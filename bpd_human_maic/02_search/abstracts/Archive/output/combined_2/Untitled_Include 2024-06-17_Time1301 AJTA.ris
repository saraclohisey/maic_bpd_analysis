AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is one of the most serious complications observed in premature infants. Thanks to microarray technique, expression of nearly all human genes can be reliably evaluated., OBJECTIVE: To compare whole genome expression in the first month of life in groups of infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: 111 newborns were included in the study. The mean birth weight was 1029 g (SD:290), and the mean gestational age was 27.8 weeks (SD:2.5). Blood samples were drawn from the study participants on the 5th, 14th and 28th day of life. The mRNA samples were evaluated for gene expression with the use of GeneChip R Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays. The infants were divided into two groups: bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n=68) and control (n=43)., RESULTS: Overall 2086 genes were differentially expressed on the day 5, only 324 on the day 14 and 3498 on the day 28. Based on pathway enrichment analysis we found that the cell cycle pathway was up-regulated in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia group. The activation of this pathway does not seem to be related with the maturity of the infant. Four pathways related to inflammatory response were continuously on the 5(th), 14(th) and 28(th) day of life down-regulated in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia group. However, the expression of genes depended on both factors: immaturity and disease severity. The most significantly down-regulated pathway was the T cell receptor signaling pathway., CONCLUSION: The results of the whole genome expression study revealed alteration of the expression of nearly 10% of the genome in bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) presents a major threat of very preterm birth and treatment options are still limited. Stem cells from different sources have been used successfully in experimental BPD, induced by postnatal hyperoxia., OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) in a new double-hit mouse model of BPD., METHODS: For the double-hit, date mated mice were subjected to hypoxia and thereafter the offspring was exposed to hyperoxia. Human umbilical cord blood MNCs were given intraperitoneally by day P7. As outcome variables were defined: physical development (auxology), lung structure (histomorphometry), expression of markers for lung maturation and inflammation on mRNA and protein level. Pre- and postnatal normoxic pups and sham treated double-hit pups served as control groups., RESULTS: Compared to normoxic controls, sham treated double-hit animals showed impaired physical and lung development with reduced alveolarization and increased thickness of septa. Electron microscopy revealed reduced volume density of lamellar bodies. Pulmonary expression of mRNA for surfactant proteins B and C, Mtor and Crabp1 was reduced. Expression of Igf1 was increased. Treatment with umbilical cord blood MNCs normalized thickness of septa and mRNA expression of Mtor to levels of normoxic controls. Tgfb3 mRNA expression and pro-inflammatory IL-1beta protein concentration were decreased., CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate the therapeutic potential of umbilical cord blood MNCs in a new double-hit model of BPD in newborn mice. We found improved lung structure and effects on molecular level. Further studies are needed to address the role of systemic administration of MNCs in experimental BPD.

AB  - Sustained lung inflations (SI) at birth may recruit functional residual capacity (FRC). Clinically, SI increase oxygenation and decrease need for intubation in preterm infants. We tested whether a SI to recruit FRC would decrease lung injury from subsequent ventilation of fetal, preterm lambs. The preterm fetus (128+/-1 day gestation) was exteriorized from the uterus, a tracheostomy was performed, and fetal lung fluid was removed. While maintaining placental circulation, fetuses were randomized to one of four 15-min interventions: 1) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O (n=4), 2) 20 s SI to 50 cmH2O then PEEP 8 cmH2O (n=10), 3) mechanical ventilation at tidal volume (VT) 7 ml/kg (n=13), or 4) 20 s SI then ventilation at VT 7 ml/kg (n=13). Lambs were ventilated with 95% N2/5% CO2 and PEEP 8 cmH2O. Volume recruitment was measured during SI, and fetal tissues were collected after an additional 30 min on placental support. SI achieved a mean FRC recruitment of 15 ml/kg (range 8-27). Fifty percent of final FRC was achieved by 2 s, 65% by 5 s, and 90% by 15 s, demonstrating prolonged SI times are needed to recruit FRC. SI alone released acute-phase proteins into the fetal lung fluid and increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase response genes in the lung. Mechanical ventilation further increased all markers of lung injury. SI before ventilation, regardless of the volume of FRC recruited, did not alter the acute-phase and proinflammatory responses to mechanical ventilation at birth.

AB  - Lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants and emphysema lack efficient treatments. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to normal and impaired alveolar growth and repair may identify new therapeutic targets for these lung diseases. Axonal guidance cues are molecules that guide the outgrowth of axons. Amongst these axonal guidance cues, members of the Semaphorin family, in particular Semaphorin 3C (Sema3C), contribute to early lung branching morphogenesis. The role of Sema3C during alveolar growth and repair is unknown. We hypothesized that Sema3C promotes alveolar development and repair. In vivo Sema3C knock down using intranasal siRNA during the postnatal stage of alveolar development in rats caused significant air space enlargement reminiscent of BPD. Sema3C knock down was associated with increased TLR3 expression and lung inflammatory cells influx. In a model of O2-induced arrested alveolar growth in newborn rats mimicking BPD, air space enlargement was associated with decreased lung Sema3C mRNA expression. In vitro, Sema3C treatment preserved alveolar epithelial cell viability in hyperoxia and accelerated alveolar epithelial cell wound healing. Sema3C preserved lung microvascular endothelial cell vascular network formation in vitro under hyperoxic conditions. In vivo, Sema3C treatment of hyperoxic rats decreased lung neutrophil influx and preserved alveolar and lung vascular growth. Sema3C also preserved lung plexinA2 and Sema3C expression, alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and decreased lung apoptosis. In conclusion, the axonal guidance cue Sema3C promotes normal alveolar growth and may be worthwhile further investigating as a potential therapeutic target for lung repair.

AB  - Curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, modulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma signaling, a key molecule in the etiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We have previously shown curcumin's acute protection against neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury. However, its longer-term protection against BPD is not known. Hypothesizing that concurrent treatment with curcumin protects the developing lung against hyperoxia-induced lung injury long-term, we determined if curcumin protects against hyperoxic neonatal rat lung injury for the first 5 days of life, as determined at postnatal day (PND) 21. One-day-old rat pups were exposed to either 21 or 95% O2 for 5 days with or without curcumin treatment (5 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally one time daily, following which the pups grew up to PND21 in room air. At PND21 lung development was determined, including gross and cellular structural and functional effects, and molecular mediators of inflammatory injury. To gain mechanistic insights, embryonic day 19 fetal rat lung fibroblasts were examined for markers of apoptosis and MAP kinase activation following in vitro exposure to hyperoxia for 24 h in the presence or absence of curcumin (5 muM). Curcumin effectively blocked hyperoxia-induced lung injury based on systematic analysis of markers for lung injury (apoptosis, Bcl-2/Bax, collagen III, fibronectin, vimentin, calponin, and elastin-related genes) and lung morphology (radial alveolar count and alveolar septal thickness). Mechanistically, curcumin prevented the hyperoxia-induced increases in cleaved caspase-3 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Molecular effects of curcumin, both structural and cytoprotective, suggest that its actions against hyperoxia-induced lung injury are mediated via Erk1/2 activation and that it is a potential intervention against BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether there was an adverse effect on brain growth after hydrocortisone (HC) treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in a large cohort of infants without dexamethasone exposure., STUDY DESIGN: Infants who received HC for BPD between 2005 and 2011 and underwent magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age were included. Control infants born in Geneva (2005-2006) and Utrecht (2007-2011) were matched to the infants treated with HC according to segmentation method, sex, and gestational age. Infants with overt parenchymal pathology were excluded. Multivariable analysis was used to determine if there was a difference in brain volumes between the 2 groups., RESULTS: Seventy-three infants treated with HC and 73 matched controls were included. Mean gestational age was 26.7 weeks, and mean birth weight was 906 g. After correction for gestational age, postmenstrual age at time of scanning, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and birth weight z-score, no differences were found between infants treated with HC and controls in total brain tissue or cerebellar volumes., CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of associated parenchymal brain injury, no reduction in brain tissue or cerebellar volumes could be found at term-equivalent age between infants with or without treatment with HC for BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extremely preterm infants often receive mechanical ventilation (MV), which can contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the effects of MV alone on the extremely preterm lung and the lung's capacity for repair are poorly understood., AIM: To characterise lung injury induced by MV alone, and mechanisms of injury and repair, in extremely preterm lungs and to compare them with very preterm lungs., METHODS: Extremely preterm lambs (0.75 of term) were transiently exposed by hysterotomy and underwent 2 h of injurious MV. Lungs were collected 24 h and at 15 d after MV. Immunohistochemistry and morphometry were used to characterise injury and repair processes. qRT-PCR was performed on extremely and very preterm (0.85 of term) lungs 24 h after MV to assess molecular injury and repair responses., RESULTS: 24 h after MV at 0.75 of term, lung parenchyma and bronchioles were severely injured; tissue space and myofibroblast density were increased, collagen and elastin fibres were deformed and secondary crest density was reduced. Bronchioles contained debris and their epithelium was injured and thickened. 24 h after MV at 0.75 and 0.85 of term, mRNA expression of potential mediators of lung repair were significantly increased. By 15 days after MV, most lung injury had resolved without treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Extremely immature lungs, particularly bronchioles, are severely injured by 2 h of MV. In the absence of continued ventilation these injured lungs are capable of repair. At 24 h after MV, genes associated with injurious MV are unaltered, while potential repair genes are activated in both extremely and very preterm lungs.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious chronic lung disease affecting extremely preterm infants. While mitochondrial dysfunction has been investigated in various medical conditions, limited research has explored mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene mutations, specifically in BPD. This study aimed to evaluate mitochondrial mtDNA gene mutations in extremely preterm infants with BPD. In this prospective observational study, we enrolled a cohort of extremely preterm infants diagnosed with BPD. Clinical data were collected to provide comprehensive patient profiles. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole-blood samples obtained within a defined timeframe. Subsequently, mtDNA extraction and sequencing using next-generation sequencing technology were performed to identify mtDNA gene mutations. Among the cohort of ten extremely preterm infants with BPD, mtDNA sequencing revealed the presence of mutations in seven patients, resulting in a total of twenty-one point mutations. Notably, many of these mutations were identified in loci associated with critical components of the respiratory chain complexes, vital for proper mitochondrial function and cellular energy production. This pilot study provides evidence of mtDNA point mutations in a subset of extremely preterm infants with BPD. These findings suggest a potential association between mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of BPD. Further extensive investigations are warranted to unravel the mechanisms underlying mtDNA mutations in BPD. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe condition in premature infants that compromises lung function and necessitates oxygen support. Despite major improvements in perinatal care minimizing the devastating effects, BPD remains the most frequent complication of extreme preterm birth. Our study reports the safety of the allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (allo-UC-MSCs) and the progression of lung development in four infants with established BPD., METHODS: UC tissue was collected from a healthy donor, followed by propagation at the Stem Cell Core Facility at Vinmec Research Institute of Stem Cell and Gene Technology. UC-MSC culture was conducted under xeno- and serum-free conditions. Four patients with established BPD were enrolled in this study between May 25, 2018, and December 31, 2018. All four patients received two intravenous doses of allo-UC-MSCs (1 million cells/kg patient body weight (PBW) per dose) with an intervening interval of 7 days. Safety and patient conditions were evaluated during hospitalization and at 7 days and 1, 6 and 12 months postdischarge., RESULTS: No intervention-associated severe adverse events or prespecified adverse events were observed in the four patients throughout the study period. At the time of this report, all patients had recovered from BPD and were weaned off of oxygen support. Chest X-rays and CT scans confirmed the progressive reductions in fibrosis., CONCLUSIONS: Allo-UC-MSC administration is safe in preterm infants with established BPD. Trial registration This preliminary study was approved by the Vinmec International Hospital Ethics Board (approval number: 88/2019/QD-VMEC; retrospectively registered March 12, 2019).

AB  - We have recently shown that a combination of vitamin A (VA) and retinoic acid (RA) in a 10:1 molar ratio (VARA) synergistically increases lung retinoid content in newborn rodents, more than either VA or RA alone in equimolar amounts. We hypothesized that the increase in lung retinoids would reduce oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in attenuation of alveolar simplification and abnormal lung function in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. Newborn C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 85% O2 (hyperoxia) or air (normoxia) for 7 or 14 days from birth and given vehicle or VARA every other day. Lung retinol content was measured by HPLC, function was assessed by flexiVent, and development was evaluated by radial alveolar counts, mean linear intercept, and secondary septal crest density. Mediators of oxidative stress, inflammation, and alveolar development were evaluated in lung homogenates. We observed that VARA increased lung retinol stores and attenuated hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification while increasing lung compliance and lowering resistance. VARA attenuated hyperoxia-induced increases in DNA damage and protein oxidation accompanied with a reduction in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 protein but did not alter malondialdehyde adducts, nitrotyrosine, or myeloperoxidase concentrations. Interferon-gamma and macrophage inflammatory protein-2alpha mRNA and protein increased with hyperoxia, and this increase was attenuated by VARA. Our study suggests that the VARA combination may be a potential therapeutic strategy in conditions characterized by VA deficiency and hyperoxia-induced lung injury during lung development, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation of preterm babies increases survival but can also cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), leading to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). It is not known whether shear stress injury from gases flowing into the preterm lung during ventilation contributes to VILI., METHODS: Preterm lambs of 131 days' gestation (term = 147 d) were ventilated for 2 hours with a bias gas flow of 8 L/min (n = 13), 18 L/min (n = 12) or 28 L/min (n = 14). Physiological parameters were measured continuously and lung injury was assessed by measuring mRNA expression of early injury response genes and by histological analysis. Control lung tissue was collected from unventilated age-matched fetuses. Data were analysed by ANOVA with a Tukey post-hoc test when appropriate., RESULTS: High bias gas flows resulted in higher ventilator pressures, shorter inflation times and decreased ventilator efficiency. The rate of rise of inspiratory gas flow was greatest, and pulmonary mRNA levels of the injury markers, EGR1 and CTGF, were highest in lambs ventilated with bias gas flows of 18 L/min. High bias gas flows resulted in increased cellular proliferation and abnormal deposition of elastin, collagen and myofibroblasts in the lung., CONCLUSIONS: High ventilator bias gas flows resulted in increased lung injury, with up-regulation of acute early response genes and increased histological lung injury. Bias gas flows may, therefore, contribute to VILI and BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants born very preterm are more likely to experience neonatal morbidities compared to their term peers. Variations in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with these morbidities may yield novel information about the processes impacted by these morbidities., METHODS: This study included 532 infants born < 30 weeks gestation, participating in the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants study. We used a neonatal morbidity risk score, which was an additive index of the number of morbidities experienced during the NICU stay, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), severe brain injury, serious neonatal infections, and severe retinopathy of prematurity. DNA was collected from buccal cells at discharge from the NICU, and DNAm was measured using the Illumina MethylationEPIC. We tested for differential methylation in association with the neonatal morbidity risk score then tested for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and overrepresentation of biological pathways., RESULTS: We identified ten differentially methylated CpGs (alpha Bonferroni-adjusted for 706,278 tests) that were associated with increasing neonatal morbidity risk scores at three intergenic regions and at HPS4, SRRD, FGFR1OP, TNS3, TMEM266, LRRC3B, ZNF780A, and TENM2. These mostly followed dose-response patterns, for 8 CpGs increasing DNAm associated with increased numbers of morbidities, while for 2 CpGs the risk score was associated with decreasing DNAm. BPD was the most substantial contributor to differential methylation. We also identified seven potential DMRs and over-representation of genes involved in Wnt signaling; however, these results were not significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing., CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal DNAm, within genes involved in fibroblast growth factor activities, cellular invasion and migration, and neuronal signaling and development, are sensitive to the neonatal health complications of prematurity. We hypothesize that these epigenetic features may be representative of an integrated marker of neonatal health and development and are promising candidates to integrate with clinical information for studying developmental impairments in childhood.

AB  - AIM: Caffeine treatment reduces the frequency of apnoea of prematurity (AOP) and eliminates the need for mechanical ventilation by acting as a nonspecific inhibitor of adenosine A1 and adenosine 2A receptors. Patients with AOP have demonstrated variant responses to caffeine therapy. We proposed to investigate the role of A1 and 2A polymorphisms in the development of AOP and individual differences in caffeine response. Secondly, we aimed to determine whether these polymorphisms have any effect on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development., METHODS: Cord blood samples were collected from infants born with gestational ages between 24 and 34 weeks. Two groups were defined: patients without apnoea (n = 60) and patients with apnoea (n = 55). Patients with apnoea were divided into two subgroups: a caffeine-responsive group (n = 30) and an unresponsive group (n = 25). Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms were chosen for genotyping., RESULTS: Patients with apnoea over 28 weeks of gestational age who responded to the caffeine treatment were found to carry the rs16851030 C/C genotype rather than the C/T or T/T genotype. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant correlation between rs35320474-C/T and T/T genotypes and apnoea and BPD development., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a role for adenosine receptor gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to AOP and BPD and in interindividual variability to caffeine response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alveolar septation marks the beginning of the transition from the saccular to alveolar stage of lung development. Inflammation can disrupt this process and permanently impair alveolar formation resulting in alveolar hypoplasia as seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm newborns. NF-kappaB is a transcription factor central to multiple inflammatory and developmental pathways including dorsal-ventral patterning in fruit flies; limb, mammary and submandibular gland development in mice; and branching morphogenesis in chick lungs. We have previously shown that epithelial overexpression of NF-kappaB accelerates lung maturity using transgenic mice. The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that targeted deletion of NF-kappaB signaling in lung epithelium would impair alveolar formation., METHODS: We generated double transgenic mice with lung epithelium-specific deletion of IKKbeta, a known activating kinase upstream of NF-kappaB, using a cre-loxP transgenic recombination strategy. Lungs of resulting progeny were analyzed at embryonic and early postnatal stages to determine specific effects on lung histology, and mRNA and protein expression of relevant lung morphoreulatory genes. Lastly, results measuring expression of the angiogenic factor, VEGF, were confirmed in vitro using a siRNA-knockdown strategy in cultured mouse lung epithelial cells., RESULTS: Our results showed that IKKbeta deletion in the lung epithelium transiently decreased alveolar type I and type II cells and myofibroblasts and delayed alveolar formation. These effects were mediated through increased alveolar type II cell apoptosis and decreased epithelial VEGF expression., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that epithelial NF-kappaB plays a critical role in early alveolar development possibly through regulation of VEGF.

AB  - Sex as a biological variable plays a critical role both during lung development and in modulating postnatal hyperoxic lung injury and repair. The molecular mechanisms behind these sex-specific differences need to be elucidated. Our objective was to determine if the neonatal lung epigenomic landscape reconfiguration has profound effects on gene expression and could underlie sex-biased differences in protection from or susceptibility to diseases. Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO, PND 1-5: saccular stage) or room air and euthanized on PND 7 and 21. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and quantified. Epigenomic landscape was assessed using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) of the H3K27ac histone modification mark, associated with active genes, enhancers, and super-enhancers. These data were then integrated, pathways identified and validated. Sex-biased epigenetic modulation of gene expression leads to differential regulation of biological processes in the developing lung at baseline and after exposure to hyperoxia. The female lung exhibits a more robust epigenomic response for the H3K27ac mark in response to hyperoxia. Epigenomic changes distribute over genomic and epigenomic domains in a sex-specific manner. The differential epigenomic responses also enrich for key transcription regulators crucial for lung development. In addition, by utilizing H3K27ac as the target epigenomic change we were also able to identify new epigenomic reprogramming at super-enhancers. Finally, we report for the first time that the upregulation of p21 (Cdkn1a) in the injured neonatal lung could be mediated through gain of H3K27ac. These data demonstrate that modulation of transcription via epigenomic landscape alterations may contribute to the sex-specific differences in preterm neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One-third to one-half of all infants born before the 28th week of gestation develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Inflammatory regulators appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD, possibly beginning in fetal life. To evaluate the feasibility of using expression profiling in umbilical cord tissue to discover molecular signatures for developmental staging and for determining risk of BPD, we conducted a cross-sectional study of infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation (n = 54). Sections of umbilical cord were obtained at birth from 20 infants who later developed BPD and from 34 of their peers who did not develop BPD., RESULTS: Umbilical cord expression profiles at birth exhibited systematic differences in bioenergetic pathways with respect to gestational age. Infants who subsequently developed BPD had distinct signatures involving chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation pathways, which have previously been implicated in several adult onset lung diseases. These findings are consistent with prior work on inflammatory processes and bioenergetics in prematurity., CONCLUSION: This study of gene expression of the newborn umbilical cord implicates the chromatin remodeling pathways in those premature infants who subsequently develop BPD. Larger sample sizes will be required to generate prognostic markers from umbilical cord profiles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); however, there were rare researches about the changes of neutrophils and their influence on the prognosis of BPD. Hence, we aimed to explore the changes in the number of peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs), and the relationship between these changes and susceptibility to pulmonary infection among children with BPD., METHODS: Firstly, the gene expression of lung tissues and the number of PBNs were respectively detected by RNA sequencing and complete blood count in the 85% O2-induced BPD model rats. Then it was analyzed the number of PBNs after birth and the incidence of pneumonia within 6 months of corrected age (CA) after discharge among full-term infants (FTIs: gestational age [GA] between 370/7 and 416/7 weeks, n = 88), preterm infants with (PTIs-BPD: GA <32 weeks, n = 35) or without BPD (PTIs-nBPD: GA <32 weeks, n = 41)., RESULTS: The levels of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs were significantly decreased in the lungs of BPD rats. Moreover, the number of PBNs was also decreased in BPD rats. The number of PBNs at birth in FTIs was significantly greater than that in PTIs-BPD or in PTIs-nBPD (p < 0.001), while those between PTIs-BPD and PTIs-nBPD showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). Although the peripheral blood neutrophils decreased overall after birth in both PTIs-nBPD and PTIs-BPD groups, only the reduction in the PTIs-BPD group was significant (p < 0.001). Importantly, at 36-37 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA), the number of PBNs in PTIs-BPD was significantly fewer than that in PTIs-nBPD (p < 0.001). In addition, PTIs-BPD had a significantly higher incidence of pneumonia than PTIs-nBPD within 6 months of CA after discharge (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The number of PBNs in PTIs-BPD decreased progressively when compared to that in PTIs-nBPD, which might contribute to their susceptibility to pulmonary infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract microbial dysbiosis can exacerbate inflammation and conversely inflammation may cause dysbiosis. Dysbiotic microbiome metabolites may lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyperoxia and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction alters lung microbiome and metabolome, mediating BPD lung injury sequence., METHODS: C57BL6/J mice were exposed to 21% (normoxia) or 70% (hyperoxia) oxygen during postnatal days (PND) 1-14. Pups were injected with LPS (6 mg/kg) or equal PBS volume, intraperitoneally on PND 3, 5, and 7. At PND14, the lungs were collected for microbiome and metabolomic analyses (n = 5/group)., RESULTS: Microbiome alpha and beta diversity were similar between groups. Metabolic changes included hyperoxia 31 up/18 down, LPS 7 up/4 down, exposure interaction 8. Hyperoxia increased Intestinimonas abundance, whereas LPS decreased Clostridiales, Dorea, and Intestinimonas; exposure interaction affected Blautia. Differential co-expression analysis on multi-omics data identified exposure-altered modules. Hyperoxia metabolomics response was integrated with a published matching transcriptome, identifying four induced genes (ALDOA, GAA, NEU1, RENBP), which positively correlated with BPD severity in a published human newborn cohort., CONCLUSIONS: We report hyperoxia and LPS lung microbiome and metabolome signatures in a clinically relevant BPD model. We identified four genes correlating with BPD status in preterm infants that are promising targets for therapy and prevention., IMPACT: Using multi-omics, we identified and correlated key biomarkers of hyperoxia and LPS on murine lung micro-landscape and examined their potential clinical implication, which shows strong clinical relevance for future research. Using a double-hit model of clinical relevance to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, we are the first to report integrated metabolomic/microbiome landscape changes and identify novel disease biomarker candidates.

AB  - Objective: To study the short-term outcomes and their related risk factors of extremely preterm infants (EPI) and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI) in Guangdong province. Methods: The neonatal and corresponding maternal medical records of 2 392 cases of EPI and ELBWI discharged from 26 tertiary hospitals in Guangdong province during 2013-2017 were collected. Chi-square test or linear-by-linear association chi-square was used to analyze the following data on an annual basis: (1) the proportion of EPI and ELBWI in all discharged infants and preterm infants; (2) the difference in survival rate of EPI and ELBWI in different regions and types of hospital; and (3) the difference in incidence of complications. A binary Logistic regression model was established to analyze the death-related risk factors. Results: From 2013 to 2017, the enrolled infants each year were 331, 418, 458, 574 and 611, respectively. Totally, there were 1 352 (56.5%) male infants. The gestational age was (27.7+/-1.9) weeks, and the birth weight was (919+/-158) g. The proportion of EPI and ELBWI in all discharged infants increased from 2013 to 2017 (chi(2)=68.636, P<0.01), and so did the proportion in all discharged preterm infants (chi(2)=73.463, P<0.01). The overall survival rate was 60.4% (1 445/2 392), which increased from 2013 to 2017 (chi(2)=11.424, P<0.01). Besides, the survival rate was higher in the Pearl River Delta region than that in the non-Pearl River Delta region (61.7% (1 325/2 146) vs. 48.8% (120/246), chi(2)=15.505, P<0.01), and also higher in women and children specialist hospitals than that in general hospitals (66.5% (702/1 056) vs. 55.6% (743/1 336), chi(2)=29.104, P<0.01). The overall incidence of complications was 89.0% (2 130/2 392) for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), 72.2% (1 041/1 442) for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), 40.5% (625/1 544) for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), 12.3% (237/1 922) for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), 31.0% (578/1 865) for periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH), 34.1% (656/1 922) for nosocomial infection, 26.9% (625/2 327) for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and 4.4% (82/1 865) for periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). From 2013 to 2017, the incidence of PVL decreased (chi(2)=6.093, P=0.014), but the incidence of BPD and PDA increased (chi(2)=24.476 and 11.741, respectively, both P<0.01). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that Apgar score <=7 at 5-minute (OR=1.830, 95%CI 1.373-2.437, P<0.01), NRDS (OR=1.407, 95%CI 1.222-1.621, P<0.01), invasive assisted ventilation (OR=1.825, 95%CI 1.241-2.683, P<0.01), maternal cervical insufficiency (OR=2.044, 95%CI 1.002-4.169, P=0.049), and medical care withdrawal (OR=25.532, 95%CI 18.867-34.553, P<0.01) increased the risk of early neonatal death, while the increase in gestational age (OR=0.869, 95%CI 0.802-0.941, P<0.01), discharged from Guangzhou and Shenzhen (OR=0.606, 95%CI 0.451-0.813, P<0.01), antenatal use of steroids (OR=0.624, 95%CI 0.471-0.828, P<0.01), premature rupture of membranes (OR=0.667, 95%CI 0.466-0.955, P=0.027), and pulmonary surfactant treatment (OR=0.532, 95%CI 0.419-0.676, P<0.01) could decrease the risk. For the mortality in the late or post-neonatal period, placenta previa (OR=2.355, 95%CI 1.006-5.516, P=0.048), cervical insufficiency (OR=3.306, 95%CI 1.259-8.679, P=0.015), PV-IVH (OR=1.486, 95%CI 1.135-1.946, P<0.01), invasive assisted ventilation (OR=2.143, 95%CI 1.208-3.801, P<0.01), and medical care withdrawal (OR=286.532, 95%CI 87.840-934.661, P<0.01) increased the risk, while the increase of birthweight (OR=0.997, 95%CI 0.996-0.999, P<0.01) decreased the risk. Conclusions: The survival rate of EPI and ELBWI increases annually, but the incidence of complications is still high. Invasive assisted ventilation, medical care withdrawal and maternal cervical insufficiency are associated with mortality in both early and late neonatal or post-neonatal period.

AB  - Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) dramatically increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm babies, a disease characterized by arrested alveolarization and abnormal microvascular angiogenesis. We have previously described a rodent low protein diet (LPD) model of IUGR inducing impaired alveolarization, but failed to demonstrate any modification of the classical factors involved in lung development. We performed a genome-wide microarray analysis in 120 rat pups with LPD-induced IUGR and their controls, at three key time points of the alveolarization process: postnatal day 4 (P4): start of alveolarization; P10: peak of the alveolarization process and P21: end of the alveolarization process. Results were analysed using Arraymining, DAVID and KEGG software and validated by qRT-PCR and western blots. Considering a cut-off of 2:1 as significant, 67 transcripts at P4, 102 transcripts at P10 and 451 transcripts at P21 were up-regulated, and 89 transcripts at P4, 25 transcripts at P10 and 585 transcripts at P21 were down-regulated. Automatic functional classification identified three main modified pathways, 'cell adhesion molecules', 'cardiac muscle contraction' and 'peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor' (PPAR). Protein analysis confirmed involvement of the PPAR pathway, with an increase of FABP4, an activator of this pathway, at P4 and an increase of adiponectin at P21. Other data also suggest involvement of the PPAR pathway in impaired alveolarization. Our results show that deregulation of the PPAR pathway may be an important component of the mechanism inducing impaired alveolarization observed in IUGR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or chronic lung disease is one of the principal causes of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Early identification of infants at the greater risk of developing BPD may allow a targeted approach for reducing disease severity and complications. The trigger cause of the disease comprehends the impairment of the alveolar development and the increased angiogenesis. Nevertheless, the molecular pathways characterizing the disease are still unclear. Therefore, the use of the metabolomics technique, due to the capability of identifying instantaneous metabolic perturbation, might help to recognize metabolic patterns associated with the condition., METHODS: The purpose of this study is to compare urinary metabolomics at birth in 36 newborns with a gestational age below 29 weeks and birth weight <1500 g (very low birth weight - VLBW), admitted in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) divided into two groups: the first group (18 cases) consisting of newborns who have not yet developed the disease, but who will subsequently develop it and the second group (18 controls) consisting of newborns not affected by BPD. Urine samples were collected within 24-36 h of life and immediately frozen at -80 degreeC., RESULTS: The (1)H-NMR spectra were analyzed using a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model coupled with orthogonal Signal Correction. Using this approach it was possible with urine at birth to discriminate newborns that will be later have a diagnosis of BPD with a high statistics power. In particular, we found five important discriminant metabolites in urine in BPD newborns: lactate, taurine, TMAO, myoinositol (which increased) and gluconate (which decreased)., CONCLUSION: These preliminary results seem to be promising for the identification of predictor's biomarkers characterizing the BPD condition. These data may suggest that BPD is probably the result of an abnormal development (respiratory bud, vascular tree, hypodysplasia of pneumocytes) and could be considered a congenital disease (genetics plus intrauterine epigenetics). Early identification of infants at the greater risk of developing BPD may allow a targeted approach for reducing disease severity and complications.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial chronic lung disease of premature infants. BPD can be attributed to the dysregulation of normal lung development due to ventilation and oxygen toxicity, resulting in pathologic complications of impaired alveolarization and vascularization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and are implicated in diverse biological processes and diseases. The objectives of this study are to identify the changed miRNAs and their target genes in neonatal rat lungs in response to hyperoxia exposure. Using miRNA microarray and real-time PCR analyses, we found downregulation of five miRNAs, miR-342, miR-335, miR-150, miR-126*, and miR-151*, and upregulation of two miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-34a. Some of these miRNAs had the highest expression during embryonic and early postnatal development. DNA microarray analysis yielded several genes with conserved binding sites for these altered miRNAs. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein b (GPNMB) was experimentally verified as a target of miR-150. In summary, we identified seven miRNAs that were changed in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal lungs. These results provide a basis for deciphering the mechanisms involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of proteins that contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Preterm infants exposed to oxygen and mechanical ventilation are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a multifactorial chronic lung disorder characterized by arrested alveolar development and nonsprouting, dysmorphic microvascular angiogenesis. The molecular regulation of this BPD-associated pathological angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. In this study, the authors used focused microarray technology to characterize the angiogenic gene expression profile in postmortem lung samples from short-term ventilated preterm infants (born at 24 to 27 weeks' gestation) and age-matched control infants. Microarray analysis identified differential expression of 13 of 112 angiogenesis-related genes. Genes significantly up-regulated in ventilated lungs included the antiangiogenic genes thrombospondin-1, collagen XVIII alpha-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), as well as endoglin, transforming growth factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2). Increased expression of thrombospondin-1 in ventilated lungs was verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunolocalized primarily to intravascular platelets and fibrin aggregates. Down-regulated genes included proangiogenic angiogenin and midkine, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-B, VEGF receptor-2, and the angiopoietin receptor TEK/Tie-2. In conclusion, short-term ventilated lungs show a shift from traditional angiogenic growth factors to alternative, often antisprouting regulators. This angiogenic shift may be implicated in the regulation of dysmorphic angiogenesis and, consequently, deficient alveolarization characteristic of infants with BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and emphysema are characterized by arrested alveolar development or loss of alveoli; both are significant global health problems and currently lack effective therapy. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) prevent adult lung injury, but their therapeutic potential in neonatal lung disease is unknown., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that intratracheal delivery of BMSCs would prevent alveolar destruction in experimental BPD., METHODS: In vitro, BMSC differentiation and migration were assessed using co-culture assays and a modified Boyden chamber. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of BMSCs was assessed in a chronic hyperoxia-induced model of BPD in newborn rats., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In vitro, BMSCs developed immunophenotypic and ultrastructural characteristics of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) (surfactant protein C expression and lamellar bodies) when co-cultured with lung tissue, but not with culture medium alone or liver. Migration assays revealed preferential attraction of BMSCs toward oxygen-damaged lung versus normal lung. In vivo, chronic hyperoxia in newborn rats led to air space enlargement and loss of lung capillaries, and this was associated with a decrease in circulating and resident lung BMSCs. Intratracheal delivery of BMSCs on Postnatal Day 4 improved survival and exercise tolerance while attenuating alveolar and lung vascular injury and pulmonary hypertension. Engrafted BMSCs coexpressed the AEC2-specific marker surfactant protein C. However, engraftment was disproportionately low for cell replacement to account for the therapeutic benefit, suggesting a paracrine-mediated mechanism. In vitro, BMSC-derived conditioned medium prevented O(2)-induced AEC2 apoptosis, accelerated AEC2 wound healing, and enhanced endothelial cord formation., CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs prevent arrested alveolar and vascular growth in part through paracrine activity. Stem cell-based therapies may offer new therapeutic avenues for lung diseases that currently lack efficient treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at increased risk for dysfunctional immune responses in the postnatal period. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that thymic function is altered in infants with BPD and changes in the expression of thymic function-related genes affect thymic development., STUDY DESIGN: Included in the study were infants who had a gestational age <=32 weeks and survived to a postmenstrual age of >=36 weeks. The clinical features and thymic size were comparatively studied between infants with and without BPD. Thymic function and the expression of thymic function-related genes were determined in BPD infants at birth, week 2, and 4 of life. The thymic size was ultrasonographically assessed in terms of the thymic index (TI) and thymic weight index (TWI). T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and gene expression were quantitatively determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: Compared to non-BPD infants, their BPD counterparts had a shorter GA, lower birth weight, lower Apgar scores at birth, and were more likely to be of the male gender. BPD infants had an elevated incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. TI was 1.73 +/- 0.68 versus 2.87 +/- 0.70 cm3 and TWI was 1.38 +/- 0.45 versus 1.72 +/- 0.28 cm3/kg in the BPD group versus the non-BPD group (p < 0.05). In BPD infants, no significant changes were observed in thymic size, lymphocyte counts, and TREC copy numbers at the first 2 weeks (p > 0.05), but they all exhibited a significant increase at week 4 (p < 0.05). BPD infants presented a trend toward increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and decreased expression of forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) from birth to week 4 (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, no significant difference was found in IL-2 or IL-7 expression at all time points (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: For preterm infants with BPD, reduced thymic size at birth might be associated with impaired thymic function. Thymic function was developmentally regulated in the BPD process., KEY POINTS: . For preterm infants with BPD, reduced thymic size at birth might be associated with impaired thymic.. . BPD infants had an elevated incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.. . Thymic function was developmentally regulated in the BPD process.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxidative stress, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sequentially occur in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and all result in DNA damage. When DNA damage becomes irreparable, tumor suppressors increase, followed by apoptosis or senescence. Although cellular senescence contributes to wound healing, its persistence inhibits growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that cellular senescence contributes to BPD progression. Human autopsy lungs were obtained. Sprague-Dawley rat pups exposed to 95% oxygen between Postnatal Day 1 (P1) and P10 were used as the BPD phenotype. N-acetyl-lysyltyrosylcysteine-amide (KYC), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), and Foxo4 dri were administered intraperitoneally to mitigate myeloperoxidase oxidant generation, ER stress, and cellular senescence, respectively. Lungs were examined by histology, transcriptomics, and immunoblotting. Cellular senescence increased in rat and human BPD lungs, as evidenced by increased oxidative DNA damage, tumor suppressors, GL-13 stain, and inflammatory cytokines with decreased cell proliferation and lamin B expression. Cellular senescence-related transcripts in BPD rat lungs were enriched at P10 and P21. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed increased cellular senescence in several cell types, including type 2 alveolar cells. In addition, Foxo4-p53 binding increased in BPD rat lungs. Daily TUDCA or KYC, administered intraperitoneally, effectively decreased cellular senescence, improved alveolar complexity, and partially maintained the numbers of type 2 alveolar cells. Foxo4 dri administered at P4, P6, P8, and P10 led to outcomes similar to TUDCA and KYC. Our data suggest that cellular senescence plays an essential role in BPD after initial inducement by hyperoxia. Reducing myeloperoxidase toxic oxidant production, ER stress, and attenuating cellular senescence are potential therapeutic strategies for halting BPD progression.

AB  - Oxidative stress is an important contributor to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that is the most common morbidity in very preterm infants. Mitochondrial functional differences due to inherited and acquired mutations influence the pathogenesis of disorders in which oxidative stress plays a critical role. We previously showed using mitochondrial-nuclear exchange (MNX) mice that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations modulate hyperoxia-induced lung injury severity in a model of BPD. In this study, we studied the effects of mtDNA variations on mitochondrial function including mitophagy in alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) from MNX mice. We also investigated oxidant and inflammatory stress as well as transcriptomic profiles in lung tissue in mice and expression of proteins such as PINK1, Parkin and SIRT3 in infants with BPD. Our results indicate that AT2 from mice with C57 mtDNA had decreased mitochondrial bioenergetic function and inner membrane potential, increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and were exposed to higher levels of oxidant stress during hyperoxia compared to AT2 from mice with C3H mtDNA. Lungs from hyperoxia-exposed mice with C57 mtDNA also had higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to lungs from mice with C3H mtDNA. We also noted changes in KEGG pathways related to inflammation, PPAR and glutamatergic signaling, and mitophagy in mice with certain mito-nuclear combinations but not others. Mitophagy was decreased by hyperoxia in all mice strains, but to a greater degree in AT2 and neonatal mice lung fibroblasts from hyperoxia-exposed mice with C57 mtDNA compared to C3H mtDNA. Finally, mtDNA haplogroups vary with ethnicity, and Black infants with BPD had lower levels of PINK1, Parkin and SIRT3 expression in HUVEC at birth and tracheal aspirates at 28 days of life when compared to White infants with BPD. These results indicate that predisposition to neonatal lung injury may be modulated by variations in mtDNA and mito-nuclear interactions need to be investigated to discover novel pathogenic mechanisms for BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a significant challenge in neonatal care, the pathogenesis of which potentially involves altered lipid metabolism. Given the critical role of lipids in lung development and the injury response, we hypothesized that specific lipid species could serve as therapeutic agents in BPD. This study aimed to investigate the role of the lipid Phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0/14:0) in modulating BPD pathology and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. Our approach integrated in vitro and in vivo methodologies to assess the effects of PC (16:0/14:0) on the histopathology, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and molecular markers in lung tissue. In a hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model, we observed a reduction in alveolar number and an enlargement in alveolar size, which were ameliorated by PC (16:0/14:0) treatment. Correspondingly, in BPD cell models, PC (16:0/14:0) intervention led to increased cell viability, enhanced proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and elevated surfactant protein C (SPC) expression. RNA sequencing revealed significant gene expression differences between BPD and PC (16:0/14:0) treated groups, with a particular focus on Cldn1 (encoding claudin 1), which was significantly enriched in our analysis. Our findings suggest that PC (16:0/14:0) might protect against hyperoxia-induced alveolar type II cell damage by upregulating CLDN1 expression, potentially serving as a novel therapeutic target for BPD. This study not only advances our understanding of the role of lipids in BPD pathogenesis, but also highlights the significance of PC (16:0/14:0) in the prevention and treatment of BPD, offering new avenues for future research and therapeutic development.

AB  - Fetal and neonatal exposures to perinatal oxidative stress (OS) are key mediators of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To characterize these exposures, adductomics is an exposure science approach that captures electrophilic addition products (adducts) in blood protein. Adducts are bound to the nucleophilic cysteine loci of human serum albumin (HSA), which has a prolonged half-life. We conducted targeted and untargeted adductomics to test the hypothesis that adducts of OS vary with BPD. We studied 205 preterm infants (<=28 weeks) and 51 full-term infants from an ongoing birth cohort. Infant plasma was collected at birth (cord blood), 1-week, 1-month, and 36-weeks postmenstrual age. HSA was isolated from plasma, trypsin digested, and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify previously annotated (known) and unknown adducts. We identified 105 adducts in cord and postnatal blood. A total of 51 known adducts (small thiols, direct oxidation products, and reactive aldehydes) were increased with BPD. Postnatally, serial concentrations of several known OS adducts correlated directly with supplemental oxygen exposure. The application of large-scale adductomics elucidated OS-mediated pathways of BPD. This is the first study to investigate the "neonatal-perinatal exposome" and to identify oxidative stress-related exposure biomarkers that may inform antioxidant strategies to protect the health of future generations of infants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Almost half of all school-age children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have asthma-like symptoms and more suffer from lung function deficits. While air pollution and indoor respiratory irritants are known to affect high-risk populations of children, few studies have objectively evaluated environmental contributions to long-term respiratory morbidity in this population. This study aimed to examine the role of indoor environmental exposures on respiratory morbidity in children with BPD., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Air quality, Environment and Respiratory Ouctomes in BPD (AERO-BPD) study is a prospective, single-centre observational study that will enrol a unique cohort of 240 children with BPD and carefully characterise participants and their indoor home environmental exposures. Measures of indoor air quality constituents will assess the relationship of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), nitric oxide (NO), temperature and humidity, as well as dust concentrations of allergens, with concurrently measured respiratory symptoms and lung function.Adaptations to the research protocol due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic included remote home environment and participant assessments., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Study protocol was approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Committee on Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading complication of preterm birth that affects infants born in the saccular stage of lung development at <32 weeks of gestation. Although the mechanisms driving BPD remain uncertain, exposure to hyperoxia is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Objectives: To determine the effects of hyperoxia on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and to define the mediators of activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling after hyperoxia injury. Methods: Three hyperoxia models were used: A three-dimensional organotypic coculture using primary human lung cells, precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), and a murine in vivo hyperoxia model. Comparisons of normoxia- and hyperoxia-exposed samples were made by real-time quantitative PCR, RNA in situ hybridization, quantitative confocal microscopy, and lung morphometry. Measurements and Main Results:  Examination of an array of Wnt ligands in the three-dimensional organotypic coculture revealed increased mesenchymal expression of WNT5A. Inhibition of Wnt5A abrogated the BPD transcriptomic phenotype induced by hyperoxia. In the PCLS model, Wnt5A inhibition improved alveolarization following hyperoxia exposure, and treatment with recombinant Wnt5a reproduced features of the BPD phenotype in PCLS cultured in normoxic conditions. Chemical inhibition of NF-kappaB with BAY11-7082 reduced Wnt5a expression in the PCLS hyperoxia model and in vivo mouse hyperoxia model, with improved alveolarization in the PCLS model. Conclusions: Increased mesenchymal Wnt5A during saccular-stage hyperoxia injury contributes to the impaired alveolarization and septal thickening observed in BPD. Precise targeting of Wnt5A may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BPD.

AB  - Objective: To explore the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive surfactant administration (MISA) in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Methods: In this multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial, 92 preterm infants with gestation age <=30 weeks and diagnosed with NRDS were enrolled in 8 level III neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region from 1(st) July 2017 to 31(st) December 2018. They were randomly assigned to minimally invasive surfactant administration (MISA) group or endotracheal intubation surfactant administration (EISA) group according to random number generated by computer. Infants in both groups received calf pulmonary surfactant preparation at a dose of 70-100 mg/kg. The data of demography, perinatal situation, medication administration, complications, clinical outcomes in the two groups were compared with Chi-square test, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Among the 92 preterm infants, 53 were males, 39 were females; 47 were in the MISA group (25 males), and 45 were in the EISA group (28 males). The gestational age and birth weight were (29.5+/-1.2) weeks and (1 271+/-242) g in all patients, (29.5+/-1.4) weeks and (1 285+/-256) g in the MISA group, and (29.6+/-0.9) weeks and (1 255+/-227) g in the EISA group. The duration of surfactant infusion and the length of whole procedure in the MISA group were significantly longer than that in the EISA group (60 (18, 270) s vs. 50 (30, 60) s, Z=3.009, P=0.003; 90 (60, 300) s vs. 60 (44, 270) s, Z=3.365, P=0.001). For the outcomes, the incidence of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were lower in the MISA group than in the EISA group (36% (17/47) vs. 67% (30/45), chi(2)=8.556, P=0.003; 26% (12/47) vs. 47% (21/45), chi(2)=4.464, P=0.035). Conclusions: Minimally invasive surfactant administration is applicable in preterm infants <=30 weeks gestational age with NRDS. Although the length of whole procedure is longer than route endotracheal administration, the benefit of decreasing the incidences of hsPDA and BPD outweighs this demerit.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common chronic respiratory disease in premature infants with growing evidence that genetic factors contribute largely to moderate and severe cases. We assessed by exome sequencing if rare genetic variants could account for extremely severe phenotypes. We selected 6 infants born very preterm with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 8 very preterm born controls for exome sequencing. We filtered whole exome sequencing results to include only rare variants and selected variants and/or genes with variants that were present in at least 2 cases and absent in controls. We selected variants, all heterozygous, in 9 candidate genes, 7 with a putative role in lung development and 2 that displayed 3 variations in 3 different cases, independently of their potential role in lung development. Sequencing of 5 other severe cases for these variants did not replicate our results. Conclusion: In selected preterm born infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and controls, we failed to find any rare variant shared by several infants with an extremely severe phenotype. Our results are not consistent with the role of rare causative variants in bronchopulmonary dysplasia's development and argue for the highly polygenic nature of susceptibility of this disorder.What is Known:* Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a multifactorial disease resulting from complex environmental and genetic interactions occurring in an immature lung.* It is not known whether rare genetic variants in coding regions could account for extreme phenotypes of the disease.What is New:* In a group of infants with an extreme phenotype of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in comparison to controls, no common genetic variants were found, nor did variants that were select in other exome studies in this setting.* These results argue for the highly polygenic nature of susceptibility of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Preterm birth exposes the developing lung to an environment with direct exposure to bacteria, often facilitated by endotracheal intubation. Despite evidence linking bacterial infections to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), systematic studies of airway microbiota are limited. The objective was to identify specific patterns of the early respiratory tract microbiome from tracheal aspirates of mechanically ventilated preterm infants that are associated with the development and severity of BPD. Infants with gestational age <=34 weeks, and birth weight 500-1250g were prospectively enrolled. Mechanically ventilated infants had tracheal aspirate samples collected at enrollment, 7, 14, and 21 days of age. BPD was determined by modified NIH criteria with oxygen reduction tests; infants without BPD were excluded due to low numbers. Aspirates were processed for bacterial identification by 16S rRNA sequencing, and bacterial load by qPCR. Cross-sectional analysis was performed using 7 day samples and longitudinal analysis was performed from subjects with at least 2 aspirates. Microbiome analysis was performed on tracheal aspirates from 152 infants (51, 49, and 52 with mild, moderate, and severe BPD, respectively). Seventy-nine of the infants were included in the cross-sectional analysis and 94 in the longitudinal. Shannon Diversity, bacterial load, and relative abundance of individual taxa were not strongly associated with BPD status. Longitudinal analysis revealed that preterm infants who eventually developed severe BPD exhibited greater bacterial community turnover with age, acquired less Staphylococcus in the first days after birth, and had higher initial relative abundance of Ureaplasma. In conclusion, longitudinal changes in the airway microbial communities of mechanically ventilated preterm infants may be associated with BPD severity, whereas cross-sectional analysis of airway ecology at 7 days of age did not reveal an association with BPD severity. Further evaluation is necessary to determine whether the observed longitudinal changes are causal or in response to clinical management or other factors that lead to BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a major risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Maternal stress and poor diet are linked to FGR. Effect of perinatal stress on lung development remains unknown., OBJECTIVE: Using a murine model of adverse early life environment (AELE), we hypothesized that maternal exposure to perinatal environmental stress and high-fat diet (Western diet) lead to impaired lung development in the offspring., METHODS: Female mice were placed on either control diet or Western diet before conception. Those exposed to Western diet were also exposed to perinatal environmental stress, the combination referred to as AELE. Pups were either euthanized at postnatal day 21 (P21) or weaned to control diet and environment until adulthood (8-14 wk old). Lungs were harvested for histology, gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR, microRNA profiling, and immunoblotting., RESULTS: AELE increased the mean linear intercept and decreased the radial alveolar count and secondary septation in P21 and adult mice. Capillary count was also decreased in P21 and adult mice. AELE lungs had decreased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha protein levels and increased expression of genes that regulate DNA methylation and upregulation of microRNAs that target genes involved in lung development at P21., CONCLUSION: AELE leads to impaired lung alveolar and vascular growth, which persists into adult age despite normalizing the diet and environment at P21. AELE also alters the expression of genes involved in lung remodeling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature neonates. Several mechanisms, including improvement in pulmonary mechanics underly beneficial effects of caffeine in BPD. As vascular development promotes alveologenesis, we hypothesized that caffeine might enhance angiogenesis in the lung, promoting lung growth, thereby attenuating BPD., METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice litters were randomized within 12 h of birth to room air (RA) or 95%O2 to receive caffeine (20 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 4 days and recovered in RA for 12wks. The lung mRNA and protein expression for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and angiogenic genes performed on day 5. Lung morphometry and vascular remodeling assessed on inflation fixed lungs at 12wks., RESULTS: Caffeine and hyperoxia in itself upregulate HIF-2alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression. Protein expression of HIF-2alpha and VEGFR1 were higher in hyperoxia/caffeine and angiopoietin-1 lower in hyperoxia. An increase in radial alveolar count, secondary septal count, and septal length with a decrease in mean linear intercept indicate an amelioration of hyperoxic lung injury by caffeine. An increase in vessel surface area and a significant reduction in smooth muscle thickness of the pulmonary arterioles may suggest a beneficial effect of caffeine on vascular remodeling in hyperoxia, especially in male mice., CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal caffeine by modulating angiogenic gene expression early in lung development may restore the pulmonary microvasculature and alveolarization in adult lung.
