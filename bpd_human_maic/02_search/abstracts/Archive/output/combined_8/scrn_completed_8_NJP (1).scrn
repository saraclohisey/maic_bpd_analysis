The delay in extubation to 5 days resulted in baboons in the delayed nasal continuous positive airway pressure group having a lower arterial to alveolar oxygen ratio, high PaCO2, and worse respiratory function. The animals in the delayed nasal continuous positive airway pressure group exhibited a poor respiratory drive that contributed to more reintubations and time on mechanical ventilation. A few animals in both groups developed necrotizing enterocolitis and/or sepsis, but infectious pneumonias were not documented. Cellular bronchiolitis and peribronchiolar alveolar wall thickening were more frequently seen in the delayed nasal continuous positive airway pressure group. Bronchoalveolar lavage levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and growth-regulated oncogene-alpha were significantly increased in the delayed nasal continuous positive airway pressure group. Standard and digital morphometric analyses showed no significant differences in internal surface area and nodal measurements between the groups. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule vascular staining was not significantly different between the 2 nasal continuous positive airway pressure groups., CONCLUSIONS: Volutrauma and/or low-grade colonization of airways secondary to increased reintubations and ventilation times are speculated to play causative roles in the delayed nasal continuous positive airway pressure group findings.","group":"g1","id":"b76a934a-57a2-4ad2-a847-a1b0758f6feb","_showDetails":false},"e3f46d1c-df6f-4cb2-b5cb-e511b2bc6b52":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Genetic susceptibility to retinopathy of prematurity.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2006-1088","authors":["Bizzarro, Matthew J","Hussain, Naveed","Jonsson, Baldvin","Feng, Rui","Ment, Laura R","Gruen, Jeffrey R","Zhang, Heping","Bhandari, Vineet"],"date":"2006//","keywords":["Female","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Male","*Retinopathy of Prematurity/ge [Genetics]","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"118","number":"5","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17079555"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The goals were to isolate and to estimate the genetic susceptibility to retinopathy of prematurity., METHODS: A retrospective study (1994-2004) from 3 centers was performed with zygosity data for premature twins who were born at a gestational age of < or = 32 weeks and survived beyond a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks.

We studied NF-(k)B dependent transcription by transfecting HFLF with a NF-(k)B responsive promoter driving the luciferase gene and treating with IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) and measuring luciferase activity. We exposed cells to the PI-3 kinase inhibitor or the Erk1/2 inhibitor one hr before stimulating with IGF-1. We also used IGF-1 receptor antibody to inhibit the action of IGF-1 and studied its effect on alpha-sma and type I collagen. IGF-1 treatment significantly increased luciferase activity.

It was our objective for this study to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms of hemostasis genes on the primary outcome measures of sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia in a large cohort of very low birth weight infants., METHODS: There were 586 very low birth weight infants enrolled prospectively in a multicenter trial between September 2003 and July 2005, and an additional 595 very low birth weight infants, who had been recruited in a previous prospective trial, were studied. DNA samples were taken by buccal swab, and genotypes of factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, the factor VII-323 del/ins polymorphism, and the factor XIII-Val34Leu polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion., RESULTS: In contrast to data published previously, the frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia was not significantly influenced by any of the genetic variants tested. Carriers of the factor XIII-Val34Leu polymorphism, however, had a higher sepsis rate and a longer period of hospital care compared with noncarriers. The factor VII-323 del/ins polymorphism was found to be a potential protective factor against bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSIONS: We could not confirm previously reported associations of hemostasis gene variants and development of intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants.

Therefore, we examined whether TA PTHrP content during the first week of life correlates with the later development of BPD. Forty VLBWI [birth weight, 943 +/- 302 g (mean +/- SD); gestational age, 27 +/- 2 wk; 21 males and 19 females], who were ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome, were studied. The TA were collected once daily until the infants were extubated and immediately frozen at -70 degrees C for subsequent assays for PTHrP and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), a previously described, nonspecific TA biomarker for BPD. The levels of these proteins were correlated with the later development of BPD. PTHrP in the TA during the first week of life was significantly lower in those infants who developed BPD (12/40) than among those who did not (28/40). The PTHrP levels also correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation needed in these infants. In contrast, MMP-8 levels did not correlate with BPD. We conclude that lower TA PTHrP content during the first week of life in ventilated VLBWI inversely correlates with prolonged ventilation and the later development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"8d9cfc29-e9ae-4e22-969e-fbe4f7a96106","_showDetails":true},"b3a77051-faac-4352-a771-9ab9d177044c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2022>","title":"Analysis of \"true extrauterine growth retardation\" and related factors in very preterm infants-A multicenter prospective study in China.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.876310","authors":["Shen, Wei","Wu, Fan","Mao, Jian","Liu, Ling","Chang, Yan-Mei","Zhang, Rong","Zheng, Zhi","Ye, Xiu-Zhen","Qiu, Yin-Ping","Ma, Li","Cheng, Rui","Wu, Hui","Chen, Dong-Mei","Chen, Ling","Xu, Ping","Mei, Hua","Wang, San-Nan","Xu, Fa-Lin","Ju, Rong","Chen, Chao","Tong, Xiao-Mei","Lin, Xin-Zhu"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20220915//","journal":"Frontiers in pediatrics","volume":"10","isbn":"2296-2360","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm7&NEWS=N&AN=36210927"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Objective: To investigate the incidence and related factors of extrauterine growth retardation (EUGR) and \"true EUGR\" in very preterm infants (VPI) from different regions of China., Materials and methods: Clinical data of VPI were prospectively collected from 28 hospitals in seven different regions of China from September 2019 to December 2020. The infants were divided into a small for gestational age (SGA) group or non-SGA group at birth, with non-SGA infants at 36 weeks of gestation or at discharge being further divided into a EUGR group or a non-EUGR group. Infants in the EUGR and non-SGA group were defined as \"true EUGR.\" The general information of VPI, such as maternal complications during pregnancy, use of enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition, and complications during hospitalization were compared between the groups., Results: Among the 2,514 VPI included in this study, 47.3, 41.5, and 33.3% of VPI were below the 10th percentile, and 22.6, 22.4, and 16.0% of VPI were below the 3rd percentile for weight, height, and head circumference at 36 weeks of gestation or at discharge, respectively, by the percentile on the 2013 Fenton curve. The incidences of EUGR and \"true EUGR\" evaluated by weight were 47.3 and 44.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences in the aspects of perinatal and nutritional characteristics, treatment, and complications between the groups. Multivariate analysis showed that in non-SGA infants, the cumulative caloric intake during the first week was a protective factor for \"true EUGR,\" while days to reach total enteral nutrition, late initiation of human milk fortifier, and moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia were independent risk factors for \"true EUGR.\", Conclusion: More attention should be paid to the nutritional management of VPI to prevent \"true EUGR.\" Cumulative caloric intake should be ensured and increased during the first week, total enteral nutrition should be achieved as early as possible, human milk fortifier should be added early, and moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia should be prevented. These strategies are very important for reducing the incidence of \"true EUGR\" in VPI.

Patient groupings on the basis of placental inflammation and clinical chorioamnionitis were studied by a comparison of mean values and incidences for those neonatal outcomes that were available from the database with the use of linear and logistic regression analysis and controlling for potentially confounding variables., RESULTS: There were 660 infants who met the inclusion criteria and had placental pathology available of whom 368 (56%) had no placental inflammation, 114 (17%) had placental chorioamnionitis, and 178 (27%) had placental funisitis. Umbilical cord partial pressure oxygen and base excess values were generally higher in the placental inflammation/clinical chorioamnionitis groups, in keeping with enhanced oxygen delivery and an overall decrease in the metabolic contribution to acidosis attributed to altered lactate metabolism in these infants. After adjusting for confounders (primarily differences in gestational age), the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was significantly decreased in the placental inflammation/clinical chorioamnionitis groups, in keeping with cytokine-induced synthesis of surfactant proteins in these infants. Although the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia was generally unchanged among the groups studied, that for intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia was lowest in the placental inflammation/no clinical chorioamnionitis patients and highest in the placental inflammation/clinical chorioamnionitis patients, suggesting a differential effect of clinical chorioamnionitis for these outcomes., CONCLUSION: Overall, infants born preterm with intrauterine infection were better oxygenated and showed less metabolic acidosis at birth and had incidences of respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular hemorrhage, which were variably lower.

Although this process was suggested to be a central molecular event in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), so far it has been only demonstrated in vitro; whether it also occurs in vivo is unknown. Our objectives were to determine if exposure to hyperoxia results in pulmonary alveolar lipo-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation in vivo, and whether treatment with a potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) (the key lipogenic fibroblast nuclear transcription factor) agonist, rosiglitazone, prevents this process. Newborn Sprague Dawley rat pups were exposed to control (21% O2), hyperoxia alone (95% O2 for 24 hr), or hyperoxia with rosiglitazone (95% O2 for 24 hr + rosiglitazone, 3 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) conditions. Subsequently, pups were sacrificed, and lung tissue was analyzed by morphometry, and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western hybridization, and immunohistochemistry for the expression of key lipogenic and myogenic markers. We observed a significant decrease in the expression of lipogenic markers, and a significant increase in the expression of myogenic markers in the hyperoxia-alone group. These hyperoxia-induced morphologic, molecular, and immunohistochemical changes were almost completely prevented by rosiglitazone. This is the first evidence of in vivo lipo-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation and its almost complete prevention by rosiglitazone, prompting us to conclude that administration of PPARgamma agonists may be a novel, effective strategy to prevent the hyperoxia-induced lung molecular injury that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD.

The mechanisms of mechanical ventilation-induced airway injury are currently unknown. This study correlates the age-related effects of mechanical ventilation on airway function with structural alterations at the tissue, cellular, ultrastructural, and molecular levels. Mechanically ventilated and nonventilated tracheal rings were obtained from premature and newborn lambs. In tissue baths, the passive and active length-tension relationships and dose-response characteristics of the tracheal rings were determined. Fixed tracheal rings were digested and the resulting isolated smooth muscle cells measured. Rings were analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Additionally, protein was extracted from the tracheal smooth muscle and myosin heavy chain isoforms were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by densitometry. Mechanical ventilation resulted in a significant decrease of both the slope of the passive length-stress relationship and of maximal force generation, with both effects being most pronounced in the newborn age group. These age-related functional alterations correlated with a decrease in smooth muscle cell length and a disruption of ultrastructural architecture, which were also most pronounced in the older groups. Furthermore, mechanical ventilation resulted in epithelial denudation at all ages. There were no acute statistically significant effects of mechanical ventilation on myosin heavy chain isoform expression. This study demonstrates age-related effects of mechanical ventilation on the passive and active characteristics of tracheal function and provides a structural analysis of potential mechanisms. The mechanisms behind these functional differences involve ultrastructural changes in cell length, tissue matrix, and disruption of epithelial integrity. These findings help elucidate the pathogenesis of ventilator-induced airway injury. Copyright 2006 S.

Maximal fetal expression of LGL1 is concordant with the onset of alveolar septation, suggesting an additional role for lgl1 in alveologenesis. At postnatal d 7, during the period of maximal septation in postnatal rat lung, lgl1 concentrates at the tips of budding secondary alveolar septa. We studied two models of impaired postnatal alveologenesis generated by exposure of newborn rats to 60% O2 for 2 wk or 95% O2 for 1 wk. A profound decrease of lgl1 expression with oxygen exposure was observed in both animal models. Animals exposed to 95% O2 for 1 wk recovered in air over a 3-wk period, associated with normalization of lgl1 levels. Changes in lung levels of alpha-actin (a marker of myofibroblast differentiation associated with alveologenesis) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin were significant but less marked.

We examined surfactant and nitric oxide (NO), which are developmentally deficient in premature infants, in the baboon model of developing CLD. Fetuses were delivered at 125 d gestation and were managed for 14 d with ventilation and oxygen prn without (controls) or with inhaled NO at 5 ppm. Compared with term infants, premature control infants had reduced maximal lung volume, decreased tissue content of surfactant proteins SP-A, -B, and -C, abnormal lavage surfactant as assessed by pulsating bubble surfactometer, and a low concentration of SP-B/phospholipid. NO treatment significantly increased maximal lung volume and tissue SP-A and SP-C, reduced recovery of lavage surfactant by 33%, decreased the total protein:phospholipid ratio of surfactant by 50%, and had no effect on phospholipid composition or SP content except for SP-C (50%). In both treatment groups, levels of SP-B and SP-C in surfactant were negatively correlated with STmin, with a 5-fold greater SP efficiency for NO versus control animals. By contrast, lung volume and compliance were not correlated with surfactant function. We conclude that surfactant is often dysfunctional in developing CLD secondary to SP-B deficiency. NO treatment improves the apparent ability of hydrophobic SP to promote low surface tension, perhaps secondary to less protein inactivation of surfactant, and improves lung volume by a process unrelated to surfactant function.","group":"g1","id":"d306d598-bab2-4db3-88d1-407600b808e6","_showDetails":false},"80b75d72-15cc-4d9e-9169-65b7b4945f4e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Effect of preterm birth on hypoxia-inducible factors and vascular endothelial growth factor in primate lungs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.20321","authors":["Asikainen, Tiina M","Ahmad, Aftab","Schneider, Barbara K","White, Carl W"],"date":"2005//","keywords":["Actins/me [Metabolism]","Animals","*Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/me [Metabolism]","Blotting, Western","Female","*Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Models, Animal","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","Papio","Pregnancy","*Premature Birth","Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase/me [Metabolism]","Respiration, Artificial","*Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/me [Metabolism]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"40","number":"6","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16231377"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Diminished vascular and alveolar development is characteristic of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The low fetal O(2) tension promotes angiogenic responses during ontogenesis, while preterm birth interrupts normal lung growth. Most of the angiogenic responses are governed by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the expressions of which are unknown in the lungs of preterm primates. Lung tissue was harvested from fetal third-trimester baboons as well as from preterm baboons (67% or 75% of term gestation) treated with mechanical ventilation and either pro re nata (PRN) or 100% O(2). Both groups of preterm animals developed lung hypoplasia similar to human BPD. Expression of HIF-1alpha protein by Western blotting of nuclear extracts of fetal baboon samples differed from that of HIF-2alpha in that both were high at early third trimester, but at term, HIF-1alpha was absent, whereas HIF-2alpha remained unchanged. Moreover, the expression of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins 2 and 3 (PHD-2 and -3), which degrade HIFs, was increased following term birth. HIF-1alpha was diminished both in 125-day and 140-day BPD models, whereas HIF-2alpha was reduced only in the latter. Surprisingly, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was enhanced in preterm baboons with BPD as compared with age-matched fetal controls, and there was a negative correlation between HIF-1alpha and/or HIF-2alpha and VEGF in BPD. Moreover, VEGF receptors KDR and/or Flt-1 were decreased in BPD. Preterm birth also prevented the end-gestational increase in the expression of endothelial cell marker platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1. These results suggest that selective downregulation of HIFs in lungs of preterm neonates may contribute to the pathophysiology of BPD.

FoxA1 gene showed higher levels in lung tissue of BPD mice and is reported to promote the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells. We aimed to clarify the expression pattern of uc.375 in BPD and explore the interaction between uc.375 and FoxA1. Methods: Newborn mice were placed in a 95% high-oxygen environment for 7 days. Lung tissue samples from mice were used for lncRNA microarray to screen BPD related lncRNAs. Mouse alveolar epithelial cell line MLE 12 was stably transfected with uc.375 and FoxA1 silencing or overexpression lentiviral vectors. The proliferation activity of MLE 12 cells was detected by a cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay. MLE 12 cell apoptosis was determined by Hoechst/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. The protein levels of Cleaved Caspase-3, FoxA1, SP-C and UCP2 were investigated by western blot. The relative mRNA expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: uc.375 is mainly distributed in the nucleus of alveolar epithelial cells, as revealed by In Situ Hybridization assay results. uc.375 was lowly expressed in the lung tissues of BPD mice. According to the results of CCK-8 assay, analysis of Hoechst/PI staining and western blotting, uc.375 silencing inhibited cell proliferation, facilitated apoptosis of MLE 12 cells, promoted caspase 3 and FoxA1 expression, and inhibited the expression of SP-C and UCP2. On the contrary, after overexpressing uc.375, the opposite results were obtained. Silencing FoxA1 inhibited MLE 12 apoptosis, promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis-related factor caspase 3, and promoted the expression of SP-C and UCP2. FoxA1 silencing also reversed the effect induced by uc.375 knockdown on the proliferation and apoptosis of MLE 12 cells. Conclusion:  Based on the biomedical images-derived analysis results, uc.375 negatively regulates FoxA1 expression, affects alveolar development, and plays an important role in the initiation and progression of BPD, providing a new molecular target for the prevention and treatment of BPD.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a trophic factor required for endothelial cell survival and is abundantly expressed in the lung., METHODS AND RESULTS: We report that VEGF blockade decreases lung VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) expression in newborn rats and impairs alveolar development, leading to alveolar simplification and loss of lung capillaries, mimicking BPD. In hyperoxia-induced BPD in newborn rats, air space enlargement and loss of lung capillaries are associated with decreased lung VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression. Postnatal intratracheal adenovirus-mediated VEGF gene therapy improves survival, promotes lung capillary formation, and preserves alveolar development in this model of irreversible lung injury. Combined VEGF and angiopoietin-1 gene transfer matures the new vasculature, reducing the vascular leakage seen in VEGF-induced capillaries., CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of the vasculature in what is traditionally thought of as an airway disease and open new therapeutic avenues for lung diseases characterized by irreversible loss of alveoli through the modulation of angiogenic growth factors.","group":"g1","id":"1222b7a1-6411-46f5-a563-6441ed342eff","_showDetails":false},"bd425053-9baf-49a3-b59e-f88ee339e00e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"A randomized, placebo-controlled GH trial in very preterm infants who were at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and were treated with dexamethasone.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/01.PDR.0000180567.94279.AE","authors":["Huysman, Marianne W A","Hop, Wim C J","Cromme-Dijkhuis, Adri H","Sauer, Pieter J J","Hokken-Koelega, Anita C S"],"date":"2005//","keywords":["*Anti-Inflammatory Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Birth Weight","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Cardiovascular System","*Dexamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Double-Blind Method","Female","*Growth Hormone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Hormones/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/me [Metabolism]","Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/me [Metabolism]","Male","Placebos","Time Factors","Ventilator Weaning"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"58","number":"4","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16189197"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Very preterm infants who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia are often treated with dexamethasone (DEXA) to wean them from the ventilator.

Potential pathogens triggering early neutrophil influx include either prenatal or postnatal exposure to bacteria or viruses. Specific mechanisms recruiting neutrophils to the lung and subsequently decreasing alveolization during virus-induced lung inflammation and injury have not been fully elucidated. Because CXC chemokines, such as CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 acting through their putative receptor, CXCR2, are potent neutrophil chemoattractants, the authors investigated their role in dsRNA-induced lung injury and decreased alveolization, in which dsRNA (poly IC) is a well-described synthetic agent mimicking acute viral infection. Intratracheal dsRNA led to significant increases in neutrophil infiltration and lung injury at 72 hours and to decreased alveolization at 5 days after dsRNA exposure in newborn (10 days old) BALB/c mice, when compared with controls treated and not treated with ssRNA (poly C). Expression of CXCL1 and CXCR2 paralleled neutrophil recruitment to the lung and preceded the decrease in alveolization. Inhibition of CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand interaction by pretreating dsRNA-exposed mice with an anti-CXCR2 neutralizing antibody significantly attenuated neutrophil sequestration and lung injury, and preserved normal alveolization. These findings demonstrate that the CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biologic axis plays an important role during the pathogenesis of dsRNA-induced lung injury and decreased alveolization and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"b9a878aa-b4d9-4022-b3ea-8bf12b7aad7a","_showDetails":true},"5235476f-97cc-4b4f-9210-ae63d8131d9e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Hyperoxic ventilated premature baboons have increased p53, oxidant DNA damage and decreased VEGF expression.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/01.pdr.0000176923.79584.f7","authors":["Maniscalco, William M","Watkins, Richard H","Roper, Jason M","Staversky, Rhonda","O'Reilly, Michael A"],"date":"2005//","keywords":["Animals","*DNA Damage","*Gene Expression","Guanosine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]","Guanosine/me [Metabolism]","*Hypoxia/me [Metabolism]","Immunohistochemistry","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Oxidants/pd [Pharmacology]","Papio","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/me [Metabolism]","*Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"58","number":"3","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16148072"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Hyperoxia is implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of premature infants. High levels of supplemental oxygen can result in microvascular endothelial cell death and may disrupt lung development. In postnatal animals, hyperoxia inhibits expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is required for normal vascular development. A potential mechanism of oxygen effects on VEGF is induction of p53, a transcription factor that represses VEGF gene transcription. Oxidant DNA damage can increase p53. We used a moderately premature baboon model of hyperoxia to examine p53, oxidant DNA damage, and VEGF expression. Fetal baboons delivered at 140 d of gestation (75% of term) were ventilated with 100% oxygen or oxygen as needed for 6 or 10 d. Lungs from the 10-d 100% oxygen animals had increased nuclear p53, compared with the oxygen as needed animals. The mechanism of increased p53 was probably related to oxidant DNA damage, which was documented by increased oxidized guanine. Dual fluorescent confocal microscopy found increased oxidized guanine in mitochondrial DNA of distal lung epithelial cells. Distal epithelial cell VEGF expression was decreased and p21, another downstream target of p53, was increased in the distal epithelium of the hyperoxic animals. These data show that p53 is induced in hyperoxic fetal lung epithelium and are consistent with p53 repression of VEGF expression in these cells. The findings suggest that oxidant DNA damage may be a mechanism of increased p53 in hyperoxic fetal lung.","group":"g1","id":"5235476f-97cc-4b4f-9210-ae63d8131d9e","_showDetails":false},"beac7f1b-6e3f-40c9-bfea-24f883507f76":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Activation of hypoxia-inducible factors in hyperoxia through prolyl 4-hydroxylase blockade in cells and explants of primate lung.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0504520102","authors":["Asikainen, Tiina M","Schneider, Barbara K","Waleh, Nahid S","Clyman, Ronald I","Ho, Wen-Bin","Flippin, Lee A","Gunzler, Volkmar","White, Carl W"],"date":"2005//","accessDate":"20050711//","keywords":["Amino Acids, Dicarboxylic/pd [Pharmacology]","Analysis of Variance","Animals","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors","Blotting, Western","Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Gene Expression Regulation/de [Drug Effects]","*Gene Expression Regulation/ph [Physiology]","Humans","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Neovascularization, Physiologic/de [Drug Effects]","*Neovascularization, Physiologic/ph [Physiology]","Oxygen/me [Metabolism]","Papio","Polymerase Chain Reaction","*Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","*Trans-Activators/me [Metabolism]","*Transcription Factors/me [Metabolism]","Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/me [Metabolism]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","volume":"102","number":"29","isbn":"0027-8424","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16009933"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) often develop a chronic form of lung disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by decreased alveolar and vascular development.

We investigated whether angiogenic responses could be augmented through enhancement of hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha and 2alpha (HIF-1alpha and -2alpha, respectively) via blockade of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (HIF-PHDs) in human microvascular endothelial cells from developing and adult lung, in epithelial A549 cells, and in fetal baboon explants in relative or absolute hyperoxia.

Using a [13C6]glucose precursor in very-low-birth weight (VLBW) premature neonates, we measured the 13C content of cysteine in hepatically derived apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 and in the plasma to determine whether cysteine synthesis occurs and to relate minimum synthetic capacity to neonatal maturity., METHODS: Twelve VLBW premature neonates (birth weight, 907 +/- 274 [SD] g; gestational age, 26.8 +/- 2.4 weeks) were studied on day of life 7.8 +/- 4.2 while on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 5.6 +/- 4.5 days. A 4-hour intravenous infusion of [13C6]glucose was administered. Blood samples were obtained immediately before and at the end of the infusion. Isotopic enrichment of cysteine was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Analysis of variance, Student's t test, and linear regression were used for comparisons., RESULTS: The 13C isotope ratio of apo B-100-derived cysteine after the [13C6]glucose infusion was significantly higher than baseline (18.57 +/- 0.38 [SEM] vs 17.54 +/- 0.25 mol%, P < .05). The 13C isotope ratio of plasma cysteine was also significantly higher than baseline (17.36 +/- 0.25 vs 16.91 +/- 0.16 mol%, P < .05). When expressed as a product/precursor ratio, the mole percent above baseline of [13C]apo B-100 cysteine/[13C6]glucose correlated with birth weight (r = 0.74, P < .01)., CONCLUSIONS: Very low-birth weight neonates are capable of cysteine synthesis as evidenced by incorporation of 13C label into hepatically derived apo B-100 cysteine and plasma cysteine from a glucose precursor. The minimum capacity for intrahepatic cysteine synthesis appears to be directly proportional to the maturity of the neonate and may impact the capabilities of VLBW neonates to counteract oxidative stresses such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis.","group":"g1","id":"1dee4572-7055-43ae-bfce-22b897d477fb","_showDetails":false},"7b9a9b55-f9d1-4156-835c-ef966fde7a99":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Experimental intrauterine Ureaplasma infection in sheep.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2004.11.063","authors":["Moss, Timothy J M","Nitsos, Ilias","Ikegami, Machiko","Jobe, Alan H","Newnham, John P"],"date":"2005//","keywords":["Analysis of Variance","Animals","Disease Models, Animal","Female","*Fetal Development/ph [Physiology]","Fetal Organ Maturity","*Lung/em [Embryology]","Pregnancy","Pregnancy, Animal","*Premature Birth","Random Allocation","Reference Values","Risk Factors","Sheep, Domestic","Survival Rate","Time Factors","*Ureaplasma Infections/co [Complications]","Ureaplasma Infections/mo [Mortality]"],"journal":"American journal of obstetrics and gynecology","volume":"192","number":"4","isbn":"0002-9378","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=15846199"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Prenatal Ureaplasma spp exposure is associated with preterm birth and modulates the neonates' susceptibility to respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

IL-10 expression is affected by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position -1082 (G to A). The A allele is associated with lower IL-10 production. Low IL-10 production has been linked to the development of BPD. Thus, the IL-10 -1082 SNP may be a genetic risk factor for the development of BPD in the premature newborn. The IL-10 -1082 SNP was determined in 294 (235 African American, 56 Caucasian, and 3 Hispanic) mechanically ventilated very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and compared to outcome (death and/or development of BPD). Differences in groups were analyzed using ANOVA (continuous variables) or chi square (proportions). The frequency of the A allele in our population was 0.62. Thirty-nine (13.3%) infants were homozygous GG, 146 (49.7%) were heterozygous GA, and 109 (37.0%) were homozygous AA. There were no significant differences between genotype groups with respect to ethnic origin, gender, need for surfactant replacement therapy, and isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum or Mycoplasma hominis from tracheal aspirates at birth. However, AA infants were slightly more mature and of greater birth weight than GA infants (26.9 +/- 0.2 weeks vs. 26.3 +/- 0.2 weeks, P < 0.05, and 940 +/- 22 g vs. 882 +/- 18 g, P < 0.05, respectively). There was no significant effect of the IL-10 -1082 SNP on mortality or the development of BPD (O2 on 28 days or 36 weeks postconceptional age). However, when considered together, the IL-10 -1082 AA/GA genotypes (lower IL-10 production) were associated with a trend toward reduction in risk for the combined outcome of BPD or death (18/39 vs. 80/255, respectively; P = 0.068). The incidence of other complications of prematurity (retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, or periventricular leukomalacia) was not different between groups. In conclusion, the IL-10 -1082 G/A SNP does not have a major influence on mortality or the development of BPD in ventilated VLBW infants.

BPD was defined as infants who remained dependent on active respiratory support or oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks postconceptional age. A case-control study of 224 preterm infants (<30 weeks) who had respiratory distress syndrome and needed intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) were undertaken between January 1999 and December 2003.

Recruitment and subsequent activation of macrophages in the lung are mediated by CC chemokines. The role of CC chemokines has not been extensively studied in the course of RDS. Serial tracheal aspirates (TA) were obtained from 56 mechanically ventilated infants with birth weights less than 1,500 g during intervals in the first 21 days of life. Tracheal aspirate concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant proteins-1,2,3 (MCP-1,2,3) and macrophage inflammatory proteins-1alpha and -1beta (MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tracheal aspirate concentrations of MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MIP-1beta increased during the first week of life in infants with RDS, whereas MIP-1alpha concentrations did not increase appreciably. Increased TA cytokine concentrations were associated with the development of BPD. Maximal TA concentrations of MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta were significantly higher in infants who were oxygen-dependent at 28 postnatal days compared to infant who were not. Similarly, maximal TA MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3 but not MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta concentrations were significantly higher in infants who were oxygen-dependent at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (PCA) than those who were not oxygen-dependent at 36 weeks PCA. Histologic chorioamnionitis and isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum from the airways were associated with higher maximal TA concentrations of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta. Pulmonary hemorrhage was associated with increased maximal concentrations of MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3. These data suggest a role for CC chemokines in the development of BPD in the newborn infant.

The increase of inflammatory cytokines in many disease processes is generally balanced by a rise in anti-inflammatory cytokines. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) have been shown to inhibit production of several inflammatory cytokines important in the development of BPD., METHODS: We sought to determine if a correlation exists between the presence or absence of IL-4 and IL-13 in tracheal aspirates (TA) during the first 3 weeks of life and the development of BPD in premature infants. Serial TAs were prospectively obtained from 36 very low birth weight infants and IL-4 and IL-13 concentrations were determined by ELISA., RESULTS: Infants who developed BPD (n = 19) were less mature (25.3 +/- 0.02 wks vs. 27.8 +/- 0.05 wks; p < 0.001), and had lower birth weights (739 +/- 27 g vs.1052 +/- 41 g; p < 0.001). IL-4 and IL-13 were detectable in only 27 of 132 and 9 of 132 samples assayed respectively. Furthermore, the levels detected for IL-4 and IL-13 were very low and did not correlate with the development of BPD., CONCLUSIONS: TA concentrations of IL-4 and IL-13 do not increase significantly during acute lung injury in premature infants.","group":"g1","id":"12586199-8382-4025-9287-7405970d3132","_showDetails":false},"46f89983-416c-4f8e-9b75-ff92c06546e8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2003 to 2004>","title":"Effect of dexamethasone treatment on serum GH, IGF-I, and the binding proteins IGFBP-1 and -3 in ventilated very preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/01.PDR.0000065727.45195.69","authors":["Huysman, Marianne W A","Hokken-Koelega, Anita C S","Hop, Wim C J","Sauer, Pieter J J"],"date":"2003//","accessDate":"20030319//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Dexamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Female","*Glucocorticoids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Human Growth Hormone/bl [Blood]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1/bl [Blood]","*Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/bl [Blood]","Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/me [Metabolism]","Male","Respiration, Artificial"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"54","number":"1","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med5&NEWS=N&AN=12646720"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Very preterm infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia frequently show a compromised growth in the neonatal period especially when steroids are given to facilitate weaning from the ventilator. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effect of dexamethasone (DEXA) on the GH-IGF axis in ventilated very preterm infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We studied 10 very preterm artificially ventilated infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [median (range) gestational age 27.5 wk (25.9-32.0 wk), median (range) birth weight 970 g (610-2150 g)] immediately before and 2 d after the start of DEXA treatment. On both days of study, serum GH profiles were obtained, and serum IGF-I and IGF binding protein (IGFBP) -1 and -3 levels were measured. The ventilation score and the nutritional intake were calculated. Before the start of DEXA treatment, the median serum mean GH level was 12.0 microg/L (6-28.4 microg/L), whereas 2 d after the start of DEXA treatment the median serum mean GH level declined significantly to a value of 4.4 microg/L (1.7-11.9 microg/L). During DEXA treatment, mean, baseline, and maximal GH levels (Pulsar analysis) were significantly lower compared with pretreatment levels (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). Serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels did not decline during DEXA. Serum IGFBP-1 levels were significantly lower compared with pretreatment levels (p < 0.01). Serum GH levels during DEXA treatment were correlated with neither the time interval between the administration of DEXA and the second GH profile nor the cumulative DEXA dose administered. Ventilation score and nutritional intake did not significantly correlate with serum GH, IGF-I, or IGFBP-1 or -3 levels, either before or after the start of DEXA. Two days of DEXA treatment in very preterm ventilated infants has a suppressive effect on serum GH levels, without an acute decline in serum IGF-I levels. A concomitant decrease in serum IGFBP-1 levels was found.","group":"g1","id":"46f89983-416c-4f8e-9b75-ff92c06546e8","_showDetails":false},"7bc784f4-c0ba-48b0-818e-94ea815382de":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Safety and pharmacokinetics of an intramuscular monoclonal antibody (SB 209763) against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and young children at risk for severe RSV disease.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.43.5.1183","authors":["Meissner, H C","Groothuis, J R","Rodriguez, W J","Welliver, R C","Hogg, G","Gray, P H","Loh, R","Simoes, E A","Sly, P","Miller, A K","Nichols, A I","Jorkasky, D K","Everitt, D E","Thompson, K A"],"date":"1999//","keywords":["*Antibodies, Monoclonal/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Antibodies, Monoclonal/ae [Adverse Effects]","Antibodies, Monoclonal/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized","*Antibodies, Viral/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Antibodies, Viral/im [Immunology]","Child, Preschool","Double-Blind Method","Female","Half-Life","Humans","Infant","Injections, Intramuscular","Male","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/im [Immunology]","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/im [Immunology]"],"journal":"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","volume":"43","number":"5","isbn":"0066-4804","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=10223933"],"address":"United States","abstract":"We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of a humanized monoclonal antibody against a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein (SB 209763) to evaluate its safety, pharmacokinetics, and fusion inhibition and neutralization titers. Forty-three infants who were either delivered prematurely (</=35 weeks' gestation) or exhibited bronchopulmonary dysplasia were administered either single or repeat (two doses, 8 weeks apart) intramuscular injections of SB 209763 at a concentration of 0.25, 1.25, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg or of a placebo. Four of 229 adverse events were considered related to the study drug, including purpura (n = 3) and thrombocytosis (n = 1). No subject developed a detectable level of anti-SB 209763 antibody. Approximately 1 week after administration of the second dose of SB 209763 at 10 mg/kg, the mean plasma concentration (n = 9) was 68.5 micrograms/ml. The terminal half-life (T1/2) determined by noncompartmental analysis ranged from 22 to 50 days. The population pharmacokinetics for SB 209763 following intramuscular administration was appropriately described by a one-compartment model with first-order input and elimination. Higher values for clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were observed for younger patients, with values decreasing to 0.143 (ml/h)/kg and 161 mL/kg, respectively, by a mean age of 298 days (approximately 10 months). The mean T1/2 of SB 209763 for the study population was 32.5 days.

The mean neutralization titer on day 6 was 286, and the mean fusion inhibition titer was 36. At least 57% of subjects dosed at 1.25 to 10.0 mg of SB 209763 per kg of body weight who were seronegative at baseline experienced a fourfold or greater increase in fusion inhibition titer. Nine RSV infections were documented during the 16-week course of the study; the numbers of RSV infections were similar for the different regimens, including the placebo. The doses of SB 209763 studied may have been insufficient to confer protection against RSV lower respiratory tract disease; these results suggest that additional trials using higher doses of monoclonal antibody for immunoprophylaxis should be considered.","group":"g1","id":"7bc784f4-c0ba-48b0-818e-94ea815382de","_showDetails":false},"23225878-6d67-49c5-8078-e7111ce665c5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Polymorphisms of surfactant protein B encoding gene: modifiers of the course of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome?.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-002-1046-1","authors":["Makri, Vassiliki","Hospes, Birgit","Stoll-Becker, Simone","Borkhardt, Arndt","Gortner, Ludwig"],"date":"2002//","accessDate":"20020913//","keywords":["Alleles","Amino Acid Motifs","Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Polymorphism, Genetic","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein B/ge [Genetics]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/co [Complications]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"European journal of pediatrics","volume":"161","number":"11","isbn":"0340-6199","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=12424586"],"address":"Germany","abstract":"UNLABELLED: Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is a lipophilic protein and plays a major role in lung mechanics. Polymorphisms of surfactant protein A, another component of the surfactant system, have been previously described to be a risk factor for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterms. The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether polymorphisms within intron 4 of the SP-B gene are related to the incidence, severity and complications of RDS in Caucasian newborns. In order to identify SP-B intron 4 polymorphisms, we analysed genomic DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction, fragment length and sequence analysis in 140 preterms and 58 healthy term neonates. The frequency of intron 4 variations did not differ between preterms and terms. A total of 111 preterms with the intron 4 wild type (group 1) and 29 preterms carrying the genetic variations (group 2) did not differ in gestational age, gender distribution and birth weight. Compared to group 1, the overall incidence of RDS (75.7% versus 93.1%, P < 0.05), the frequency of severe RDS (28.4% versus 55.2%, P < 0.01) and BPD (21.6% versus 48.3%, P < 0.01) were all higher in group 2. The median duration of oxygen dependency (4 days versus 17 days, P < 0.05) and the need for surfactant administration were also higher in group 2 than in group 1 (43.2% versus 72.4%, P < 0.01).

Very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants, many with tracheal microbial colonization and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), comprise a difficult group in whom to make a diagnosis of pneumonia with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for infants younger than 1 year., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to retrospectively compare VAP surveillance diagnoses made by the hospital infection control practitioner (ICP) with those made by a panel of experts with the same clinical and laboratory evidence and supportive radiologic data. A secondary objective was to compare radiologic diagnosis of pneumonia made by the general hospital radiologists, by the panel of experts, and by a pediatric radiologist from another hospital., STUDY POPULATION: Thirty-seven VLBW infants identified as at risk for VAP by the ICP on the basis of a positive bacterial tracheal culture and the application of CDC criteria for the definition of pneumonia were studied., METHODS: Clinical and laboratory evidence and routine radiologic reports made by the general radiologist were reviewed independently by a panel of experts composed of 3 experienced neonatologists. Chest x-rays from the day before, day of, and day after the surveillance date were reviewed separately by the 3 neonatologists and also by a pediatric radiologist., RESULTS: After inter-reader reliability was found satisfactory (kappa's coefficient, 0.47-0.75; P <.05), the panel of neonatologists determined that the 37 VLBW infants represented 4 distinct clinical categories. Group 1 comprised 12 airway-colonized infants, aged 14 to 30 days, who on the surveillance date, albeit intubated, were asymptomatic, not treated with antibiotics, and survived. Group 2 comprised 11 airway-colonized infants, aged 7 to 42 days, who presented with equivocal clinical, laboratory, or radiologic signs of VAP and survived. Group 3 comprised 7 airway-colonized infants, aged 14 to 21 days, who were acutely ill (3 died) and had clinical and laboratory evidence of nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) but no radiologic signs of pneumonia. Group 4 comprised 7 infants, aged 14 to 28 days, who were acutely ill (4 died) and had clinical and laboratory evidence of infection and radiologic changes consistent with VAP. Radiologic Findings: General radiologists, neonatologists, and the pediatric radiologist agreed that none of the asymptomatic airway-colonized infants (Group 1) had VAP. General radiologists reported signs suggestive of pneumonia in 8 of 11 infants (Group 2), a finding not corroborated by the others. Everybody agreed on the absence of radiologic pneumonia in 6 of 7 patients with nosocomial BSI (Group 3) and on the presence of signs consistent with pneumonia in the remaining 7 infants (Group 4)., CONCLUSION: Surveillance diagnosis of VAP in VLBW infants is difficult because current CDC definitions are not specific for this population. Isolated positive tracheal culture alone does not distinguish between bacterial colonization and respiratory infection. Clinical and laboratory signs of VAP, mostly nonspecific, can be found in other conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and nosocomial BSI. Routine radiologic reports suggestive of pneumonia in airway-colonized infants without definitive clinical and laboratory evidence of infection could be misleading. To improve accuracy, surveillance diagnosis of VAP in special populations such as VLBW infants should be reformulated; meanwhile, ICPs should seek consultation with experienced clinicians for interpretation of data.","group":"g1","id":"e58055d2-2b9c-4ce8-b30d-dffd26d4890f","_showDetails":false},"18074926-9f16-4c91-a467-7505e0d3892c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Disrupted pulmonary vasculature and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor, Flt-1, and TIE-2 in human infants dying with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2101140","authors":["Bhatt, A J","Pryhuber, G S","Huyck, H","Watkins, R H","Metlay, L A","Maniscalco, W M"],"date":"2001//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Age Factors","Autopsy","Biomarkers/an [Analysis]","Birth Weight","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/em [Embryology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Capillaries/ab [Abnormalities]","Capillaries/em [Embryology]","*Capillaries/pa [Pathology]","Case-Control Studies","Cause of Death","*Endothelial Growth Factors/an [Analysis]","*Extracellular Matrix Proteins/an [Analysis]","Gestational Age","Humans","Immunohistochemistry","Infant, Newborn","*Lymphokines/an [Analysis]","Neovascularization, Physiologic/ph [Physiology]","*Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/an [Analysis]","Prospective Studies","*Pulmonary Alveoli/bs [Blood Supply]","*Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/an [Analysis]","Receptor, TIE-2","Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","Risk Factors","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine","volume":"164","number":"10 Pt 1","isbn":"1073-449X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11734454"],"address":"United States","abstract":"An abnormal pulmonary vasculature may be an important component of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Regression analyses were used to examine the relation between nutritional parameters and IGF-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 concentrations in premature infants with and without BPD., RESULTS: The group of infants with BPD (n = 12) did not differ from infants without BPD (n = 17) in gestational age or weight at entry, but gained less weight during the study period. In infants without BPD, IGF-1 correlated positively with protein intake (r = 0.50) and caloric intake (r = 0.41) over the 3 days before sample collection and with weight change over the previous week (r = 0.46). In contrast, infants with BPD showed a significant correlation between IGF-1 and weight change (r = 0.54) only. There was a significant negative correlation between IGFBP-2 and protein intake in infants without BPD (r = -0.50) and in infants with BPD (r = -0.41). Negative correlations between IGFBP-2 and both weight change (r = -0.64) and caloric intake (r = -0.43) over the previous week were found only in the group of infants without BPD. IGFBP-3 correlated positively with weight changes and protein intake in both groups but correlated with caloric intake only in the group without BPD. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine significant independent variables associated with IGF-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3. In infants without BPD, significant independent predictors of IGFBP-2 were 7-day weight change and 2-day protein intake; 3-day caloric intake was the only significant independent predictor for IGFBP-3. For infants with BPD, 3-day weight gain was the only independent variable associated with serum IGF-1. Protein intake in the week before sample collection was an independent predictor of IGFBP-2 and 3-day weight change and 2-day protein intake were independent predictors of IGFBP-3., CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that changes in serum IGF-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 reflect the nutritional status of premature infants and demonstrate that the relation between these proteins and nutritional intake differs in premature infants with and without BPD. Refinement of these observations by future studies may permit a more accurate determination of the protein and caloric intake sufficient for growth and repair after injury in premature infants with lung disease.","group":"g1","id":"5425507a-77e2-447b-bece-9362c5e8106b","_showDetails":false},"486bf29a-582c-4419-b842-a70d60311591":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Lung inflammation in hyperoxia can be prevented by antichemokine treatment in newborn rats.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.162.6.9911020","authors":["Deng, H","Mason, S N","Auten, R L Jr"],"date":"2000//","keywords":["Acute Disease","Analysis of Variance","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Chemokine CXCL1","Chemokine CXCL2","*Chemokines, CXC/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","Chemokines, CXC/me [Metabolism]","*Chemotactic Factors/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","Chemotactic Factors/me [Metabolism]","Dose-Response Relationship, Drug","Growth Substances/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Hyperoxia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Immunohistochemistry","Infant, Newborn","*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Lung/ch [Chemistry]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Monokines/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","Monokines/me [Metabolism]","Neutrophils/me [Metabolism]","Pneumonia/et [Etiology]","Pneumonia/me [Metabolism]","*Pneumonia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Random Allocation","Rats","Time Factors"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine","volume":"162","number":"6","isbn":"1073-449X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11112157"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Hyperoxia may contribute to lung disease in newborns through effects on alveolar neutrophils which predominate in respiratory distress syndrome and other acute lung injuries. Neutrophil chemokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) regulate chemoattraction, and are elevated in tracheal aspirates of newborns who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Blockade of neutrophil chemokines may reduce hyperoxia-induced inflammatory lung injury and BPD. We therefore tested the hypothesis that hyperoxia contributes to elevations of rat neutrophil chemokines, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in newborn rat lung. Newborn rats were exposed to air or 95% O(2) for 8 d. CINC-1 and MIP-2 were measured in whole lung homogenates by ELISA. Newborn 95% O(2)-exposed animals were given anti-CINC-1 or anti-MIP-2, 1, 5, or 10 microg on Days 3 and 4 of 95% O(2) exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed after perfusion on day 6 to evaluate airway neutrophils, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured in perfused whole lung. Lungs were examined histologically and immunohistochemically for effects of 95% O(2) +/- antichemokine. CINC-1 and MIP-2 increased nearly tenfold by Day 8 95% O(2) treatment versus air control. CINC-1 and MIP-2 immunolabeling was increased in alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelium in 95% O(2). Anti-CINC-1 and anti-MIP-2 treatment at every dose reduced neutrophil number > 90% in BAL. Anti-CINC-1 10 microg reduced tissue MPO by 50%. Antichemokine treatment on days 3 and 4 prevented alveolar septal thickening and reduced chemokine immunolabeling on Day 6. Hyperoxia-induced neutrophil influx is mediated in part by CINC-1 and MIP-2 in newborn rats and can be partially prevented by treatment with anti-CINC-1 and anti-MIP-2.","group":"g1","id":"486bf29a-582c-4419-b842-a70d60311591","_showDetails":false},"202d64cd-3e40-4187-b575-b72c21eb0609":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"High-dose inhaled nitric oxide and hyperoxia increases lung collagen accumulation in piglets.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000014271","authors":["Ekekezie, I I","Thibeault, D W","Rezaeikhaligh, M H","Mabry, S M","Norberg, M","Reddy, G K","Youssef, J","Truog, W E"],"date":"2000//","keywords":["Administration, Inhalation","Albumins/me [Metabolism]","Animals","*Animals, Newborn/ph [Physiology]","Body Water/me [Metabolism]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","*Collagen/me [Metabolism]","Dose-Response Relationship, Drug","Hydroxyproline/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Matrix Metalloproteinases/me [Metabolism]","*Nitric Oxide/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Nitric Oxide/pd [Pharmacology]","Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Swine"],"journal":"Biology of the neonate","volume":"78","number":"3","isbn":"0006-3126","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11044769"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Nitric oxide (NO), a pro-oxidant gas, is used with hyperoxia (O(2)) to treat neonatal pulmonary hypertension and recently bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but great concerns remain regarding NO's potential toxicity. Based on reports that exposure to oxidant gases results in pulmonary extracellular matrix injury associated with elevated lavage fluid levels of extracellular matrix components, we hypothesized that inhaled NO with or without hyperoxia will have the same effect. We measured alveolar septal width, lung collagen content, lavage fluid hydroxyproline, hyaluronan and laminin levels in neonatal piglets after 5 days' exposure to room air (RA), RA + 50 ppm NO (RA + NO), O(2) (FiO(2) > 0.96) or O(2) + NO. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and MMP-2 mRNA were also measured. In recovery experiments, we measured lung collagen content in piglets exposed to RA + NO or O(2) + NO and then allowed to recover for 3 days. The results show that lung collagen increased 4-fold in the RA + NO piglets, the O(2) and O(2) + NO groups had only a 2-fold elevation relative to RA controls. Unlike the RA + NO piglets, the O(2) and O(2) + NO groups had more than 20-fold elevation in lung lavage fluid hydroxyproline compared to the RA group. O(2) and O(2) + NO also had increased lung MMP activity, extravascular water, and lavage fluid proteins. MMP-2 mRNA levels were unchanged. After 3 days' recovery in room air, the RA + NO groups' lung collagen had declined from 4-fold to 2-fold above the RA group values. The O(2) + NO group did not decline. Alveolar septal width increased significantly only in the O(2) and O(2) + NO groups. We conclude that 5 days' exposure to NO does not result in pulmonary matrix degradation but instead significantly increases lung collagen content. This effect appears potentially reversible. In contrast, hyperoxia exposure with or without NO results in pulmonary matrix degradation and increased lung collagen content. The observation that NO increased lung collagen content represents a new finding and suggests NO could potentially induce pulmonary fibrosis. Copyright 2000 S.

Dexamethasone is used in the postnatal treatment of very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates with BPD. To test the hypothesis that the vitamin A status is critical for the beneficial pulmonary response to dexamethasone, we performed a prospective cohort study in which we characterized the changes in plasma concentrations of vitamin A and retinol-binding protein (RBP) in response to dexamethasone, and correlated these changes with the pulmonary outcome., METHODS: VLBW neonates (birth weight <1350 g, gestational age <31 weeks, postnatal age >10 days), who had presumptive diagnosis of severe BPD and need for high ventilatory support (fraction of inspired oxygen >/=.6, mean airway pressure >/=7 cm H(2)O), were treated with a seven-day course of dexamethasone (.5 mg/kg/d x 2 days,.25 mg/kg/d x 2 days,.1 mg/kg/d x 3 days). Plasma concentrations of vitamin A and RBP were determined sequentially at baseline, and during and after dexamethasone treatment. Pulmonary response to dexamethasone was graded daily using a composite ventilation score. The changes in plasma vitamin A and RBP concentrations were compared between infants with a positive (beneficial) pulmonary response to dexamethasone and those with a negative response., RESULTS: Among 23 infants studied, 13 showed a positive pulmonary response to dexamethasone, as indicated by successful weaning from supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, whereas 10 showed a negative response. A significant, yet short-term, increase in plasma concentrations of both vitamin A and RBP was observed in most infants treated with dexamethasone. The plasma vitamin A and RBP responses to dexamethasone tended to be higher in infants with a positive pulmonary response than in those with a negative response. Accounting for gender, a vitamin A response with each 10.0 microg/dL increment in plasma vitamin A concentration was associated with a 60% increase in the odds favoring a positive pulmonary response to dexamethasone., CONCLUSION: Postnatal dexamethasone treatment in VLBW neonates with BPD induces a significant, yet short-term, increase in plasma concentrations of both vitamin A and RBP. This increase probably results from endogenous mobilization of vitamin A from the liver. Our data suggest that the beneficial pulmonary response to dexamethasone in infants with BPD is influenced, at least in part, by the vitamin A status, and that gender plays a role in this response.vitamin A, dexamethasone, bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"545fc986-b000-4e82-97fc-11d460a5ca8b","_showDetails":false},"c189252a-d922-4f3b-8210-041e8bb4f91f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2022>","title":"Risk factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation in neonates following gastrointestinal surgery.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/tp-22-14","authors":["Wang, Huanhuan","Gauda, Estelle B","Chiu, Priscilla P L","Moore, Aideen M"],"date":"2022//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","journal":"Translational pediatrics","volume":"11","number":"5","isbn":"2224-4336","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm7&NEWS=N&AN=35685067"],"address":"China","abstract":"Background: Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) should be avoided in neonates. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can facilitate weaning from MV but has risks for patients immediately following foregut surgery due to the potential risk of anastomotic leak. We evaluated the risk factors for prolonged MV following intestinal surgery in neonates., Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 253 neonates undergoing intestinal surgery in 2017-2018 to identify risk factors for prolonged MV, and determine the correlation between NIV and anastomotic leak in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit that performs the greatest number of neonatal surgeries in Ontario., Results: The most common diagnoses were necrotizing enterocolitis/spontaneous intestinal perforation (NEC/SIP) 21%, intestinal atresia 16%, esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula 14%, ano-rectal malformation 13%, malrotation/volvulus 11%, gastroschisis 9% and omphalocele 4%. The median (IQR) duration of MV post-surgery was 3 (1-8) days with 25.7 % (n=65) of neonates on MV for >7 days. Compared to infants on MV post-surgery for <=7 days, those with MV>7 days were of lower gestational age, birth weight and weight at surgery, but a higher proportion underwent stoma creation, had a longer duration of opioid administration and higher rates of moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality (P<0.05). Generalized linear regression analysis showed lower gestational age (GA) and longer opioid administration were associated with longer duration of MV (P<0.001), but indication for surgery, weight at surgery and stoma creation didn't correlate with longer duration of MV (P>0.05). Of the 122 patients handled by one-stage resection with primary anastomosis, 22.1% (n=27) received NIV with 74.1% (n=20) commenced on NIV after 7 days post-surgery, anastomotic leak was detected in 2.5 % (3/122) patients and didn't correlate with NIV., Conclusions: Lower GA and longer opioid administration were risk factors for prolonged MV in neonates following intestinal surgery. Further research is needed to investigate modifiable practices around pain assessment/ventilation in these patients, and the correlation between NIV and anastomotic leak.

Also the concentration of unidentified antioxidants was significantly lower in GOG. By day 10 the TRAP decreased substantially in both groups. However, from the components of TRAP, both ascorbate and the unidentified fraction decreased more in POG (p = 0.017 and 0.021, respectively). Furthermore in POG on day 10 urate concentration did not significantly differ from day 3 values. In conclusion, in preterm infants high TRAP was associated with high plasma uric acid concentration and a poor short-term prognosis.","group":"g1","id":"506d0c5e-85fc-4b38-a255-c85e36ce6f16","_showDetails":false},"f32bba72-6870-4756-9103-0e0e8b4c801c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Modulations in breathing patterns during intermittent feeding in term infants and preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0012162299001279","authors":["Craig, C M","Lee, D N","Freer, Y N","Laing, I A"],"date":"1999//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*Feeding Behavior/ph [Physiology]","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Oximetry/mt [Methods]","Oxygen Consumption","Respiration Disorders/co [Complications]","*Respiration Disorders/di [Diagnosis]","Severity of Illness Index","Sucking Behavior/ph [Physiology]","Time Factors"],"journal":"Developmental medicine and child neurology","volume":"41","number":"9","isbn":"0012-1622","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=10503920"],"address":"England","abstract":"As infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have difficulty maintaining adequate levels of oxygenation during rest, it was decided to investigate how the additional respiratory demands associated with nutritive feeding disrupt their breathing rates.

This unit serves a childhood population of about 3-4 million aged from 0-12 years., RESULTS: The proportion of children admitted to the ICU as a percentage of the general paediatric admission has increased from 1.5% in 1971 to 7% in 1995. During this period, 7580 children were admitted to the unit, an average of 303 cases per annum. The overall mortality rate was 35.44% (range 29.9 to 45.4%); over 90% of the children admitted were intubated and 80% required intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Common childhood vaccine preventable infections have declined substantially and have been replaced by HIV related syndromes, lower respiratory tract infections, metabolic disorders, septicaemia and hyaline membrane disease. The mean duration of ICU stay per survivor over the study period 1991-1995 was 13.891 days. Tetanus, septicaemia and HIV related diseases required the longest ICU stay per survivor (>20 days), while accidental injuries, neonatal apnoea and asthma required the shortest duration of ICU stay per survivor (<6 days); 23.9% of all deaths occurred in the first 24 h., CONCLUSION: The profile of diseases in children admitted to this PICU has changed considerably over 25 years. Some of these changes can be attributed to the shift in emphasis to primary health care, especially higher vaccination coverage rates. Profitable utilisation of limited ICU facilities would probably be enhanced by the use of outcome measures such as mortality and mean number of ICU days of stay per survivor.","group":"g1","id":"6622471b-36b0-403f-93c9-c6f80d512004","_showDetails":false},"e8b7b2a9-416a-47a2-9c69-9cd00c2a9db2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"The effects of IL-10 on proinflammatory cytokine expression (IL-1beta and IL-8) in hyaline membrane disease (HMD).","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/clin.1997.4510","authors":["Kwong, K Y","Jones, C A","Cayabyab, R","Lecart, C","Khuu, N","Rhandhawa, I","Hanley, J M","Ramanathan, R","deLemos, R A","Minoo, P"],"date":"1998//","keywords":["Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pd [Pharmacology]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cy [Cytology]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/im [Immunology]","Cells, Cultured","Gene Expression/de [Drug Effects]","Humans","Hyaline Membrane Disease/et [Etiology]","*Hyaline Membrane Disease/im [Immunology]","Hyaline Membrane Disease/th [Therapy]","In Vitro Techniques","Infant, Newborn","Inflammation Mediators/me [Metabolism]","Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein","*Interleukin-1/bi [Biosynthesis]","Interleukin-1/ge [Genetics]","Interleukin-10/bi [Biosynthesis]","Interleukin-10/ge [Genetics]","*Interleukin-10/pd [Pharmacology]","*Interleukin-8/bi [Biosynthesis]","Interleukin-8/ge [Genetics]","Lipopolysaccharides/pd [Pharmacology]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Recombinant Proteins/pd [Pharmacology]","Sialoglycoproteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Sialoglycoproteins/ge [Genetics]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/bi [Biosynthesis]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Clinical immunology and immunopathology","volume":"88","number":"1","isbn":"0090-1229","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=9683557"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Deficient expression of the counterregulatory cytokine IL-10 by lung inflammatory cells may facilitate chronic inflammation and the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease (HMD), in premature infants. To determine if pathways which regulate proinflammatory cytokines in response to human recombinant IL-10 (rIL-10) were functional in the lungs of these neonates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-derived lung inflammatory cells (predominantly macrophages and neutrophils) from infants with HMD were cultured in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increasing concentrations of (rIL-10). The expression of IL-1beta and IL-8 protein was assessed 24 h later. IL-10 protein was also measured from the BAL aspirates of these newborns at 4-day intervals over the first month of life. In cell culture IL-1beta expression was inhibited by rIL-10 in a dose-dependent fashion while IL-8 expression was inhibited by higher concentrations of rIL-10. IL-10 protein was undetectable from BAL fluid of the premature infants sampled over 28 days. The results demonstrate that lung inflammatory cells, which do not express IL-10 in vivo, are capable of responding to rIL-10 in cell culture with reduction of IL-1beta and IL-8 expression. These data support the rationale for the development of rIL-10 as a potential anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of HMD.

To investigate the possible role of nitric oxide-derived oxidants such as peroxynitrite in the etiology of BPD, we measured levels of plasma 3-nitrotyrosine, which is produced by the reaction of peroxynitrite with proteins., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten premature infants who developed BPD, defined as requiring supplemental oxygen beyond 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, were identified retrospectively from a group of subjects enrolled in a clinical trial of antenatal therapy. Serial plasma samples had been collected on these infants during the first month of life as part of the trial. Sixteen comparison premature infants were identified from the same population: 5 had no lung disease, 6 had respiratory distress syndrome that resolved, and 5 had residual lung disease at 28 days of life that resolved by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Plasma 3-nitrotyrosine levels were measured using a solid phase immunoradiochemical method., RESULTS: All 3-nitrotyrosine values in infants without BPD were <0.25 ng/mg protein, and levels did not change with postnatal age. Plasma 3-nitrotyrosine concentrations were significantly higher in infants with BPD, increasing approximately fourfold during the first month of life. For the 20 infants who had blood samples available at 28 days of life, plasma 3-nitrotyrosine levels correlated with the fraction of inspired oxygen that the infant was receiving (r = 0.7)., CONCLUSION: Plasma 3-nitrotyrosine content is increased during the first month of life in infants who develop BPD. This suggests that peroxynitrite-mediated oxidant stress may contribute to the development of this disease in premature infants and that 3-nitrotyrosine may be useful as an early plasma indicator of infants at risk for developing BPD.","group":"g1","id":"07208cc5-3360-445d-bb6c-4ec89f9747ab","_showDetails":false},"a213bd85-fe90-4223-9e03-51c904e8c3e5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Health and developmental outcomes at 18 months in very preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.101.5.856","authors":["Gregoire, M C","Lefebvre, F","Glorieux, J"],"date":"1998//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/px [Psychology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","*Child Development","Developmental Disabilities/et [Etiology]","Follow-Up Studies","Gestational Age","Health Status","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature/gd [Growth & Development]","*Infant, Premature","Logistic Models"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"101","number":"5","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=9565414"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether very preterm infants who are oxygen-dependent at 28 days of life but not at 36 weeks' gestational age are at high risk of morbidities at 18 months., POPULATION: A total of 217 infants born in a tertiary care center at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation in 1987 to 1992, classified into three groups: neonatal comparison group, O2 <28 days of life (n = 76); bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-1, O2 >/=28 days but not at 36 weeks' gestational age (n = 48); and BPD-2, O2 >/=36 weeks (n = 93)., OUTCOME MEASURES: Growth, persistent respiratory problems (asthma, tracheostomy, home oxygen therapy), surgery, hospitalizations, and neurodevelopmental impairments., RESULTS: Among the three groups, no differences were found in weight, height, head circumference, or total number of days of rehospitalizations for any causes, or in rate of rehospitalizations to the intensive care unit, persistent respiratory problems, cerebral palsy, or sensory impairment.

Stress-related increases in airway smooth muscle (ASM) quantity are reflected in vitro where cultured ASM cells respond to cyclic deformational strain with increased proliferation, cell reorientation, protein production, stress fibers, and focal adhesions. To understand the mechanisms of mechanical signaling in ASM cells, we investigated whether strain increased tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-related proteins. ASM cells were grown to confluence on collagen type I and subjected to 30 min of cyclic deformation strain (2 s of 25% deformation of the substratum, 2 s relaxation) and compared at various time points with identical cells not subjected to strain for phosphotyrosine content of three focal adhesion-concentrated proteins (pp125FAK, paxillin, and talin) by Western blotting. Strain caused a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK and paxillin. Tyrosine phosphorylation decreased by 4 h in pp125FAK after discontinuing strain but remained elevated in paxillin at 24 h. Increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of talin were not found. In separate studies, when cells were strained in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin A), strain-induced reorientation and elongation were inhibited. Mechanochemical signal transduction appears to mediate cell morphologic changes through quantitative and possibly qualitative changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of adhesion-related proteins.","group":"g1","id":"e25c61ec-f0bd-4de2-9019-69e1be0e4af7","_showDetails":false},"29dcd787-6aea-4182-8b4e-8893f04fba27":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Growth and growth factors in premature infants receiving dexamethasone for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-994330","authors":["Skinner, A M","Battin, M","Solimano, A","Daaboul, J","Kitson, H F"],"date":"1997//","keywords":["Body Constitution","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Dexamethasone/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Dexamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Energy Intake","Glucocorticoids/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Glucocorticoids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Humans","Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Newborn, Diseases/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Infant, Premature/gd [Growth & Development]","Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/bl [Blood]","Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/de [Drug Effects]","Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/de [Drug Effects]","Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/me [Metabolism]","Linear Models","Time Factors","Weight Gain/de [Drug Effects]","Weight Gain/ph [Physiology]"],"journal":"American journal of perinatology","volume":"14","number":"9","isbn":"0735-1631","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=9394163"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Physical growth and the serum growth factors, insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its binding protein (IGFBP3) were measured weekly during dexamethasone treatment and for 3 weeks after stopping therapy in 10 ventilated babies [median (range) birth weight 860 g (640-1210); median (range) gestational age 26 weeks (24-29)] with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

To test this theory, we compared the small airway morphology of 21-d-old rats subsequently exposed to 2 wk of > 95% O2 (Ox; n = 12) with that of normoxic controls (Con; n = 12). In paraffin-embedded sections, airways < 1500 microns cut in cross-section were analyzed using light microscopy and image analysis software. The degree of epithelial and smooth muscle hyperplasia was assessed with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PNEC content was assessed via immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the number of solitary PNEC (PNECsol) and PNEC clusters (neuroepithelial bodies, NEB) counted per section.

According to the severity of BPD, the patients were divided into mild, moderate and severe BPD groups, and the non-BPD group was the control group. Tracheal aspirates (TA) were obtained at intubation and on day 7 after birth. The bacterium in the aspirates were sequenced by 16S rRNA, and the metabolomics of the aspirates were identified by high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS). The correlation between the differential metabolite and differential bacteria was investigated using Pearson's correlation coefficient corrected for gestational age and birth weight and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases., Results: There were significant differences in the diversity and composition of airway microbiome and metabolome between severe, moderate and mild BPD and non-BPD premature infants. At birth (day 1), the difference was more pronounced than at day 7. The diversity of airway microbial community decreased, the abundance of Stenotrophomonas increased, and the increased level of sn-glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine was positively correlated with the severity of BPD. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of Stenotrophomonas and the level of sn-glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine., Conclusion: Decreased diversity of the airway microbiome, increased abundance of Stenotrophomonas, and increased level of sn-glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine may have potential as biomarkers for BPD. The occurrence and severity of BPD are closely related to Stenotrophomonas, which may influence the composition of the lower airway microbiome through its metabolite sn-glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine, and may be the triggering factor of the disease. The causal relationship needs further study.

Methods. Thirty-three infants (700 to 1300 g) were randomized and blindly received saline, 2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg rhSOD IT within 2 hours of surfactant administration. Infants were treated every 48 hours (as long as endotracheal intubation was required) up to 7 doses. Serial blood and urine studies, chest radiographs, neurosonograms, SOD concentration and activity measurements, and tracheal aspirate (TA) inflammatory markers were assessed throughout the 28-day study., RESULTS: SOD concentrations in serum (0.1 [0.05/0.15] microg/mL-geometric mean with lower/upper confidence intervals), tracheal aspirates (TA) (0.2 [0.1/0.3] microg/mL) and urine (0.3 [0.2/0.4] microg/mL) were similar at baseline in all 3 groups and did not change significantly in the placebo group. In the rhSOD treatment groups, SOD concentrations were increased on day 3 and did not change significantly thereafter over the 14-day dosing period (also measured on days 5, 7, and 13). SOD concentrations averaged 0.4 [0.3/0.5] microg/mL in serum, 0.8 [0.6/1.2] microg/mL in TA and 1.1 [1.0/1.3] microg/mL in urine for the low-dose group and 0.6 [0.5/0.7] microg/mL in serum, 1.1 [0.9/1.5] microg/mL in TA, and 2.2 [1.6/2.9] microg/mL in urine for the high-dose group over the 14-day dosing period. Enzyme activity directly correlated with SOD concentration and rhSOD was active even when excreted in urine. TA markers of acute lung injury (neutrophil chemotactic activity, albumin concentration) were lower in the rhSOD agroups compared with placebo. No significant differences in any clinical outcome variable were noted between groups., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that multiple IT doses of rhSOD increase the concentration and activity of the enzyme in serum, TA and urine, reduce TA lung injury markers and are well-tolerated. Further clinical trials examining the efficacy of rhSOD in the prevention of BPD are warranted.","group":"g1","id":"781fe2f5-abec-4fc4-a91e-968b3c042474","_showDetails":false},"12e72581-254c-4f19-9465-2c294f2dd8cf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Ultrasound predictors of neonatal outcome in intrauterine growth restriction.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-994429","authors":["Craigo, S D","Beach, M L","Harvey-Wilkes, K B","D'Alton, M E"],"date":"1996//","keywords":["Adolescent","Adult","Female","*Fetal Growth Retardation/dg [Diagnostic Imaging]","Fetal Growth Retardation/ep [Epidemiology]","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant Mortality","Infant, Newborn","Logistic Models","Predictive Value of Tests","Pregnancy","*Pregnancy Outcome/ep [Epidemiology]","Retrospective Studies","Ultrasonography, Doppler","*Ultrasonography, Prenatal","Umbilical Arteries/dg [Diagnostic Imaging]"],"journal":"American journal of perinatology","volume":"13","number":"8","isbn":"0735-1631","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=8989476"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Our purpose was to assess the value of commonly performed ultrasound parameters in predicting neonatal outcome of fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).

At all ages from birth, lavage supernatants demonstrated highly significant increase over controls of the beta-chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, although not of regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1 beta, and of elastase/alpha-1 antitrypsin.

Diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by standard criteria was recorded at 30 days of life. Various biochemical analyses related to pulmonary oxyradical stress were determined on endotracheal tube aspirates and were normalized according to the magnitude of serum/aspirate urea ratios.

Automated Edman degradation in a gas-phase sequencer showed the major N-terminus of the human low molecular weight protein to be Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-Tyr-Cys-Trp-Leu-Cys-Arg-Ala-Leu-. Because of the N-terminal phenylalanine, the surfactant protein was designated SPL(Phe). Antiserum generated against hydrophobic surfactant protein(s) from bovine pulmonary surfactant recognized protein of Mr 6000-14,000 in immunoblot analysis and was used to screen a lambda gt11 expression library constructed from adult human lung poly(A)+ RNA. This resulted in identification of a 1.4-kilobase cDNA clone that was shown to encode the N-terminus of the surfactant polypeptide SPL(Phe) (Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-) within an open reading frame for a larger protein. Expression of a fused beta-galactosidase-SPL(Phe) gene in Escherichia coli yielded an immunoreactive Mr 34,000 fusion peptide. Hybrid-arrested translation with this cDNA and immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translation products of human poly(A)+ RNA with a surfactant polyclonal antibody resulted in identification of a Mr 40,000 precursor protein. Blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated RNA from human lung detected a 2.0-kilobase RNA that was more abundant in adult lung than in fetal lung. The larger RNA and translation product indicates that SPL(Phe) is derived by proteolysis of a large polypeptide precursor. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein, beginning Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro-Leu-Pro-Try-, comprises a hydrophobic peptide that is a major protein component of surfactant lipid extracts used successfully to treat hyaline membrane disease in newborn infants. These proteins, and specifically SPL(Phe), may therefore be useful for synthesis of replacement surfactants for treatment of hyaline membrane disease in newborn infants or of other surfactant-deficient states.","group":"g1","id":"dfa7aa7e-c158-4ddf-9373-32b898bfac87","_showDetails":false},"0abe0c1f-02ab-4bd4-9b7e-b4e196806b68":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2022>","title":"The Consensus Definition of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Is an Adequate Predictor of Lung Function at Preschool Age.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.830035","authors":["Rite, Segundo","Martin de Vicente, Carlos","Garcia-Iniguez, Juan P","Couce, Maria L","Samper, Maria P","Montaner, Alicia","Ruiz de la Cuesta, Carmen"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20220204//","journal":"Frontiers in pediatrics","volume":"10","isbn":"2296-2360","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm7&NEWS=N&AN=35186811"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent attempts to refine the definition bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have based its predictive capacity on respiratory outcome in the first 2 years of life, eliminating the pre-existing requirement of 28 days of oxygen therapy prior to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). The objective of this study was to assess the utility of the 2001 consensus definition in predicting impaired lung function at preschool age., METHODS: This cohort study included children aged 4-6 years old who were born at gestational age (GA) <32 weeks or bodyweight <1500 g. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess differences in antenatal and neonatal variables between BPD and non-BPD children. All participants underwent incentive spirometry. Lung function parameters were contrasted with the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI-2012) reference equations and, together with antenatal and neonatal variables, compared among the different subgroups (no BPD, mild BPD, and moderate-to-severe BPD). A multivariate model was generated to identify independent risk factors for impaired lung function., RESULTS: GA, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, and late sepsis were independent risk factors for the development of BPD. A total of 119 children underwent incentive spirometry. All lung function parameters were significantly altered relative to reference values. Greater impairment of lung function was observed in the mild BPD vs. the no BPD group (forced expiratory volume in the first 0.75 seconds [FEV0.75]: -1.18 +/- 0.80 vs. -0.55 +/- 1.13; p = 0.010), but no difference in forced vital capacity (FVC) was observed (-0.32 +/- 0.90 vs. -0.18 +/- 1; p = 0.534). The moderate-to-severe BPD group exhibited the most severe FEV0.75 reduction (FEV0.75: -2.63 +/- 1.18 vs. -0.72 +/- 1.08; p = 0.000) and was the only condition with FVC impairment (FVC: -1.82 +/- 1.12 vs. -0.22 +/- 0.87; p = 0.000). The multivariate analysis identified a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe BPD as an independent risk factor for lung function impairment., CONCLUSION: The 2001 consensus definition of BPD has adequate predictive capacity for lung function measured by spirometry at 4-6 years of age. Moderate-to-severe BPD was the best predictor of respiratory impairment. Children with mild BPD showed greater alteration of FEV0.75 than those without BPD.

Using previously banked samples, we applied our sample-sparing, high-throughput proteomics technology to compare OS and TA proteomes in infants born <32 weeks admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) (Cohort 1; n = 23 infants). In a separate similar cohort, we mapped the BPD-associated changes in the OS proteome (Cohort 2; n = 17 infants including 8 with BPD)., RESULTS: In samples collected during the first month of life, we identified 607 proteins unique to OS, 327 proteins unique to TA, and 687 overlapping proteins belonging to pathways involved in immune effector processes, neutrophil degranulation, leukocyte mediated immunity, and metabolic processes. Furthermore, we identified 37 OS proteins that showed significantly differential abundance between BPD cases and controls: 13 were associated with metabolic and immune dysregulation, 10 of which (eg, SERPINC1, CSTA, BPI) have been linked to BPD or other prematurity-related lung disease based on blood or TA investigations, but not OS., CONCLUSIONS: OS are a noninvasive, easily accessible alternative to TA and amenable to high-throughput proteomic analysis in preterm newborns.

Here, we use a rat model to assess the isolated effects of postnatal nutrition on lung structural development without concomitant lung injury. We hypothesize that postnatal growth restriction (PGR) impairs lung structure and function, critical mediators of lung development, and fatty acid profiles at postnatal day 21 in the rat. Rat pups were cross-fostered at birth to rat dams with litter sizes of 8 (control) or 16 (PGR). Lung structure and function, as well as serum and lung tissue fatty acids, and lung molecular mediators of development, were measured. Male and female PGR rat pups had thicker airspace walls, decreased lung compliance, and increased tissue damping. Male rats also had increased lung elastance, increased lung elastin protein abundance, and lysol oxidase expression, and increased elastic fiber deposition. Female rat lungs had increased conducting airway resistance and reduced levels of docosahexaenoic acid in lung tissue. We conclude that PGR impairs lung structure and function in both male and female rats, with sex-divergent changes in lung molecular mediators of development.

The C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CXCL17) belongs to the chemokine family that plays important roles in various processes, but the function in BPD is unknown. Elevated serum CXCL17 levels were observed in human premature infants with hyperoxia-induced lung injury, suggesting that CXCL17 might be involved in BPD. To further validate our speculation, studies were conducted in a hyperoxia-induced lung injury mouse model and primary murine alveolar epithelial cells Type II (T2AEC) cells exposed to hyperoxia. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to validate CXCL17 expression in newborn mice. Hyperoxia exposure-induced lung injury was determined by assessing the lung wet-weight/dry-weight ratio and histological changes. Oxidative stress and inflammatory factors were examined by ELISA assay and RT-qPCR. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was evaluated by DHE staining. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining and western blot. The results showed that hyperoxia exposure increased CXCL17 levels in newborn mice pups. Hyperoxia exposure increased lung wet-weight/dry-weight ratio, increased alveolar diameter and enlarged alveoli, and reduced surfactant protein C expression. However, recombinant CXCL17 (rCXCL17) treatment alleviated hyperoxia-induced lung injury. rCXCL17 treatment inhibited hyperoxia-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in neonatal mice. These results were further verified in T2AEC cells. Additionally, rCXCL17 treatment activated the AKT pathway, which is a protective pathway in BPD. Collectively, rCXCL17 alleviates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal mice by activating the AKT pathway, indicating that CXCL17 may be a promising target for BPD therapy. Copyright © 2023.

All methods of administration (intravenous, intramuscular, and oral) were eligible. We did not include studies where magnesium sulphate was used with the primary aim of preterm labour tocolysis, or the prevention and/or treatment of eclampsia., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and trustworthiness. Dichotomous data were presented as summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and continuous data were presented as mean differences with 95% CI. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach., MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs (5917 women and their 6759 fetuses alive at randomisation). All RCTs were conducted in high-income countries. The RCTs compared magnesium sulphate with placebo in women at risk of preterm birth at less than 34 weeks' gestation; however, treatment regimens and inclusion/exclusion criteria varied. Though the RCTs were at an overall low risk of bias, the certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low, due to concerns regarding study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency. Primary outcomes for infants/children: Up to two years' corrected age, magnesium sulphate compared with placebo reduced cerebral palsy (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.89; 6 RCTs, 6107 children; number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 60, 95% CI 41 to 158) and death or cerebral palsy (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; 6 RCTs, 6481 children; NNTB 56, 95% CI 32 to 363) (both high-certainty evidence). Magnesium sulphate probably resulted in little to no difference in death (fetal, neonatal, or later) (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.13; 6 RCTs, 6759 children); major neurodevelopmental disability (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.44; 1 RCT, 987 children); or death or major neurodevelopmental disability (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 3 RCTs, 4279 children) (all moderate-certainty evidence). At early school age, magnesium sulphate may have resulted in little to no difference in death (fetal, neonatal, or later) (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.02; 2 RCTs, 1758 children); cerebral palsy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.41; 2 RCTs, 1038 children); death or cerebral palsy (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.20; 1 RCT, 503 children); and death or major neurodevelopmental disability (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 503 children) (all low-certainty evidence). Magnesium sulphate may also have resulted in little to no difference in major neurodevelopmental disability, but the evidence is very uncertain (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.62; 2 RCTs, 940 children; very low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes for infants/children: Magnesium sulphate probably reduced severe intraventricular haemorrhage (grade 3 or 4) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98; 5 RCTs, 5885 infants; NNTB 92, 95% CI 55 to 1102; moderate-certainty evidence) and may have resulted in little to no difference in chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10; 5 RCTs, 6689 infants; low-certainty evidence). Primary outcomes for women: Magnesium sulphate may have resulted in little or no difference in severe maternal outcomes potentially related to treatment (death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest) (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.92; 4 RCTs, 5300 women; low-certainty evidence). However, magnesium sulphate probably increased maternal adverse effects severe enough to stop treatment (average RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.88 to 5.48; 3 RCTs, 4736 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes for women: Magnesium sulphate probably resulted in little to no difference in caesarean section (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; 5 RCTs, 5861 women) and postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.09; 2 RCTs, 2495 women) (both moderate-certainty evidence). Breastfeeding at hospital discharge and women's views of treatment were not reported., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The currently available evidence indicates that magnesium sulphate for women at risk of preterm birth for neuroprotection of the fetus, compared with placebo, reduces cerebral palsy, and death or cerebral palsy, in children up to two years' corrected age, and probably reduces severe intraventricular haemorrhage for infants. Magnesium sulphate may result in little to no difference in outcomes in children at school age. While magnesium sulphate may result in little to no difference in severe maternal outcomes (death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest), it probably increases maternal adverse effects severe enough to stop treatment. Further research is needed on the longer-term benefits and harms for children, into adolescence and adulthood. Additional studies to determine variation in effects by characteristics of women treated and magnesium sulphate regimens used, along with the generalisability of findings to low- and middle-income countries, should be considered.

The cardiovascular and renal systems are most affected in Fabry patients and may require heart or kidney transplants in the late stages of the disease depending on severity of manifestations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has proven to delay progression of Fabry disease considerably, especially when started early in life. Current research has shown that individuals who have received cardiac or renal transplants or are currently on dialysis have the greatest probability of developing severe manifestations of COVID-19. It has also been shown that people who contract COVID-19 experience a rapid increase in cytokine levels which can lead to a prothrombotic state and have a greater risk in the presence of comorbidities. A history of cardiac or renal transplants as well as the naturally elevated cytokine levels in Fabry disease make it likely that COVID-19 could have a greater impact on the health of these patients. We report the case of a 67-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, history of kidney transplant, and Fabry disease treated late in progression of the disease first with agalsidase beta ERT, then oral migalastat who developed severe manifestations of COVID-19. The autopsy findings showed acute and organizing hyaline membrane disease consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and secondary invasive bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with cavitary lesion formation. The sections of the heart showed scattered subendocardial fibrosis, and the transplanted kidneys showed thyroidization and interstitial nephritis potentially secondary to COVID-19, in addition to his long-standing renal disease. This case report serves to chronicle complications in a complex patient with late stage Fabry disease and multiple COVID-19 related complications who succumbed from respiratory failure despite the advanced management for the COVID-19 infection.

Premature infants often require supplemental oxygen, a known risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been implicated in hyperoxic lung injury. We hypothesize that prenatal PAH exposure exacerbates oxygen-mediated lung injury in neonatal mice, and that this effect is differentially altered in mice lacking the gene for (Cyp)1a1, 1a2, or 1b1. Timed pregnant wild type (WT) (C57BL/6J) mice were orally administered a PAH mixture of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) or the vehicle corn oil (CO) once daily on gestational days 16-19, and the dose response on postnatal lung injury was examined. In addition, timed pregnant mice with one of four genotypes, WT, Cyp1a1-null, Cyp1a2-null, and Cyp1b1-null, were treated orally with CO or PAH on gestational days 16-19 and exposed to hyperoxia or room air for 14 days. Lung injury was assessed on PND15 by radial alveolar count (RAC) and mean linear intercept (MLI) Gene expression of DNA repair genes in lung and liver were measured. Results showed that neonatal hyperoxic lung injury is augmented by prenatal PAH exposure in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was differentially altered in the Cyp-null mice, with Cyp1a2-null showing the greatest extent of lung injury. We concluded that newborn mice exposed to PAH in utero had more significant lung injury in response to hyperoxia than non-PAH exposed pups, and that CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are protective against lung injury while CYP1B1 augments lung injury.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have shown promise in repairing injury in animal BPD models. Evidence suggests they exert their effects via paracrine mechanisms. We aim herein to assess the effectiveness of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from hiPSCs and their alveolar progenies (diPSCs) in attenuating hyperoxic injury in a preterm lung explant model., METHODS: Murine lung lobes were harvested on embryonic day 17.5 and maintained in air-liquid interface. Following exposure to 95% O2 for 24 h, media was supplemented with 5 x 106 particles/mL of EVs isolated from hiPSCs or diPSCs by size-exclusion chromatography. On day 3, explants were assessed using Hematoxylin-Eosin staining with mean linear intercept (MLI) measurements, immunohistochemistry, VEGFa and antioxidant gene expression. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA and Multiple Comparison Test. EV proteomic profiling was performed, and annotations focused on alveolarization and angiogenesis signaling pathways, as well as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and regenerative pathways., RESULTS: Exposure of fetal lung explants to hyperoxia induced airspace enlargement, increased MLI, upregulation of anti-oxidants Prdx5 and Nfe2l2 with decreased VEGFa expression. Treatment with hiPSC-EVs improved parenchymal histologic changes. No overt changes in vasculature structure were observed on immunohistochemistry in our in vitro model. However, VEGFa and anti-oxidant genes were upregulated with diPSC-EVs, suggesting a pro-angiogenic and cytoprotective potential. EV proteomic analysis provided new insights in regard to potential pathways influencing lung regeneration., CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept in vitro study reveals a potential role for hiPSC- and diPSC-EVs in attenuating lung changes associated with prematurity and oxygen exposure. Our findings pave the way for a novel cell free approach to prevent and/or treat BPD, and ultimately reduce the global burden of the disease. Copyright © 2024.

The primary comparison was the difference in fluid balance between the first and third 24 hours of furosemide exposure. We fit a general linear model for within-subject repeated measures of fluid balance over time, with thiazide co-administration as an interaction variable. Secondary analyses included an evaluation of weight trajectories over time., RESULTS: In 83 infants, median fluid balance ranged between + 43.6 and + 52.7 ml/kg/d in the 3 days prior to furosemide exposure. Fluid balance decreased to a median of + 29.1 ml/kg/d in the first 24 hours after furosemide, but then increased to +47.5 ml/kg/d by the third 24-hour interval, consistent with tolerance (P < .001). Thiazides did not modify the change in fluid balance during furosemide exposure for any time-period. Weight decreased significantly in the first 24 hours after furosemide and increased thereafter (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: The net fluid balance response to furosemide decreases rapidly during repeated-dose exposures in infants with BPD, consistent with diuretic tolerance.

Multivariate logistic regression was applied to model the associations between VEGF polymorphisms and ROP susceptibility, severity, and premature clinicopathologic characteristics., Results: A total of 334 patients were included and categorized into three groups: those without ROP, those with mild ROP (i.e., ROP not requiring treatment), and those with severe ROP (i.e., ROP for whom treatment was indicated).

HRQOL is assessed at enrollment by 3 PROMIS questionnaires, Parent Proxy Scale-Global Health 7, Parent Proxy Psychological Stress Experiences-Short Form, and the Parent Proxy Profile-Profile-25. PROMIS data were tested for significant deviation from the standardized T-Score references for normative populations of children., RESULTS: Eighty-nine subjects enrolled in the AERO-BPD study had complete outcome data for HRQOL.

Across all domains, school-aged children with BPD reported similar or slightly better outcomes than the reference sample. Statistically significant findings of lower depression (P < .0001), fatigue (P < .0001), and pain (P < .0001) scores were found; there was no difference in psychological stress experiences (P = .87), global health (P = .06), anxiety (P = .08), relationships (P = .80), and mobility (P = .59) domains., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that children with BPD may have less depression, fatigue, and pain HRQL than the general population.

However, the potential of m6A in neonatal Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the roles of METTL3 in BPD., METHODS: BPD models were established by hyperoxia in vivo and in vitro. Histological analysis was determined using HE staining. Gene expression was determined using Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. The release of IL-1beta and IL-18 was detected using ELISA. The m6A sites of ATG8 were predicted by SCRAPM and verified by MeRIP assay. The location of GSDMD and ATG8 was determined by FISH assay. The interaction between ATG8 and GSDMD was detected using Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Cell pyroptosis was determined using flow cytometry and TUNEL assays., RESULTS: METTL3 was overexpressed in BPD, which was accompanied by an increase in m6A levels. Interestingly, METTL3 suppressed hyperoxia-mediated damage and pyroptosis in BEAS-2B cells and promoted cell autophagy. METTL3-mediated m6A modification of ATG8 suppressed its expression and disrupted the interaction between ATG8 and GSDMD. However, autophagy inhibition induced pyroptosis in BEAS-2B cells. In vivo assays showed that METTL3-mediated autophagy inhibition induced a decrease in the radial alveolar count and an increase in the mean linear intercept and promoted cell pyroptosis., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, METTL3-mediated cell pyroptosis promotes BPD by regulating the m6A modification of ATG8. This may provide new insight into the development of BPD. Copyright © 2023 HCFMUSP. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Using a random number table, the PBMCs were randomly assigned to each of the following groups: the control group, air + OM group, hyperoxia group, and hyperoxia + OM group. After 48 h of in vitro modeling and culture, PBMCs and the culture medium of each group were collected. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to examine ROS levels in PBMCs. A full-spectrum spectrophotometer was used to examine malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the culture medium.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of a subgroup of school-aged participants enrolled in the Air quality, Environment, and Respiratory Outcomes in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) study, who performed same-day paired coached baseline spirometry measurements from the Pneumotrac and MIR devices. Proportion of successful tests was estimated for each device and compared using McNemar's test. Correlation between devices forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was analyzed by Lin's concordance correlation, and Bland-Altman plots were generated. Results: Twenty-one participants with history of BPD completed home spirometry maneuvers on both devices. The mean age of participants was 8.7 years. The mean FEV1 and FVC measurement was 81% predicted and 90.4% predicted, respectively. The proportion of acceptable tests appeared higher using Pneumotrac (81%) than when using MIR (67%), although without evidence of discordance (P = 0.317). Among subjects with successful tests on both devices, Lin's concordance correlation demonstrated moderate agreement (FEV1 r = 0.955, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-0.98; FVC r = 0.971, CI: 0.91-0.99). The mean difference in FEV1 between Pneumotrac and MIR was 0.079 L (95% limits of agreement were -0.141 to 0.298 L) and FVC was 0.075 L (95% limits of agreement were -0.171 to 0.322 L). These were relatively small and without evidence of systematic or volume-dependent bias. Conclusions: Utilizing turbine spirometers may be a promising and feasible way to perform pulmonary function testing for field research in children.","group":"g1","id":"c2238b91-146c-44b5-aa84-12e4a3c85d1e","_showDetails":false},"a71bf3b3-d4b6-4ba5-abc0-3e3464e96e8c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2021>","title":"Effect of the Notch4/Dll4 signaling pathway in early gestational intrauterine infection on lung development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10404","authors":["Zhan, Canyang","Sun, Yi","Pan, Jiarong","Chen, Lihua","Yuan, Tianming"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210708//","journal":"Experimental and therapeutic medicine","volume":"22","number":"3","isbn":"1792-0981","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm6&NEWS=N&AN=34335914"],"address":"Greece","abstract":"Intrauterine infection is an important risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is characterized by arrested lung alveolarization and impaired pulmonary vascularization. The Notch4 signaling pathway is a key regulator of vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. Therefore, the presents study investigated the expression of Notch4, delta-like canonical Notch ligand 4 (Dll4) and related factors in an in vivo rat model and in rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) in vitro, to study the mechanisms by which intrauterine infection affects rat lung development. A rat model of intrauterine infection was established by endocervical inoculation with Escherichia scoli on embryonic day 15. The date of birth was counted as postnatal day 0 (P0). Then, the lung tissues were collected from pups at days P3-P14. The expression of Notch4, Dll4 and related factors was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. In addition, the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT was used to examine the effect of Notch4 signaling on PMVECs. Intrauterine E. coli infection impaired normal lung development, as indicated by decreased microvessel density, fewer alveoli, fewer secondary septa, and larger alveoli compared with the control group. Furthermore, Notch4, Dll4 and NF-kappaB levels were significantly increased in the E. coli-infected group at P3 compared with the control group. Similarly, the mRNA expression levels of fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1, a VEGF receptor) were significantly increased in the E. coli-infected group at P3 and P7. In PMVECs, the inhibition of Notch4 signaling contributed to decreases in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of VEGF and its receptors. Furthermore, the inhibition of Notch4/Dll4 signaling accelerated cell proliferation and decreased the apoptosis rate of LPS-induced PMVECs. LPS-induced NF-kappaB expression in PMVECs was also attenuated by the Notch4/Dll4 inhibitor. In conclusion, intrauterine E. coli infection impaired normal lung development, possibly through Notch4/Dll4 signaling and effects on VEGF and its receptors.

Clinical studies have confirmed that human milk has an important nutritional role for children with BPD, therefore, dentification of beneficial components in human milk that prevent BPD is urgently needed. Our previous work showed that human milk exosomes (HM-Exos) could inhibit apoptosis of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AT II), and the circular RNA (circRNA)-circABPD1 were highly expressed in preterm colostrum milk exosomes. Exosomes transport circRNAs that are stable and may exert anti-inflammatory and immune effects attracted the attention of researchers, but the role and mechanism of human milk exosome-derived circABPD1 in BPD remains unclear. Here, we constructed BPD in vivo and in vitro models through exposure to hyperoxia, verified the effect of circABPD1 and revealed its mechanism through rescue experiments. We found that circABPD1 had circRNA properties, and overexpression of circABPD1 could improve reduced alveolar number, enlarged the alveolar linear intercept in vivo models of BPD, promote cell proliferation, reduce oxidative stress levels and alleviate lung epithelial cell damage in vivo and in vitro models. Mechanistically, circABPD1 targets miR-330-3p and regulates the expression of HIF1alpha. These results suggest that circABPD1 can improve the pathologoical changes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, promote cell proliferation, inhibit oxidative stress level, and alleviate lung injury by targeting the miR-330-3p/HIF1alpha axis, which provides a new idea for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Artesunate exhibits excellent anti-inflammatory in lung injury caused by various factors. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the artesunate on hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal mice and its mechanism. A BPD model of hyperoxic lung injury in neonatal mice was established after hyperoxia (75% oxygen) exposure for 14 days, and part of the mice received intraperitoneal injections of the artesunate. H&E staining was used to observe the pathology of lung tissue, and the degree of oxidative stress in the lung tissue was determined by commercial kits. The levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and lung tissues of neonatal mice were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunohistochemical experiments were performed to further evaluate the expression of IL-1beta. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the mRNA level of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The western blot assay was used to measure the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kappaB pathway-related proteins. Artesunate ameliorated weight loss and lung tissue injury in neonatal mice induced by hyperoxia. The level of malondialdehyde was decreased, while the activity of superoxide dismutase and the level of glutathione increased after artesunate treatment. Artesunate reduced the level of inflammation cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta in the serum and lung. Moreover, artesunate inhibited the mRNA expression and protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, as well as the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha. Our findings suggest that artesunate treatment can attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung injury in BPD neonatal mice by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB pathway.

It is unclear whether the use of bubble CPAP versus other pressure sources is associated with lower rates of CPAP treatment failure, or mortality and other morbidity. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of bubble CPAP versus other pressure sources (mechanical ventilators or Infant Flow Driver) for reducing treatment failure and associated morbidity and mortality in newborn preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2023, Issue 1); MEDLINE (1946 to 6 January 2023), Embase (1974 to 6 January 2023), Maternity & Infant Care Database (1971 to 6 January 2023), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1982 to 6 January 2023). We searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing bubble CPAP with other pressure sources (mechanical ventilators or Infant Flow Driver) for the delivery of nasal CPAP to preterm infants., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors separately evaluated trial quality, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and mean difference. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for effects on treatment failure, all-cause mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment, pneumothorax, moderate-severe nasal trauma, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia., MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 trials involving a total of 1437 infants. All trials were small (median number of participants 88). The methods used to generate the randomisation sequence and ensure allocation concealment were unclear in about half of the trial reports. Lack of measures to blind caregivers or investigators was a potential source of bias in all of the included trials. The trials took place during the past 25 years in care facilities internationally, predominantly in India (five trials) and Iran (four trials). The studied pressure sources were commercially available bubble CPAP devices versus a variety of mechanical ventilator (11 trials) or Infant Flow Driver (4 trials) devices. Meta-analyses suggest that the use of bubble CPAP compared with mechanical ventilator or Infant Flow Driver CPAP may reduce the rate of treatment failure (RR 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.95; (I2 = 31%); RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 20, 95% CI 10 to 100; 13 trials, 1230 infants; low certainty evidence). The type of pressure source may not affect mortality prior to hospital discharge (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.36 (I2 = 0%); RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02; 10 trials, 1189 infants; low certainty evidence). No data were available on neurodevelopmental impairment. Meta-analysis suggests that the pressure source may not affect the risk of pneumothorax (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.34 (I2 = 0%); RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01; 14 trials, 1340 infants; low certainty evidence). Bubble CPAP likely increases the risk of moderate-severe nasal injury (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.82 (I2 = 17%); RD 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome 14, 95% CI 9 to 33; 8 trials, 753 infants; moderate certainty evidence). The pressure source may not affect the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.10 (I2 = 0%); RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.01; 7 trials, 603 infants; low certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the low level of certainty about the effects of bubble CPAP versus other pressure sources on the risk of treatment failure and most associated morbidity and mortality for preterm infants, further large, high-quality trials are needed to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform context- and setting-relevant policy and practice.

Late-onset hyponatremia typically occurs in infants who are physiologically stable and is defined as serum sodium of 132 mEq/L or less or between 133 and 135 mEq/L if receiving sodium supplementation. Recent evidence suggests that spot urine sodium levels may improve the recognition of LOH, as low levels of excreted urine reflect a total body sodium deficit and negative balance. Untreated LOH may result in poor somatic growth, neurodevelopmental delay, higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and more severe retinopathy of prematurity. The primary prevention of LOH is to maintain serum sodium between 135 and 145 mEq/L; however, there are currently no formal protocols guiding sodium supplementation. The purpose of this article is to present on overview of LOH pathophysiology and its effect on somatic growth, neurodevelopment outcomes, and other related sequelae.

The current pilot study tested the hypothesis that treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors (decitabine; RG108) would improve alveolarization in a newborn murine model of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Newborn mice exposed to maternal inflammation (LPS) and neonatal hyperoxia (85% O2) were treated with decitabine (p3, 0.1 mg/kg; p2, 4, 6, 0.1 mg/kg; or p2, 4, 6, 0.15 mg/kg) or RG108 (p3, 0.0013 mg/kg) delivered intranasally. Modest improvements in alveolarization were observed with decitabine, but no differences were observed with RG108. Attenuated phospho-SMAD2/3 levels and greater surfactant protein C protein levels compared to vehicle were observed with some tested doses. No detrimental side effects were observed with the doses used in this study. In summary, our pilot investigations identified a safe dose for intranasal administration of both methylation inhibitors and provides a foundation for further studies into methylation inhibitors in the context of neonatal lung injury.

To investigate the protective mechanism of caffeine in a hyperoxia-based cell model of BPD in vitro. Methods: Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs II) were isolated and randomly divided into 6 groups: the normal, hyperoxia, caffeine (50 muM caffeine), antagonist (5 muM ZM241385), agonist (5 muM CGS21680), and DMSO groups. Transfection with siRNA against adenosine A2A receptor (siA2AR) was performed in AECs II. Results: Caffeine alone or in combination with adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist inhibited apoptosis, promoted proliferation and reduced oxidative stress (OS). The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA) mRNA, A2AR mRNA and the protein levels of A2AR, phospho-Src, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-P38 and cleaved caspase-3 were decreased in the caffeine and antagonist groups compared with that in the hyperoxia group. However, the effects of caffeine above were weakened by the A2AR agonist. Knockdown of A2AR showed similar results to caffeine. Discussion: Caffeine can reduce apoptosis, promote proliferation, and alleviate OS in hyperoxia-induced AECs II injury by inhibiting the A2AR/cAMP/PKA/Src/ERK1/2/p38MAPK signaling pathway. Caffeine and A2AR may serve as a promising therapeutic target for BPD in prematurity.","group":"g1","id":"607eb785-696b-4f93-a00a-6e40f60023f1","_showDetails":false},"431eb07e-757e-489b-ace1-eec5087026d6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"Neonatal Docosahexaenoic Acid in Preterm Infants and Intelligence at 5 Years.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2206868","authors":["Gould, Jacqueline F","Makrides, Maria","Gibson, Robert A","Sullivan, Thomas R","McPhee, Andrew J","Anderson, Peter J","Best, Karen P","Sharp, Mary","Cheong, Jeanie L Y","Opie, Gillian F","Travadi, Javeed","Bednarz, Jana M","Davis, Peter G","Simmer, Karen","Doyle, Lex W","Collins, Carmel T"],"date":"2022//","keywords":["Child","Child, Preschool","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Australia","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Dietary Supplements/ae [Adverse Effects]","Docosahexaenoic Acids/df [Deficiency]","Docosahexaenoic Acids/pd [Pharmacology]","Docosahexaenoic Acids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Docosahexaenoic Acids","Emulsions","Follow-Up Studies","Infant, Premature/gd [Growth & Development]","*Infant, Premature","Intelligence/de [Drug Effects]","*Intelligence","Enteral Nutrition","Wechsler Scales","Cognition/de [Drug Effects]","*Cognition"],"journal":"The New England journal of medicine","volume":"387","number":"17","isbn":"0028-4793","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med22&NEWS=N&AN=36300974"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a component of neural tissue. Because its accretion into the brain is greatest during the final trimester of pregnancy, infants born before 29 weeks' gestation do not receive the normal supply of DHA. The effect of this deficiency on subsequent cognitive development is not well understood., METHODS: We assessed general intelligence at 5 years in children who had been enrolled in a trial of neonatal DHA supplementation to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the previous trial, infants born before 29 weeks' gestation had been randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an enteral emulsion that provided 60 mg of DHA per kilogram of body weight per day or a control emulsion from the first 3 days of enteral feeds until 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or discharge home, whichever occurred first. Children from 5 of the 13 centers in the original trial were invited to undergo assessment with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 5 years of corrected age. The primary outcome was the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score. Secondary outcomes included the components of WPPSI., RESULTS: A total of 1273 infants underwent randomization in the original trial; of the 656 surviving children who had undergone randomization at the centers included in this follow-up study, 480 (73%) had an FSIQ score available - 241 in the DHA group and 239 in the control group. After imputation of missing data, the mean (+/-SD) FSIQ scores were 95.4+/-17.3 in the DHA group and 91.9+/-19.1 in the control group (adjusted difference, 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.38 to 6.53; P = 0.03). The results for secondary outcomes generally did not support that obtained for the primary outcome. Adverse events were similar in the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: In infants born before 29 weeks' gestation who had been enrolled in a trial to assess the effect of DHA supplementation on bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the use of an enteral DHA emulsion until 36 weeks of postmenstrual age was associated with modestly higher FSIQ scores at 5 years of age than control feeding.

Defects in late lung development manifest in premature infants as a chronic lung disease named bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Numerous studies demonstrated the therapeutic properties of exogenous bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in experimental BPD. However, very little is known regarding the regenerative capacity of resident lung MSCs (L-MSCs) during normal development and in BPD. In this study we aimed to characterize the L-MSC population in homeostasis and upon injury. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile in situ Ly6a+ L-MSCs in the lungs of normal and O2-exposed neonatal mice (a well-established model to mimic BPD) at 3 developmental timepoints (postnatal days 3, 7, and 14). Hyperoxia exposure increased the number and altered the expression profile of L-MSCs, particularly by increasing the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and anti-angiogenic genes. In order to identify potential changes induced in the L-MSCs transcriptome by storage and culture, we profiled 15 000 Ly6a+ L-MSCs after in vitro culture. We observed great differences in expression profiles of in situ and cultured L-MSCs, particularly those derived from healthy lungs. Additionally, we have identified the location of Ly6a+/Col14a1+ L-MSCs in the developing lung and propose Serpinf1 as a novel, culture-stable marker of L-MSCs. Finally, cell communication analysis suggests inflammatory signals from immune and endothelial cells as main drivers of hyperoxia-induced changes in L-MSCs transcriptome.

The risk prediction models nowadays for BPD risk that included only clinical factors but without genetic factors are either too complex without practicability or provide poor-to-moderate discrimination. We aim to identify the role of genetic factors in BPD risk prediction early and accurately., METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed in a cohort of 245 premature infants (gestational age <32 weeks), with 131 BPD infants and 114 infants without BPD as controls. A gene burden test was performed to find risk genes with loss-of-function mutations or missense mutations over-represented in BPD and severe BPD (sBPD) patients, with risk gene sets (RGS) defined as BPD-RGS and sBPD-RGS, respectively. We then developed two predictive models for the risk of BPD and sBPD by integrating patient clinical and genetic features. The performance of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)., RESULTS: Thirty and 21 genes were included in BPD-RGS and sBPD-RGS, respectively. The predictive model for BPD, which combined the BPD-RGS and basic clinical risk factors, showed better discrimination than the model that was only based on basic clinical features (AUROC, 0.915 vs. AUROC, 0.814, P = 0.013, respectively) in the independent testing dataset. The same was observed in the predictive model for sBPD (AUROC, 0.907 vs. AUROC, 0.826; P = 0.016)., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that genetic information contributes to susceptibility to BPD. The predictive model in this study, which combined BPD-RGS with basic clinical risk factors, can thus accurately stratify BPD risk in premature infants.

After propensity score matching, there were 282 infants in each group. Infants were further divided into a neonatal malnutrition (NM) group and a well-nourished (WN) group. Clinical factors, nutrition intake, and growth parameters were collected and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the factors associated with neonatal malnutrition., RESULTS: 1. Compared with infants in the non-BPD group, the infants in BPD group had more fluid intake and lower calorie and protein intake after the second week, longer invasive ventilation time, and longer time to total oral feeding and parenteral nutrition (PN), and the difference was more significant in NM infants than in WN infants (P < 0.05). 2. The weight/length, body mass index, triponderal mass index, and weight gain velocity in the BPD group were significantly lower than in the non-BPD group (P < 0.05) and lower in NM infants than in WN ones (P < 0.05). 3. Multivariable system regression analysis showed that invasive ventilation time, lipid intake in week 4, time to reach full feeding, and duration of PN were independent risk factors for NM., CONCLUSION: Enhancing calorie and macronutrient intake, reducing invasive ventilation, and achieving full gastrointestinal feeding early may be effective measures to avoid malnutrition in infants with BPD.

The relationship between birth weight and survival after cardiac surgery is nonlinear with 2 kilograms (kg) being an inflection point below which marked decline in survival occurs. The prevalence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in premature infants is more than twice that in term born infants. Increased risk of preterm birth in infants with CHD is most commonly due to spontaneous preterm birth and remains poorly understood.Advances in Neonatal-Perinatal medicine have led to a marked improvement in survival of neonates born prematurely over the last several decades. However, the risk of severe morbidities including retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis remains significant in extremely low birth weight infants. Premature infants with CHD are at a greater risk of prematurity related morbidities than premature infants without CHD. Interventions that have been successful in decreasing the risk of these morbidities are addressed.","group":"g1","id":"1fe95849-ace8-4503-9905-999aa52c9062","_showDetails":false},"1859e56b-a191-4ea1-be4c-5d983e213f1b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"Sustained sterile inflammation is related to pulmonary morbidities in premature infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1931102","authors":["Shima, Yoshio","Kumasaka, Sakae","Negishi, Yasuyuki"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20210715//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Infant","Humans","*HMGB1 Protein","Infant, Premature","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Infant, Premature, Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","*Infant, Premature, Diseases","Inflammation","Morbidity","Gestational Age"],"journal":"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians","volume":"35","number":"25","isbn":"1476-4954","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med21&NEWS=N&AN=34266359"],"address":"England","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Sterile inflammation, initiated by endogenous molecules such as high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), has come to be recognized as a critical mechanism in a variety of chronic diseases.

The pressure difference offered by bilevel continuous positive distending pressure (BiPAP) respect to CPAP may be an advantage to the spontaneously breathing patient. In this study, we compared the efficacy of CPAP and BiPAP in the firstweek post-extubation in a series of very preterm infants., METHODS: Inborn neonates less than 30 weeks of gestational age who were intubated shortly after birth from January 2011 to December 2017 were enrolled in a retrospective study. The attending clinician assessed the patients for non-invasive respiratory support readiness and allocated them to CPAP (PEEP 4-6 cmH2O) or BiPAP (PEEP 4-5 cmH2O, rate 10-40; Thigh 0.7-1.2; upper-pressure level 8-10 cmH2O). Both techniques were compared for preventing extubation failure within 7 days from extubation as defined per local protocol (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were: definitive failure of extubation, pneumothorax during non-invasive respiratory support, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus and retinopathy of prematurity at discharge., RESULTS: We enrolled 134 neonates; the CPAP group included 89 babies while 45 received BiPAP. Patients did not differ for their general characteristics (EG, antenatal steroids, incidence of SGA, maternal hypertension, surfactant replacement therapy). Short term extubation failure was significantly higher in the former group (23/89 in CPAP vs 5/45 in BiPAP; p = .005). No infant developed air leak syndrome. Secondary outcomes were comparable between groups. Multivariate analysis showed that on the whole population the extubation failure was correlated to the insurgence of late-onset sepsis., CONCLUSION: BiPAP safely reduced early extubation failure compared to CPAP in our cohort of very preterm neonates within 7 days from extubation.","group":"g1","id":"33adceeb-41c2-4b32-b5e2-e2ece413c690","_showDetails":false},"ca0f27f9-9a68-41b8-ad90-f7d929b770b4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"MicroRNA-214 promotes alveolarization in neonatal rat models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia via the PlGF-dependent STAT3 pathway.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10020-021-00374-4","authors":["Zhang, Zhi-Qun","Hong, Hui","Li, Jing","Li, Xiao-Xia","Huang, Xian-Mei"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210916//","notes":"Erratum in (EIN)","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis","Biomarkers","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Computational Biology/mt [Methods]","Disease Models, Animal","Disease Susceptibility","Gene Expression Profiling","*Gene Expression Regulation","Immunohistochemistry","*Membrane Proteins/me [Metabolism]","*MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","*Placenta Growth Factor/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/ul [Ultrastructure]","Rats","*STAT3 Transcription Factor/me [Metabolism]","*Signal Transduction"],"journal":"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)","volume":"27","number":"1","isbn":"1076-1551","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34530740"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recently, the role of several microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in pulmonary diseases has been described. The molecular mechanisms by which miR-214 is possibly implicated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have not yet been addressed. Hence, this study aimed to investigate a putative role of miR-214 in alveolarization among preterm neonates with BPD., METHODS: Microarray-based gene expression profiling data from BPD was employed to identify differentially expressed genes. A BPD neonatal rat model was induced by hyperoxia. Pulmonary epithelial cells were isolated from rats and exposed to hyperoxia to establish cell injury models. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed in BPD neonatal rats and hyperoxic pulmonary epithelial cells. MiR-214 and PlGF expression in BPD neonatal rats, and eNOS, Bcl-2, c-myc, Survivin, alpha-SMA and E-cadherin expression in hyperoxic pulmonary epithelial cells were measured using RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. The interaction between PlGF and miR-214 was identified using dual luciferase reporter gene and RIP assays. IL-1beta, TNF-a, IL-6, ICAM-1 and Flt-1 expression in the rat models was measured using ELISA., RESULTS: The lung tissues of neonatal rats with BPD showed decreased miR-214 expression with elevated PlGF expression. PlGF was found to be a target of miR-214, whereby miR-214 downregulated PlGF to inactivate the STAT3 pathway. miR-214 overexpression or PlGF silencing decreased the apoptosis of hyperoxic pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro and restored alveolarization in BPD neonatal rats., CONCLUSION: Overall, the results demonstrated that miR-214 could facilitate alveolarization in preterm neonates with BPD by suppressing the PlGF-dependent STAT3 pathway.

Microsomal RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding single-strand RNAs. It was shown that miRNA dysregulation contributes to PHT. Up until now, miRNA levels have not been studied in BPD to detect PHT. The main aim of this study is: miRNAs play role in PHT etiopathogenesis in BPD. They can be used as a feasible biomarker for early detection and follow-up of PHT in children with BPD., METHODS: The study included infants who were admitted to the Neonatology Clinic. In all subjects, transthoracic echocardiography was performed by the same pediatric cardiologist. Expression of 25 miRNAs was studied from peripheral blood samples at the time of diagnosis., RESULTS: Patients were categorized according to whether they have PHT and BPD. Group 1 included 21 infants who had both BPD and PHT. Group 2 had 17 infants who were diagnosed as BPD but had no PHT. Group 3 was a control group and had 21 infants who did not have BPD and PHT. Significant differences in the expression of 19 of 25 miRNAs were detected. Fifteen of these were in group 1., CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension is a disorder developing due to environmental and genetic reasons, in which the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The genes controlled by miRNAs found to be related to PH in our study may have a role in PHT. In the future, it could be possible to establish novel approaches that may contribute to early diagnosis and treatment of PHT by focusing target genes of miRNA found to be related in this study.","group":"g1","id":"08f300e8-e48a-4b28-941d-f2bfedfa22e8","_showDetails":false},"0cce36dd-835d-47f0-bea5-b5021f0fddcf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Role of the LRP1-pPyk2-MMP9 pathway in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats.","journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2108125","authors":["Zheng, Ya-Fei","Zhu, Hai-Yan","Wang, Wei","Hu, Jing-Jing","Bao, Tian-Ping","Tian, Zhao-Fang"],"date":"2021//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Hyperoxia","Lung","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","*Lung Injury","Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/ge [Genetics]","Rats"],"volume":"23","number":"12","isbn":"1008-8830","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34911615"],"address":"China","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To study the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 phosphorylation (pPyk2)-matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) pathway in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats., METHODS: A total of 16 neonatal rats were randomly placed in chambers containing room air (air group) or 95% medical oxygen (hyperoxia group) immediately after birth, with 8 rats in each group.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially propionate, possess anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study was designed to examine the roles of sodium propionate (SP) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged BPD and its potential mechanisms., METHODS: WT, Nrf2-/- mice and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were used in this study. LPS was performed to mimic BPD model both in vivo and vitro. Lung histopathology, inflammation and oxidative stress-related mRNA expressions in lungs involved in BPD pathogenesis were investigated. In addition, cell viability and angiogenesis were also tested., RESULTS: The increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and decreased Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap-1) expressions were observed after SP treatment in the LPS-induced neonatal mouse model of BPD. In LPS-induced wild-type but not Nrf2-/- neonatal mice, SP reduced pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress and exhibited obvious pathological alterations of the alveoli. Moreover, in LPS-evoked HPMECs, SP accelerated Nrf2 nuclear translocation presented and exhibited cytoprotective and pro-angiogenesis effects. In addition, SP diminished the LPS-induced inflammatory response by blocking the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway.

Besides mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia, sepsis contributes to BPD pathogenesis. Adrenomedullin (Adm) is a multifunctional peptide that exerts anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs of adult rodents. Whether Adm mitigates sepsis-induced neonatal lung injury is unknown. The lung phenotype of mice exposed to early postnatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was recently shown to be similar to that in human BPD. This model was used to test the hypothesis that Adm-deficient neonatal mice will display increased LPS-induced lung injury than their wild-type (WT) littermates. Adm-deficient mice or their WT littermates were intraperitoneally administered 6 mg/kg of LPS or vehicle daily on postnatal days (PNDs) 3 to 5. The lungs were harvested at several time points to quantify inflammation, alveolarization, and vascularization. The extent of LPS-induced lung inflammation in Adm-deficient mice was 1.6-fold to 10-fold higher than their WT littermates. Strikingly, Adm deficiency induced STAT1 activation and potentiated STAT3 activation in LPS-exposed lungs. The severity of LPS-induced interruption of lung development was also greater in Adm-deficient mice at PND7. At PND14, LPS-exposed WT littermates displayed substantial improvement in lung development, whereas LPS-exposed Adm-deficient mice continued to have decreased lung development. These data indicate that Adm is necessary to decrease lung inflammation and injury and promote repair of the injured lungs in LPS-exposed neonatal mice.

A large number of studies have shown that silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) plays a protective role in oxidative stress. SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) is vital in the nucleoplasmic distribution of SIRT1 under stress. However, whether the SENP1-SIRT1 pathway is involved in the hyperoxic lung injury is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the role and related mechanisms of the SENP1-SIRT1 pathway in hyperoxic lung injury. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from infants with BPD and SENP1-silenced alveolar epithelial cells were used as research models. PBMCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of premature infants. Next, the SENP1-silenced human alveolar epithelial cells were used to verify the role of the SENP1-SIRT1 pathway in vitro. The results indicated that the ROS level and the mRNA and protein expression of SENP1 increased in PBMCs of infants with BPD, but the expression of SIRT1 decreased in the nucleus and increased in the cytoplasm, and then the expression of acetyl-p53 (Ac-p53) increased. In the hyperoxic alveolar epithelial cell injury model, it seemed that hyperoxia could induce the same variation trend in the SENP1-SIRT1 pathway as in infants with BPD and then increased the expression of Ac-p53 and BAX, and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, silencing SENP1 could alleviate these hyperoxia-induced changes. These results suggested that SENP1 played an important role in hyperoxia-induced lung injury.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate the pathological state of lung tissues. The expression of CD68 was determined by immunohistochemistry assay. The infiltration of M1 and M2 macrophages was marked by immunofluorescence. The expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-10, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and arginase-1 (Arg-1) were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay, and the ratio of M1/M2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined by flow cytometry., RESULTS: Disordered alveolar structure in the lung tissue, thickened alveolar septa, and infiltration of inflammatory cells around the alveolar cavity and pulmonary septa were observed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats. On day 21 post-natal (PN21), the pathological state was aggravated, alveolar simplification was observed, and the expression level of CD68 in the lung tissues was significantly elevated, and these results were dramatically alleviated in the VitA, VitD, and VitA+VitD groups. However, no significant synergistic effect was observed between VitA+VitD and VitA or VitD groups. After the administration with VitA or VitD, IL-10 and Arg-1 were up-regulated on PN10. TNF-alpha and NOS were up-regulated on PN21. The ratio of macrophage polarization and M2 macrophages increased considerably after the stimulation with LPS, and this result was significantly reversed by VitA or VitD. A significant difference was observed on the effect of different dosages of VitA or VitD on macrophage polarization, among which moderate dosages of VitA or VitD exerted the most significant influence on macrophage polarization., CONCLUSION: The BPD-linked pulmonary injury stimulated by LPS can be ameliorated by the introduction of VitA or VitD.

Our previous study found that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung injury and the combination therapy of surfactant and human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) did not have additive effects on hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats. The aim is to evaluate the effects of 2 consecutive days of intratracheal administration of surfactant and hUC-MSCs on hyperoxia-induced lung injury., METHODS: Neonatal Sprague Dawley rats were reared in either room air (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal days 1 to 14. On postnatal day 4, the rats received intratracheal injections of either 20 muL of normal saline (NS) or 20 muL of surfactant. On postnatal day 5, the rats reared in RA received intratracheal NS, and the rats reared in O2 received intratracheal NS or hUC-MSCs (3 x 104 or 3 x 105 cells). Six study groups were examined: RA + NS + NS, RA + surfactant + NS, O2 + NS + NS, O2 + surfactant + NS, O2 + surfactant + hUC-MSCs (3 x 104 cells), and O2 + surfactant + hUC-MSCs (3 x 105 cells). The lungs were excised for histological, western blot, and cytokine analyses., RESULTS: The rats reared in hyperoxia and treated with NS yielded significantly higher mean linear intercepts (MLIs) and interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 levels and significantly lower vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), platelet-derived growth factor protein expression, and vascular density than did those reared in RA and treated with NS or surfactant. The lowered MLIs and cytokines and the increased VEGF expression and vascular density indicated that the surfactant and surfactant + hUC-MSCs (3 x 104 cells) treatment attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung injury. The surfactant + hUC-MSCs (3 x 105 cells) group exhibited a significantly lower MLI and significantly higher VEGF expression and vascular density than the surfactant + hUC-MSCs (3 x 104 cells) group did., CONCLUSIONS: Consecutive daily administration of intratracheal surfactant and hUC-MSCs can be an effective regimen for treating hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonates.","group":"g1","id":"30e6417c-3cda-4fb8-aab3-f0e00c658b92","_showDetails":false},"4587430c-685a-438e-bc31-fa5c36a45153":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"The H2S-generating enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase regulates pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation but does not impact normal or aberrant lung development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2020.12.002","authors":["Lignelli, Ettore","Palumbo, Francesco","Bayindir, Selahattin Gorkem","Nagahara, Noriyuki","Vadasz, Istvan","Herold, Susanne","Seeger, Werner","Morty, Rory E"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20201215//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Cell Movement/ph [Physiology]","Cell Proliferation/ph [Physiology]","Cells, Cultured","Female","*Gasotransmitters/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression/de [Drug Effects]","Humans","*Hydrogen Sulfide/me [Metabolism]","Lung/cy [Cytology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/me [Metabolism]","*Organogenesis/ph [Physiology]","Sulfurtransferases/ge [Genetics]","*Sulfurtransferases/me [Metabolism]","Mice"],"journal":"Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry","volume":"107","isbn":"1089-8603","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33338600"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Along with nitric oxide (NO), the gasotransmitters carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are emerging as potentially important players in newborn physiology, as mediators of newborn disease, and as new therapeutic modalities. Several recent studies have addressed H2S in particular in animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common complication of preterm birth where oxygen toxicity stunts lung development. In those studies, exogenous H2S attenuated the impact of oxygen toxicity on lung development, and two H2S-generating enzymes were documented to affect pulmonary vascular development. H2S is directly generated endogenously by three enzymes, one of which, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), has not been studied in the lung. In a hyperoxia-based animal model of BPD, oxygen exposure deregulated MPST expression during post-natal lung development, where MPST was localized to the smooth muscle layer of the pulmonary vessels in developing lungs. siRNA-mediated abrogation of MPST expression in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells in vitro limited baseline cell migration and cell proliferation, without affecting apoptosis or cell viability. In vivo, MPST was dispensable for normal lung development in Mpst-/-mice, and MPST did not contribute to stunted lung development driven by hyperoxia exposure, assessed by design-based stereology. These data demonstrate novel roles for MPST in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell physiology. The potential caveats of using Mpst-/- mice to study normal and aberrant lung development are also discussed, highlighting the possible confounding, compensatory effects of other H2S-generating enzymes that are present alongside MPST in the smooth muscle compartment of developing pulmonary vessels.

Loss of HHIP, a key regulator of the hedgehog signaling pathway, leads to impaired lung morphogenesis and lethality in animal models, through unimpeded sonic hedgehog expression blocking mesenchymal-expressed fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10). Since bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is also associated with altered lung development and worsens with stimuli including mechanical ventilation, reactive oxygen species, and inflammation, HHIP and FGF10 may be candidate genes., METHODS: This was an observational, cohort study including extremely low birth weight infants that who developed BPD and those who did not. DNA was isolated from buccal swabs and subjected to allelic discrimination, using specific HHIP and FGF10 probes. Protein levels were measured in tracheal aspirates. Student's t test, Chi-square, Z test and logistic regression were used., RESULTS: Demographic characteristics did not differ except that birth weight (715 +/- 153 vs. 835 +/- 132 g) and gestational age (25 vs. 26 weeks) were less in babies with BPD.

To induce BPD, neonatal rat pups were raised in hyperoxic (>90% O2) environments from day one (P1) until day ten (P10) and treated with N-acetyl-lysyltyrosylcysteine amide (KYC). In vivo studies showed that KYC improved lung complexity, reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive (+) myeloid cell counts, MPO protein, chlorotyrosine formation, increased endothelial cell CD31 expression, decreased 8-OH-dG and Cox-1/Cox-2, HMGB1, RAGE, TLR4, increased weight gain and improved survival in hyperoxic pups. EPR studies confirmed that MPO reaction mixtures oxidized KYC to a KYC thiyl radical. Adding recombinant HMGB1 to the MPO reaction mixture containing KYC resulted in KYC thiylation of HMGB1. In rat lung microvascular endothelial cell (RLMVEC) cultures, KYC thiylation of RLMVEC proteins was increased the most in RLMVEC cultures treated with MPO + H2O2, followed by H2O2, and then KYC alone. KYC treatment of hyperoxic pups decreased total HMGB1 in lung lysates, increased KYC thiylation of HMGB1, terminal HMGB1 thiol oxidation, decreased HMGB1 association with TLR4 and RAGE, and shifted HMGB1 in lung lysates from a non-acetylated to a lysyl-acetylated isoform, suggesting that KYC reduced lung cell death and that recruited immune cells had become the primary source of HMGB1 released into the hyperoxic lungs. MPO-dependent and independent KYC-thiylation of Keap1 were both increased in RLMVEC cultures. Treating hyperoxic pups with KYC increased KYC thiylation and S-glutathionylation of Keap1, and Nrf2 activation. These data suggest that KYC is a novel system pharmacological agent that exploits MPO to inhibit toxic oxidant production and is oxidized into a thiyl radical that inactivates HMGB1, activates Nrf2, and increases antioxidant enzyme expression to improve lung complexity and reduce BPD in hyperoxic rat pups.

Preterm lungs are underdeveloped, non-compliant in terms of breathing, often need mechanical ventilation and these patients commonly develop syndromes as a consequence of their prematurity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Surfactant protein SP-D could be a therapy for BPD. However, there is a need for an animal model that resembles the structural characteristics of premature lungs to test SP-D and future molecules that will target the newborn population. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a pre-clinical model of early alveolarization and structurally premature lungs in 10-day-old rats, and establish the dose safety and distribution of rhSP-D administered intratracheally to premature lungs., METHODS: Ten-day-old Sprague Dawley rats were selected to develop the lung model. SP-D was administered intratracheally. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lungs were collected to evaluate inflammation and SP-D distribution., RESULTS: The 10-day-old rat pup demonstrates early alveolarization features of premature lung development and it tolerates daily intratracheal injections for up to 14 days. The intratracheal administration of rhSP-D, at a dose of 8 mg/kg, does not induce an inflammatory response or histological signs of toxicity in the premature lung, even with a daily administration for 14 days. The pharmacokinetic distribution of rhSP-D in premature lungs has a half-life of ~9 h, and the incorporation into blood is minimal., CONCLUSIONS: 10-day-old rats are a good pre-clinical animal model of premature lungs, and rhSP-D can be intratracheally administered at doses up to 8 mg/kg without expecting adverse reactions.

Previous studies with rats suggested that gestational exposure to PFOS may affect the lung development in the offspring. The mechanism, however, is still unknown. In the present study, we have exposed 24 pregnant SD rats from gestational day 12-18 to different doses of PFOS (0, 1 or 5 mg/kg BW/day). The lungs of the offspring were analyzed at postnatal days 1, 3, 7 and 14. PFOS treatment appeared to reduce the alveolar numbers, resulting in simplified alveolar structure and thickened alveolar septa. Also, PFOS treated animals had increased lung inflammation with up-regulated inflammasome associated proteins NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and GSDMD and increased inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1beta. At the same time, HIF-1alpha and VEGFA were significantly down-regulated. Since HIF-1alpha and VEGFA are critical factors promoting alveolar development and pulmonary angiogenesis, these results suggested that PFOS may also affect lung development by inhibiting HIF-1alpha and VEGFA expression. Our results here indicate that gestational exposure to PFOS may affect lung development in the offspring with pathological characteristics similar to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a severe lung developmental defect. The results also suggest that environmental factors such as PFOS may contribute to the increasing incidence of developmental lung diseases, such as BPD, by elevating lung inflammation and inhibiting lung development.

In this study, human alveolar epithelial cells were used to establish a hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury cell model, and resveratrol (Res or R), the Sirtuin 1 activator SRT1720 (S) and the Sirtuin 1 inhibitor EX-527 (E) were administered to alveolar epithelial cells, which were then exposed to hyperoxia to investigate the role of Res in mitochondrial function and apoptosis. We divided human alveolar epithelial cells into the following groups: (1) the control group, (2) hyperoxia group, (3) hyperoxia+Res20 group, (4) hyperoxia+Res20+E5 group, (5) hyperoxia+Res20+E10 group, (6) hyperoxia+S2 group, (7) hyperoxia+S2+E5 group, and (8) hyperoxia+S2+E10 group. Hyperoxia-induced cell apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction were alleviated by Res and SRT1720. Res and SRT1720 upregulated Sirtuin 1, PGC-1alpha, NRF1, and TFAM but decreased the expression of acetyl-p53 in human alveolar epithelial cells that were exposed to hyperoxia. These findings revealed that Res may alleviated hyperoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells through the SIRT1/PGC-1a signaling pathway. Thus, Sirtuin 1 upregulation plays an important role in lung protection.","group":"g1","id":"9f98ea12-7a9b-475c-a8a3-e19cd9795581","_showDetails":false},"42cc89e3-e3b2-4400-868c-6350ee0a0a09":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Astaxanthin Prevents Lung Injury Due to Hyperoxia and Inflammation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1386207323666200915092012","authors":["Akduman, Hasan","Tayman, Cuneyt","Cakir, Ufuk","Cakir, Esra","Dilli, Dilek","Turkmenoglu, Tugba Taskin","Gonel, Ataman"],"date":"2021//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia","Inflammation/dt [Drug Therapy]","Inflammation/me [Metabolism]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung Injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","*Lung Injury","Pregnancy","Rats","Rats, Wistar","Xanthophylls"],"journal":"Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening","volume":"24","number":"8","isbn":"1386-2073","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=32933455"],"address":"United Arab Emirates","abstract":"BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to ascertain the effects of astaxanthin on the lungs of rat pups with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) induced by hyperoxia and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two newborn Wistar rats, born to spontaneous pregnant rats, were divided into three groups: Hyperoxia (95% O2) + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, hyperoxia + LPS + astaxhantin group, and control: no treatment group (21% O2). Pups in the hyperoxia + LPS + astaxanthin group were given 100 mg/kg/day oral astaxanthin from the first day to the fifth day. Histopathologic and biochemical evaluations, including glutathione (GSH), total anti-oxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), lipid hydroperoxide (LPO), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), total thiol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), and caspase-3 activities, were performed., RESULTS: Better survival rates and weight gain were demonstrated in the hyperoxia + LPS + astaxanthin group (p <0.001). In the histopathologic evaluation, the severity of lung damage was significantly reduced in the hyperoxia+LPS+astaxanthin group, as well as decreased apoptosis (ELISA for caspase-3) (p <0.001). The biochemical analyses of lung tissues showed that TAS, GSH, and Total thiol levels were significantly higher in the astaxanthin treated group compared to the hyperoxia + LPS group (p <0.05) while TOS, AOPP, LPO, 8-OHdG, MPO levels were significantly lower (p <0.001). In addition, unlike the hyperoxia + LPS group, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in lung tissue were significantly lower in the astaxanthin-treated group (p <0.001)., CONCLUSION: Astaxanthin was shown to reduce lung damage caused by inflammation and hyperoxia with its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic properties, and to protect the lung from severe destruction.

Although many treatment methods are currently available, they are not effective in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Herein, we explored the role of tripartite motif protein 72 (TRIM72), a factor involved in repairing alveolar epithelial wounds, in regulating alveolar cells upon hyperoxia exposure., METHODS: In this in vivo study, we used Sprague-Dawley rat pups that were reared in room air or 85% O2 for 2 weeks after birth. The lungs were excised for histological analyses, and TRIM72 expression was assessed on postnatal days 7 and 14. For in vitro experiments, RLE-6TN cells (i.e., rat alveolar type II epithelial cells) and A549 cells (i.e., human lung carcinoma epithelial cells) were exposed to 85% O2 for 5 days. The cells were then analyzed for cell viability, and TRIM72 expression was determined., RESULTS: Exposure to hyperoxia reduced body and lung weight, increased mean linear intercept values, and upregulated TRIM72 expression. In vitro study results revealed increased or decreased lung cell viability upon hyperoxia exposure depending on the suppression or overexpression of TRIM72, respectively., CONCLUSION: Hyperoxia upregulates TRIM72 expression in neonatal rat lung tissue; moreover, it initiates TRIM72-dependent alveolar epithelial cell death, leading to hyperoxia-induced lung injury.

Tracheal bacterial diversity decreased from DOL 3 to DOL 7. Longer time to first OPC administration tended to be associated with lower bacterial diversity in the airways., CONCLUSIONS: The tracheal microbiome in intubated premature infants in the first week is likely determined, in part, by the composition of the oral microbiome. Bacterial diversity in intubated babies decreases during the first week of life, a pattern that could be consistent with risk for BPD. Decreased bacterial diversity and increased inflammatory activity in the lung may also be associated with delayed administration of OPC.","group":"g1","id":"be7f220f-6fb2-4ea7-b7b5-8f7a7d6c5cac","_showDetails":false},"4dc8cfc2-50d6-441c-920e-b66b4747c76f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Survival analysis of a cohort of extremely preterm infants born in Finland during 2005-2013.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1668925","authors":["Harkin, Pia","Marttila, Riitta","Pokka, Tytti","Saarela, Timo","Hallman, Mikko"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20190926//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Child, Preschool","Female","Finland/ep [Epidemiology]","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant","Infant, Extremely Premature","Infant, Newborn","Pregnancy","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn","Survival Analysis"],"journal":"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians","volume":"34","number":"15","isbn":"1476-4954","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=31522587"],"address":"England","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the mortality of extremely preterm infants (ELGA born alive before 28 weeks) until the postconceptional age of 42 weeks, death, or home discharge, whichever came first. It was focused especially on studying the relationship between antenatal risk factors, the time of death, and the postnatal morbidities associated with mortality., STUDY DESIGN: The original data obtained from the nationwide Finnish medical birth register of extremely preterm and low birthweight infants born during 2005-2013 were analyzed. The total population consisted of 1353 ELGA infants after the exclusion of 18 infants born with lethal congenital anomalies or genetic defects. Mortality risks were adjusted according to the length of gestation, the administration of antenatal steroids, and the delivery hospital., RESULTS: During the first 48 hours, extreme immaturity was seen to be the prominent cause of death, and intrauterine growth did not influence mortality. The ELGA population surviving for at least 48 hours (N = 1135) was submitted for mortality risk analysis. After the adjustments, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (birth weight below -2 SD) was found to be the factor with the highest risk for demise [OR 6.2; 95% CI (3.9-10.0) p < .001]. Multiple deliveries were associated with increased risk for death [OR 1.5; 95% CI (1.0-2.1), p = .048] to a lesser extent. The main neonatal morbidities associated with the risk of mortality after 48 postnatal hours of life were severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) [OR 4.4; 95% CI (3.0-6.7), p < .001], respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) [OR 2.6; 95% CI (1.3-5.0), p = .006], and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [OR 2.3; 95% CI (1.5-3.4), p < .001]. The major morbidities associated with deaths among non-SGA infants were severe IVH (32.1% of all deaths), NEC (19.1%), and sepsis (8.4%). In SGA infants, severe respiratory disease (RDS, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary hypertension) was the main cause of death (60.9% of all deaths). Medical or surgical PDA treatment was not found to be associated with increased risk of death [OR 0.4; 95% CI (0.2-0.5), p < .001] compared to infants who had survived for more than 2 days. Severe preeclampsia was found to be associated with 42% of all ELGA-SGA births. After the adjustments, ELGA infants from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia of the mother exhibited a significantly lower risk of severe IVH [OR 0.3; 95% CI (0.2-0.5), p < .001] compared to the non-preeclamptic mothers' infants. The low incidence of severe IVH was evident regardless of fetal growth in this patient group., CONCLUSIONS: SGA infants with less than 28 gestational weeks, who had survived for at least 2 days, had excessively high mortality due to severe pulmonary disease. Intrauterine growth had no influence on the risk of death, other than pulmonary causes. The infants of preeclamptic mothers exhibited an increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation; however, despite this serious complication, these infants exhibited a significant decrease in the risk for severe IVH.","group":"g1","id":"4dc8cfc2-50d6-441c-920e-b66b4747c76f","_showDetails":false},"57f154e5-a20c-4038-9534-e52d788f4d14":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"The fetal inflammatory response syndrome: the origins of a concept, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and obstetrical implications.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2020.101146","authors":["Jung, Eunjung","Romero, Roberto","Yeo, Lami","Diaz-Primera, Ramiro","Marin-Concha, Julio","Para, Robert","Lopez, Ashley M","Pacora, Percy","Gomez-Lopez, Nardhy","Yoon, Bo Hyun","Kim, Chong Jai","Berry, Stanley M","Hsu, Chaur-Dong"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20201023//","keywords":["Adult","Chorioamnionitis/di [Diagnosis]","*Chorioamnionitis/im [Immunology]","*Chorioamnionitis/pp [Physiopathology]","Chorioamnionitis/th [Therapy]","Cytokines/bl [Blood]","Female","Fetus","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature, Diseases/im [Immunology]","Infant, Premature, Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]","Interleukin-6/bl [Blood]","*Obstetric Labor, Premature/pp [Physiopathology]","Pregnancy","Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","*Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/im [Immunology]","*Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine","volume":"25","number":"4","isbn":"1744-165X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33164775"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"The fetus can deploy a local or systemic inflammatory response when exposed to microorganisms or, alternatively, to non-infection-related stimuli (e.g., danger signals or alarmins). The term \"Fetal Inflammatory Response Syndrome\" (FIRS) was coined to describe a condition characterized by evidence of a systemic inflammatory response, frequently a result of the activation of the innate limb of the immune response. FIRS can be diagnosed by an increased concentration of umbilical cord plasma or serum acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein or cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6). Pathologic evidence of a systemic fetal inflammatory response indicates the presence of funisitis or chorionic vasculitis. FIRS was first described in patients at risk for intraamniotic infection who presented preterm labor with intact membranes or preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes. However, FIRS can also be observed in patients with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation, alloimmunization (e.g., Rh disease), and active autoimmune disorders. Neonates born with FIRS have a higher rate of complications, such as early-onset neonatal sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and death, than those born without FIRS. Survivors are at risk for long-term sequelae that may include bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, retinopathy of prematurity, and sensorineuronal hearing loss. Experimental FIRS can be induced by intra-amniotic administration of bacteria, microbial products (such as endotoxin), or inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1), and animal models have provided important insights about the mechanisms responsible for multiple organ involvement and dysfunction. A systemic fetal inflammatory response is thought to be adaptive, but, on occasion, may become dysregulated whereby a fetal cytokine storm ensues and can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and even fetal death if delivery does not occur (\"rescued by birth\"). Thus, the onset of preterm labor in this context can be considered to have survival value. The evidence so far suggests that FIRS may compound the effects of immaturity and neonatal inflammation, thus increasing the risk of neonatal complications and long-term morbidity. Modulation of a dysregulated fetal inflammatory response by the administration of antimicrobial agents, anti-inflammatory agents, or cell-based therapy holds promise to reduce infant morbidity and mortality.

Premature delivery puts babies at risk of severe complications. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of premature birth leading to lifelong affection of pulmonary function. BPD is recognized as a disease of arrested alveolar development. The disease process is not fully described and no complete cure or prevention is known. The focus of interest in the search for treatment and prevention of BPD has traditionally been at airspace level; however, the pulmonary vasculature is increasingly acknowledged in the pathology of BPD. The aim of the investigation was to study the gene expression in lungs with BPD with regards to pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). Methods: We employed a murine model of hyperoxia-induced BPD and gene expression microarray technique to determine the mRNA expression in lung tissue from young mice. We combined gene expression pathway analysis and analyzed the biological function of multiple single gene transcripts from lung homogenate to study the PVD relevant gene expression. Results: There were n = 117 significantly differentially regulated genes related to PVD through down-regulation of contractile elements, up- and down-regulation of factors involved in vascular tone and tissue-specific genes. Several genes also allowed for pinpointing gene expression differences to the pulmonary vasculature. The gene Nppa coding for a natriuretic peptide, a potent vasodilator, was significantly down-regulated and there was a significant up-regulation of Pde1a (phosphodiesterase 1A), Ptger3 (prostaglandin e receptor 3), and Ptgs1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase one). Conclusion:  The pulmonary vasculature is affected by the arrest of secondary alveolarization as seen by differentially regulated genes involved in vascular tone and pulmonary vasculature suggesting BPD is not purely an airspace disease. Clues to prevention and treatment may lie in the pulmonary vascular system.","group":"g3","id":"571beb56-cf29-4ce4-b95f-227d955af799","_showDetails":true},"754375b7-6605-44a5-aeda-ba309fc43e9f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2021>","title":"Respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia after fetal growth restriction: Lessons from a natural experiment in identical twins.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100725","authors":["Groene, Sophie G","Spekman, Jip A","Te Pas, Arjan B","Heijmans, Bastiaan T","Haak, Monique C","van Klink, Jeanine M M","Roest, Arno A W","Lopriore, Enrico"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210129//","journal":"EClinicalMedicine","volume":"32","isbn":"2589-5370","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm6&NEWS=N&AN=33554092"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is thought to negatively affect lung development resulting in increased respiratory morbidity. However, research performed in singletons is often limited by a certain level of bias caused by individual differences in genetic constitution, obstetrical and maternal factors., METHODS: Respiratory morbidity was compared between the smaller and the larger twin in monochorionic twins with selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), defined as a birth weight discordance >= 20%, born in our center between 2010 and 2019 in this retrospective study. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was diagnosed based on the clinical picture of a neonate with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and/or surfactant, confirmed by a chest X-ray. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was diagnosed when the neonate required treatment with >21% oxygen for at least 28 days., FINDINGS: Median gestational age at birth for the 94 included pregnancies was 32.4 (IQR 30.4-34.3) weeks. Within-pair analyses showed that the prevalence of RDS was lower in the smaller twin compared to the larger twin, 19.1% (18/94) vs 34.0% (32/94), respectively (p = 0.004). The odds of RDS for the larger twin was doubled (OR 2.1 (CI95% 1.3-3.5). In contrast, the rate of BPD in the smaller twin was higher as opposed to the larger twin, 16.7% (15/90) vs 6.7% (6/89), respectively (p = 0.008), with a more than doubled odds (OR 2.5 (CI95% 1.3-4.9))., INTERPRETATION: Despite being genetically identical, sFGR twins have different respiratory outcomes. Adverse growth condition in utero in the smaller twin is associated with a reduced odds of RDS at birth but a more than doubled odds of BPD, reflecting the pathophysiologic adverse effect of growth restriction on lung development., FUNDING: The Dutch Heart Foundation (2017T075).

In these studies, cells or animals were challenged with hyperoxia or other injury-inducing agents. However, little is known about the effect of MSCs on immature fetal lungs and whether MSCs are able to improve lung maturity, which may alleviate lung developmental arrest in BPD., METHODS: We aimed to determine if the conditioned medium (CM) of MSCs stimulates functional and structural lung maturation. As a measure of functional maturation, Na+ transport in primary fetal distal lung epithelial cells (FDLE) was studied in Ussing chambers. Na+ transporter and surfactant protein mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Structural maturation was assessed by microscopy in fetal rat lung explants., RESULTS: MSC-CM strongly increased the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and the Na,K-ATPase as well as their mRNA expression. Branching and growth of fetal lung explants and surfactant protein mRNA expression were enhanced by MSC-CM. Epithelial integrity and metabolic activity of FDLE cells were not influenced by MSC-CM. Since MSC's actions are mainly attributed to paracrine signaling, prominent lung growth factors were blocked. None of the tested growth factors (VEGF, BMP, PDGF, EGF, TGF-beta, FGF, HGF) contributed to the MSC-induced increase of Na+ transport. In contrast, inhibition of PI3-K/AKT and Rac1 signaling reduced MSC-CM efficacy, suggesting an involvement of these pathways in the MSC-CM-induced Na+ transport., CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that MSC-CM strongly stimulated functional and structural maturation of the fetal lungs. These effects were at least partially mediated by the PI3-K/AKT and Rac1 signaling pathway. Thus, MSCs not only repair a deleterious tissue environment, but also target lung cellular immaturity itself.","group":"g1","id":"477b90af-60f5-4aba-a429-bfa20f375e6b","_showDetails":false},"1eea42b5-4ded-4b50-9349-46fcc382ad47":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Involvement of Hdac3-mediated inhibition of microRNA cluster 17-92 in bronchopulmonary dysplasia development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10020-020-00237-4","authors":["Wang, Di","Hong, Hui","Li, Xiao-Xia","Li, Jing","Zhang, Zhi-Qun"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20201103//","keywords":["Animals","Biomarkers","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Disease Progression","Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genetic Association Studies/mt [Methods]","Genetic Predisposition to Disease","*Histone Deacetylases/ge [Genetics]","Histone Deacetylases/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Mice","*MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","*Multigene Family","Phenotype","RNA Interference","Signal Transduction"],"journal":"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)","volume":"26","number":"1","isbn":"1076-1551","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33143661"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of newborns, has been paradoxically rising despite medical advances.

Hdac3 was knocked out in vivo and knocked down in vitro, while microRNA (miR)-17 was downregulated in vivo and in vitro to clarify their roles in abnormal pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolarization. Mechanistic investigations were performed on the interplay of Hdac3, miR-17-92 cluster, enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1), p65 and placental growth factor (Pgf)., RESULTS: Hdac3 was involved in abnormal alveolarization and angiogenesis in BPD mice. Further, the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in BPD mice was downregulated by Hdac3. miR-17 was found to target EZH1, and Hdac3 rescued the inhibited EZH1 expression by miR-17 in lung fibroblasts. Additionally, EZH1 augmented Pgf expression by recruiting p65 thus enhancing the progression of BPD. Hdac3 augmented the recruitment of p65 in the Pgf promoter region through the miR-17/EZH1 axis, thus enhancing the transcription and expression of Pgf, which elicited abnormal angiogenesis and alveolarization of BPD mice., CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the present study revealed that Hdac3 activated the EZH1-p65-Pgf axis through inhibiting miR-17 in the miR-17-92 cluster, leading to accelerated abnormal pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolarization of BPD mice.","group":"g1","id":"1eea42b5-4ded-4b50-9349-46fcc382ad47","_showDetails":false},"457d85a7-7074-4a85-b7fb-9c5060b786fc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Minoxidil Cannot Be Used To Target Lysyl Hydroxylases during Postnatal Mouse Lung Development: A Cautionary Note.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1124/jpet.120.000138","authors":["Pfeffer, Tilman","Lignelli, Ettore","Inoue, Hajime","Mizikova, Ivana","Surate Solaligue, David E","Steenbock, Heiko","Myti, Despoina","Vadasz, Istvan","Herold, Susanne","Seeger, Werner","Brinckmann, Jurgen","Morty, Rory E"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20201005//","keywords":["Animals","Cytosol/de [Drug Effects]","Cytosol/me [Metabolism]","Dose-Response Relationship, Drug","Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/de [Drug Effects]","Hydroxylation/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Lysine/me [Metabolism]","Mice","*Minoxidil/pd [Pharmacology]","Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase/ge [Genetics]","*Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","volume":"375","number":"3","isbn":"0022-3565","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33020194"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The lysyl hydroxylases (procollagen-lysine 5-dioxygenases) PLOD1, PLOD2, and PLOD3 have been proposed as pathogenic mediators of stunted lung development in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common complication of preterm birth. In affected infants, pulmonary oxygen toxicity stunts lung development. Mice lacking Plod1 exhibit 15% mortality, and mice lacking Plod2 or Plod3 exhibit embryonic lethality. Therefore, to address any pathogenic role of lysyl hydroxylases in stunted lung development associated with BPD, minoxidil was administered to newborn mice in an oxygen toxicity-based BPD animal model. Minoxidil, which has attracted much interest in the management of systemic hypertension and androgenetic alopecia, can also be used to reduce lysyl hydroxylase activity in cultured cells. An in vivo pilot dosing study established 50 mgkg-1day-1 as the maximum possible minoxidil dose for intraperitoneal administration in newborn mouse pups. When administered at 50 mgkg-1day-1 to newborn mouse pups, minoxidil was detected in the lungs but did not impact lysine hydroxylation, collagen crosslinking, or lysyl hydroxylase expression in the lungs. Consistent with no impact on mouse lung extracellular matrix structures, minoxidil administration did not alter the course of normal or stunted lung development in newborn mice. At doses of up to 50 mgkgday-1, pharmacologically active concentrations of minoxidil were not achieved in neonatal mouse lung tissue; thus, minoxidil cannot be used to attenuate lysyl hydroxylase expression or activity during mouse lung development. These data also highlight the need for new and specific lysyl hydroxylase inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Extracellular matrix crosslinking is mediated by lysyl hydroxylases, which generate hydroxylated lysyl residues in procollagen peptides. Deregulated collagen crosslinking is a pathogenic component of a spectrum of diseases, and thus, there is interest in validating lysyl hydroxylases as pathogenic mediators of disease and potential \"druggable\" targets. Minoxidil, administered at the maximum possible dose, did not inhibit lysyl hydroxylation in newborn mouse lungs, suggesting that minoxidil was unlikely to be of use in studies that pharmacologically target lysyl hydroxylation in vivo.

Although most BPD survivors can be weaned from supplemental oxygen, many show evidence of cardiovascular sequelae in adulthood, including pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) plays an important role in mediating vascular remodeling in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Whether hyperoxic exposure, a known mediator of BPD in rodent models, causes EndoMT resulting in vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension remains unclear. We hypothesized that neonatal hyperoxic exposure causes EndoMT, leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension in adulthood. To test this hypothesis, newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia and then allowed to recover in room air until adulthood. Neonatal hyperoxic exposure gradually caused pulmonary vascular and right ventricle remodeling as well as pulmonary hypertension. Male mice were more susceptible to developing pulmonary hypertension compared to female mice, when exposed to hyperoxia as newborns. Hyperoxic exposure induced EndoMT in mouse lungs as well as in cultured lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) isolated from neonatal mice and human fetal donors. This was augmented in cultured LMVECs from male donors compared to those from female donors. Using primary mouse LMVECs, hyperoxic exposure increased phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3, but reduced Smad7 protein levels. Treatment with a selective TGF-beta inhibitor SB431542 blocked hyperoxia-induced EndoMT in vitro. Altogether, we show that neonatal hyperoxic exposure caused vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in adulthood. This was associated with increased EndoMT.

Animal models based on oxygen toxicity to the developing mouse lung are used to understand the mechanisms of stunted alveolarization in BPD, and to develop new medical management strategies for affected infants. The toxicity of genetic and pharmacological interventions, together with maternal cannibalism, reduce mouse litter sizes in experimental studies. The impact of litter size on normal and stunted lung alveolarization is unknown, but may influence data interpretation. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of litter size on normal and oxygen-stunted lung alveolarization in mice., METHODS: BPD was experimentally modelled in newborn C57BL/6J mice by exposure to 85% O2 in the inspired air for the first 14 days of post-natal life. Perturbations to mouse lung architecture were assessed by design-based stereology, in which the alveolar density, total number of alveoli, gas-exchange surface area, and the septal thickness were estimated., RESULTS: Litter sizes of a single mouse were not viable to post-natal day 14. Normal lung alveolarization was comparable in mouse pups in litters of 2, 4, 6, and 8 pups per litter. Hyperoxia was equally effective at stunting lung alveolarization in mouse pups in litters of 2, 4, 6, and 8 pups per litter., CONCLUSIONS: Studies on normal lung alveolarization as well as alveolarization stunted by oxygen toxicity can be undertaken in mouse litters as small as two pups, and as large as eight pups.

Here we show that inactivation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), a key factor required for myofibroblast contraction, disrupted septa formation, supporting the myofibroblast contraction model of alveologenesis. The alveoli simplification phenotype was accompanied by decreased yes-associated protein (YAP), a key effector in the Hippo mechanotransduction pathway. Expression of activated YAP in Mlck-mutant lungs led to partial reversal of alveolar simplification. In the adult, although Mlck inactivation did not lead to simplification, it prevented reseptation during compensatory regrowth in the pneumonectomy model.

Adrenomedullin (AM) signals through calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity-modifying protein 2 and modulates lung injury initiation. However, its role in lung injury resolution and the mechanisms by which it regulates angiogenesis remain unclear. Consequently, we hypothesized that AM resolves hyperoxia-induced BPD and PH via endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3). AM-sufficient (ADM+/+) or -deficient (ADM+/-) mice were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia through postnatal days (PNDs) 1 to 14, and the hyperoxia-exposed mice were allowed to recover in normoxia for an additional 56 days. Lung injury and development and PH were quantified at different time points. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were also used to examine the effects of AM signaling on the NOS3 pathway and angiogenesis. Lung blood vessels and NOS3 expression decreased and the extent of hyperoxia-induced BPD and PH increased in ADM+/- mice compared with ADM+/+ mice. Hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and PH resolved by PND14 and PND70, respectively, in ADM+/+ mice but not in ADM+/- mice. Knockdown of ADM, calcitonin receptor-like receptor, and receptor activity-modifying protein 2 in vitro decreased NOS3 expression, nitric oxide generation, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, NOS3 knockdown abrogated the angiogenic effects of AM. Collectively, these results indicate that AM resolves hyperoxic lung injury via NOS3.

Then, inappropriate responses to respiratory viruses (especially respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus) and early allergic sensitization are the strongest contributors to the inception of wheezing and early-onset asthma.

Biomarkers in blood have been reported to detect bacterial infection in neonates. However, serial blood exams pose iatrogenic anemia in premature babies. Thus, this study aimed to identify cytokines in saliva, which can help to diagnose bacterial infection in premature babies via a non-invasive method., METHODS: Premature neonates were enrolled from Aug. 2012 to Feb. 2015 after completing informed consent. Babies with congenital anomalies, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis and any surgical indicated diseases were excluded. Salivary samples collection and septic work-up were performed when bacterial infection was clinically suspected, as well as one week after antimicrobial treatment. The level of salivary cytokines was detected by MILLPLEX R MAP and analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test., RESULTS: There were 16 episodes of bacterial infection in 10 cases. Culture-positive group had significantly higher levels of salivary Interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1alpha, MIP-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha than that in the culture-negative group (p = 0.002, 0.006, 0.001, <0.001, 0.009), and blood C-reactive protein and sugar as well (p < 0.001, 0.026). After adjusting postmenstrual age by logistic regression, blood sugar level was the most significant biomarker (p = 0.019). In combination of blood and salivary biomarkers, blood sugar higher than 67 mg/dL and salivary IL-6 higher than 367.25 pg/mL concurrently, would accurately detect bacterial infection in premature babies., CONCLUSION: This non-invasive method might help us to accurately diagnose bacterial infection in premature babies.

The aim of this study was to discuss the success, efficacy and safety of the percutaneous closure of symptomatic ASD in children weighing less than 10 kg. Material and methods: This study was performed in two centres. A total of 44 patients were included. Demographic and angiographic data of these patients were gathered retrospectively from patients' records. Main indications for ASD closure were: failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and genetic syndromes. Results: Median weight of patients was 9.0(8.12-9.50) kg. Bodyweight of 22 patients was less than 3 percentiles. In the follow-up, this number was lowered to 9 patients at 12 months. Median age of patients was 18.0(12.0-285) months. Minimum age and weight of patients was 3 months and 4.5 kg, respectively. Median mean pulmonary pressure was 24.0(20.0-29.5). The values of median defect size were measured in Cath lab as 13.0(10.75-15.3) mm. Median device size was 13(9-15) mm. Defect size was evaluated according to body weight and body surface area. The ratio of weight per defect size was 0.65(0.54-0.84) also the ratio of body surface area per defect size was 0.032(0.028-0.04). The ratio of total septum per device diameter was 2.5(2.1-3.1). Types of devices used were Amplatzer Septal Occluder, Cera Flex Septal Occluder, Figulla Flex II Atrial Septal Occluder, Memopart Septal Occluder. All cases were closed successfully, but the device had to be retrieved in one patient after successful positioning because it was detected that device compressed the aorta. No major complications were seen. Conclusion:  In the experienced centres, percutaneous ASD closure can be done effectively and safely in symptomatic children weighing less than 10 kg.","group":"g1","id":"b9eae0a8-8fbb-45c6-93c3-ea25adce42d3","_showDetails":false},"b1aaa625-d3e1-48fa-aeea-c10c5e5c126c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Oxygen therapy in preterm infants with pulmonary hypertension.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2019.101070","authors":["Chandrasekharan, Praveen","Lakshminrusimha, Satyan"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20191203//","keywords":["Administration, Inhalation","Animals","Gestational Age","Humans","Hypertension, Pulmonary/ep [Epidemiology]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/th [Therapy]","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Infant, Premature, Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/th [Therapy]","Oxygen/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/mt [Methods]","Sheep"],"journal":"Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine","volume":"25","number":"2","isbn":"1744-165X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med17&NEWS=N&AN=31836427"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"Premature neonates <34 weeks gestation can present with early-onset, late-onset and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) associated pulmonary hypertension (PHT), with clinical, echocardiographic, and histological features similar to term infants with PHT.

Alveolar pathologies are prominent in neonatal and adult lung diseases. The mechanisms of alveologenesis remain largely unknown. We inactivated Pdgfra postnatally in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF), a subpopulation of lung mesenchymal cells. Lack of Pdgfra arrested alveologenesis akin to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a neonatal chronic lung disease. The transcriptome of mutant SCMF revealed 1808 altered genes encoding transcription factors, signaling and extracellular matrix molecules. Elastin mRNA was reduced, and its distribution was abnormal. Absence of Pdgfra disrupted expression of elastogenic genes, including members of the Lox, Fbn and Fbln families. Expression of EGF family members increased when Tgfb1 was repressed in mouse. Similar, but not identical, results were found in human BPD lung samples. In vitro, blocking PDGF signaling decreased elastogenic gene expression associated with increased Egf and decreased Tgfb family mRNAs. The effect was reversible by inhibiting EGF or activating TGFbeta signaling. These observations demonstrate the previously unappreciated postnatal role of PDGFA/PDGFRalpha in controlling elastogenic gene expression via a secondary tier of signaling networks composed of EGF and TGFbeta.

This study aimed to establish a BPD model of postnatal pulmonary inflammation in premature infants and to explore its role and possible mechanisms in the pathogenesis of BPD. We exposed postnatal day 1 mice to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and normal saline for 14 days. Pulmonary inflammation and alveolar microvascular development were assessed by histology. In addition, we also examined the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGFR2, nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappaB) and related inflammatory mediators [interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)] in the lungs. Lung histology revealed inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar simplification, and decreased microvascular density in LPS-exposed lungs. VEGF and VEGFR2 expression was decreased in the lungs of LPS-exposed neonatal mice. Furthermore, we detected elevated levels of the inflammatory mediators IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha, and MCP-1 in the lungs, which are associated with the activation of NF-kappaB. Intranasal instillation of LPS inhibits lung development in newborn mice, and postnatal pulmonary inflammation may participate in the pathogenesis of BPD. The mechanism is related to the inhibition of VEGF and VEGFR2 and the upregulation of inflammatory mediators through activation of NF-kappaB.","group":"g1","id":"e722735b-43c2-4d74-aa5f-5391b8c77856","_showDetails":false},"ab407aa1-7685-4442-a318-6cdb26d21982":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Autophagy is required for lung development and morphogenesis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI127307","authors":["Yeganeh, Behzad","Lee, Joyce","Ermini, Leonardo","Lok, Irene","Ackerley, Cameron","Post, Martin"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190604//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Animals","*Autophagic Cell Death","Beclin-1/ge [Genetics]","Beclin-1/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/em [Embryology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Lung/em [Embryology]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Knockout","*Organogenesis"],"journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","volume":"129","number":"7","isbn":"0021-9738","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=31162135"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major respiratory illness in extremely premature infants.

E16.5 Becn1Epi-KO lungs had reduced terminal air sac formation and vascularization and delayed distal epithelial differentiation, a pathology similar to that seen in infants with BPD.

PT children who experienced neonatal inflammatory conditions have poorer cognitive outcomes than those who did not. The goal of this study was to contrast white matter microstructure and cognitive outcomes after preterm birth in relation to the presence or absence of severe inflammatory conditions in the neonatal period., METHODS: PT children (n=35), born at gestational age 22-32weeks, were classified as either PT+ (n=12) based on a neonatal history of inflammatory conditions, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis or culture positive sepsis, or PT- (n=23) based on the absence of the three inflammatory conditions. Full term (FT) children (n=43) served as controls. Participants underwent diffusion MRI and cognitive testing (intelligence, reading, and executive function) at age 6years. The corpus callosum was segmented into 7 regions using deterministic tractography and based on the cortical projection zones of the callosal fibers. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated for each segment. General linear models with planned contrasts assessed group differences in FA, MD and cognitive outcomes. Pearson correlations assessed associations of white matter metrics and cognitive outcome measures., RESULTS: FA was significantly lower and MD was significantly higher in PT+ compared to PT- or FT groups in multiple callosal segments, even after adjusting for gestational age. Executive function scores, but not intelligence or reading scores, were less favorable in PT+ than in PT- groups. Among the entire sample, occipital FA was significantly correlated with IQ (r=0.25, p<0.05), reading (r=0.32, p<0.01), and executive function (r=-0.28, p<0.05) measures. Anterior frontal FA and superior parietal FA were significantly correlated with executive function (r=-0.25, r=0.23, respectively, p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: We observed differences in the white matter microstructure of the corpus callosum and in the cognitive skills of 6-year-old PT children based on their history of neonatal inflammation. Neonatal inflammation is one medical factor that may contribute to variation in long-term neurobiological and neuropsychological outcomes in PT samples. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Although increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines are seen in airway samples and blood from bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients, the innate immune responses in this common neonatal lung condition have not been well characterized. We previously reported that depletion of murine CD11b-expressing mononuclear phagocytes at birth led to severe acute hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) and significant mortality. In this study, we further define the mononuclear phagocyte populations that are present in the neonatal lung and characterize their responses to hyperoxia exposure. We used myeloid depleter mice (CD11b-DTR and CCR2-DTR) to contrast the effects of depleting different monocyte/macrophage subpopulations on the innate immune response to hyperoxia. Using RNA sequencing and subsequent data analysis, we identified an IFN-gamma-mediated role for interstitial monocytes/macrophages in acute HILI, in which decreased IFN-gamma expression led to increased disease severity and increased Mmp9 mRNA expression. Importantly, intranasal administration of rIFN-gamma largely rescued CD11b-DTR+ mice from severe HILI and decreased Mmp9 mRNA expression in Ly-6Clo and Ly-6Chi interstitial monocyte/macrophages. We conclude that the proinflammatory effects of hyperoxia exposure are, at least in part, because of the modulation of effectors downstream of IFN-gamma by pulmonary monocytes/macrophages.

Montelukast, an effective cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) receptor antagonist, has a variety of pharmacological effects and has protective effects against a variety of diseases. Currently, the efficacy and safety of montelukast sodium in treating BPD has been revealed, however, the precise molecular mechanism of the effect of montelukast on BPD development remain largely unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of montelukast on BPD in vivo and in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS A mouse BPD model and hyperoxia-induced lung cell injury model were established and treated with montelukast. Then mean linear intercept (MLI), radial alveolar count (RAC), lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratio, pro-inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress-related factors in lung tissues were determined. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected using MTT assay and flow cytometer respectively. RESULTS The results showed that montelukast treatment relieved mouse BPD, evidenced by increased RAC and decreased MLI and LW/BW ratios. We also found that montelukast treatment reduced pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1s) production, enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the lung tissues of BPD mice. Besides, montelukast eliminated the reduced cell viability and enhanced cell apoptosis induced by hyperoxia exposure in vitro. Moreover, the upregulated pro-inflammatory factors production and p-p65 protein level in lung cells caused by hyperoxia were decreased by montelukast treatment. CONCLUSIONS Montelukast protected against mouse BPD induced by hyperoxia through inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and lung cell apoptosis.","group":"g1","id":"173ee305-dd08-4ded-b00e-4bc4c1f2714f","_showDetails":false},"e9a4371e-d85f-4356-a93a-807b4f8a6262":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Genetic Strain and Sex Differences in a Hyperoxia-Induced Mouse Model of Varying Severity of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2019.01.014","authors":["Leary, Sean","Das, Pragnya","Ponnalagu, Devasena","Singh, Harpreet","Bhandari, Vineet"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190219//","keywords":["Animals","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Disease Models, Animal","Female","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","*Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Severity of Illness Index","Sex Factors","Species Specificity"],"journal":"The American journal of pathology","volume":"189","number":"5","isbn":"0002-9440","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=30794808"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a disease prevalent in preterm babies with a need for supplemental oxygen, resulting in impaired lung development and dysregulated vascularization. Epidemiologic studies have shown that males are more prone to BPD and have a delayed recovery compared with females, for reasons unknown. Herein, we tried to recapitulate mild, moderate, and severe BPD, using two different strains of mice, in males and females: CD1 (outbred) and C57BL/6 (inbred). Aside from higher body weight in the CD1 strain, there were no other gross morphologic differences with respect to alveolar development between the two strains. With respect to lung morphology after oxygen exposure, females had less injury with better preservation of alveolar chord length and decreased alveolar protein leak and inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, housekeeping genes, which are routinely used as loading controls, were expressed differently in males and females. In the BPD mouse model, gonadotropin-releasing hormone was increased in females compared with males. Specific miRNAs (miR-146 and miR-34a) were expressed differently in the sexes. In the severe BPD mouse model, administering miR-146 mimic to males attenuated lung damage, whereas administering miR-146 inhibitor to females increased pulmonary injury.

The lipid solutions used for PN, however, are associated with oxidative stress and morbidity. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a new-generation lipid emulsion (SMOFLipid) and olive-oil based lipid emulsion for prevention of PN-associated oxidative damage., METHODS: Preterm infants < 32 weeks of gestational age were included in this prospective randomized study. All infants were randomized to SMOFlipid or olive-oil based lipid emulsion (ClinOleic). Lipid peroxidation products were evaluated in all infants. In addition, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were studied at days 0, 7 and 14., RESULTS: A total of 89 infants (SMOFlipid, n = 42; ClinOleic, n = 47) were enrolled. TAC was higher in the SMOFlipid group compared with the ClinOleic group at all time points, and the difference on day 7 was statistically significant. Although the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 was higher in the SMOFlipid group, this difference was not significant. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was lower in the SMOFlipid group (14.1%) than in the ClinOleic group (31.2%), but this finding was non-significant p > 0.05. The rate of severe BPD was significantly lower in the SMOFlipid group., CONCLUSION: To our best of knowledge, this is the first study to suggest that SMOFlipid might decrease oxidative damage and oxidative-stress-associated morbidity compared with olive oil-based emulsion in preterm infants.

Oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation are common treatments, which can cause hyperoxia-induced lung injury, but the underlying mechanism is not yet understood. Mitochondrial fission is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis. The objective of this study was to determine whether mitochondrial fission (dynamin-related protein 1, Drp1) is an important mediator of hyperoxia lung injury in rats. Methods: The animal model of BPD was induced with high oxygen (80-85% O2). Pulmonary histological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Pulmonary microvessels were observed by immunofluorescence staining of von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Protein expression levels of Drp1 and p-Drp1 (Ser616) were observed using Western Blot. We used echocardiography to measure pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAT), pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi), peak flow velocity of the pulmonary artery (PFVP), pulmonary arteriovenous diameter, and pulmonary vein peak velocity. Mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) was used as an inhibitor of Drp1, and administered through intraperitoneal injection (25 mg/kg). Results: Pulmonary artery resistance of the hyperoxide-induced neonatal rat model of BPD increased after it entered normoxic convalescence. During the critical stage of alveolar development in neonatal rats exposed to high oxygen levels for an extended period, the expression and phosphorylation of Drp1 increased in lung tissues. When Drp1 expression was inhibited, small pulmonary vessel development improved and PH was relieved. Conclusion:  Our study shows that excessive mitochondrial fission is an important mediator of hyperoxia-induced pulmonary vascular injury, and inhibition of mitochondrial fission may be a useful treatment for hyperoxia-induced related pulmonary diseases.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is an important regulator of the extracellular matrix in the developing lung. To determine if increased TGF-beta would injure alveolar development by activating TGF-beta signaling and by influencing the expression of elastogenesis-related protein, we performed intraperitoneal injection of newborn mice with the TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody 1D11 and observed whether 1D11 had a protective role in the oxygen (O2)-exposed newborn mouse lung. The newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 for 14 and 21 days. 1D11 was administered by intraperitoneal injection every day from postnatal days 3 to 20. Alveolar morphology was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression and distribution of elastin were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The level of TGF-beta signaling-related proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. The expression levels of elastogenesis-related proteins, including tropoelastin, fibulin-5, and neutrophil elastase (NE), which participate in the synthesis, assembly, and degradation of elastin, were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot. In this research, impaired alveolar development and elastin deposition as well as the excessive activation of TGF-beta signaling were observed in the newborn mouse lung exposed to hyperoxia. 1D11 improved alveolarization as well as the distribution of elastin in the newborn lung with hyperoxia exposure. The expression levels of tropoelastin, fibulin-5, and NE, which are important components of elastogenesis, were decreased by treatment with 1D11 in the injured newborn lung. These data demonstrate that 1D11 improved alveolarization by blocking the TGF-beta signaling pathway and by reducing the abnormal expression of elastogenesis-related proteins in the O2-exposed newborn mouse lung. 1D11 may become a new therapeutic method to prevent the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"24674868-186d-4877-947a-57557c2e62fd","_showDetails":false},"1d04cb73-4bbf-4fac-a21d-608d0316f67c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Control Interventions Can Impact Alveolarization and the Transcriptome in Developing Mouse Lungs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ar.23931","authors":["Fehl, Joshua","Pozarska, Agnieszka","Nardiello, Claudio","Rath, Philipp","Surate Solaligue, David E","Vadasz, Istvan","Mayer, Konstantin","Herold, Susanne","Seeger, Werner","Morty, Rory E"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20181109//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Female","*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*MicroRNAs/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","MicroRNAs/me [Metabolism]","Organogenesis","*Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","*Transcriptome"],"journal":"Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)","volume":"302","number":"2","isbn":"1932-8486","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=30412359"],"address":"United States","abstract":"There is currently much interest in understanding the mechanisms of normal and aberrant lung alveolarization, particularly in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a common complication of preterm birth where alveolarization is impeded. To this end, the parenteral administration of pharmacological agents that modulate biochemical pathways, or facilitate modulation of gene expression in transgenic animals, has facilitated the discovery and validation of mechanisms that direct lung development. Such studies include control interventions, where the solvent vehicle, perhaps containing an inactive form of the agent applied, is administered; thereby providing a well-controlled point of reference for the analysis of the partner experiment. In the present study, the impact of several widely used control interventions in developing C57Bl/6J mouse pups was examined for effects on lung structure and the lung transcriptome. Parenteral administration of scrambled microRNA inhibitors (called antagomiRs) that are used to control in vivo microRNA neutralization studies, impacted lung volume, septal thickness, and the transcriptome of developing mouse lungs; with some effects dependent upon nucleotide sequence. Repeated intraperitoneal isotonic saline injections altered lung volume, with limited impact on the transcriptome. Parenteral administration of the tamoxifen solvent Miglyol accelerated mouse pup growth, and changed the abundance of 73 mRNA transcripts in the lung. Tamoxifen applied in Miglyol-in the absence of Cre recombinase-decreased pup growth, lung volume, and lung alveolarization and changed the abundance of 298 mRNA transcripts in the lung. These data demonstrate that widely used control interventions can directly impact lung alveolarization and the lung transcriptome in studies on lung development.

Weight, length, and head circumference were measured at birth, term, 4, and 12 months of corrected age. Serial C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were measured at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days of age and averaged for each infant. A sustained neonatal systemic inflammatory response was defined as an average C-reactive protein level greater than the median for the group. Analysis was undertaken with linear mixed models., RESULTS: Decreases in mean z scores for weight, length, and head circumference were associated with the presence of a sustained neonatal systemic inflammatory response from birth to 12 months of corrected age (beta [95% CI] = -0.282 [-0.306 to -0.258]; -1.899 [-2.028,-1.769]; -0.806 [-0.910, to -0.701], P < .001, respectively) in main effect models.

There is a pressing clinical need for an accurate, objective, and safe assessment of neonatal TM., PURPOSE: To use retrospectively respiratory-gated ultrashort echo-time (UTE) MRI to noninvasively analyze moving tracheal anatomy for regional, quantitative evaluation of dynamic airway collapse in quiet-breathing, nonsedated neonates., STUDY TYPE: Prospective., POPULATION/SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven neonatal subjects with varying respiratory morbidities (control, BPD, CDH, abnormal polysomnogram)., FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: High-resolution 3D radial UTE MRI (0.7 mm isotropic) on 1.5T scanner sited in the neonatal intensive care unit., ASSESSMENT: Images were retrospectively respiratory-gated using the motion-modulated time-course of the k-space center. Tracheal surfaces were generated from segmentations of end-expiration/inspiration images and analyzed geometrically along the tracheal length to calculate percent-change in luminal cross-sectional area (A % ) and ratio of minor-to-major diameters at end-expiration (r D,exp ). Geometric results were compared to clinically available bronchoscopic findings (n = 14)., STATISTICAL TESTS: Two-sample t-test., RESULTS: Maximum A % significantly identified subjects with/without a bronchoscopic TM diagnosis (with: 46.9 +/- 10.0%; without: 27.0 +/- 5.8%; P < 0.001), as did minimum r D,exp (with: 0.346 +/- 0.146; without: 0.671 +/- 0.218; P = 0.008).

Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 beta has been shown to attenuate lung injury and PH in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats. Genipin has been widely used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to show that genipin decreased the expression of GSK-3 beta in lung tissues of hyperoxia-exposed rat pups., METHODS: We established models of hyperoxia-exposed rat pups, evaluated lung injury and pulmonary hypertension and detected the mRNA and protein expression of key molecules., RESULTS: Hyperoxia resulted in the reduction of survival rate and histologic injury of lung tissues; an increase of the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of transforming growth factor-beta1, extracellular matrix proteins collagen-I and fibronectin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin; an increase of right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure and the weight ratio of RV to left ventriclar (LV) plus septum (S) (RV/LV+S) were inhibited by genipin. Genipin also decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6 in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues after hyperoxia exposure. In addition, genipin inhibited p65 nuclear factor-kappaB nuclear translocation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 expression. Moreover, hyperoxia resulted in an increase of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde content and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity, catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, modified subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 expression were inhibited by genipin. All these effects induced by genipin were blocked by upregulation of GSK-3 beta. Genipin downregulated GSK-3 beta expression, decreased nuclear factor-kappaB translocation, increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 expression, attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to amelioration of lung injury and PH in hyperoxia-exposed rat pups., CONCLUSION: Overall, genipin may provide a novel therapeutic option for preventing and treating infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Intake of energy and protein on postnatal days 4-6 and association with weight standard deviation score (WSDS) from birth to day 7, as well as intakes of energy and protein on postnatal days 4-6 and 7 to 27, respectively, and association with composite outcome of death and BPD and separate outcomes of BPD and ROP were examined, and adjusted for potential confounders., RESULTS: The cohort comprised 296 infants with a median gestational age of 25 3/7 weeks. Expressed as daily intakes, every additional 10 kcal/kg/d of energy during days 4-6 was associated with 0.08 higher WSDS on day 7 (95% CI 0.06-0.11; p < 0.001). Between days 7 and 27, every 10 kcal/kg/d increase in energy intake was associated with a reduced risk of BPD of 9% (95% CI 1-16; p = 0.029) and any grade of ROP with a reduced risk of 6% (95% CI 2-9; p = 0.005) in multivariable models. This association was statistically significant in infants with <=10 days of mechanical ventilation. In infants with >10 days of mechanical ventilation, a combined higher intake of energy and protein was associated with a reduced risk of BPD., CONCLUSION: Early provision of energy and protein may reduce postnatal weight loss and risk of morbidity in extremely preterm infants.

Previous studies have shown that it is found in the peripheral circulation in patients with pulmonary disease, likely because of translocation into the blood when lung epithelial barriers are disrupted by inflammation or acute injury. In adults, serum SP-D levels are biomarkers for the progression and severity of chronic lung disease. In neonates, elevated SP-D levels in cord blood and on day 1 have been associated with prenatal risk factors and with an increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome and infections. It is not known whether serum SP-D during the first week of life is a marker for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease of prematurity that is associated with lung parenchymal maldevelopment and injury., OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to determine whether serum SP-D on days 3 and 7 of life are associated with the development of BPD in preterm infants., DESIGN/METHODS: Serum samples were obtained on postnatal days 3 and 7 from 106 preterm infants (500-2000 g birth weight, 23-32-week gestation). SP-D was quantified by Western blot. BPD was determined at 36 weeks PMA using NICHD criteria., RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 1145 +/- 347 g and gestational age 29.2 +/- 7.4 weeks. BPD was diagnosed in 7 and \"BPD or death\" in 16 infants. Days 3 and 7 values tracked significantly (r = 0.648), and did not correlate with birth weight or gestational age. Contrary to expectations, serum SP-D was not associated with BPD. Significant gender differences were noted, with SP-D dropping from day 3 to day 7 in males, while increasing in females (p < .05)., CONCLUSION: Elevated serum SP-D does not appear to be a useful marker for BPD. Decreasing serum SP-D levels in males, as compared to females, during the first week of life are likely related to gender differences in lung maturation, consistent with the higher incidence of BPD in males.","group":"g1","id":"b8f1a667-5ea2-4740-9fe5-bc052805af99","_showDetails":false},"fd425eb9-0b44-43f3-b45f-f81ecba5ff95":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Inhibition of microRNA-29a alleviates hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonatal mice via upregulation of GAB1.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10020-019-0127-9","authors":["Hu, Yu","Xie, Liang","Yu, Jing","Fu, Hongling","Zhou, Dan","Liu, Hanmin"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20191231//","keywords":["3' Untranslated Regions","*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/ge [Genetics]","*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/me [Metabolism]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/cy [Cytology]","*Alveolar Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Antagomirs/pd [Pharmacology]","Apoptosis","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Cell Line","Cell Proliferation","Computer Simulation","Dependovirus/ge [Genetics]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Gene Expression Regulation","Genetic Vectors/pd [Pharmacology]","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Male","Mice","MicroRNAs/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","*MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)","volume":"26","number":"1","isbn":"1076-1551","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=31892308"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The main features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are alveolar simplification, pulmonary growth arrest, and abnormal lung function. Multiple studies have highlighted microRNA-29 (miR-29) as a potential biomarker for lung diseases and cancers. Upregulation of miR-29a has been known to downregulate GRB2-associated-binding protein 1 (GAB1), which is often highly expressed in the lung. The current study was designed to investigate the potential role of miR-29a in hyperoxia-induced BPD by targeting GAB1 in a neonatal mouse model., METHODS: The expression of miR-29a and GAB1 in lung tissues of neonatal mice with hyperoxia-induced BPD and mouse alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12) was determined using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Subsequently, the relationship between miR-29a and GAB1 was verified using in silico analysis. In order to assess the effects of miR-29a or GAB1 on BPD, the pathological characteristics of alveoli, as well as proliferation and apoptosis of cells were measured through gain- and loss-of-function studies., RESULTS: Upregulation of miR-29a and downregulation of GAB1 were evident in both lung tissues and MLE-12 cells following BPD modeling. GAB1 was a direct target gene of miR-29a. Inhibition of miR-29a and overexpression of GAB1 were shown to alleviate lung injury, promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis but reduce chord length in lung tissues of neonatal mice following hyperoxia-induced BPD modeling., CONCLUSION: Altogether, down-regulation of miR-29a can potentially elevate GAB1 expression, reducing cell apoptosis and stimulating proliferation, ultimately retarding the development of BPD in mice. This study highlights the potential of a promising new target for preventing BPD.","group":"g1","id":"fd425eb9-0b44-43f3-b45f-f81ecba5ff95","_showDetails":false},"aed80696-8972-4090-bd33-8cff19260ba6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Duration of significant patent ductus arteriosus and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41372-019-0496-5","authors":["Mirza, Hussnain","Garcia, Jorge","McKinley, Genevieve","Hubbard, Laura","Sensing, Wendla","Schneider, Jordan","Oh, William","Wadhawan, Rajan"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190925//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/co [Complications]","Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/mo [Mortality]","Female","Humans","*Infant, Extremely Premature","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature, Diseases/mo [Mortality]","*Infant, Premature, Diseases","Logistic Models","Male","Multivariate Analysis","Retrospective Studies","Risk Factors","Time Factors"],"journal":"Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association","volume":"39","number":"12","isbn":"0743-8346","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=31554913"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the association between the duration of significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely preterm infants., METHODS: All extremely preterm infants (<29 weeks) treated in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit from January 2013 to March 2016 were included if their PDA status was confirmed at <7 days of life.

Although IL-33-mediated promotion of type 2 immune responses has been well established, a gap in our knowledge regarding the functional diversity of this pleiotropic cytokine remains. To address this gap, we developed a new IL-33 transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of full-length IL-33 is induced in lung epithelial cells under conditional control. In adult mice, an ~3-fold increase in the steady-state IL-33 levels produced no pathologic effects in the lungs. When exposed to airborne allergens, adult transgenic mice released more IL-33 extracellularly and exhibited robust type 2 immune responses. In neonatal transgenic mice, up to postnatal day 14, a similar increase in steady-state IL-33 levels resulted in increased mortality, enlarged alveolar spaces resembling bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and altered expression of genes associated with tissue morphogenesis. Processed 25-kDa IL-33 protein was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids without any exogenous stimuli, and pathologic changes were abolished in mice deficient in the IL-33 receptor ST2. These findings suggest that adult lungs are relatively resistant to IL-33 overexpression unless they encounter environmental insults, whereas developing lungs are highly susceptible, with IL-33 overexpression resulting in detrimental and pathologic outcomes.

Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. The pooled odds ratio and standard mean difference were calculated to compare dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. In addition, we also assessed the heterogeneity and publication bias and carried out sensitivity analysis for each related factor. Results: We included 45 studies with 87,419 individuals. After the primary analysis and a series of adjustments, results showed chorioamnionitis, lower gestational age, lower birth weight, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, surfactant treatment, ventilation, and lower platelet count had a positive correlation with PDA, while small for gestational age decreased the incidence of PDA in preterm infants. Besides, premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, antenatal steroids, male gender, mean platelet volume, and platelet distribution width were found to have no statistically significant relationship with PDA. Conclusion:  Preterm infants with more immature characteristics generally have a higher likelihood to develop PDA. The prevention, diagnosis, and management of PDA may depend on these results, and effective measures can be taken accordingly.

Hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats has been used as a model of BPD, as indicated by lung architectural change and alveolar simplification that resembles clinical feature of BPD. s-defensin-2 (BD2) plays an important role in lung diseases by inhibiting inflammation response. However, little is known about its role in BPD. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of human BD2 (hBD2) gene on hyperoxia-induced animal model of BPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS The neonatal rats were exposed to 90% oxygen (O2) continuously for 14 days to mimic the BPD-like lung injury. These rats were then randomly assigned to the following four groups: in room air (air), in 90% O2, in 90% O2 with null adenovirus vector infection (O2+Ad), and in 90% O2 with gene therapy through adenovirus transfected hBD2 (O2+Ad-hBD2). Morphology of lungs, pulmonary function and expression of inflammatory cytokines on P7, P10, P14, and P21 were documented and compared across the 4 groups. RESULTS The overexpression of hBD2 mediated by the adenovirus vector was successfully constructed. hBD2 gene therapy increased hBD2 mRNA expression, increased radial alveolar count (RAC), lung volume and compliance, decreased mean linear intercept (MLI), tissue damping, and elastance. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1s, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were inhibited and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 was increased in the lungs of rats in O2+Ad-hBD2 group. CONCLUSIONS In hyperoxia-induced rat models of BPD, hBD2 promotes alveolarization and improves pulmonary function. The mechanism may contribute in alleviating inflammation response and inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors including IL-1s, IL-6, and TNF-alpha.","group":"g1","id":"f66afaa8-6f38-4e53-8d6c-18abc6d36fd9","_showDetails":false},"322840c3-31a9-492b-81b9-28fe808322c2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Upper Airway Pathology Contributes to Respiratory Symptoms in Children Born Very Preterm.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2019.06.048","authors":["Simpson, Shannon J","Champion, Zoe","Hall, Graham L","French, Noel","Reynolds, Victoria"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190808//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","Child","*Dysphonia/ep [Epidemiology]","Female","Humans","Infant, Extremely Premature","Infant, Newborn","Male","*Respiration Disorders/ep [Epidemiology]","Risk Factors","Spirometry","Voice Quality"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"213","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=31402143"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of upper airway dysfunction, indicated by altered vocal quality (dysphonia), on the respiratory symptoms of children surviving very preterm birth., STUDY DESIGN: Children born <32 weeks of gestation participated in 2 separate assessments during midchildhood.

The frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms in arginase-1 (ARG1 rs2781666) and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1 rs480414) genes has been found to differ in a cohort of bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients with pulmonary hypertension (cases) and without pulmonary hypertension (controls). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that combining these genotypes with phenotypic data would better predict pulmonary hypertension in bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients., METHODS: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients (n = 79) born at <35 weeks gestation were studied. Pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed by echocardiographic criteria (n = 20). ROC curves to predict pulmonary hypertension in bronchopulmonary dysplasia were generated from genotype and/or clinical data., RESULTS: Cases were born at an earlier gestation and weighed less at birth than did controls. ROC curves for rs2781666 had an AUC of 0.61, while rs480414 had an AUC of 0.66. Together, the AUC was 0.70. When clinical data were added to the genetic model, AUC was 0.73., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that ROC predictive modelling of pulmonary hypertension in bronchopulmonary dysplasia improves with inclusion of both genotypic and phenotypic data.

This study aimed to investigate the role of IL-33 in the lungs of neonatal mice with hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-four C57BL/6 baby mice were randomly separated into three groups: the on-air group (N=16); the O2 group (N=8); and the O2 + anti-IL-33 group (N=8). Forced mechanical ventilation with oxygen-rich air (MV-O2) was used in 16 mouse pups. The mouse pups were incubated in containers with either air or 85% O2 for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after birth. At the end of the treatment period, the mouse lungs were studied by histology, Western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to examine the expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, chemokine (CC motif) ligand 1 (CXCL-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). RESULTS Following forced MV-O2, increased levels of IL-33 in whole mouse lungs were associated with impaired alveolar growth and with changes consistent with BPD, including reduced numbers of enlarged alveoli, increased apoptosis, and increased expression of IL-1beta, CXCL-1, and MCP-1. IL-33 inhibition improved alveolar development in hyperoxia-impaired lungs and suppressed IL-1beta and MCP-1 expression and was associated with increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, reduced pulmonary NF-kappaB activity and decreased expression of the TGF-beta inhibitor SMAD-7 in forced MV-O2 exposed mouse pups. CONCLUSIONS IL-33 increased hyperoxia-induced BPD in newborn mice by regulation of the expression of inflammatory mediators.","group":"g1","id":"22a2e4b6-d4ff-4beb-90d7-161f4244900c","_showDetails":false},"ed047833-d5ec-4af6-9915-e14f7fe63fec":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Protective role of glucocorticosteroid prior to endotoxin exposure in cultured neonatal type II alveolar epithelial cells.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2018.08.004","authors":["He, Liming","Dong, Ying","Wu, Wenqian","Zhang, Ling","Sun, Bo"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180818//","keywords":["*Alveolar Epithelial Cells/de [Drug Effects]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Animals","Apoptosis/de [Drug Effects]","Cells, Cultured","Cytokines/bi [Biosynthesis]","Cytokines/ge [Genetics]","*Dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","Dose-Response Relationship, Drug","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Lipopolysaccharides/pd [Pharmacology]","Male","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/bi [Biosynthesis]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Swine"],"journal":"Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics","volume":"52","isbn":"1094-5539","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=30130572"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone (DEX) is widely used for antenatal lung maturation and has been investigated to prevent premature lung injury by inhibiting postnatal inflammation. Its pharmacological mechanisms in the treatment of bacterial infection-induced injury of neonatal lung parenchymal cells remain to be clarified. We hypothesized that DEX pretreatment may attenuate endotoxin-induced growth suppression and regulate cytokine mRNA expression in cultured neonatal type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-II)., METHODS: AEC-II of newborn piglets were freshly isolated and cultured. After pretreatment of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mumol/l DEX (E0.01, E0.1, E1.0 and E10 group, respectively) for 24h, the cells were cultured with 1mug/ml lipopolysaccharides (LPS) for 7 days with medium replacement every 24h. Messenger RNA expression of surfactant proteins (SPs), pro-inflammatory cytokines and multiple growth factors (GF) were determined by RT-PCR, along with the cell growth and apoptosis measurements., RESULTS: LPS without DEX pretreatment suppressed cell proliferation, enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and apoptosis, which was ameliorated in all DEX-pretreated groups on day 3. On day 3 and 5, only cells pretreated by E1.0 and E10 showed a 20-fold increase in insulin-like GF-1 mRNA expression whereas the expression of other GFs was down-regulated. LPS exposure reduced the expression of SP-A, B, C and Aquaporin-5 mRNA on day 3-7. However, the expression of SP-C mRNA was increased in E1.0 on day 3, which was supported by in situ expression of pro-SP-C with immunocytochemical assay., CONCLUSION: LPS-induced in vitro AEC-II injury was partially prevented by DEX pretreatment, with 1.0 mumol/l being the potentially optimal concentration.

Recent studies have established MSC exosomes (EXO), as one of the main therapeutic vectors of MSCs in mouse models of multifactorial chronic lung disease of preterm infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the mechanisms underlying MSC-EXO therapeutic action are not completely understood. Using a neonatal mouse model of human BPD, we evaluated the therapeutic efficiency of early gestational age (GA) human umbilical cord (hUC)-derived MSC EXO fraction and its exosomal factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6)., METHODS: Conditioned media (CM) and EXO fractions were isolated from 25 and 30 weeks GA hUC-MSC cultures grown in serum-free media (SFM) for 24 h. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (> 95% oxygen) and were given intraperitoneal injections of MSC-CM or MSC-CM EXO fractions at postnatal (PN) day 2 and PN4. They were then returned to room air until PN14 (in a mouse model of severe BPD). The treatment regime was followed with (rh)TSG-6, TSG-6-neutralizing antibody (NAb), TSG-6 (si)RNA-transfected MSC-CM EXO and their appropriate controls. Echocardiography was done at PN14 followed by harvesting of lung, heart and brain for assessment of pathology parameters., RESULTS: Systemic administration of CM or EXO in the neonatal BPD mouse model resulted in robust improvement in lung, cardiac and brain pathology. Hyperoxia-exposed BPD mice exhibited pulmonary inflammation accompanied by alveolar-capillary leakage, increased chord length, and alveolar simplification, which was ameliorated by MSC CM/EXO treatment. Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy was also corrected. Cell death in brain was decreased and the hypomyelination reversed. Importantly, we detected TSG-6, an immunomodulatory glycoprotein, in EXO. Administration of TSG-6 attenuated BPD and its associated pathologies, in lung, heart and brain. Knockdown of TSG-6 by NAb or by siRNA in EXO abrogated the therapeutic effects of EXO, suggesting TSG-6 as an important therapeutic molecule., CONCLUSIONS: Preterm hUC-derived MSC-CM EXO alleviates hyperoxia-induced BPD and its associated pathologies, in part, via exosomal factor TSG-6. The work indicates early systemic intervention with TSG-6 as a robust option for cell-free therapy, particularly for treating BPD.","group":"g1","id":"1f49f55d-89d5-44af-8eb8-f01e8cb7f120","_showDetails":false},"439e7f56-3f84-4f8b-ba0f-cfa0d51dd7d6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Antifungal Treatment and Outcome in Very Low Birth Weight Infants: A Population-based Observational Study of the German Neonatal Network.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/INF.0000000000002001","authors":["Fortmann, Ingmar","Hartz, Annika","Paul, Pia","Pulzer, Ferdinand","Muller, Andreas","Bottger, Ralf","Proquitte, Hans","Dawczynski, Kristin","Simon, Arne","Rupp, Jan","Herting, Egbert","Gopel, Wolfgang","Hartel, Christoph","German Neonatal Network"],"date":"2018//","keywords":["*Antifungal Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Candida/de [Drug Effects]","Candidiasis/dt [Drug Therapy]","Candidiasis/mo [Mortality]","Child, Preschool","Cohort Studies","Female","Fluconazole/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Follow-Up Studies","Germany/ep [Epidemiology]","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature, Diseases/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/mi [Microbiology]","*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Male","*Mycoses/dt [Drug Therapy]","Mycoses/ep [Epidemiology]","Population Health","Risk Factors","*Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","volume":"37","number":"11","isbn":"0891-3668","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=29601449"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The diagnostic proof of fungal infection in preterm infants is difficult. Antifungal treatment (AFT) is often initiated empirically when infants with suspected infection do not improve despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. It was the aim of our study to determine the rate of exposure to empirical AFT in a large cohort of very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) of the German Neonatal Network and to address associated risks and outcomes., METHODS: The epidemiologic database consisted of n = 13,343 VLBWI born in 54 German Neonatal Network centers between 2009 and 2015. AFT was defined as number of neonates who got any dose of at least one of the following antifungal drugs: fluconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin (denominator: number of infants enrolled in German Neonatal Network) for treatment (not prophylaxis) of (suspected) fungal infection. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for exposure to AFT and associated short-term morbidities and long-term outcomes at 5-year follow-up., RESULTS: In our cohort, 724 out of 13,343 (5.4%) VLBWI were exposed to empiric AFT and had a mean gestational age of 25.7 (+/-2.1) weeks. Forty-four out of 13,343 (0.3%) had proven bloodstream infection with Candida spp. The main risk factors for exposure to AFT were gestational age, postnatal steroid treatment, need for abdominal surgery and use of carbapenems. Notably, AFT was associated with adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-2.3; P < 0.001) and retinopathy of prematurity requiring intervention (adjusted OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.3-2.3; P <0.001) but not mortality. In the subgroup of infants available for 5-year follow-up (n = 895), exposure to AFT was associated with a risk for cerebral palsy (adjusted OR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.11-7.04; P = 0.04) and intelligence quotient < 85 (adjusted OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01-4.28; P = 0.049)., CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of VLBWI is exposed to AFT, specifically those born <26 weeks. Exposed infants were found to have a higher risk for adverse outcomes, which may reflect their significant vulnerability in general. Given the observational design of our study, it remains unclear whether potential side effects of empirical or target AFT itself contribute to adverse outcome. Future studies need to include risk-based strategies and stewardship programs to restrict the use of antifungal management in VLBWI.","group":"g1","id":"439e7f56-3f84-4f8b-ba0f-cfa0d51dd7d6","_showDetails":false},"8d9e463c-364c-4a8a-b5be-297ae6a65a48":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Impact of SMOFLipid on Pulmonary Alveolar Development in Newborn Guinea Pigs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpen.1153","authors":["Lavoie, Jean-Claude","Mohamed, Ibrahim","Nuyt, Anne-Monique","Elremaly, Wesam","Rouleau, Therese"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180313//","keywords":["Aldehydes/ae [Adverse Effects]","Aldehydes/an [Analysis]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Caspases/me [Metabolism]","Catheterization, Central Venous","*Drug Stability","Emulsions/ae [Adverse Effects]","Emulsions/ch [Chemistry]","*Fatty Acids, Omega-6/ae [Adverse Effects]","Fatty Acids, Omega-6/ch [Chemistry]","Glutathione/me [Metabolism]","Guinea Pigs","Humans","Infant Health","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Light","Oxidants/ae [Adverse Effects]","Oxidants/ch [Chemistry]","Oxidation-Reduction","*Oxidative Stress","*Parenteral Nutrition/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Parenteral Nutrition Solutions/ae [Adverse Effects]","Peroxides/ae [Adverse Effects]","Peroxides/an [Analysis]","*Phospholipids/ae [Adverse Effects]","Phospholipids/ch [Chemistry]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","*Soybean Oil/ae [Adverse Effects]","Soybean Oil/ch [Chemistry]"],"journal":"JPEN.

In animals, PN leads to alveolar loss following stimulation of apoptosis by oxidative stress (oxidized redox potential). Peroxides and aldehydes generated in PN can induce hypo-alveolarization. The implication of peroxides, which is reduced by light protection, is demonstrated. The implication of aldehydes from omega-6 fatty acids oxidation is expected. The hypothesis is that composition and light exposure of PN influences bronchopulmonary dysplasia development. Since SMOFLipid (SMOF) contains a lower amount of omega-6 fatty acids than Intralipid (IL), the aim was to compare, the impacts of PN compounded with SMOF or IL, photo-protected or not, on alveolar development., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-day-old Guinea pigs received PN, photo-protected or not, made with SMOF or IL through a jugular vein catheter. After 4 days, lungs were sampled for determinations of redox potential of glutathione, apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9) and alveolarization index (histology: number of intercepts/mm)., RESULTS: Compared with IL, SMOF induces a greater oxidation of redox potential (-200 +/- 1 versus [vs] -205 +/- 1 mV), apoptosis (caspase-3: 0.27 +/- 0.04 vs 0.16 +/- 0.02; caspase-9: 0.47 +/- 0.03 vs 0.30 +/- 0.03), and a lower alveolarization index (27.2 +/- 0.8 vs 30.0 +/- 0.9). Photo-protection prevented activation of caspase-9 and was statistically without effect on redox potential, caspase-3, and alveolarization index., CONCLUSION: In our model, SMOF is pro-oxidant and induces hypo-alveolarization following exaggerated apoptosis. These results highlight the need for further studies before introducing SMOFLipid in standard neonatal care.

This compound possesses potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Supplemental oxygen is routinely administered to premature infants with pulmonary insufficiency. However, hyperoxia is one of the major risk factors for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is also termed chronic lung disease in premature infants. Currently, no preventive approaches have been reported against BPD. The treatment of BPD is notably limited to oxygen administration, ventilatory support, and steroids. Since QU has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in various disease models, we hypothesized that the postnatal QU treatment of newborn mice will protect against hyperoxic lung injury by the upregulation of the phase I (CYP1A/B) and/or phase II, NADPH quinone reductase enzymes. Newborn C57BL/6J mice within 24h of birth with the nursing dams were exposed to either 21% O2 (air) and/or 85% O2 (hyperoxia) for 7 days. The mice were treated, intraperitoneally (i.p.) once every other day with quercetin, at a concentration of 20mg/kg, or saline alone from postnatal day (PND) 2-6. The mice were sacrificed on day 7, and lung and liver tissues were collected. The expression levels of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, NQO1 proteins and mRNA as well as the levels of MDA-protein adducts were analyzed in lung and liver tissues. The findings indicated that QU attenuated hyperoxia-mediated lung injury by reducing inflammation and improving alveolarization with decreased number of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. The attenuation of this lung injury correlated with the upregulation of CYP1A1/CYP1B1/NQO1 mRNA, proteins and the down regulation of NF-kB levels and MDA-protein adducts in lung and liver tissues. The present study demonstrated the potential therapeutic value of quercetin in the prevention and/or treatment of BPD. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to explore whether fucoidan could alleviate hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn rats., METHODS: Lung wet-weight/dry-weight (W/D) ratio, total protein (TP) content, total cell counts, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are used to evaluate lung injury. Masson staining is used to evaluate lung fibrotic. Tunnel assay and Hoechst 33258 assay were used to evaluate apoptosis. The levels of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) were measured using ELISA to assess oxidative stress. Western blot assay was used to detect apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-1, Bax, and myofibroblast proteins alpha-SMA., RESULTS: The data indicating fucoidan treatment remarkably reduces the lung W/D ratio and TP content, total cell counts, and LDH levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Also, fucoidan treatment significantly inhibited cell apoptosis with the elevated expression of Bcl-2/Bax in cultured lung fibroblasts. Moreover, treatment with fucoidan suppressed the levels of MDA significantly and elevated the level of SOD and GSH, showing that oxidative stress was restrained by fucoidan. Furthermore, the decreased expression levels of alpha-SMA and collagen I was detected in fibroblast treated with fucoidan., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest fucoidan may protect the lung from hyperoxia via suppressing cell apoptosis, mitigating oxidative stress, and inhibiting lung fibroblasts from differentiating into myofibroblasts.

No new data concerning use of palivizumab on a national scale have been published since the 2007 update of the national guidelines., OBJECTIVES: To describe palivizumab administration for RSV prophylaxis during the first RSV season in infants born prematurely in France in 2011., METHODS: Infants from the national population-based cohort EPIPAGE-2 born at<=34 weeks' gestation, discharged home before 31 March 2012 and followed-up at 1year were included. The RSV season ran from 1 October 2011 to 31 March 2012. Prophylaxis was deemed \"initiated\" if the infant had received at least one dose of palivizumab during this period and \"complete\" if it had received at least five doses or as many doses as the number of exposed months. The reference documents were the MA and French Transparency Committee guidelines (TC)., RESULTS: Prophylaxis was indicated in 3586 of 3608 infants (99.7%) according to the MA and 1315 of 3608 (16.7%) according to the TC.

The rate of complete prophylaxis was 77.2%. The factors associated with prophylaxis initiation were low gestational age, low birthweight, high maternal educational level, type of neonatal unit, and date at discharge. Factors associated with complete prophylaxis were respiratory impairment, high educational level, and characteristics related to living conditions (absence of siblings at home, type of childcare)., CONCLUSIONS: Palivizumab administration in France generally conformed with TC guidelines, but could be further improved for infants born at 27-32 weeks' gestation without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Using a library of human normal and diseased human lung samples, we identified a distinct signature of nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin phosphorylated at tyrosine 489 and epithelial cell cytosolic localization of beta-catenin phosphorylated at tyrosine 654 in early normal lung development and fibrotic lung diseases BPD and IPF. Furthermore, this signature was recapitulated in murine models of BPD and IPF. Image analysis of immunofluorescence colocalization demonstrated a consistent pattern of elevated nuclear phosphorylated beta-catenin in the lung epithelium and surrounding mesenchyme in BPD and IPF, closely resembling the pattern observed in 18-week fetal lung. Nuclear beta-catenin phosphorylated at tyrosine 489 associated with an increased expression of Wnt target gene AXIN2, suggesting that the observed beta-catenin signature is of functional significance during normal development and injury repair. The association of specific modifications of beta-catenin during normal lung development and again in response to lung injury supports the widely held concept that repair of lung injury involves the recapitulation of developmental programs. Furthermore, these observations suggest that beta-catenin phosphorylation has potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of both BPD and IPF.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Neonatal rat AEC II cells were isolated and identified by detecting surfactant protein C (SP-C). Three small interfering RNAs targeting Notch 1 were synthesized and transfected into AEC II. A hyperoxia-exposed AEC II cell injury model was established and was divided into 8 groups. MDA levels and SOD activity were examined using lipid peroxidation assay kits. Apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were evaluated using flow cytometry. Notch 1 mRNA expression was examined using RT-PCR. Homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum protein (HERP) was examined using Western blot analysis. RESULTS CGRP treatment significantly enhanced MDA levels and decreased SOD activity compared to hyperoxia-treated AEC II cells (P<0.05). CGRP treatment significantly inhibited hyperoxia-induced AEC II cell apoptosis, and significantly suppressed hyperoxia-induced ROS production compared to hyperoxia-treated AEC II cells (P<0.05) either undergoing g secretase inhibitor or Notch RNA interference. CGRP significantly triggered Notch 1 mRNA expression and significantly enhanced HERP expression compared to hyperoxia-treated AEC II cells (P<0.05) either undergoing g secretase inhibitor or Notch RNA interference.

While human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) have shown promise in small and large animal models of BPD, there is scarce information on long-term benefit and clinically relevant questions surrounding administration strategy remain unanswered. In assessing the therapeutic potential of hAECs, we investigated the impact of cell dosage, administration routes and timing of treatment in a pre-clinical model of BPD., METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide was introduced intra-amniotically at day 16 of pregnancy prior to exposure to 65% oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth. hAECs were administered either 12 hours (early) or 4 days (late) after hyperoxia commenced. Collective lung tissues were subjected to histological analysis, multikine ELISA for inflammatory cytokines, FACS for immune cell populations and 3D lung stem cell culture at neonatal stage (postnatal day 7 and 14). Invasive lung function test and echocardiography were applied at 6 and 10 weeks of age., RESULTS: hAECs improved the tissue-to-airspace ratio and septal crest density in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of administration route. Early administration of hAECs, coinciding with the commencement of postnatal hyperoxia, was associated with reduced macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells. This was not the case if hAECs were administered when lung injury was established. Fittingly, early hAEC treatment was more efficacious in reducing interleukin-1beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels. Early hAEC treatment was also associated with reduced airway hyper-responsiveness and normalisation of pressure-volume loops. Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle hypertrophy were also prevented in the early hAEC treatment group, and this persisted until 10 weeks of age., CONCLUSIONS: Early hAEC treatment appears to be advantageous over late treatment. There was no difference in efficacy between intravenous and intratracheal administration. The benefits of hAEC administration resulted in long-term improvements in cardiorespiratory function.","group":"g1","id":"e9b7d011-2693-40c2-801c-adf937c94844","_showDetails":false},"68ff45aa-f2f7-4c85-b9e1-1f59512f3b35":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Spot protein-creatinine ratio and spot albumin-creatinine ratio in the assessment of pre-eclampsia: a diagnostic accuracy study with decision-analytic model-based economic evaluation and acceptability analysis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3310/hta21610","authors":["Waugh, Jason","Hooper, Richard","Lamb, Edmund","Robson, Stephen","Shennan, Andrew","Milne, Fiona","Price, Christopher","Thangaratinam, Shakila","Berdunov, Vladislav","Bingham, Jenn"],"date":"2017//","keywords":["Adult","*Albuminuria/di [Diagnosis]","Albuminuria/ur [Urine]","Cost-Benefit Analysis","Creatinine/ur [Urine]","*Creatinine","*Diagnostic Tests, Routine/st [Standards]","England","Female","Humans","*Pre-Eclampsia/di [Diagnosis]","Pre-Eclampsia/ur [Urine]","Pregnancy","Prospective Studies","*Proteinuria/di [Diagnosis]","Proteinuria/ur [Urine]","Sensitivity and Specificity"],"journal":"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)","volume":"21","number":"61","isbn":"1366-5278","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=29064366"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines highlighted the need for 'large, high-quality prospective studies comparing the various methods of measuring proteinuria in women with new-onset hypertensive disorders during pregnancy'., OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate quantitative assessments of spot protein-creatinine ratio (SPCR) and spot albumin-creatinine ratio (SACR) in predicting severe pre-eclampsia (PE) compared with 24-hour urine protein measurement. The secondary objectives were to investigate interlaboratory assay variation, to evaluate SPCR and SACR thresholds in predicting adverse maternal and fetal outcomes and to assess the cost-effectiveness of these models., DESIGN: This was a prospective diagnostic accuracy cohort study, with decision-analytic modelling and a cost-effectiveness analysis., SETTING: The setting was 36 obstetric units in England, UK., PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women (aged >= 16 years), who were at > 20 weeks' gestation with confirmed gestational hypertension and trace or more proteinuria on an automated dipstick urinalysis., INTERVENTIONS: Women provided a spot urine sample for protein analysis (the recruitment sample) and were asked to collect a 24-hour urine sample, which was stored for secondary analysis. A further spot sample of urine was taken immediately before delivery., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome data were collected from hospital records. There were four index tests on a spot sample of urine: (1) SPCR test (conducted at the local laboratory); (2) SPCR test [conducted at the central laboratory using the benzethonium chloride (BZC) assay]; (3) SPCR test [conducted at the central laboratory using the pyrogallol red (PGR) assay]; and (4) SACR test (conducted at the central laboratory using an automated chemistry analyser). The comparator tests on 24-hour urine collection were a central test using the BZC assay and a central test using the PGR assay. The primary reference standard was the NICE definition of severe PE. Secondary reference standards were a clinician diagnosis of severe PE, which is defined as treatment with magnesium sulphate or with severe PE protocol; adverse perinatal outcome; one or more of perinatal or infant mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis or grade III/IV intraventricular haemorrhage; and economic cost and outcomes. Health service data on service use and costs followed published economic models., RESULTS: In total, 959 women were available for primary analysis and 417 of them had severe PE. The diagnostic accuracy of the four assays on spot urine samples against the reference standards was similar. The three SPCR tests had sensitivities in excess of 90% at prespecified thresholds, with poor specificities and negative likelihood ratios of >= 0.1. The SACR test had a significantly higher sensitivity of 99% (confidence interval 98% to 100%) and lower specificity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were similar (area under ROC curve between 0.87 and 0.89); the area under the central laboratory's SACR curve was significantly higher (p = 0.004). The central laboratory's SACR test was the most cost-effective option, generating an additional 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years at an additional cost of 45.07 compared with the local laboratory's SPCR test. The probabilistic analysis showed it to have a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the standard willingness-to-pay threshold recommended by NICE., LIMITATIONS: Implementation of NICE guidelines has led to an increased intervention rate in the study population that affected recruitment rates and led to revised sample size calculations., CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this clinical study does not support the recommendation of 24-hour urine sample collection in hypertensive pregnant women. The SACR test had better diagnostic performance when predicting severe pre-eclampsia. All four tests could potentially be used as rule-out tests for the NICE definition of severe PE., FUTURE WORK: Testing SACR at a threshold of 8 mg/mmol should be studied as a 'rule-out' test of proteinuria., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82607486., FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 21, No. 61.

In the United States, the prevalence of allergic asthma (AA) is inexplicably rising and in utero exposure to cigarette smoke increases the risk of AA and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in children and animal models. We reported that gestational exposure to sidestream cigarette smoke (SS), or secondhand smoke, promoted nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent exacerbation of AA and BPD in mice. Recently, perinatal nicotine injections in rats were reported to induce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-dependent transgenerational transmission of asthma. Herein, we show that first generation and second generation progeny from gestationally SS-exposed mice exhibit exacerbated AA and BPD that is not dependent on the decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma levels. Lungs from these mice show strong eosinophilic infiltration, excessive Th2 polarization, marked airway hyperresponsiveness, alveolar simplification, decreased lung compliance, and decreased lung angiogenesis. At the molecular level, these changes are associated with increased RUNX3 expression, alveolar cell apoptosis, and the antiangiogenic factor GAX, and decreased expression of HIF-1alpha and proangiogenic factors NF-kappaB and VEGFR2 in the 7-d first generation and second generation lungs. Moreover, the lungs from these mice exhibit lower levels of microRNA (miR)-130a and increased levels of miR-16 and miR-221. These miRs regulate HIF-1alpha-regulated apoptotic, angiogenic, and immune pathways. Thus the intergenerational effects of gestational SS involve epigenetic regulation of HIF-1alpha through specific miRs contributing to increased incidence of AA and BPD in the progenies.

Visitation is not usually permitted or may be strictly limited, and NICU care for most neonates is provided by health-care professionals with little participation of the parents. An exception to this rule is the level 2 \"Room-In\" ward in Qilu Children's Hospital, Shandong University, where parents have 24-hour access to their infants and participate in providing care., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the outcomes of infants who were admitted to the NICU and remained there throughout their stay (NICU-NICU group, n=428), admitted to the NICU and then transferred to the Room-In ward (NICU-RIn group, n=1018), or admitted straight to the Room-In ward (RIn only group, n=629)., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the rates of nosocomial infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity between the NICU-NICU and NICU-RIn groups. The rate of necrotizing enterocolitis was significantly lower in the NICU-RIn group (P=0.04), while weight gain and duration of hospital stay were significantly higher (both P<0.001). Rates of adverse outcomes were lower in RIn-only infants due to their low severity of illness on admission., CONCLUSIONS: Allowing parents access to their infant in the NICU is feasible and safe in China, and may result in improvements in infant outcomes. Further studies are required to generate stronger evidence that can inform changes to neonatal care in China.","group":"g1","id":"4fefb2eb-ed1a-4512-b52d-8b95bb5ad5e2","_showDetails":false},"d04dfaba-b61c-4731-b5b8-c931547226e6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Fgf10 deficiency is causative for lethality in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/path.4834","authors":["Chao, Cho-Ming","Yahya, Faady","Moiseenko, Alena","Tiozzo, Caterina","Shrestha, Amit","Ahmadvand, Negah","El Agha, Elie","Quantius, Jennifer","Dilai, Salma","Kheirollahi, Vahid","Jones, Matthew","Wilhem, Jochen","Carraro, Gianni","Ehrhardt, Harald","Zimmer, Klaus-Peter","Barreto, Guillermo","Ahlbrecht, Katrin","Morty, Rory E","Herold, Susanne","Abellar, Rosanna G","Seeger, Werner","Schermuly, Ralph","Zhang, Jin-San","Minoo, Parviz","Bellusci, Saverio"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20161126//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Cells, Cultured","Disease Models, Animal","Female","*Fibroblast Growth Factor 10/df [Deficiency]","Fibroblast Growth Factor 10/ge [Genetics]","Fibroblast Growth Factor 10/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression Regulation/ph [Physiology]","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Male","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Pulmonary Surfactants/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"The Journal of pathology","volume":"241","number":"1","isbn":"0022-3417","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=27770432"],"address":"England","abstract":"Inflammation-induced FGF10 protein deficiency is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurely born infants characterized by arrested alveolar development. So far, experimental evidence for a direct role of FGF10 in lung disease is lacking. Using the hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury as a mouse model of BPD, the impact of Fgf10 deficiency in Fgf10+/- versus Fgf10+/+ pups was investigated. In normoxia, no lethality of Fgf10+/+ or Fgf10+/- pups was observed. By contrast, all Fgf10+/- pups died within 8 days of hyperoxic injury, with lethality starting at day 5, whereas Fgf10+/+ pups were all alive. Lungs of pups from the two genotypes were collected on postnatal day 3 following normoxia or hyperoxia exposure for further analysis. In hyperoxia, Fgf10+/- lungs exhibited increased hypoalveolarization. Analysis by FACS of the Fgf10+/- versus control lungs in normoxia revealed a decreased ratio of alveolar epithelial type II (AECII) cells over total Epcam-positive cells. In addition, gene array analysis indicated reduced AECII and increased AECI transcriptome signatures in isolated AECII cells from Fgf10+/- lungs. Such an imbalance in differentiation is also seen in hyperoxia and is associated with reduced mature surfactant protein B and C expression. Attenuation of the activity of Fgfr2b ligands postnatally in the context of hyperoxia also led to increased lethality with decreased surfactant expression. In summary, decreased Fgf10 mRNA levels lead to congenital lung defects, which are compatible with postnatal survival, but which compromise the ability of the lungs to cope with sub-lethal hyperoxic injury. Fgf10 deficiency affects quantitatively and qualitatively the formation of AECII cells. In addition, Fgfr2b ligands are also important for repair after hyperoxia exposure in neonates.

The aim of our investigation is to probe the role and mechanism of lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in BPD. Methods: The current mouse model of BPD was simulated by induction of hyperoxia, and hyperoxia-induced mouse type II alveolar epithelial (MLE-12) (MLE-12) cells were established as a cellular model. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to determine relative expressions of TUG1, miR-29a-3p, and elastin (ELN). We assessed cell apoptosis by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Western blot was used for detection of apoptosis-related proteins. Moreover, cell viability was tested by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Inflammatory factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay was employed to confirm relationship between genes. Results: Upregulation of miR-29a-3p was found in lung tissues of BPD mice compared with lung tissues without BPD, while downregulations of TUG1 and ELN were discovered in BPD tissues in comparison with tissues without BPD. Increasing TUG1 was shown to alleviate lung injury of BPD mice and promote proliferation of hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells. Meanwhile, TUG1 inhibited inflammatory response and cell apoptosis in lung tissues of BPD mice and hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells. miR-29a-3p was targeted by TUG1 and negatively modulated by TUG1. ELN was inversely regulated by miR-29a-3p. Meantime, suppressive effects of TUG1 on apoptosis and inflammation were reversed by decreasing ELN or increasing miR-29a-3p in hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells. Conclusion:  lncRNA TUG1 relieved BPD through regulating the miR-29a-3p/ELN axis, which provided a therapeutic option to prevent or ameliorate BPD.

In a guinea pig model, it caused oxidized redox potential, increased apoptosis, and decreased alveolarization. AscOOH detoxification is carried out by glutathione peroxidase (GPX). We hypothesize that extremely preterm infants have limited capacity for AscOOH detoxification. Our objective was to determine if there is an association between an early level of urinary AscOOH and later development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 51 infants at <29 weeks of gestation. Baseline clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes data were collected. Urine samples were collected on days 3, 5, and 7 of life for urinary AscOOH. Blood samples on day 7 were collected for total plasma glutathione, GPX, and glutathione reductase. chi2, Student's t test, Spearman correlation ( r), linear regression (adjusted r2), and repeated-measure analysis of variance were used as appropriate. P < .05 was considered significant., RESULTS: Urinary AscOOH increased over time ( P = .001) and was higher in infants who later developed BPD or died ( P = .037). Compared with adults and full-term infants, total plasma glutathione concentration was low (median, 1.02 micromol/L; 25th-75th percentiles, 0.49-1.76 micromol/L), whereas GPX and glutathione reductase activities were sufficient (3.98 +/- 1.25 and 0.36 +/- 0.01 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Extremely preterm infants have low glutathione levels, which limit their capacity to detoxify AscOOH. Higher first-week urinary AscOOH levels are associated with an increased incidence of BPD or death.","group":"g1","id":"508b86c5-b59d-42a9-baaf-080536796a86","_showDetails":false},"ad00cc63-5983-4c3b-a1a7-a8b9b0d0be24":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2017 to 2019>","title":"The significance of IL-1beta +3953C>T, IL-6 -174G>C and -596G>A, TNF-alpha -308G>A gene polymorphisms and 86 bp variable number tandem repeat polymorphism of IL-1RN in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants born before 32 weeks of gestation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.5114/ceji.2017.67000","authors":["Szpecht, Dawid","Gadzinowski, Janusz","Nowak, Irmina","Cygan, Dorothy","Seremak-Mrozikiewicz, Agnieszka","Kurzawinska, Grazyna","Madajczak, Dariusz","Drews, Krzysztof","Szymankiewicz, Marta"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20170608//","journal":"Central-European journal of immunology","volume":"42","number":"3","isbn":"1426-3912","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm4&NEWS=N&AN=29204094"],"address":"Poland","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects primarily preterm infants.

Early detection of its risk factors and early treatment of its etiologies are major challenges. However, few studies in developing countries have provided data needed to tackle it. We aimed to determine the prevalence, predictors, etiologies and outcome of NRD in a tertiary health care centre of Cameroon., METHODS: We analyzed the hospital files of all newborns admitted to the Neonatal unit of Douala General Hospital from 1(st) January 2011 to 28(th) February 2013. NRD was diagnosed based on the presence of one or more of the following signs: an abnormal respiratory rate, expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, chest wall recessions and thoraco-abdominal asynchrony with or without cyanosis, in their files. Socio-demographic and clinical variables of newborns and their mothers were analyzed using logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: The prevalence of NRD was 47.5% out of the 703 newborns studied. Acute fetal distress, elective caesarean delivery, APGAR score < 7 at the 1(st) minute, prematurity, male gender and macrosomia were independent predictors of NRD. The main etiologies were neonatal infections (31%) and transient tachypnea of the newborn (25%). Its neonatal mortality rate was 24.5%, mainly associated with neonatal sepsis and hyaline membrane disease., CONCLUSION: NRD is a frequent emergency and causes high morbidity and mortality. Most of its risk factors and etiologies are preventable.

We observed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling protects newborn mice and primary fetal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) against hyperoxic injury. Additionally, a recent genome-wide transcriptome study in a newborn mouse model of BPD identified AhR as a key regulator of hyperoxia-induced gene dysregulation. Whether the AhR similarly deregulates genes in HPMEC is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize transcriptome level gene expression profile in AhR-sufficient and -deficient HPMEC exposed to normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Global gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina microarray platform and selected genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR. AhR gene expression and hyperoxia independently affected the expression of 540 and 593 genes, respectively. Two-way ANOVA further identified 85 genes that were affected by an interaction between AhR expression and exposure to hyperoxia. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology, and Reactome pathway analysis identified cell proliferation, immune function, cytokine signaling, and organ development as the major pathways affected in AhR-deficient cells. The biological processes that were significantly enriched by hyperoxia included metabolic process, stress response, signal transduction, cell cycle, and immune regulation. Cell cycle was the predominant pathway affected by the combined effect of AhR knockdown and hyperoxia. Functional analysis of cell cycle showed that AhR-deficient cells had decreased proliferation compared with AhR-sufficient cells. These findings suggest that AhR modulates hyperoxic lung injury by regulating the genes that are necessary for cell proliferation and inflammation. Copyright © The Author 2016.

We found that neonatal hyperoxia acutely initially diminished saccular TGF-beta signaling coincident with alveolar simplification. However, sustained hyperoxia resulted in a biphasic response and subsequent up-regulation of TGF-beta signaling, ultimately resulting in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Significantly, we found that the TGF-beta-induced matricellular protein (TGFBI) was similarly biphasically altered in response to hyperoxia. Moreover, genetic ablation revealed that TGFBI was required for normal alveolar structure and function. Although the phenotype was not neonatal lethal, Tgfbi-deficient lungs were morphologically abnormal. Mutant septal tips were stunted, lacked elastin-positive tips, exhibited reduced proliferation, and contained abnormally persistent alveolar alpha-smooth muscle actin myofibroblasts. In addition, Tgfbi-deficient lungs misexpressed TGF-beta-responsive follistatin and serpine 1, and transiently suppressed myofibroblast platelet-derived growth factor alpha differentiation marker. Finally, despite normal lung volume, Tgfbi-null lungs displayed diminished elastic recoil and gas exchange efficiency. Combined, these data demonstrate that initial suppression of the TGF-beta signaling apparatus, as well as loss of key TGF-beta effectors (like TGFBI), underlies early alveolar structural defects, as well as long-lasting functional deficits routinely observed in chronic lung disease of infancy patients.

Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, fibrin and collagen deposition, vascular leakage and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in LPA signalling and BPD pathogenesis., RESULTS: LPAR1-mutant rats were protected against experimental BPD and mortality with reduced alveolar septal thickness, lung inflammation (reduced influx of macrophages and neutrophils, and CINC1 expression) and collagen III deposition. However, LPAR1-mutant rats were not protected against alveolar enlargement, increased medial wall thickness of small arterioles, fibrin deposition and vascular alveolar leakage. Treatment of experimental BPD with Ki16425 confirmed the data observed in LPAR1-mutant rats, but did not reduce the pulmonary influx of neutrophils, CINC1 expression and mortality in rats with experimental BPD. In addition, Ki16425 treatment protected against PAH and right ventricular hypertrophy., CONCLUSION: LPAR1 deficiency attenuates pulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, thereby reducing mortality, but does not affect alveolar and vascular development and, unlike Ki16425 treatment, does not prevent PAH in neonatal rats with experimental BPD.

In the present study, right lung tissue samples of fetuses at different gestational ages were collected within 2 h of the induction of labor in order to observe morphological discrepancies. An Affymetrix Human GeneChip was used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed. A total of 687 lncRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed among three groups of fetal lung tissue samples corresponding to the three embryonic periods. A total of 34 significantly upregulated and 12 significantly downregulated lncRNAs (fold-change, >=1.5; P<0.05) were detected at different time points (embryonic weeks 7-16, 16-25 and 25-28) of fetal lung development and compared with healthy tissues Expression changes in lncRNAs n340848, n387037, n336823 and ENST00000445168 were validated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and the results were consistent with the GeneChip results.

Although progress has been made in this field, the mechanisms underlying this process remain only partially understood., METHODS: We assessed aberrant elastin localization-associated signaling in mouse pups exposed to 85% O2 treated with either IL-1Ra or 1D11, using morphometric analyses, quantitative RT-PCR, immunostaining, and ELISA. We also evaluated the derivation of elastin-producing cells using dual marker tracking. The regulatory mechanisms of IL-1beta were investigated in vitro in lung epithelial and mesenchymal cells., RESULTS: Elevated levels of IL-1beta, alphavbeta6 and TGF-beta1 were each associated with aberrant elastin production in O2-exposed lungs. IL-1Ra abolished TGF-beta1 activation and alphavbeta6 upregulation, which occurred as a result of exposure to hyperoxia, whereas 1D11 had no discernible effect on the expression of either alphavbeta6 or IL-1beta even following O2-exposure, suggesting that IL-1beta was initially induced. Additionally, double staining revealed the presence of epithelium-derived elastin-producing cells, which was confirmed via in vitro IL-1beta stress-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) morphological and molecular marker changes, which may explain the altered lung elastin deposition and defective septation observed in BPD., CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that IL-1beta was initially induced by hyperoxia; alphavbeta6 subsequently interacted with and activated TGF-beta1, acting as an epithelial/mesenchymal signaling molecule that contributed to excessive alveolar elastogenesis, the primary pathological feature of BPD.

In this study, the effect of resveratrol on the lung injury was evaluated in hyperoxia-exposed rats of preterm birth. The results demonstrated that hyperoxia led to thickened alveolar wall, simplified alveolar architecture and fibrosis. In addition, elevated methane dicarboxylic aldehyde level, decreased glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity were also found in hyperoxic lungs, as well as the increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Fibrotic-associated proteins transforming growth factor-beta1, alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen I and fibronectin deposition were also found in interstitial substance of lungs. Furthermore, Wnt/beta-catenin signalling was found to be active in hyperoxia-induced lungs. In addition, expression of SP-C was increased and T1alpha was decreased in hyperoxia-exposed lungs. Resveratrol intraperitoneal administration alleviated hyperoxia-induced histological injury of lungs, regulated redox balance, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and down-regulated expression of fibrotic-associated proteins. Furthermore, Wnt/beta-catenin signalling was also suppressed by resveratrol, as represented by diminished expression of lymphoid enhancer factor-1, Wnt induced signalling protein-1 and cyclin D1. In addition, the increase of SP-C and decrease of T1alpha expression was prevented as well. The present study showed that resveratrol could protect lungs from hyperoxia-induced injury through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. The transdifferentiation of alveolar epithelial type II cells to alveolar epithelial type I cells promotion and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling suppression are also involved in the protective effect.

It is induced by oxidative stress and has anti-apoptotic effects. The role of GDF15 in hyperoxic lung injury is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that GDF15 will be induced in vitro, in a model of pulmonary oxygen toxicity, and will play a critical role in decreasing cell death and oxidative stress. BEAS-2B (human bronchial epithelial cells) and human pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) were exposed to hyperoxia, and expression of GDF15 and effect of GDF15 disruption on cell viability and oxidative stress was determined. Furthermore, we studied the effect of p53 knockdown on GDF15 expression. In vitro, both BEAS-2B and HPMEC cells showed a significant increase in GDF15 expression upon exposure to hyperoxia. After GDF15 knockdown, there was a significant decrease in cell viability and increase in oxidative stress compared to control cells transfected with siRNA with a scrambled sequence. Knockdown of p53 significantly decreased the induction of GDF15 by hyperoxia. In conclusion, we show that GDF15 has a pro-survival and anti-oxidant role in hyperoxia and that p53 plays a key role in its induction. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Initially defined as a radiographic, clinical and histopathological entity, the chronic lung disease known as BPD has evolved as obstetrical and neonatal care have improved the survival of lower gestational age infants. Now, definitions based on the need for supplementary oxygen at 28 days and/or 36 weeks provide a useful reference point in the neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU), but are no longer based on histopathological findings, and are neither designed to predict longer term respiratory consequences nor to study the evolution of a multifactorial disease. The aims of this review are to critically examine the evolution of the diagnosis of BPD and the challenges inherent to current classifications. We found that the increasing use of respiratory support strategies that administer ambient air without supplementary oxygen confounds oxygen-based definitions of BPD. Furthermore, lack of reproducible, genetic, biochemical and physiological biomarkers limits the ability to identify an impending BPD for early intervention, quantify disease severity for standardized classification and approaches and reliably predict the long-term outcomes. More comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches to overcome these challenges involve longitudinal observation of extremely preterm infants, not only those with BPD, using genetic, environmental, physiological and clinical data as well as large databases of patient samples. The Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) will provide such a framework to address these challenges through high-resolution characterization of both NICU and post-NICU discharge outcomes.","group":"g1","id":"44109d5a-97aa-4d05-ae14-3e7548abe695","_showDetails":false},"08ee8a1b-54a1-41e1-9b82-44f0c2cfc74b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Related factors and adverse neonatal outcomes in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes complicated by histologic chorioamnionitis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.12659/MSM.891203","authors":["Xie, Ailan","Zhang, Wenwen","Chen, Miaomiao","Wang, Yuhuan","Wang, Ying","Zhou, Qingfeng","Zhu, Xueqiong"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150203//","keywords":["Apgar Score","C-Reactive Protein/me [Metabolism]","*Chorioamnionitis/pp [Physiopathology]","Female","*Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture/pp [Physiopathology]","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Newborn, Diseases/et [Etiology]","*Infant, Newborn, Diseases/pa [Pathology]","Logistic Models","Oligohydramnios/pp [Physiopathology]","Pregnancy","*Pregnancy Outcome","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","volume":"21","isbn":"1234-1010","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25644559"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA) in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 371 women diagnosed with PPROM at less than 34 weeks of gestation at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between January 2008 and December 2012.

Prematurity is a risk factor for severe RV infection in early life, but is unknown if RV elicits enhanced pro-asthmatic airway cytokine responses in premature infants. This study investigated whether young children born severely premature (<32 wks gestation) exhibit airway secretion of Th2 and Th17 cytokines during natural RV infections and whether RV-induced Th2-Th17 responses are linked to more respiratory morbidity in premature children during the first 2 yrs of life., METHODS: We measured Th2 and Th17 nasal airway cytokines in a retrospective cohort of young children aged 0-2 yrs with PCR-confirmed RV infection or non-detectable virus. Protein levels of IL-4, IL-13, TSLP, and IL-17 were determined with multiplex immunoassays. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained by electronic medical record (EMR) review., RESULTS: The study comprised 214 children born full term (n = 108), preterm (n = 44) or severely premature (n = 62). Natural RV infection in severely premature children was associated with elevated airway secretion of Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines, particularly in subjects with history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Severely premature children with high RV-induced airway IL-4 had recurrent respiratory hospitalizations (median 3.65 hosp/yr; IQR 2.8-4.8) and were more likely to have at least one pediatric intensive care unit admission during the first 2 yrs of life (OR 8.72; 95% CI 1.3-58.7; p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Severely premature children have increased airway secretion of Th2 and Th17 cytokines during RV infections, which is associated with more respiratory morbidity in the first 2 yrs of life.

The disease has a multifactorial aetiology with a significant genetic component; until now published association studies have identified several candidate genes but only few of these data has been replicated. In this pilot study, we approached exome sequencing aimed at identifying non-common variants, which are expected to have a stronger phenotypic effect., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed this study on 26 Italian severely affected BPD preterm unrelated newborns, homogeneously selected from a large prospective cohort. We used an Illumina HiSeq 2000 for sequencing. Data analysis was focussed on genes previously associated to BPD susceptibility and to new candidates in related pathways, highlighted by a prioritization analysis performed using ToppGene Suite., RESULTS: By exome sequencing, we identified 3369 novel variants, with a median of 400 variations per sample. The top candidate genes highlighted were NOS2, MMP1, CRP, LBP and the toll-like receptor (TLR) family. All of them have been confirmed with Sanger sequencing., CONCLUSIONS: Potential candidate genes have been discovered in this preliminary study; the pathogenic role of identified variants will need to be confirmed with functional and segregation studies and possibly with further methods, able to evaluate the collective influence of rare variants. Moreover, additional candidates will be tested and genetic analysis will be extended to all affected children. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Exposure of the neonatal rat lung to 60% O2 for 14 days results in impairments of lung cell proliferation, secondary crest formation, and alveologenesis. This lung injury is mediated by peroxynitrite and is prevented by treatment with a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst. We hypothesized that one of the mechanisms by which peroxynitrite induces lung injury in 60% O2 is through nitration and inactivation of critical growth factors or their receptors. Increased nitration of both IGF-I and IGF-R1 was evident in 60% O2-exposed lungs, which was reversible by concurrent treatment with a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst. Increased nitration of the IGF-R1 was associated with its reduced activation, as assessed by IGF-R1 phosphotyrosine content. IGF-I displacement binding plots were conducted in vitro using rat fetal lung distal epithelial cells which respond to IGF-I by an increase in DNA synthesis. When IGF-I was nitrated to a degree similar to that observed in vivo there was minimal, if any, effect on IGF-I displacement binding. In contrast, nitrating cell IGF-R1 to a similar degree to that observed in vivo completely prevented specific binding of IGF-I to the IGF-R1, and attenuated an IGF-I-mediated increase in DNA synthesis. Additionally, we hypothesized that peroxynitrite also impairs alveologenesis by being an upstream regulator of the growth inhibitor, TGFbeta1. That 60% O2-induced impairment of alveologenesis was mediated in part by TGFbeta1 was confirmed by demonstrating an improvement in secondary crest formation when 60% O2-exposed pups received concurrent treatment with the TGFs1 activin receptor-like kinase, SB 431542. That the increased TGFbeta1 content in lungs of pups exposed to 60% O2 was regulated by peroxynitrite was confirmed by its attenuation by concurrent treatment with a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst. We conclude that peroxynitrite contributes to the impaired alveologenesis observed following the exposure of neonatal rats to 60% O2 both by preventing binding of IGF-I to the IGF-R1, secondary to nitration of the IGF-R1, and by causing an up-regulation of the growth inhibitor, TGFbeta1.

Hyperoxia is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of BPD, hyperoxia-induced lung injury model has similar pathological manifestations as human BPD. Tetrandrine (Tet) is known to suppress oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation. Thus it has been used to prevent organ injuries. However, the protective effect of Tet against hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn rats has not been reported., METHODS: A hyperoxia-induced lung injury model was established using newborn rats exposed to high O2 levels. The models were treated with various concentrations of Tet, and a lung function test was conducted. Then, the lung tissues and blood were collected to detect the effect of Tet on cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, and fibrosis. The effect of Tet on nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways was also determined., RESULTS: Lung function was decreased in hyperoxia-induced rats, and Tet could reverse this inhibiting effect. For oxidative stress, Tet caused an increase in the levels of antioxidant enzymes. The apoptosis rate and apoptosis-related proteins were decreased in hyperoxia-induced rats after Tet treatment. Additionally, Tet treatment could reduce inflammatory factor levels, while increasing CD4+IFN-gamma+ T cell levels and decreasing CD4+IL-4+ T cell levels. Tet treatment was also able to inhibit the expression of fibrosis-related markers and NF-kappaB and ERK1/2 pathways., CONCLUSIONS: Tet demonstrated potent activity against hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn rats through NF-kappaB and ERK1/2 pathway inhibition.

Although cellular redox status is known to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation, redox-sensitive pathways associated with these processes in developing pulmonary epithelium are unknown. Redox-sensitive pathways are commonly regulated by cysteine thiol modifications. Therefore two thiol oxidoreductase systems, thioredoxin and glutathione, were chosen to elucidate the roles of these pathways on cell death. Studies herein indicate that thiol oxidation contributes to cell death through impaired activity of glutathione-dependent and thioredoxin (Trx) systems and altered signaling through redox-sensitive pathways. Free thiol content decreased by 71% with hyperoxic (95% oxygen) exposure. Increased cell death was observed during oxygen exposure when either the Trx or the glutathione-dependent system was pharmacologically inhibited with aurothioglucose (ATG) or buthionine sulfoximine, respectively. However, inhibition of the Trx system yielded the smallest decrease in free thiol content (1.44% with ATG treatment vs 21.33% with BSO treatment). Although Trx1 protein levels were unchanged, Trx1 function was impaired during hyperoxic treatment as indicated by progressive cysteine oxidation. Overexpression of Trx1 in H1299 cells utilizing an inducible construct increased cell survival during hyperoxia, whereas siRNA knockdown of Trx1 during oxygen treatment reduced cell viability. Overall, this indicated that a comparatively small pool of proteins relies on Trx redox functions to mediate cell survival in hyperoxia, and the protective functions of Trx1 are progressively lost by its oxidative inhibition. To further elucidate the role of Trx1, potential Trx1 redox protein-protein interactions mediating cytoprotection and cell survival pathways were determined by utilizing a substrate trap (mass action trapping) proteomics approach. With this method, known Trx1 targets were detected, including peroxiredoxin-1as well as novel targets, including two HSP90 isoforms (HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1). Reactive cysteines within the structure of HSP90 are known to modulate its ATPase-dependent chaperone activity through disulfide formation and S-nitrosylation. Whereas HSP90 expression is unchanged at the protein level during hyperoxic exposure, siRNA knockdown significantly increased hyperoxic cell death by 2.5-fold, indicating cellular dependence on HSP90 chaperone functions in response to hyperoxic exposure. These data support the hypothesis that hyperoxic impairment of Trx1 has a negative impact on HSP90-oxidative responses critical to cell survival, with potential implications for pathways implicated in lung development and the pathogenesis of BPD.

ROP exam results and clinical risk factors were recorded. The cohort was stratified by weight, highest ROP stage, and need for ROP treatment. Descriptive and correlational statistics were performed., RESULTS: For the overall cohort, regression analysis found that birth weight (OR: 0.741 per 100 g; 95 % CI: 0.606, 0.905), gestational age at birth (OR: 0.563 per week; 95 % CI: 0.454, 0.697), multiple gestation (OR 2.02, 95 % CI: 1.15, 3.56), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR: 4.68, 95 % CI: 1.93, 11.35), and necrotizing enterocolitis (OR 2.80, 95 % CI: 1.40, 5.16) were independent risk factors for treatment-requiring ROP. Black race was found to be a protective factor for treatment-requiring ROP (OR 0.244, 95 % CI: 0.095, 0.626). Among 15 infants with BW <500 g, there were no significant differences in any clinical risk factors between the 12 (80 %) with ROP vs the three (20 %) without ROP. Similarly, among infants with BW >1500 g, the 17 (9 %) with ROP only differed from the 166 (91 %) without ROP with respect to a higher incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis among those with ROP (11.8 % vs 0 %)., CONCLUSIONS: Although known clinical risk factors were predictive of ROP stage and need for laser treatment in this cohort, they were not significantly associated with ROP at extremes of birth weight. This suggests that other clinical, maternal, or genetic factors may protect from or predispose to ROP.","group":"g1","id":"585addf0-5eba-4298-b03a-1a7a41ddec35","_showDetails":false},"d3a80e57-e587-4e02-88fe-564157bae462":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Surfactant protein-D-encoding gene variant polymorphisms are linked to respiratory outcome in premature infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.05.042","authors":["Sorensen, Grith Lykke","Dahl, Marianne","Tan, Qihua","Bendixen, Christian","Holmskov, Uffe","Husby, Steffen"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140709//","keywords":["Alleles","Birth Weight","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Cohort Studies","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Female","Genetic Variation","Genotype","Gestational Age","Haplotypes","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Oxygen/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Polymorphism, Genetic","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D/ge [Genetics]","Respiration","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ge [Genetics]","Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"165","number":"4","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25015576"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Associations between the genetic variation within or downstream of the surfactant protein-D-encoding gene (SFTPD), which encodes the collectin surfactant protein-D (SP-D) and may lead to respiratory distress syndrome or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, recently were reported. Our aim was to investigate whether SFTPD variations affect serum SP-D levels in infants and pulmonary outcome in premature infants., STUDY DESIGN: Serum SP-D levels were measured in 211 mature and 202 premature infants, and 7 SFTPD single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. SNP analysis and haplotype analysis were used to associate genetic variation to SP-D, respiratory distress (RD), oxygen requirement, and respiratory support., RESULTS: The 5'-upstream SFTPD SNP rs1923534 and the 3 structural SNPs rs721917, rs2243639, and rs3088308 were associated with the SP-D level. The same SNPs were associated with RD, a requirement for supplemental oxygen, and a requirement for respiratory support. Haplotype analyses identified 3 haplotypes that included the minor alleles of rs1923534, rs721917, and rs3088308 that exhibited highly significant associations with decreased SP-D levels and decreased ORs for RD, oxygen supplementation, and respiratory support., CONCLUSION: These findings extend and validate previous observations of SFTPD association with the risk of respiratory outcomes and suggest SFTPD as an essential factor affecting pulmonary adaptation in premature infants.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1 has been shown to modulate hyperoxic lung injury. The mechanistic role(s) of CYP1A1 in hyperoxic lung injury in vivo is not known. In this investigation, we hypothesized that Cyp1a1(-/-) mice would be more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than wild-type (WT) mice, and that the protective role of CYP1A1 is in part due to CYP1A1-mediated decrease in the levels of reactive oxygen species-mediated lipid hydroperoxides, e.g., F2-isoprostanes/isofurans, leading to attenuation of oxidative damage. Eight- to ten-week-old male WT (C57BL/6J) or Cyp1a1(-/-) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) or room air for 24-72 h. The Cyp1a1(-/-) mice were more susceptible to oxygen-mediated lung damage and inflammation than WT mice, as evidenced by increased lung weight/body weight ratio, lung injury, neutrophil infiltration, and augmented expression of IL-6. Hyperoxia for 24-48 h induced CYP1A expression at the mRNA, protein, and enzyme levels in liver and lung of WT mice. Pulmonary F2-isoprostane and isofuran levels were elevated in WT mice after hyperoxia for 24 h. On the other hand, Cyp1a1(-/-) mice showed higher levels after 48-72 h of hyperoxia exposure compared to WT mice. Our results support the hypothesis that CYP1A1 protects against hyperoxic lung injury by decreasing oxidative stress. Future research could lead to the development of novel strategies for prevention and/or treatment of acute lung injury. Copyright © The Author 2014.

During this stage of alveolarization, division of the alveolar ducts into alveolar sacs by secondary septation, and expansion of the pulmonary vasculature by means of angiogenesis markedly increase the gas exchange surface area of the lung. However, postnatal completion of growth renders the lung highly susceptible to environmental insults such as inflammation that disrupt this developmental program. This is particularly evident in the setting of preterm birth, where impairment of alveolarization causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease associated with significant morbidity. The nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) family of transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed, and function to regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation, survival, and immunity. Extensive evidence suggests that activation of NFkappaB is important in the regulation of inflammation and in the control of angiogenesis. Therefore, NFkappaB-mediated downstream effects likely influence the lung response to injury and may also mediate normal alveolar development. This review summarizes the main biologic functions of NFkappaB, and highlights the regulatory mechanisms that allow for diversity and specificity in downstream gene activation. This is followed by a description of the pro and anti-inflammatory functions of NFkappaB in the lung, and of NFkappaB-mediated angiogenic effects. Finally, this review summarizes the clinical and experimental data that support a role for NFkappaB in mediating postnatal angiogenesis and alveolarization, and discusses the challenges that remain in developing therapies that can selectively block the detrimental functions of NFkappaB yet preserve the beneficial effects.

Over the years, the BPD phenotype has evolved, but despite various advances in neonatal management approaches, the reduction in the BPD burden is minimal. With the advent of surfactant, glucocorticoids, and new ventilation strategies, BPD has evolved from a disease of structural injury into a new BPD, marked by an arrest in alveolar growth in the lungs of extremely premature infants. This deficient alveolar growth has been associated with a diminution of pulmonary vasculature. Several investigators have described the epithelial / vascular co-dependency and the significant role of crosstalk between vessel formation, alveologenesis, and lung dysplasia's; hence identification and study of factors that regulate pulmonary vascular emergence and inflammation has become crucial in devising effective therapeutic approaches for this debilitating condition. The potent antiangiogenic and proinflammatory protein Endothelial Monocyte Activating Polypeptide II (EMAP II) has been described as a mediator of pulmonary vascular and alveolar formation and its expression is inversely related to the periods of vascularization and alveolarization in the developing lung. Hence the study of EMAP II could play a vital role in studying and devising appropriate therapeutics for diseases of aberrant lung development, such as BPD. Herein, we review the vascular contribution to lung development and the implications that vascular mediators such as EMAP II have in distal lung formation during the vulnerable stage of alveolar genesis.

In summary, pulmonary hypertension is noted in a fifth of extremely low birth weight infants, primarily those with moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and persists to discharge in many infants. Diagnosis is generally by echocardiography, and some infants require cardiac catheterization to identify associated anatomic cardiac lesions or systemic-pulmonary collaterals, pulmonary venous obstruction or myocardial dysfunction.

Hyperoxia is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of BPD, hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) model has similar pathological manifestations as human BPD, therefore, may provide insight into the pathogenesis of human BPD. Studies have shown that Twist1 regulates pulmonary vascular permeability of LPS-induced lung injury through the Ang-Tie2 pathway. However, the effect of Twist1 pathway on vascular permeability in HALI has not been reported. Methods: We randomly exposed newborn rats to the room air or hyperoxia for 14 days. Lung histopathology, immunofluorescence, vascular permeability, mRNA and protein expression was assessed on day 1,7,14. Results: Our results verified that hyperoxia caused alveolar and vascular developmental disorders and increased pulmonary vascular permeability, which was consistent with previous findings. In hyperoxia-exposed rat lungs, the expressions of Twist1, Ang1, Tie1, Tie2, and pTie2 were significantly reduced, whereas the expression of Ang2 was significantly increased. Next, we observed a significant down-regulation of the Akt/Foxo1 pathway. Conclusion:  In HALI, the pulmonary microvascular permeability was increased, accompanied by changes in Twist1-Tie2 pathway which combined to Angs, and downregulation of Tie1 and Akt/Foxo1 pathway.

We evaluated the role of genetic background in response to oxidant stress in the neonatal lung by exposing mice from 36 inbred strains to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 72 h after birth. Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was evaluated by using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis and pathology. Statistically significant interstrain variation was found for BALF inflammatory cells and protein (heritability estimates range: 33.6-55.7%). Genome-wide association mapping using injury phenotypes identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Comparative mapping of the chromosome 6 QTLs identified Chrm2 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 2, cardiac) as a candidate susceptibility gene, and mouse strains with a nonsynonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Chrm2 that causes an amino acid substitution (P265L) had significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced inflammation compared to strains without the SNP. Further, hyperoxia-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in neonatal mice with targeted deletion of Chrm2, relative to wild-type controls.

A secondary objective is to assess whether this difference in medical interventions can be linked to a difference in mortality and morbidity rates., METHODS: We prospectively included all very preterm neonates free from lethal malformation born live in these two centers between 2006 and 2010. These inclusion criteria were met by 1286 patients, for whom we compared the rate of five selected medical interventions: birth by caesarean section, chest intubation in the delivery room, surfactant therapy, pharmacological treatment of patent ductus arteriosus, and red blood cell transfusion., RESULTS: The rates of the five medical interventions were systematically lower in the center that is involved in Neonatal Developmental Care. There was no significant difference in survival at discharge with no severe cerebral ultrasound scan abnormalities between the two centers. There were, however, significantly higher rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and nosocomial sepsis and longer hospital stays when the patients were not involved in a Neonatal Developmental Care program., DISCUSSION: This benchmarking study shows that in France, in the first decade of the 21st century, there are as many ways to handle very preterm neonates as there are centers in which they are born. This brings to light the concept of medical stance, which is the general care approach prior to the treatment itself. This medical stance creates the overall framework for the staff's decision-making regarding neonate care. The different parameters structuring medical stance are discussed.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a substantive role in the development of PH associated with these diseases. ROS impair the normal pulmonary artery (PA) relaxation in response to vasodilators, and ROS are also implicated in pulmonary arterial remodeling, both of which can increase the severity of PH., RECENT ADVANCES: PA ROS levels are elevated when endogenous ROS-generating enzymes are activated and/or when endogenous ROS scavengers are inactivated. Animal models have provided valuable insights into ROS generators and scavengers that are dysregulated in different forms of neonatal PH, thus identifying potential therapeutic targets., CRITICAL ISSUES: General antioxidant therapy has proved ineffective in reversing PH, suggesting that it is necessary to target specific signaling pathways for successful therapy., FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Development of novel selective pharmacologic inhibitors along with nonantioxidant therapies may improve the treatment outcomes of patients with PH, while further investigation of the underlying mechanisms may enable earlier detection of the disease.","group":"g1","id":"35ffaa90-2a45-4890-9aee-02722ff55463","_showDetails":false},"b13615a3-9d27-4308-82d7-2822d8c67f0a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Glucocorticoids recruit Tgfbr3 and Smad1 to shift transforming growth factor-beta signaling from the Tgfbr1/Smad2/3 axis to the Acvrl1/Smad1 axis in lung fibroblasts.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M113.541052","authors":["Schwartze, Julian T","Becker, Simone","Sakkas, Elpidoforos","Wujak, Lukasz A","Niess, Gero","Usemann, Jakob","Reichenberger, Frank","Herold, Susanne","Vadasz, Istvan","Mayer, Konstantin","Seeger, Werner","Morty, Rory E"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20131217//","keywords":["Activin Receptors, Type I/ge [Genetics]","*Activin Receptors, Type I/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Endothelial Cells/cy [Cytology]","Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Female","Fibroblasts/cy [Cytology]","*Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","*Glucocorticoids/pd [Pharmacology]","Humans","Lung/cy [Cytology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Mice","Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cy [Cytology]","Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/me [Metabolism]","NIH 3T3 Cells","Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/ge [Genetics]","*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/me [Metabolism]","Proteoglycans/ge [Genetics]","*Proteoglycans/me [Metabolism]","Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I","Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/ge [Genetics]","*Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/me [Metabolism]","*Signal Transduction/de [Drug Effects]","Signal Transduction/ph [Physiology]","Smad1 Protein/ge [Genetics]","*Smad1 Protein/me [Metabolism]","Smad2 Protein/ge [Genetics]","*Smad2 Protein/me [Metabolism]","Smad3 Protein/ge [Genetics]","*Smad3 Protein/me [Metabolism]","Transforming Growth Factor beta/ge [Genetics]","*Transforming Growth Factor beta/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","volume":"289","number":"6","isbn":"0021-9258","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24347165"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Glucocorticoids represent the mainstay therapy for many lung diseases, providing outstanding management of asthma but performing surprisingly poorly in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, and blunted lung development associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. TGF-beta is a pathogenic mediator of all four of these diseases, prompting us to explore glucocorticoid/TGF-beta signaling cross-talk. Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, budesonide, and fluticasone, potentiated TGF-beta signaling by the Acvrl1/Smad1/5/8 signaling axis and blunted signaling by the Tgfbr1/Smad2/3 axis in NIH/3T3 cells, as well as primary lung fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. Dexamethasone drove expression of the accessory type III TGF-beta receptor Tgfbr3, also called betaglycan. Tgfbr3 was demonstrated to be a \"switch\" that blunted Tgfbr1/Smad2/3 and potentiated Acvrl1/Smad1 signaling in lung fibroblasts. The Acvrl1/Smad1 axis, which was stimulated by dexamethasone, was active in lung fibroblasts and antagonized Tgfbr1/Smad2/3 signaling. Dexamethasone acted synergistically with TGF-beta to drive differentiation of primary lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, revealed by acquisition of smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin, which are exclusively Smad1-dependent processes in fibroblasts. Administration of dexamethasone to live mice recapitulated these observations and revealed a lung-specific impact of dexamethasone on lung Tgfbr3 expression and phospho-Smad1 levels in vivo. These data point to an interesting and hitherto unknown impact of glucocorticoids on TGF-beta signaling in lung fibroblasts and other constituent cell types of the lung that may be relevant to lung physiology, as well as lung pathophysiology, in terms of drug/disease interactions.","group":"g1","id":"b13615a3-9d27-4308-82d7-2822d8c67f0a","_showDetails":true},"4f4916e1-833b-4832-8c07-6c334521b50c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Infants born at <29 weeks: pulmonary outcomes from a hybrid perinatal system.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jp.2013.125","authors":["Truog, W E","Nyp, M F","Taylor, J","Gratny, L L","Escobar, H","Manimtim, W M","Lachica, C I","Khmour, A","Oluola, O O","Oshodi, A A","Norberg, M","Dai, H","Pallotto, E K"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20131017//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/cl [Classification]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","Cohort Studies","Female","Humans","*Infant, Extremely Premature","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Male","*Outcome Assessment, Health Care/mt [Methods]","Prognosis","ROC Curve","Risk Factors","Severity of Illness Index"],"journal":"Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association","volume":"34","number":"1","isbn":"0743-8346","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24135708"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess pulmonary outcomes of infants <29 weeks gestational age (GA), delivered at level I, II and III facilities, to identify potentially modifiable factors affecting bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) severity and to assess the external generalizability of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) BPD Outcome Estimator., STUDY DESIGN: Outcomes for infants <29 weeks GA born during (2008-2010) and delivered either at an inborn level III center or in a level II or III metropolitan area hospital with transfer to a level IV center, or delivered in a distant level I or II center and then transported to a level IV center were assessed.

Intraperitoneal LPS was injected into maternal rats at the 19th and 20th gestational days to establish a neonatal lung injury model. Mild hypothermia was started at the postnatal 24th hour and continued during 24 h. At the postnatal 7th day, the rats were sacrificed and lung samples were evaluated for immunohistochemical tests and proinflammatory gene expression levels., RESULTS: Hypothermia therapy attenuated the damaging effects of antenatal LPS administration. Furthermore, hypothermia therapy reduced gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha) and induced the expression of a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10)., CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated that mild hypothermia therapy is effective in an LPS induced neonatal lung injury model.

Exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia enhanced sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in lung tissues; however, the role of increased S1P in the pathobiological characteristics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has not been investigated. We hypothesized that an altered S1P signaling axis, in part, is responsible for neonatal lung injury leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To validate this hypothesis, newborn wild-type, sphingosine kinase1(-/-) (Sphk1(-/-)), sphingosine kinase 2(-/-) (Sphk2(-/-)), and S1P lyase(+/-) (Sgpl1(+/-)) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75%) from postnatal day 1 to 7. Sphk1(-/-), but not Sphk2(-/-) or Sgpl1(+/-), mice offered protection against hyperoxia-induced lung injury, with improved alveolarization and alveolar integrity compared with wild type. Furthermore, SphK1 deficiency attenuated hyperoxia-induced accumulation of IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2 and NOX4 protein expression in lung tissue. In vitro experiments using human lung microvascular endothelial cells showed that exogenous S1P stimulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, whereas SphK1 siRNA, or inhibitor against SphK1, attenuated hyperoxia-induced S1P generation. Knockdown of NOX2 and NOX4, using specific siRNA, reduced both basal and S1P-induced ROS formation. These results suggest an important role for SphK1-mediated S1P signaling-regulated ROS in the development of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a murine neonatal model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

This study investigated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in endothelial and respiratory cells from newborns exposed to staphylococci., METHODS: Human vascular endothelial cells and small airway epithelial cells were incubated with neonatal blood isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 14) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14). The extracellular release of IL-8, IL-10, sICAM-1, ICAM-1 mRNA and the expression of membrane bound ICAM-1 were assessed by ELISA, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy., RESULTS: Staphylococcus epidermidis induced higher levels of IL-8 (mean 38.5 ng/mL) and ICAM-1 mRNA (mean ratio 1.037) in the small airway epithelial cells than S. aureus (IL-8 mean 22.2 ng/mL, p < 0.01 and ICAM-1 mRNA mean ratio 0.715, p < 0.01). In the endothelial cells, ICAM-1 remained more integrated in the cell membranes after exposure to S. epidermidis compared with S. aureus, which induced disintegration and release of soluble ICAM-1 into the supernatants., CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus epidermidis induced a higher chemoattractive response than S. aureus.

Recent research focused on mechanisms of lung repair. Animal models of BPD in term rodents use postnatal hyperoxia in order to mimic features observed in very preterm human neonates: reduced alveolarization and impaired septal architecture without profound inflammatory changes. In contrast, BPD in very preterm human neonates involves prenatal hits e.g. infections and growth restriction plus postnatal ventilation. BPD induced in rodents by postnatal hyperoxia also exhibits reduced alveolarization however without septal pathology but with marked inflammation. We therefore aimed to establish an animal model combining prenatal growth restriction (FiO2 0.1 for 4 days) with postnatal hyperoxia (FiO2 0.7 for 2 weeks). In double-hit mice the development was retarded: body weight and length, lung and brain weight were significantly reduced by day P14 compared with normoxic controls. Histomorphometric analysis revealed reduced alveolarization and increased septal thickness without pronounced inflammatory lesions. A down-regulation of SftpB and SftpC genes was observed in double-hit animals compared with controls. Thus, we established a new model of BPD using pre- and postnatal hits. Copyright © 2013.

The FS-II items generated a total score, age-specific: (1) total; (2) general health (GH); and (3) responsiveness, activity, or interpersonal functioning (IPF) scores in specific age group categories., RESULTS: FS-II was administered to 51/62 (82.2%) survivors at a median (range) age of 5 (1-10) years; 27% children were on the ventilator and 43% required devices. About 40% of children had a median of 1 (1-4) hospitalization in the previous 6 months. Scores were >2 SD below means in 55%, 24%, and 55% cases for age-specific T, GH, and R/A/IPF scores respectively. The T and R/A/IPF scales were significantly higher in those with private, rather than public, maternal insurance, as were T and R/A/IPF scores for children >= 4 years, compared with younger children. On regression analysis, FS-II T, GH, and R/A/IPF scores were independently associated with maternal private insurance (P = .02). R/A/IPF scores were also significantly associated with corrected age at FS-II administration., CONCLUSIONS: One-third of surviving children who underwent tracheostomy during their initial hospitalization remained technology-dependent. The parental FS-II questionnaires revealed low R/A/IPF scores, especially at younger ages and in those with maternal public insurance. Further research on family-level interventions to improve functional outcomes in this population is warranted. Copyright © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

Soluble inflammatory mediators present in the lungs of patients developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia disrupt expression of multiple genes critical for development. However, the mechanisms linking innate immune signaling and developmental programs are not clear. NF-kappaB activation inhibits expression of the critical morphogen FGF-10. Here, we show that interactions between the RELA subunit of NF-kappaB and SP3 suppress SP1-mediated FGF-10 expression. SP3 co-expression reduced SP1-mediated Fgf-10 promoter activity, suggesting antagonistic interactions between SP1 and SP3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of LPS-treated primary mouse fetal lung mesenchymal cells detected increased interactions between SP3, RELA, and the Fgf-10 promoter. Expression of a constitutively active IkappaB kinase beta mutant not only decreased Fgf-10 promoter activity but also increased RELA-SP3 nuclear interactions. Expression of a dominant-negative IkappaB, which blocks NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, prevented inhibition of FGF-10 by SP3. The inhibitory functions of SP3 required sequences located in the N-terminal region of the protein. These data suggested that inhibition of FGF-10 by inflammatory signaling involves the NF-kappaB-dependent interactions between RELA, SP3, and the Fgf-10 promoter. NF-kappaB activation may therefore lead to reduced gene expression by recruiting inhibitory factors to specific gene promoters following exposure to inflammatory stimuli.","group":"g1","id":"9c1c746a-4312-4469-a7ec-8bc9117f5e9d","_showDetails":true},"b3761311-a26f-417a-ada6-b065bdc31702":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Single nucleotide polymorphism in toll-like receptor 6 is associated with a decreased risk for ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/INF.0b013e31828fc693","authors":["Winters, Alexandra H","Levan, Tricia D","Vogel, Stefanie N","Chesko, Kirsty L","Pollin, Toni I","Viscardi, Rose M"],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mi [Microbiology]","Cohort Studies","Female","Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","*Respiratory Tract Infections/ge [Genetics]","Respiratory Tract Infections/mi [Microbiology]","*Toll-Like Receptor 6/ge [Genetics]","Ureaplasma/ip [Isolation & Purification]","*Ureaplasma Infections/ge [Genetics]","Ureaplasma Infections/mi [Microbiology]"],"journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","volume":"32","number":"8","isbn":"0891-3668","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23518821"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Ureaplasma spp. respiratory tract colonization is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, but differences in host susceptibility have not been elucidated.

Although a vigorous innate immune system is critical for maintaining lung health, a balanced response is essential to minimize damaging inflammation. We investigated the functional and clinical impact of human genetic variants in the promoter of NFKBIA, which encodes IkappaBalpha, the major negative regulator of NF-kappaB. In this study, we quantified the functional impact of NFKBIA promoter polymorphisms (rs3138053, rs2233406, and rs2233409) on promoter-driven protein expression, allele-specific and total NFKBIA mRNA expression, IkappaBalpha protein expression, and TLR responsiveness; mapped innate immune regulatory networks active during respiratory syncytial virus infection, asthma, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia; and genotyped and analyzed independent cohorts of children with respiratory syncytial virus infection, asthma, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Genetic variants in the promoter of NFKBIA influenced NFKBIA gene expression, IkappaBalpha protein expression, and TLR-mediated inflammatory responses. Using a systems biology approach, we demonstrated that NFKBIA/IkappaBalpha is a central hub in transcriptional responses of prevalent childhood lung diseases, including respiratory syncytial virus infection, asthma, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Finally, by examining independent pediatric lung disease cohorts, we established that this immunologically relevant genetic variation in the promoter of NFKBIA is associated with differential susceptibility to severe bronchiolitis following infection with respiratory syncytial virus, airway hyperresponsiveness, and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These data highlight the importance of negative innate immune regulators, such as NFKBIA, in pediatric lung disease and begin to unravel common aspects in the genetic predisposition to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiolitis, and childhood asthma.","group":"g1","id":"514c622d-fded-4b6d-bf30-b68a9a5f96de","_showDetails":true},"d3df226a-03f6-43f7-9fc7-daa39815839f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Intermittent intravenous sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension management in neonates and infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2146/ajhp120364","authors":["Stultz, Jeremy S","Puthoff, Teresa","Backes, Carl Jr","Nahata, Milap C"],"date":"2013//","keywords":["Disease Management","Drug Administration Schedule","Female","Humans","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/di [Diagnosis]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/dt [Drug Therapy]","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Infusions, Intravenous","Male","*Piperazines/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Purines/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Sildenafil Citrate","*Sulfones/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Vasodilator Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]"],"journal":"American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists","volume":"70","number":"5","isbn":"1079-2082","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23413163"],"address":"England","abstract":"PURPOSE: The use of intermittent i.v. sildenafil dosing in three patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and limited venous access is reported., SUMMARY: One preterm infant with PH in addition to bronchopulmonary dysplasia and two full-term neonates with PH after congenital diaphragmatic hernia repairs were successfully treated for PH with adjunctive intermittent i.v. sildenafil. sildenafil dosages ranged from 0.4 to 2 mg/kg every six hours. Infusion periods ranged from one to three hours. The longer infusion periods were used to minimize the risk of hypotension during infusion, with continued efficacy assessment between dosing intervals by monitoring ongoing oxygenation saturation trends and oxygen requirements when the drug was not infusing. Treatment duration ranged from 5 to 50 days. Decreases or fluctuations in systemic blood pressure were noted at the beginning of treatment, but minimal interventions were required to maintain blood pressure, which generally increased during extended treatment. Fraction of inspired oxygen requirements were decreased or remained stable during each patient's first dose, and the need for respiratory support decreased over time, with improvements in oxygenation and prevention of continual life-threatening desaturation episodes. PH eventually resolved in each patient, based on improvements in serial echocardiographic studies with decreased requirements for inhaled nitric oxide, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation. All three patients required weaning from sildenafil treatment, suggesting a potential for rebound respiratory insufficiency with abrupt discontinuation of sildenafil., CONCLUSION: Intermittent i.v. sildenafil dosing provided a well-tolerated, practical, and potentially effective treatment for PH in three patients when enteral intake was undesirable and when there was a need to conserve available venous access.","group":"g1","id":"d3df226a-03f6-43f7-9fc7-daa39815839f","_showDetails":false},"8eb67449-cc18-4971-ae56-8c578d08cedb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Endoglin in amniotic fluid as a risk factor for the subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aji.12046","authors":["Kim, Sun K","Romero, Roberto","Savasan, Zeynep A","Xu, Yi","Dong, Zhong","Lee, Deug-Chan","Yeo, Lami","Hassan, Sonia S","Chaiworapongsa, Tinnakorn"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20121224//","keywords":["Adult","*Amniotic Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","Amniotic Fluid/im [Immunology]","Antigens, CD/an [Analysis]","Antigens, CD/im [Immunology]","*Antigens, CD/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Cross-Sectional Studies","Endoglin","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Female","Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture/im [Immunology]","Flow Cytometry","Fluorescent Antibody Technique","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infections","Inflammation","Obstetric Labor, Premature/im [Immunology]","Pregnancy","Receptors, Cell Surface/an [Analysis]","Receptors, Cell Surface/im [Immunology]","*Receptors, Cell Surface/me [Metabolism]","Risk Factors","Young Adult"],"journal":"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)","volume":"69","number":"2","isbn":"1046-7408","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23279628"],"address":"Denmark","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Cross-talk between inflammation and angiogenesis pathways has been recently reported. The objectives of this study were to: (i) examine whether amniotic fluid (AF) concentrations of soluble endoglin (sEng), a protein with anti-angiogenic properties, change during pregnancy, parturition, or intra-amniotic infection and/or inflammation (IAI); (ii) determine whether an increase in sEng in the AF of patients with preterm labor (PTL) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes; and (iii) investigate potential sources of sEng in AF., STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted to include patients in the following groups: (i) mid-trimester (n = 20); (ii) PTL with term delivery (n = 95); (iii) PTL leading to preterm delivery with (n = 40) and without IAI (n = 46); (iv) preterm PROM with (n = 37) and without IAI (n = 37); (v) term in labor (n = 48) and not in labor (n = 44). AF concentrations of sEng were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Chorioamniotic membranes, umbilical cord blood, and AF macrophages were examined for the expression of endoglin., RESULTS: (i) Patients with IAI had a higher median AF concentration of sEng than those without IAI (P = 0.02 for PTL and 0.06 for preterm PROM); (ii) AF concentrations of sEng in the 3rd and 4th quartiles were associated with IAI (OR 2.5 and 7.9, respectively); (iii) an AF sEng concentration >=779.5 pg/mL was associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (OR 7.9); (iv) endoglin was co-localized with CD14+ macrophages in AF pellets of patients with IAI by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry; and (v) the concentration of sEng in the supernatant was significantly increased after the treatment of macrophages with endotoxin or TNF-alpha., CONCLUSIONS: Soluble endoglin participates in the host response against IAI. Activated macrophages may be a source of sEng concentrations in the AF of patients with IAI. An increase of sEng in the AF is associated with BPD and adverse neonatal outcomes.

In addition to prototypical DCD, the development of mastication was severely impaired, while no evidence of swallowing apraxia, dysphagia, sensorimotor disturbances, abnormal tone, or impaired general cognition was found. He suffered from bronchopulmonary dysplasia and was ventilated as a newborn for 1.5 months. At the age of 3 months, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was surgically installed because of obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to perinatal intraventricular bleeding. At the age of 5 years, the patient's attempts to masticate were characterized by rough, effortful, and laborious biting movements confined to the vertical plane. Solid food particles had a tendency to get struck in his mouth and there was constant spillage. As a substitute for mastication, he moved the unground food with his fingers in a lateral direction to the mandibular and maxillary vestibule to externally manipulate and squeeze the food between cheek and teeth with the palm of his hand. Once the food was sufficiently soft, the bolus was correctly transported by the tongue in posterior direction and normal deglutition took place. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during follow-up disclosed mild structural abnormalities as the sequelae of the perinatal intraventricular bleeding, but this could not explain impaired mastication behavior. Quantified Tc-99m-ethylcysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography (Tc-99m-ECD SPECT), however, revealed decreased perfusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere, as well as in both inferior lateral frontal regions, both motor cortices, and the right anterior and lateral temporal areas. Anatomoclinical findings in this patient with DCD not only indicate that the functional integrity of the cerebellocerebral network is crucially important in the planning and execution of skilled actions, but also seem to show for the first time that mastication deficits may be of true apraxic origin. As a result, it is hypothesized that \"mastication dyspraxia\" may have to be considered as a distinct nosological entity within the group of the developmental dyspraxias following a disruption of the cerebellocerebral network involved in planned actions.","group":"g1","id":"1d764d80-668a-4fc0-bb08-819829572113","_showDetails":false},"22111dbd-2f01-4481-bdec-14e339991429":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2020>","title":"Umbilical Cord Blood Cells Do Not Reduce Ventilation-Induced Lung Injury in Preterm Lambs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00119","authors":["Smith, Madeleine J","Chan, Kyra Y Y","Papagianis, Paris","Nitsos, Ilias","Zahra, Valerie","Allison, Beth","Polglase, Graeme R","McDonald, Courtney A"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200221//","journal":"Frontiers in physiology","volume":"11","isbn":"1664-042X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm5&NEWS=N&AN=32153424"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Preterm infants often have immature lungs and, consequently, many require respiratory support at birth. However, respiratory support causes lung inflammation and injury, termed ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Umbilical cord blood (UCB) contains five cell types that have been shown to reduce inflammation and injury. The aim of this study was to determine whether UCB cells can reduce VILI in preterm lambs., METHODS: We assessed lung inflammation and injury, with and without UCB cell administration. Fetal lambs at 125 +/- 1 days gestation underwent sterile surgery and were randomly allocated to one of four groups; unoperated controls (UNOP), sham controls (SHAM), injuriously ventilated lambs (VILI), and injuriously ventilated lambs that received UCB cells via the jugular vein 1 h after ventilation (VILICELLS). Ventilated lambs received an injurious ventilation strategy for 15 min, before they were returned to the uterus and the lamb and ewe recovered for 24 h. After 24 h, lambs were delivered via caesarean section and euthanized and the lungs were collected for histological and molecular assessment of inflammation and injury., RESULTS: VILI led to increased immune cell infiltration, increased cellular proliferation, increased tissue wall thickness, and significantly reduced alveolar septation compared to controls.

We tested the hypotheses that infant rats exposed to a combination of caffeine and hyperoxia would be less susceptible to lung injury than those exposed to hyperoxia alone and that caffeine decreases the pulmonary tissue expression of chemokines and leukocyte influx following hyperoxia. Using 6-day-old rat pups, we demonstrated that 24 h of 80% oxygen exposure caused pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. High levels of oxygen upregulated the expression of: the CXC chemokines, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2; the CC-chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, as measured by realtime PCR after the administration of caffeine (10 mg . kg(-1) body weight); and attenuated chemokine and cytokine upregulation, as well as the influx of CD11b(+), ED-1(+) and myeloperoxidase(+) leukocytes.

Rat BMSC were isolated and co-cultured with primary fetal E21 rat type II cells or lung fibroblasts in a Transwell( R) system without direct cell contact. Effects of BMSC conditioned media (CM) on type II cell and fibroblast proliferation and on type II cell surfactant phospholipid (DSPC) synthesis and mRNA expression of surfactant proteins B and C (sftpb and sftpc) were studied. We also determined the effect of fibroblast and type II cell CM on BMSC proliferation and surface marker expression. Co-culture with BMSC significantly decreased type II cell and fibroblast proliferation to 72.5% and 83.7% of controls, respectively.

Flow cytometry confirmed that BMSC retained the expression of undifferentiated stem cell markers despite their exposure to fetal lung cell CM.

However, its role in organ development and neonatal disease has received little attention. Therapeutically administered oxygen has been considered to contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in prematurity. The current study was performed to determine Nrf2-mediated molecular events during saccular-to-alveolar lung maturation, and the role of Nrf2 in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic lung injury using newborn Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2(-/-)) and wild-type (Nrf2(+/+)) mice., RESULTS: Pulmonary basal expression of cell cycle, redox balance, and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism genes was lower while lymphocyte immunity genes were more highly expressed in Nrf2(-/-) neonates than in Nrf2(+/+) neonates. Hyperoxia-induced phenotypes, including mortality, arrest of saccular-to-alveolar transition, and lung edema, and inflammation accompanying DNA damage and tissue oxidation were significantly more severe in Nrf2(-/-) neonates than in Nrf2(+/+) neonates. During lung injury pathogenesis, Nrf2 orchestrated expression of lung genes involved in organ injury and morphology, cellular growth/proliferation, vasculature development, immune response, and cell-cell interaction. Bioinformatic identification of Nrf2 binding motifs and augmented hyperoxia-induced inflammation in genetically deficient neonates supported Gpx2 and Marco as Nrf2 effectors., INNOVATION: This investigation used lung transcriptomics and gene targeted mice to identify novel molecular events during saccular-to-alveolar stage transition and to elucidate Nrf2 downstream mechanisms in protection from hyperoxia-induced injury in neonate mouse lungs., CONCLUSION: Nrf2 deficiency augmented lung injury and arrest of alveolarization caused by hyperoxia during the newborn period.

Although inflammatory responses are critical in these diseases, the relationship between smooth muscle cell growth and inflammatory mediators is poorly understood. This study demonstrates that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) promotes the expression of interleukin-13 (IL-13) in lung smooth muscle cells through an oxidant signaling mechanism. Treatment of cultured human airway or pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells with PDGF promotes IL-13 mRNA and protein expression. IL-13 expression is also detected in smooth muscle of airways and pulmonary vessels in allergen-stimulated mice. PDGF activates the proximal 980-bp region of the IL-13 promoter. PDGF-induced IL-13 expression is suppressed by the inhibition of reactive oxygen species signaling such as by NAD(P)H oxidase inhibition, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and metal chelation. Treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide at as low as 1 muM also promotes IL-13 gene expression. PDGF-induced cell growth is suppressed by the neutralizing antibody against IL-13 as well as by reactive oxygen inhibitors, and recombinant IL-13 promotes the growth of airway smooth muscle cells. These results demonstrate that oxidant signaling activates IL-13 gene transcription in lung smooth muscle cells and that this signaling mechanism regulates cell growth. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Despite its usefulness in injured neonatal lungs, the mechanisms of improved surfactant homeostasis in vivo and systemic effects on lipid homeostasis are unknown. We therefore exposed newborn rats to 85% vs. 21% oxygen and treated them systemically with rhKGF for 48 h before death at 7 days. We determined type II pneumocyte (PN-II) proliferation, surfactant protein (SP) mRNA expression, and the pulmonary metabolism of individual phosphatidylcholine (PC) species using [D(9)-methyl]choline and tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, we assessed liver and plasma lipid metabolism, addressing PC synthesis de novo, the liver-specific phosphatidylethanolamine methyl transferase (PEMT) pathway, and triglyceride concentrations. rhKGF was found to maintain PN-II proliferation and increased SP-B/C expression and surfactant PC in both normoxic and hyperoxic lungs. We found increased total PC together with decreased [D(9)-methyl]choline enrichment, suggesting decreased turnover rather than increased secretion and synthesis as the underlying mechanism. In the liver, rhKGF increased PC synthesis, both de novo and via PEMT, underlining the organotypic differences of rhKGF actions on lipid metabolism. rhKGF increased the hepatic secretion of newly synthesized polyunsaturated PC, indicating improved systemic supply with choline and essential fatty acids. We suggest that rhKGF has potential as a therapeutic agent in neonates by improving pulmonary and systemic PC homeostasis.","group":"g1","id":"21993098-3825-4fce-befc-2d22ed2db417","_showDetails":false},"5c6f5240-5641-409e-95b6-7bb9e8245bdb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"Neonatal candidiasis: results of an 8 year study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-200X.2012.03574.x","authors":["Celebi, Solmaz","Hacimustafaoglu, Mustafa","Koksal, Nilgun","Ozkan, Hilal","Cetinkaya, Merih","Ener, Beyza"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20120418//","keywords":["Candida/ip [Isolation & Purification]","Candidemia/di [Diagnosis]","Candidemia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Candidemia/ep [Epidemiology]","Candidemia/et [Etiology]","Candidemia/mi [Microbiology]","*Candidemia","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Male","Prospective Studies","Risk Factors","Time Factors"],"journal":"Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society","volume":"54","number":"3","isbn":"1328-8067","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22320707"],"address":"Australia","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk factors, demographic features, treatment and clinical outcome associated with candidemia in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within an 8 year period., METHODS: The data of infants who were diagnosed as having candidemia, were evaluated., RESULTS: Between January 2000 and December 2007, a total of 28 candidemia episodes were identified in 28 infants. A 1.1% candidemia incidence was documented in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The species most frequently causing candidemia were Candida parapsilosis (57.1%), followed by C. albicans (42.9%).

No studies have evaluated the efficacy of per rectum (PR) acetaminophen. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PR acetaminophen in modulating the risk of PDA ligation., STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective matched case-control study was conducted to compare neonates born <29 weeks' gestation with evidence of hsDA, in an era when rescue rectal acetaminophen was used (January 2014-March 2018) as a treatment strategy, versus historical controls (July 2006-August 2012). All patients underwent comprehensive echocardiography assessment of ductal shunt volume according to a standardized protocol. Acetaminophen treated neonates were matched according to demographics, gestation, preintervention echocardiography features, and comorbidities. Control patients were selected when an echocardiography was performed at an equivalent postnatal age. Infants with a genetic syndrome, severe congenital malformation, or major forms of congenital heart disease excluding small atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect, PDA, or patent formale ovale were excluded. The primary outcome was surgical ligation of the PDA. Secondary outcomes included echocardiography indices of hemodynamic significance, the composite of death, or severe BPD (defined by ventilator dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age). Descriptive statistics and univariate (t-tests, Fisher's exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test) analyses were used to evaluate clinical and echocardiography characteristics of the groups and compare outcomes., RESULTS: Forty infants (20 cases and 20 controls), with similar demographic and echocardiography features, were compared. Cases received 6.8 +/- 0.7 days (60 mg/kg/day) of PR acetaminophen. Responders (n = 12, 60%) had echocardiography evidence of reduced ductal diameter (2.2 mm [1.9-2.6] to 1.1 mm [0-1.7], p = 0.002), left ventricular output (363 +/- 108-249 +/- 61 mL/min/kg; p = 0.002) and left atrium to aortic root ratio (1.7 +/- 0.3-1.3 +/- 0.2; p = 0.002) following treatment. The rate of PDA ligation was 50% lower (p = 0.02) and composite outcome of death or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia was reduced (p = 0.04) in the acetaminophen group., CONCLUSION: Rectal acetaminophen was associated with improvement in echocardiography indices of PDA shunt volume, a 50% reduction in PDA ligation rates and a reduction in the composite outcome of death or severe BPD. Pharmacologic and further prospective clinical studies are needed., KEY POINTS: . Many preterm infants encounter the clinical consequences of a hemodynamically significant PDA.. . The merits and optimal timing of PDA ligation remains an area of controversy amongst neonatologists.. . Cyclooxygenase inhibitors are associated with adverse events or are often contraindicated..

Because of the lack of useful biomarkers for BPD, the gene expression of tracheal aspirate fluid (TAF) cells in premature infants was analyzed., METHODS: Of 148 consecutive patients, 26 preterm infants (gestational age <34 weeks) were enrolled, who underwent assisted ventilation at birth for respiratory failure. Patients with congenital disorders were excluded. Half of these infants developed BPD. Interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B mRNA of TAF cells were quantified on real-time polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: IL-10 (P < 0.01) and IFN-gamma (P= 0.03) but not TGF-beta1 or PDGF-B mRNA levels at birth were higher in BPD than in non-BPD infants. IL-10 expression differentiated BPD with the highest sensitivity (92%) and specificity (77%). IL-10 levels correlated with TGF-beta1 (P= 0.03) and IFN-gamma (P= 0.01), but not with PDGF-B levels. When BPD infants were classified according to comorbidity (group 1, six patients who suffered respiratory distress syndrome [RDS] but not chorioamnionitis [CAM]; group 2, five patients who had CAM but not RDS), PDGF-B levels were higher in group 2 (P= 0.01). High IL-10 expression was selected as a risk factor for BPD in infants who had CAM but not RDS (P= 0.01), although prolonged oxygen therapy was the most sensitive indicator for BPD (P < 0.01) on multivariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: High IL-10 expression in TAF cells at birth could predict the evolution of BPD, but with less impact than oxygen requirement. PDGF might play a different role in the inflammatory process of premature lungs. Copyright © 2011 The Authors.

Currently no effective therapy is clinically available to prevent the long-term pulmonary sequelae of BPD. Previous research has demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system is up-regulated in human lung fibroblasts. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists and AT1R short interfering RNA diminished hyperoxia-increased collagen expression, whereas AT2R antagonists did not have any effects on these hyperoxia-induced changes. The in vivo therapeutic effects of AT1R antagonists on hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis remain unknown. The present study assessed the effects of an AT1R antagonist (losartan) on preventing hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis in newborn rats. Rat pups were exposed to 7 days of > 95% O2 and an additional 2 weeks of 60% O2. AT1R antagonist-treated pups were injected intraperitoneally with losartan at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day from postnatal days 1 to 7 and a dose of 5 mg/kg/day from postnatal days 8 to 21. Control group pups were injected with an equal volume of normal saline. AT1R antagonist treatment attenuated the hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis on postnatal days 7 and 21 and also decreased the hyperoxia-induced expression of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and alpha-smooth muscle actin. AT1R antagonist treatment did not affect body weight or lung weight of the rats. These data suggest that AT1R antagonist may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis.","group":"g1","id":"4b9a892e-38a2-4379-b902-da7d7fb954df","_showDetails":false},"326d760e-5004-4242-8444-4dbc157cc7b9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"Genetic associations of surfactant protein D and angiotensin-converting enzyme with lung disease in preterm neonates.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jp.2011.104","authors":["Ryckman, K K","Dagle, J M","Kelsey, K","Momany, A M","Murray, J C"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20110929//","keywords":["Alleles","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Cohort Studies","DNA/an [Analysis]","DNA/ge [Genetics]","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Genetic Testing","Gestational Age","Humans","Incidence","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal","Male","Neonatal Screening","*Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/ge [Genetics]","*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","Pregnancy","Prognosis","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D/ge [Genetics]","Renin-Angiotensin System/ge [Genetics]","Renin-Angiotensin System/ph [Physiology]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/di [Diagnosis]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ep [Epidemiology]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ge [Genetics]","Retrospective Studies","Risk Assessment","Sex Distribution","Survival Rate"],"journal":"Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association","volume":"32","number":"5","isbn":"0743-8346","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=21960125"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To replicate genetic associations with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in genes related to surfactant deficiency, inflammation and infection, and the renin-angiotensin system., STUDY DESIGN: We examined eight candidate genes for associations with RDS and BPD in 433 preterm birth (PTB-<37 weeks) infants (251 with RDS and 134 with BPD).

The molecular mechanisms that regulate BSM and alveolar myofibroblast development are not fully understood. Here we show that mSmile (murine Smile), a novel transmembrane protein with tetratricopeptide repeats, functions in lung alveolar myofibroblast and BSM cell development. mSmile mutant mice exhibit early neonatal lethality with few mice surviving up to 3 weeks. Mutant lungs display both airway branching morphogenesis defect during fetal lung development and alveolarization defect after birth. These defects are associated with reduced numbers of BSM cells in the peribronchial subepithelial region and clefts and myofibroblasts in alveolar septae. Expression of fibroblast growth factor-10 and its down stream target Bmp-4, which are important for BSM formation, is decreased. In vitro, mSmile mutant embryonic fibroblasts show reduced receptor activation and induction of myofibroblast formation in response to Transforming growth factor-beta (Tgf-beta), indicating that mSmile may mediate myofibroblast development through modulation of Tgf-beta signaling. These studies identify mSmile as a novel gene specifying both the BSM and lung alveolar myofibroblast lineages, contributing to our understanding of the biological control of the development of these cells, and may provide insights into the aberrant smooth muscle and alveolar myofibroblast development that occur in pathological conditions.

This review examines the role of selected outpatient environmental factors on respiratory outcomes during infancy in preterm infants with lung disease.","group":"g1","id":"8b974dc1-28b3-42de-845b-cf09ba50b38d","_showDetails":false},"2ef76bd9-d800-4a48-8550-9a2588beed7a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Elevated CO(2) levels cause mitochondrial dysfunction and impair cell proliferation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.290056","authors":["Vohwinkel, Christine U","Lecuona, Emilia","Sun, Haying","Sommer, Natascha","Vadasz, Istvan","Chandel, Navdeep S","Sznajder, Jacob I"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20110908//","keywords":["*Carbon Dioxide/pd [Pharmacology]","Cell Line","*Cell Proliferation/de [Drug Effects]","Humans","*Hypercapnia/me [Metabolism]","Hypercapnia/pa [Pathology]","Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/me [Metabolism]","Ketoglutaric Acids/me [Metabolism]","Lung Diseases/me [Metabolism]","MicroRNAs/me [Metabolism]","*Mitochondria/me [Metabolism]","Mitochondria/pa [Pathology]","Muscular Dystrophies/me [Metabolism]","*Up-Regulation/de [Drug Effects]"],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","volume":"286","number":"43","isbn":"0021-9258","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21903582"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Elevated CO(2) concentrations (hypercapnia) occur in patients with severe lung diseases.

Cells exposed to elevated CO(2) died in galactose medium as well as when glucose-6-phosphate isomerase was knocked down, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. High CO(2) levels led to increased levels of microRNA-183 (miR-183), which in turn decreased expression of IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2). The high CO(2)-induced decrease in cell proliferation was rescued by alpha-ketoglutarate and overexpression of IDH2, whereas proliferation decreased in normocapnic cells transfected with siRNA for IDH2. Also, overexpression of miR-183 decreased IDH2 (mRNA and protein) as well as cell proliferation under normocapnic conditions, whereas inhibition of miR-183 rescued the normal proliferation phenotype in cells exposed to elevated levels of CO(2). Accordingly, we provide evidence that high CO(2) induces miR-183, which down-regulates IDH2, thus impairing mitochondrial function and cell proliferation.

Earlier we observed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-deficient mice are more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than AhR-sufficient mice, and this phenomenon was associated with a lack of expression of cytochrome P450 1A enzymes. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor used in humans with gastric acid-related disorders, activates AhR in hepatocytes in vitro. However, the effects of omeprazole on AhR activation in the lungs and its impact on hyperoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammation are unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that omeprazole attenuates hyperoxia-induced cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in human lung-derived H441 cells via AhR activation. Experimental groups included cells transfected with AhR small interfering RNA (siRNA). Hyperoxia resulted in significant increases in cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and MCP-1 production, which were significantly attenuated with the functional activation of AhR by omeprazole. The protective effects of omeprazole on cytotoxicity, ROS production, and MCP-1 production were lost in H441 cells whose AhR gene was silenced by AhR siRNA. These findings support the hypothesis that omeprazole protects against hyperoxic injury in vitro via AhR activation that is associated with decreased ROS generation and expression of MCP-1.

DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of inflammation from peripheral blood associate with poor brain imaging outcomes in adult cohorts. However, the robustness of DNAm inflammatory scores in infancy, their relation to comorbidities of preterm birth characterised by inflammation, neonatal neuroimaging metrics of EoP, and saliva cross-tissue applicability are unknown., METHODS: Using salivary DNAm from 258 neonates (n = 155 preterm, gestational age at birth 23.28 - 34.84 weeks, n = 103 term, gestational age at birth 37.00 - 42.14 weeks), we investigated the impact of a DNAm surrogate for C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) on brain structure and other clinically defined inflammatory exposures. We assessed i) if DNAm CRP estimates varied between preterm infants at term equivalent age and term infants, ii) how DNAm CRP related to different types of inflammatory exposure (maternal, fetal and postnatal) and iii) whether elevated DNAm CRP associated with poorer measures of neonatal brain volume and white matter connectivity., RESULTS: Higher DNAm CRP was linked to preterm status (-0.0107 +/- 0.0008, compared with -0.0118 +/- 0.0006 among term infants; p < 0.001), as well as perinatal inflammatory diseases, including histologic chorioamnionitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotising enterocolitis (OR range , 2.00 ,  to , 4.71, , p < 0.01). Preterm infants with higher DNAm CRP scores had lower brain volume in deep grey matter, white matter, and hippocampi and amygdalae (beta range , 0.185,  to , 0.218, ). No such associations were observed for term infants. Association magnitudes were largest for measures of white matter microstructure among preterms, where elevated epigenetic inflammation associated with poorer global measures of white matter integrity (beta range , 0.206,  to , 0.371, ), independent of other confounding exposures., CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related DNAm captures the allostatic load of inflammatory burden in preterm infants.

Arrested lung development leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but the molecular pathways that cause this arrest are unclear. Lung injury and inflammation increase disease risk, but the cellular site of the inflammatory response and the potential role of localized inflammatory signaling in inhibiting lung morphogenesis are not known. In this study, we show that tissue macrophages present in the fetal mouse lung mediate the inflammatory response to LPS and that macrophage activation inhibits airway morphogenesis. Macrophage depletion or targeted inactivation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway protected airway branching in cultured lung explants from the effects of LPS. Macrophages also appear to be the primary cellular site of IL-1beta production following LPS exposure. Conversely, targeted NF-kappaB activation in transgenic macrophages was sufficient to inhibit airway morphogenesis. Macrophage activation in vivo inhibited expression of multiple genes critical for normal lung development, leading to thickened lung interstitium, reduced airway branching, and perinatal death. We propose that fetal lung macrophage activation contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia by generating a localized inflammatory response that disrupts developmental signals critical for lung formation.","group":"g1","id":"e50048cf-5195-4d07-a6e2-dd381b2c3f59","_showDetails":false},"14689ee1-a508-48af-8f39-d927fdab99b7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Omeprazole attenuates hyperoxic lung injury in mice via aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation and is associated with increased expression of cytochrome P4501A enzymes.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1124/jpet.111.182980","authors":["Shivanna, Binoy","Jiang, Weiwu","Wang, Lihua","Couroucli, Xanthi I","Moorthy, Bhagavatula"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20110718//","keywords":["*Acute Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","*Acute Lung Injury/pc [Prevention & Control]","Animals","Blotting, Western","Chemokine CCL2/me [Metabolism]","*Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/bi [Biosynthesis]","Enzyme Induction","*Enzyme Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]","*Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Immunohistochemistry","Liver/en [Enzymology]","Lung/en [Enzymology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Inbred DBA","Mice, Inbred Strains","Microsomes/de [Drug Effects]","Microsomes/me [Metabolism]","Neutrophil Infiltration/de [Drug Effects]","*Omeprazole/pd [Pharmacology]","Organ Size/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Edema/pa [Pathology]","*Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/ag [Agonists]","Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/ge [Genetics]","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"journal":"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","volume":"339","number":"1","isbn":"0022-3565","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21768223"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Hyperoxia contributes to lung injury in experimental animals and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) enzymes, which are regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), have been shown to attenuate hyperoxic lung injury in rodents. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, used in humans to treat gastric acid-related disorders, induces hepatic CYP1A in vitro. However, the mechanism by which omeprazole induces CYP1A and its impact on CYP1A expression in vivo and hyperoxic lung injury are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that omeprazole attenuates hyperoxic lung injury in adult wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice by an AhR-mediated induction of pulmonary and hepatic CYP1A enzymes. Accordingly, we determined the effects of omeprazole on pulmonary and hepatic CYP1A expression and hyperoxic lung injury in adult WT and AhR dysfunctional (AhRd) mice. We found that omeprazole attenuated lung injury in WT mice. Attenuation of lung injury by omeprazole paralleled enhanced pulmonary CYP1A1 and hepatic CYP1A2 expression in the omeprazole-treated mice. On the other hand, omeprazole failed to enhance pulmonary CYP1A1 and hepatic CYP1A2 expression and protect against hyperoxic lung injury in AhRd mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that omeprazole attenuates hyperoxic lung injury in mice by AhR-mediated mechanisms, and this phenomenon is associated with induction of CYP1A enzymes. These studies have important implications for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperoxia-induced disorders such as BPD in infants and acute respiratory distress syndrome in older children and adults.","group":"g1","id":"14689ee1-a508-48af-8f39-d927fdab99b7","_showDetails":false},"d5d3271e-3c80-4d87-a7fa-7ab44c87de22":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Neonatal hyperoxia causes pulmonary vascular disease and shortens life span in aging mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.02.010","authors":["Yee, Min","White, R James","Awad, Hani A","Bates, Wendy A","McGrath-Morrow, Sharon A","O'Reilly, Michael A"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20110506//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Biomarkers/me [Metabolism]","Body Weight/de [Drug Effects]","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/pa [Pathology]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/pp [Physiopathology]","Longevity/de [Drug Effects]","*Longevity/ph [Physiology]","Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","*Lung Diseases/co [Complications]","Lung Diseases/pa [Pathology]","Lung Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]","Mice","Organ Size/de [Drug Effects]","Oxygen/to [Toxicity]","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pp [Physiopathology]","Respiratory Function Tests","Signal Transduction/de [Drug Effects]","*Vascular Diseases/co [Complications]","Vascular Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"The American journal of pathology","volume":"178","number":"6","isbn":"0002-9440","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21550015"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease observed in premature infants requiring oxygen supplementation and ventilation. Although the use of exogenous surfactant and protective ventilation strategies has improved survival, the long-term pulmonary consequences of neonatal hyperoxia are unknown. Here, we investigate whether neonatal hyperoxia alters pulmonary function in aging mice. By 67 weeks of age, mice exposed to 100% oxygen between postnatal days 1 to 4 showed significantly a shortened life span (56.6% survival, n = 53) compared to siblings exposed to room air as neonates (100% survival, n = 47). Survivors had increased lung compliance and decreased elastance. There was also right ventricular hypertrophy and pathological evidence for pulmonary hypertension, defined by reduction of the distal microvasculature and the presence of numerous dilated arterioles expressing von Willebrand factor and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Consistent with recent literature implicating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in pulmonary vascular disease, BMP receptors and downstream phospho-Smad1/5/8 were reduced in lungs of aging mice exposed to neonatal oxygen. BMP signaling alterations were not observed in 8-week-old mice. These data suggest that loss of BMP signaling in aged mice exposed to neonatal oxygen is associated with a shortened life span, pulmonary vascular disease, and associated cardiac failure.

Levels of eight proinflammatory cytokines in tracheal aspirate were interrelated and unchanged from baseline after surfactant treatment., CONCLUSION: Booster doses of surfactant for premature infants with lung disease are safe and transiently improve respiratory status as well as composition and function of endogenous surfactant.","group":"g1","id":"2c4e7851-3911-477c-9645-32c5183dfba5","_showDetails":false},"2e3bef0d-d9c7-40d2-8767-3a7f02e77fb1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"The impact of obesity on maternal morbidity and feto-infant outcomes among macrosomic infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2010.546451","authors":["Salihu, Hamisu M","Weldeselasse, Hanna E","Rao, Kiran","Marty, Phillip J","Whiteman, Valerie E"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20110121//","keywords":["Adult","Algorithms","Cohort Studies","Female","Fetal Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","Fetal Diseases/et [Etiology]","*Fetal Macrosomia/ep [Epidemiology]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Newborn, Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","Infant, Newborn, Diseases/et [Etiology]","Male","Missouri/ep [Epidemiology]","Morbidity","Obesity/co [Complications]","*Obesity/ep [Epidemiology]","Pregnancy","*Pregnancy Complications/ep [Epidemiology]","Pregnancy Complications/et [Etiology]","*Pregnancy Outcome/ep [Epidemiology]","Retrospective Studies","Young Adult"],"journal":"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians","volume":"24","number":"9","isbn":"1476-4954","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21250914"],"address":"England","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the contribution of obesity to maternal complications, neonatal morbidity and mortality among macrosomic births., DESIGN: A population-based retrospective cohort design using State of Missouri maternally linked birth cohort files., METHODS: Using pre-gravid body mass index (BMI), we categorized mothers of 116,976 singleton macrosomic live births as non-obese (BMI < 30) or obese (BMI >= 30). We used logistic regression models to generate adjusted odd ratios for pregnancy and neonatal complications. We also estimated the proportion of potentially preventable excess maternal and neonatal complications that could be eliminated among obese women with infant macrosomia at various levels of pre-pregnancy obesity reduction., RESULT: Obese mothers with macrosomic infants were at elevated risk for chronic hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 6.78 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.82-7.88]), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, (OR = 2.60 [CI: 2.34-2.88]) other types of diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.83 [CI: 2.65-3.02]) and preeclampsia (OR = 2.49 [CI: 2.33-2.67]).

This chronic lung disease results from arrested saccular airway development and is most common in infants exposed to inflammatory stimuli. In experimental models, inflammation inhibits expression of fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) and impairs epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during lung development; however, the mechanisms connecting inflammatory signaling with reduced growth factor expression are not yet understood. In this study we found that soluble inflammatory mediators present in tracheal fluid from preterm infants can prevent saccular airway branching. In addition, LPS treatment led to local production of mediators that inhibited airway branching and FGF-10 expression in LPS-resistant C.C3-Tlr4(Lpsd)/J fetal mouse lung explants. Both direct NF-kappaB activation and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) that activate NF-kappaB reduced FGF-10 expression, whereas chemokines that signal via other inflammatory pathways had no effect. Mutational analysis of the FGF-10 promoter failed to identify genetic elements required for direct NF-kappaB-mediated FGF-10 inhibition. Instead, NF-kappaB activation appeared to interfere with the normal stimulation of FGF-10 expression by Sp1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and nuclear coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB and Sp1 physically interact at the FGF-10 promoter. These findings indicate that inflammatory signaling through NF-kappaB disrupts the normal expression of FGF-10 in fetal lung mesenchyme by interfering with the transcriptional machinery critical for lung morphogenesis.","group":"g1","id":"d3d57a89-6fe6-4b86-aaac-db42f79acc76","_showDetails":false},"efb2d073-c98d-4b0b-b05a-ec8ee7ff3f7d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Complicated Intubations are Associated with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Very Low Birth Weight Infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1736130","authors":["Glenn, Tara","Fischer, Linnea","Markowski, Ashley","Carr, Cara Beth","Malay, Sindhoosha","Hibbs, Anna Maria"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20210909//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Infant","Humans","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Retrospective Studies","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Gestational Age","Intubation, Intratracheal/ae [Adverse Effects]","Birth Weight"],"journal":"American journal of perinatology","volume":"40","number":"11","isbn":"0735-1631","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=34500482"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between desaturation <60% (severe desaturation) during intubation and a total number of intubation attempts in the first week of life in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with adverse long-term outcomes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and severe periventricular/intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or 4 (PIVH)., STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was performed on VLBW infants intubated in the neonatal intensive care unit during the first week of life between January 2017 and July 2020. Descriptive tables were generated for two outcomes including BPD and PIVH. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for each outcome including significant predictors that differed between groups with a p-value of <0.2., RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were included. Patients with BPD or PIVH had a lower gestational age, and patients with BPD had a lower BW. Patients with BPD had a greater number of intubation attempts in the first week of life (4 vs. 3, p < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression controlling for confounding variables, the odds developing BPD were higher for patients with increased cumulative number of intubation attempts in the first week of life (odds ratio [OR]: 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.62, p = 0.029).

Previous findings in a newborn mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) suggest that thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is a novel regulator of VEGF expression. The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that Txnip negatively regulates VEGF through effects on HIF-mediated gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the levels of VEGF and Txnip protein in the lungs of 1-day-old newborn mice and E19 embryos and detected a significant inverse correlation. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship, we studied the effects of Txnip overexpression on HIF-mediated transcription using murine lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells. Overexpression of Txnip inhibited HIF-mediated reporter activity in both hypoxia and room air. Suppression of HIF activity by Txnip seemed to be independent of the ability of Txnip to bind to thioredoxin. Thus, our studies support a model in which Txnip is a potentially critical regulator of HIF-mediated gene transcription in the murine lung. Alterations in Txnip expression could alter lung VEGF expression in prematurely born human infants and contribute to the development of BPD. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical features, fluid and electrolyte balance were analyzed for the first 7 days of life using multivariate models of generalized estimation equations. A p value <0.05 was considered significant in all of the hypothesis tests., RESULTS: The prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 22%. Lower gestational age and birth weight, male gender, less frequent use of antenatal steroids, respiratory distress syndrome, use of surfactant, patent ductus arteriosus, duration of invasive ventilation and NICU stay were significantly associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The variation in serum values of potassium, phosphorus and creatinine during the first week of life also revealed an association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Higher mean plasma calcium values were associated with spontaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus. The use of indomethacin to induce patent ductus arteriosus closure was significantly higher in bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients., CONCLUSIONS: Differences in renal function and tubular handling of potassium and phosphorus are present during the first week of life among preterm neonates who will develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The higher rate of patent ductus arteriosus and indomethacin use may influence these differences. Serum levels of calcium also appear to play a role in spontaneous ductus arteriosus closure.","group":"g1","id":"a4986a28-c0a9-4220-bbda-932505773318","_showDetails":false},"ceb30e74-5053-4b6f-adea-b6988bd62d31":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in fetal monkey lung results in prenatal pulmonary fibrosis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00011810","authors":["Tarantal, A F","Chen, H","Shi, T T","Lu, C-H","Fang, A B","Buckley, S","Kolb, M","Gauldie, J","Warburton, D","Shi, W"],"date":"2010//","accessDate":"20100329//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Animals","Azo Compounds/pd [Pharmacology]","Cell Proliferation","Elastin/ch [Chemistry]","Female","Fibrosis/pa [Pathology]","*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Haplorhini","Humans","*Lung/em [Embryology]","Macaca mulatta","Pregnancy","Pregnancy, Animal","*Pulmonary Fibrosis/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Fibrosis/pa [Pathology]","*Transforming Growth Factor beta1/bi [Biosynthesis]"],"journal":"The European respiratory journal","volume":"36","number":"4","isbn":"0903-1936","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=20351039"],"address":"England","abstract":"Altered transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta expression levels have been linked to a variety of human respiratory diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary fibrosis. However, a causative role for aberrant TGF-beta in neonatal lung diseases has not been defined in primates.

The lungs were then harvested near term, and fixed for histology and immunohistochemistry. Lung hypoplasia was observed where TGF-beta1 was overexpressed during the second trimester. The most clearly marked phenotype consisted of severe pulmonary and pleural fibrosis, which was independent of the gestational time point when TGF-beta1 was overexpressed. Increased cell proliferation, particularly in alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts, was detected within the fibrotic foci. But epithelium to mesenchyme transdifferentiation was not detected. Massive collagen fibres were deposited on the inner and outer sides of the pleural membrane, with an intact elastin layer in the middle. This induced fibrotic pathology persisted even after adenoviral-mediated TGF-beta1 overexpression was no longer evident. Therefore, overexpression of TGF-beta1 within developing fetal monkey lung results in severe and progressive fibrosis in lung parenchyma and pleural membrane, in addition to pulmonary hypoplasia.","group":"g1","id":"ceb30e74-5053-4b6f-adea-b6988bd62d31","_showDetails":false},"ed665ab9-f341-4905-b211-8816fff832b6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"ErbB4 regulates the timely progression of late fetal lung development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.03.003","authors":["Liu, Washa","Purevdorj, Erkhembulgan","Zscheppang, Katja","von Mayersbach, Dietlinde","Behrens, Jan","Brinkhaus, Maria-Jantje","Nielsen, Heber C","Schmiedl, Andreas","Dammann, Christiane E L"],"date":"2010//","accessDate":"20100317//","keywords":["Animals","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","CD11b Antigen/me [Metabolism]","Cells, Cultured","ErbB Receptors/ge [Genetics]","*ErbB Receptors/me [Metabolism]","Female","Fetus/ah [Anatomy & Histology]","*Fetus/ph [Physiology]","Fibroblasts/cy [Cytology]","Fibroblasts/ph [Physiology]","Heart/em [Embryology]","Heart/ph [Physiology]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Surfactants/ch [Chemistry]","Pulmonary Surfactants/me [Metabolism]","Receptor, ErbB-4"],"journal":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","volume":"1803","number":"7","isbn":"0006-3002","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=20303366"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"The ErbB4 receptor has an important function in fetal lung maturation. Deletion of ErbB4 leads to alveolar hypoplasia and hyperreactive airways similar to the changes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is a chronic pulmonary disorder affecting premature infants as a consequence of lung immaturity, lung damage, and abnormal repair. We hypothesized that proper ErbB4 function is needed for the timely progression of fetal lung development. An ErbB4 transgenic cardiac rescue mouse model was used to study the effect of ErbB4 deletion on fetal lung structure, surfactant protein (SP) expression, and synthesis, and inflammation. Morphometric analyses revealed a delayed structural development with a significant decrease in saccular size at E18 and more pronounced changes at E17, keeping these lungs in the canalicular stage. SP-B mRNA expression was significantly down regulated at E17 with a subsequent decrease in SP-B protein expression at E18. SP-D protein expression was significantly decreased at E18. Surfactant phospholipid synthesis was significantly decreased on both days, and secretion was down regulated at E18. We conclude that pulmonary ErbB4 deletion results in a structural and functional delay in fetal lung development, indicating a crucial regulatory role of ErbB4 in the timely progression of fetal lung development.

Oxygen toxicity, barotrauma, and volutrauma play key roles in its pathogenesis. Parenteral administration of Vitamin A to the newborn is the current recommended preventive therapy for BPD. Vitamin A has been found to upregulate genes necessary for fetal lung growth and increase surfactant production in animal models. Supplementation of Vitamin A in late pregnancy increases the cord blood vitamin A levels proportionately. Hence, we hypothesize that Vitamin A supplementation during late pregnancy can decrease the incidence of BPD in newborns. This can be an effective adjunct to postnatal preventive therapy. Vitamin A supplementation in late pregnancy carries no risk of teratogenicity unlike in early pregnancy. Moreover, vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy is associated with depressed immune function leading on to increased infectious morbidity and can cause intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight and anemia in newborns. Combining antenatal Vitamin A supplementation to the mother with postnatal supplementation to the newborn can effectively prevent BPD better than the traditional postnatal preventive therapy alone. It will also treat the highly prevalent vitamin A deficiency in pregnant mothers and newborns of the developing world.","group":"g1","id":"6f130432-f5fa-44ec-bff8-fce3782830ff","_showDetails":false},"ea9636f2-2972-4f48-a64b-0bf5b7ca836f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"High-mobility group box-1 protein in tracheal aspirates from premature infants: relationship with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and steroid therapy.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jp.2010.16","authors":["Aghai, Z H","Saslow, J G","Meniru, C","Porter, C","Eydelman, R","Bhat, V","Stahl, G","Sannoh, S","Pyon, K","Hewitt, C","Bhandari, V"],"date":"2010//","accessDate":"20100225//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","Dexamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Female","*Homeodomain Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Sputum/me [Metabolism]","Steroids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Trachea"],"journal":"Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association","volume":"30","number":"9","isbn":"0743-8346","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=20182437"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a potent inflammatory mediator and contributes to acute lung injury in adults. The role of HMGB1 in neonatal lung injury and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. We studied the association between HMGB1 levels in tracheal aspirates (TAs) and adverse outcomes (BPD/death) in ventilated premature infants (VPIs) and modulation of HMGB1 levels with dexamethasone (Dex) use., STUDY DESIGN: Infants born before 32 weeks gestation and requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Serial TA samples were collected on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 and HMGB1 levels were measured. HMGB1 levels in TA samples were compared between infants with no BPD and infants who developed BPD or died. HMGB1 TA levels were also compared before and after using Dex., RESULT: In all, 24 infants (gestational age 26.4+/-1.9 weeks, birth weight 859+/-200 g) had no BPD, 60 infants (gestational age 25.4+/-1.8 weeks, birth weight 749+/-156 g) developed BPD or died before 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Mean HMGB1 level in first week of life was significantly lower in infants with no BPD (27.3+/-16.5 ng mg(-1)) compared with those who developed BPD or died (45.1+/-30.9 ng mg(-1), P=0.004). In total, 29 VPIs received Dex. There was no significant change in HMGB1 levels with steroid therapy (before 47.0+/-43.9, after 60.1.5+/-58.8, P=0.3)., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that higher HMGB1 levels in TA are associated with the development of BPD or death in VPI.

However, prior to the description in 1967 of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), following ventilator therapy for respiratory distress syndrome, Wilson-Mikity syndrome (WMS) had been described in very preterm infants on minimal oxygen supplementation. In the 1970s and 1980s, many infants treated with assisted ventilation required prolonged mechanical ventilation after developing radiographic features of coarse infiltrates, severe hyperinflation, and microcystic changes, associated with hypercarbemia and the need for increased inspired oxygen concentrations. Some infants died and showed evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, obstructive bronchiolitis, and dysplastic change. The role of supplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and the immaturity of the lung have long been considered important in the etiology of CLD/BPD. More recently, the role of inflammation (particularly antenatal exposure to cytokines) and individual susceptibility (genetic predisposition) have assumed greater etiologic importance. The historical setting into which corticosteroid treatment for BPD was introduced is also discussed. After the licensing of exogenous surfactant to treat RDS in the early 1990s and more widespread use of prenatal corticosteroids in the mid-1990s, severe BPD became an unusual event. Gradually, the diagnosis of CLD, still often referred to as BPD, was based on an oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. However, it is not clear that this 'new BPD' is substantially different from WMS. It is difficult to make prognostications about long-term lung function of these infants based on oxygen 'requirement' at 36 weeks, since supplemental oxygen is frequently used unnecessarily.","group":"g1","id":"d405baae-404d-43b0-9a66-b5396f9bcab6","_showDetails":false},"bbd64fa0-0603-4491-ae79-97b80f8a8cf0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Antenatal steroids and antioxidant enzyme activity in preterm infants: influence of gender and timing.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ars.2009.2671","authors":["Vento, Maximo","Aguar, Marta","Escobar, Javier","Arduini, Alessandro","Escrig, Raquel","Brugada, Maria","Izquierdo, Isabel","Asensi, Miguel Angel","Sastre, Juan","Saenz, Pilar","Gimeno, Ana"],"date":"2009//","keywords":["Adolescent","*Adrenal Cortex Hormones/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Adult","*Antioxidants/me [Metabolism]","*Catalase/me [Metabolism]","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Male","Oxidative Stress","Pregnancy","Prospective Studies","*Sex Factors","*Superoxide Dismutase/me [Metabolism]","Young Adult"],"journal":"Antioxidants & redox signaling","volume":"11","number":"12","isbn":"1523-0864","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19645572"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Antenatal steroids have improved the survival of preterm infants; however, the mechanism of action is not fully understood.

The identification of small molecules acting as agents for enzyme enhancement therapy is an attractive approach for treating different forms of GD. A thermal denaturation assay utilizing wild type GCase was developed to screen a library of 1,040 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. Ambroxol (ABX), a drug used to treat airway mucus hypersecretion and hyaline membrane disease in newborns, was identified and found to be a pH-dependent, mixed-type inhibitor of GCase. Its inhibitory activity was maximal at neutral pH, found in the endoplasmic reticulum, and undetectable at the acidic pH of lysosomes. The pH dependence of ABX to bind and stabilize the enzyme was confirmed by monitoring the rate of hydrogen/deuterium exchange at increasing guanidine hydrochloride concentrations. ABX treatment significantly increased N370S and F213I mutant GCase activity and protein levels in GD fibroblasts. These increases were primarily confined to the lysosome-enriched fraction of treated cells, a finding confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Additionally, enhancement of GCase activity and a reduction in glucosylceramide storage was verified in ABX-treated GD lymphoblasts (N370S/N370S). Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed that upon binding of ABX, amino acid segments 243-249, 310-312, and 386-400 near the active site of GCase are stabilized. Consistent with its mixed-type inhibition of GCase, modeling studies indicated that ABX interacts with both active and non-active site residues. Thus, ABX has the biochemical characteristics of a safe and effective enzyme enhancement therapy agent for the treatment of patients with the most common GD genotypes.","group":"g1","id":"a68a33e1-7ac4-4a93-a6e0-abd863915873","_showDetails":false},"c14435a1-4a64-4d8e-971b-d43cdf72776f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Enhanced Parenteral Nutrition Is Feasible and Safe in Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants: A Randomized Trial.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000527552","authors":["Nagel, Emily M","Gonzalez V, Juan David","Bye, Jeffrey K","Super, Jennifer","Demerath, Ellen W","Ramel, Sara E"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230222//","keywords":["Infant","Child","Infant, Newborn","Humans","*Infant, Premature","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Parenteral Nutrition/mt [Methods]","Glucose","*Hyperglycemia","Birth Weight"],"journal":"Neonatology","volume":"120","number":"2","isbn":"1661-7800","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=36812894"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of enhanced early (PN) (early initiation of intralipids and faster advancement of glucose infusion rate) during the first week of life for very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants., METHODS: 90 VLBW preterm infants (<32 weeks gestational age at birth) admitted to the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital between August 2017 and June 2019 were included.

These stimuli alter alveolarization and contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. While prior research has focused primarily on late gestational effects of inflammation on alveolar development, we sought to study whether early gestational exposure to endotoxin affects branching morphogenesis, during the critical pseudoglandular stage of lung development., METHOD: Gestational day 15 (E15) fetal rat lung explants (term = 22 d) were treated with either 200 ng/mL or 2 microg/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS) with controls and examined daily by phase microscopy. After 5 d, explants were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, and sectioned at 5 mum in the coronal plane. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) to define endothelial cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to examine endothelial mitogenesis, and COX-2 antibodies as a marker for prostaglandin synthesis. Real-time PCR examined inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), FGF9, FGF10, and FGFr2 gene expression. Air space fraction and airway epithelium were analyzed with Image J software., RESULTS: Phase contrast microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin histology revealed progressive, dose-related changes in air sac contraction and interstitial thickening. Compared with control E15 explants, day 5 explants incubated with high dose LPS demonstrated thickened and shrunken airway sacs with stunted branching and increased matrix deposition in interstitial areas. By immunohistochemical staining, COX-2 was quantitatively increased after high dose LPS exposure, while PECAM was reduced. VEGF expression was unaltered. LPS increased iNOS, but decreased FGF9, FGF10, and FGFr2 gene expression., CONCLUSIONS: These data support evidence for an inflammatory effect of LPS on the early phase of lung development in the fetal rat, affecting branching morphogenesis during the pseudoglandular phase. Fetal endothelial cells are clearly affected, while COX-2 elevation suggests activation of an as yet undefined fetal pulmonary inflammatory cascade. We speculate that proinflammatory stimuli may ultimately lead to abnormal pulmonary development via fibroblastic growth factor (FGF)-directed mechanisms that affect epithelial-mesenchymal interaction and differentiation at a much earlier gestational age than was previously recognized.","group":"g1","id":"b5a972a8-e99e-436d-9fbd-6bc2b18e625b","_showDetails":false},"8f8657e5-e227-4255-a737-6338f44b1046":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 enhances lung alveolarisation in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00109008","authors":["Woyda, K","Koebrich, S","Reiss, I","Rudloff, S","Pullamsetti, S S","Ruhlmann, A","Weissmann, N","Ghofrani, H A","Gunther, A","Seeger, W","Grimminger, F","Morty, R E","Schermuly, R T"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20081114//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Blotting, Western","*Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia/en [Enzymology]","Lung Compliance/de [Drug Effects]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/en [Enzymology]","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"journal":"The European respiratory journal","volume":"33","number":"4","isbn":"0903-1936","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19010982"],"address":"England","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterised by impaired alveolarisation, inflammation and aberrant vascular development.

Evidence on the use of mucolytic agents including acetylcysteine and deoxyribonuclease, and the anti-inflammatory agents including the macrolide antibiotics, cromolyn, pentoxyfylline, and recombinant human Clara cell protein are also reviewed.","group":"g1","id":"8246f325-b290-423f-b002-1032a290430e","_showDetails":false},"d9aa7689-21d8-457a-9d7e-0b3a9497a8a2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Amniotic fluid concentration of surfactant proteins in intra-amniotic infection.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14767050802215664","authors":["Chaiworapongsa, Tinnakorn","Hong, Joon-Seok","Hull, William M","Romero, Roberto","Whitsett, Jeffrey A"],"date":"2008//","keywords":["Adolescent","Adrenal Cortex Hormones/pd [Pharmacology]","Adult","*Amniotic Fluid/me [Metabolism]","Case-Control Studies","Female","Humans","Pregnancy","*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/me [Metabolism]","Prenatal Care","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/de [Drug Effects]","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Young Adult"],"journal":"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians","volume":"21","number":"9","isbn":"1476-4954","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18828060"],"address":"England","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary surfactant is a complex molecule of lipids and proteins synthesized and secreted by type II alveolar cells into the alveolar epithelial lining. Both lipid and protein components are essential for lung function in postnatal life. Infection is a well-established cause of preterm delivery, and several inflammatory cytokines play a role in the mechanisms of preterm parturition. An increased concentration of inflammatory cytokines in amniotic fluid or fetal plasma has been linked to the onset of preterm parturition and fetal/neonatal injury, including cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease. Experimental evidence indicates that inflammatory mediators also regulate surfactant protein synthesis, and histologic chorioamnionitis is associated with a decreased incidence of hyaline membrane disease in neonates. This study was conducted to determine if amniotic fluid concentrations of surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, and SP-D change in patients with and without intra-amniotic infection (IAI)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to determine amniotic fluid concentrations of SP-A, SP-B, SP-D, and total protein in patients who had an amniocentesis performed between 18 and 34 weeks of gestation for the detection of IAI in patients with spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes (n = 42) and cervical insufficiency prior to the application of cerclage (n = 6). Amniotic fluid samples were selected from a bank of biological specimens and included patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 32) IAI matched for gestational age at amniocentesis. Intra-amniotic infection was defined as a positive amniotic fluid culture for microorganisms. Each group was further subdivided according to a history of corticosteroid administration within 7 days prior to amniocentesis into the following subgroups: (1) patients without IAI who had received antenatal corticosteroids (n = 21), (2) patients with IAI who had received antenatal corticosteroids (n = 9), (3) patients without IAI who had not received antenatal corticosteroids (n = 11), and (4) patients with IAI who had not received antenatal corticosteroids (n = 7). Amniotic fluid was obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis. SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D concentrations in amniotic fluid were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis., RESULTS: Women with IAI had a higher median amniotic fluid concentration of SP-B and of SP-B/total protein, but not other SPs, than those without IAI (both p = 0.03). Among patients who had received antenatal corticosteroids, the median amniotic fluid concentration of SP-B and of SP-B/total protein was significantly higher in patients with IAI than in those without IAI (SP-B, IAI: median 148 ng/mL, range 37.3-809 ng/mL vs. without IAI: median 7.2 ng/mL, range 0-1035 ng/mL; p = 0.005 and SP-B/total protein, IAI: median 14.1 ng/mg, range 4.3-237.5 ng/mg vs. without IAI: median 1.45 ng/mg, range 0-79.5 ng/mg; p = 0.003). Among women who had not received antenatal corticosteroids, the median amniotic fluid concentrations of SP-B and of SP-B/total protein were not significantly different between patients with and without IAI (SP-B, IAI: median 4 ng/mL, range 0-31.4 ng/mL vs. without IAI: median 3.4 ng/mL, range 0-37 ng/mL; p = 0.8 and SP-B/total protein, IAI: median 0.55 ng/mg, range 0-6.96 ng/mg vs. without IAI: median 0.59 ng/mg, range 0-3.28 ng/mg; p = 0.9). The median amniotic fluid concentrations of SP-A, SP-A/total protein, SP-D, and SP-D/total protein were not significantly different between patients with and without IAI whether they received antenatal corticosteroids or not (all p > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: IAI was associated with an increased amniotic fluid concentration of SP-B in patients who received antenatal corticosteroids within 7 days prior to amniocentesis.","group":"g1","id":"d9aa7689-21d8-457a-9d7e-0b3a9497a8a2","_showDetails":false},"7f2e9c93-2f1f-438c-85a1-2e8add9556e7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Association between birth weight in preterm neonates and the BclI polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2008.05.002","authors":["Bertalan, Rita","Patocs, Attila","Vasarhelyi, Barna","Treszl, Andras","Varga, Ibolya","Szabo, Eva","Tamas, Judit","Toke, Judit","Boyle, Belema","Nobilis, Andras","Rigo, Janos Jr","Racz, Karoly"],"date":"2008//","accessDate":"20080527//","keywords":["*Birth Weight/ge [Genetics]","Cohort Studies","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Male","*Polymorphism, Genetic","Pregnancy","*Premature Birth/ge [Genetics]","*Receptors, Glucocorticoid/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology","volume":"111","number":"1-2","isbn":"0960-0760","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18595687"],"address":"England","abstract":"Endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids influence fetal growth and development, and maternal administration of synthetic glucocorticoids may decrease the risk of perinatal morbidity including lung disease in preterm neonates.

Almost 25 years later, Richard Pattle, John Clements and Chris Macklin, each working on the effects of nerve gases on the lungs, contributed to the understanding of the physiology of pulmonary surfactant. About 5 years later Mary Ellen Avery and Jere Mead published convincing evidence that preterm neonates dying of hyaline membrane disease (respiratory distress syndrome, RDS) had a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. The first trials of nebulized synthetic (protein-free) surfactant to prevent RDS were published soon after Patrick Bouvier Kennedy (son of President John F Kennedy) died of this disorder after treatment in Boston. These trials were unsuccessful; however, Goran Enhorning and Bengt Robertson in the early 1970s demonstrated that natural surfactants (containing proteins) were effective in an immature rabbit model of RDS. Soon after this Forrest Adams showed that a natural surfactant was also effective in an immature lamb model. Working with him was Tetsuro Fujiwara who 2 years later, after returning to Japan, published the seminal article reporting the responses of 10 preterm infants with RDS to a bolus of modified bovine surfactant. During the 1980s there were numerous randomized controlled trials of many different natural and synthetic surfactants, demonstrating reductions in pulmonary air leaks and neonatal mortality. Subsequently natural surfactants were shown to be superior to the protein-free synthetic products. Recently there have been a number of randomized trials comparing different natural surfactant preparations. Commercially available bovine surfactants may have similar efficacy but there is some evidence that a porcine surfactant used to treat RDS with an initial dose of 200 mg per kg is more effective than a bovine surfactant used in an initial dose of 100 mg per kg. Bovine and porcine surfactants have not been compared in trials of prophylaxis. Very recently a new synthetic surfactant with a surfactant protein mimic has been compared with other commercially available natural and synthetic surfactants in two trials. The new surfactant may be superior to one of the older protein-free synthetic surfactants but there is no evidence of its superiority over established natural products and it is currently not approved for clinical use. A number of other new synthetic surfactants have been tested in animal models or in treatment of adults with ARDS, but so far there have been no reports of treatment of neonatal RDS. Natural surfactants work best if given by a rapid bolus into the lungs but less invasive methods such as a laryngeal mask, pharyngeal deposition or rapid extubation to CPAP have showed promise. Unfortunately, delivery of surfactant by nebulization has so far been ineffective. Surfactant treatment has been tried in a number of other neonatal respiratory disorders but only infants with meconium aspiration seem to benefit although larger and more frequent doses are probably needed to demonstrate improved lung function. A surfactant protocol based upon early treatment and CPAP is suggested for very preterm infants. Earlier treatment may improve survival rates for these infants; however, there is a risk of increasing the prevalence of milder forms of chronic lung disease. Nevertheless, surfactant therapy has been a major contribution to care of the preterm newborn during the past 25 years.","group":"g1","id":"cd977374-d6fe-41cb-a2c6-74c8d9fd07f7","_showDetails":false},"62ae8f52-efb9-41e3-900c-d09f4d14d82f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Endothelial function in children with a history of premature prolonged rupture of membranes and bronchopulmonary dysplasia--a pilot study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00802.x","authors":["Liljedahl, Magnus","Martin, Helena","Magnuson, Anders","Montgomery, Scott M","Schollin, Jens"],"date":"2008//","accessDate":"20080421//","keywords":["Acetylcholine/pd [Pharmacology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Child","*Endothelium, Vascular/pp [Physiopathology]","Female","*Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture/pp [Physiopathology]","Follow-Up Studies","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Pregnancy","*Skin/bs [Blood Supply]","Vasodilation/de [Drug Effects]","Vasodilator Agents/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","volume":"97","number":"7","isbn":"0803-5253","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18430069"],"address":"Norway","abstract":"AIM: To investigate vascular function in children with a neonatal history of generalised inflammation indicated by premature prolonged rupture of membranes (PPROM) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Children born at <or=30 weeks 1994-2000 were investigated at a present age of 6-12 years.

We prematurely delivered mouse pups at embryonic day 18, during the early saccular stage of pulmonary development. Only 8% of the prematurely delivered pups genetically deficient in MIF survived 8 h vs 75% of wild-type controls (p<0.001). This phenotype was corrected when pups of all genotypes were bred from dams heterozygote for MIF deficiency. Local production of MIF in the lung increased at embryonic day 18, continued until full-term at embryonic day 19.5, and decreased in adulthood, thus coinciding with this developmental window. The lungs of pups genetically deficient in MIF were less mature upon histological evaluation, and demonstrated lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and corticosterone--two factors that promote fetal lung maturation. In vitro studies support a role for MIF in surfactant production by pulmonary epithelial cells. In a cohort of human neonates with RDS, higher intrapulmonary MIF levels were associated with a lower likelihood of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a sequelae of RDS (p<0.03).

Preterm infants with postnatal CMV infections are susceptible to a variety of life-threatening conditions., CASE SUMMARY: Twin male infants were delivered via emergency caesarian section at 27 weeks' gestation secondary to maternal complete uterine rupture. The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were 1 and 1 for the older twin (Twin A) and 0 and 3 for the younger twin (Twin B). Their birth weights were 1203 g (+ 0.65SD) and 495 g (- 3.79SD) respectively. On day 41, laboratory blood test results for Twin B showed a moderate elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP), thrombocytopenia. CMV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests in Twin B's urine and blood as well as in the mother's breast milk were positive, but stored, dried umbilical cord CMV qPCR tests were negative. Twin B was diagnosed with a postnatal CMV infection secondary to infected breast milk and ganciclovir was commenced on day 52. Treatment was switched to valganciclovir at 74 days of age, but a negative CMV-DNA level in the blood was not achieved. Postnatal CMV infection in this infant led to an exacerbation of pre-existing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and he demised at 182 days of age., CONCLUSION: Postnatal cytomegalovirus infections may lead to exacerbations of BPD. Early use of raw breast milk in preterm infants should be done with careful consideration of this potential complication.","group":"g1","id":"80c5ad41-7784-49e2-aec6-b9242cbc9daa","_showDetails":false},"91b25ead-d307-404a-b94a-ae10bfb9fa1a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Expression of hypoxia-inducible factors in normal human lung development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2350/07-04-0257.1","authors":["Rajatapiti, Prapapan","van der Horst, Irene W J M","de Rooij, Jessica D","Tran, Maxine G B","Maxwell, Patrick H","Tibboel, Dick","Rottier, Robbert","de Krijger, Ronald R"],"date":"2008//","accessDate":"20070702//","keywords":["Adult","Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins","*Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/bi [Biosynthesis]","Female","Fetus","Humans","*Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/bi [Biosynthesis]","Immunohistochemistry","Infant, Newborn","*Lung/em [Embryology]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Pregnancy","RNA, Messenger/an [Analysis]","Repressor Proteins","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","*Transcription Factors/bi [Biosynthesis]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/bi [Biosynthesis]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/bi [Biosynthesis]","Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein/bi [Biosynthesis]"],"journal":"Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society","volume":"11","number":"3","isbn":"1093-5266","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=17990921"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Pulmonary vascular development is essential for proper lung development, and its disturbance can lead to neonatal morbidity and mortality, as exemplified in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) appear to be key molecules in physiologic angiogenesis and in certain forms of lung pathology, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Little is known about the qualitative and quantitative expression of HIFs in normal human fetal lung development. Therefore, we investigated the expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, and HIF-3alpha, along with their upstream regulators and downstream targets, von Hippel-Lindau protein, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and its receptor, VEGFR-2, in 20 normal human fetal lungs (13.5 weeks in gestation until term) and 5 adult lungs. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a positive correlation between HIF-2alpha and VEGF-A expression and gestational age. Although there appeared to be a decreasing trend in HIF-3alpha expression during pregnancy, it did not reach statistical significance. Immunohistochemistry for HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha revealed that HIF-1alpha is expressed in the epithelium, while HIF-2alpha is expressed in both interstitium and epithelium. Our data indicate that HIFs, most notably HIF-2alpha, appear to exert an important role in angiogenesis during human fetal lung development, especially in the last phases of pregnancy, preparing the fetus for extrauterine life. As such, our results form the baseline data for the evaluation and interpretation of abnormal pulmonary vascular development.","group":"g1","id":"91b25ead-d307-404a-b94a-ae10bfb9fa1a","_showDetails":true},"f834736e-e799-4197-a8b0-25b6570a31c4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Early hypoadrenalism in premature infants at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00500.x","authors":["Nykanen, Paivi","Anttila, Eija","Heinonen, Kirsti","Hallman, Mikko","Voutilainen, Raimo"],"date":"2007//","accessDate":"20070919//","keywords":["*Adrenal Insufficiency/di [Diagnosis]","Adrenal Insufficiency/mo [Mortality]","Adrenal Insufficiency/pc [Prevention & Control]","Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","Betamethasone/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Betamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Biomarkers/bl [Blood]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate/bl [Blood]","Dexamethasone/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Dexamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Female","Fetal Blood/ch [Chemistry]","Finland/ep [Epidemiology]","Glucocorticoids/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Glucocorticoids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Humans","*Hydrocortisone/bl [Blood]","Hydrocortisone/df [Deficiency]","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/ph [Physiology]","Male","Outcome Assessment, Health Care","Pregnancy","Pregnancy Complications/pc [Prevention & Control]","Prenatal Care","Prospective Studies","Risk Factors"],"journal":"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","volume":"96","number":"11","isbn":"0803-5253","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17888053"],"address":"Norway","abstract":"AIM: To study the relationship between serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) concentrations and death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age in preterm infants., METHODS: Prospective measurement of cord, day of birth (D0) and day 4 (D4) serum cortisol and DHEAS concentrations and performance of low-dose (LD) ACTH tests in 89 preterm infants with gestational age <34 weeks at birth and in need of mechanical ventilation., RESULTS: Serum DHEAS levels correlated negatively with gestational age.

In the multiple logistic regression analyses, gestational age was the most significant factor affecting outcome, but low cord and D0 basal and stimulated cortisol and gestation-adjusted DHEAS levels also predicted poor outcome (OR 5.7-22; p = 0.049-0.014)., CONCLUSIONS: Low cord and first day serum cortisol and DHEAS levels associated with poor outcome in preterm infants, which suggests general relative adrenocortical insufficiency in some premature newborns.","group":"g1","id":"f834736e-e799-4197-a8b0-25b6570a31c4","_showDetails":false},"ef9e8f12-b857-4179-9450-8bbab23e2adf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"FGF9 and SHH regulate mesenchymal Vegfa expression and development of the pulmonary capillary network.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.004879","authors":["White, Andrew C","Lavine, Kory J","Ornitz, David M"],"date":"2007//","accessDate":"20070919//","keywords":["Animals","Capillaries/cy [Cytology]","*Capillaries/em [Embryology]","*Capillaries/me [Metabolism]","Embryo, Mammalian/ah [Anatomy & Histology]","Embryo, Mammalian/ph [Physiology]","Fibroblast Growth Factor 9/ge [Genetics]","*Fibroblast Growth Factor 9/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Hedgehog Proteins/me [Metabolism]","In Situ Hybridization","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/em [Embryology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Lung","Mesoderm/cy [Cytology]","*Mesoderm/me [Metabolism]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/ge [Genetics]","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/me [Metabolism]","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2/ge [Genetics]","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2/me [Metabolism]","Signal Transduction/ph [Physiology]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]","*Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","volume":"134","number":"20","isbn":"0950-1991","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17881491"],"address":"England","abstract":"The juxtaposition of a dense capillary network to lung epithelial cells is essential for air-blood gas exchange. Defective lung vascular development can result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and alveolar capillary dysplasia. Although vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) is required for formation of the lung capillary network, little is known regarding the factors that regulate the density and location of the distal capillary plexus and the expression pattern of Vegfa. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling to lung mesenchyme, but not to endothelial cells, are each necessary and together sufficient for distal capillary development. Furthermore, both gain- and loss-of-function of FGF9 regulates Vegfa expression in lung mesenchyme, and VEGF signaling is required for FGF9-mediated blood vessel formation. FGF9, however, can only partially rescue the reduction in capillary density found in the absence of SHH signaling, and SHH is unable to rescue the vascular phenotype found in Fgf9(-/-) lungs. Thus, both signaling systems regulate distinct aspects of vascular development in distal lung mesenchyme. These data suggest a molecular mechanism through which FGF9 and SHH signaling coordinately control the growth and patterning of the lung capillary plexus, and regulate the temporal and spatial expression of Vegfa.","group":"g1","id":"ef9e8f12-b857-4179-9450-8bbab23e2adf","_showDetails":false},"91511058-ec69-4915-ae85-c098603d4edc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"In preterm neonates, is the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia influenced by the failure to protect total parenteral nutrition from exposure to ambient light?.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2007.04.029","authors":["Chessex, Philippe","Harrison, Adele","Khashu, Minesh","Lavoie, Jean-Claude"],"date":"2007//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Disease Progression","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","*Light/ae [Adverse Effects]","Male","*Parenteral Nutrition, Total/ae [Adverse Effects]","Parenteral Nutrition, Total/mt [Methods]","Reference Values","Risk Assessment","Severity of Illness Index","Survival Rate"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"151","number":"2","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17643781"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Light-exposed total parenteral nutrition (TPN) generates peroxides that contribute to an oxidant load.

As indicated in previous studies, moderate to severe fibrosis is a hallmark of pathology in the Ureaplasma-infected preterm lung. To further characterize the preterm lung's response to Ureaplasma, lung specimens from 4 gestational controls (GC), 12 other pneumonia and 5 Ureaplasma-infected infants were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), Hart's elastin staining, and in situ hybridization for tropoelastin (TE) expression. Cells positive for alphaSMA were observed in thickened, extensive bundles surrounding terminal airspaces in Ureaplasma and other pneumonia cases compared to individual myofibroblasts in GC. The myofibroblast pattern correlated with the severity of fibrosis, but not duration of ventilation. Transforming growth factor beta1 immunostaining was primarily localized to alveolar macrophages and was increased in Ureaplasma more than in other pneumonia cases. Elastic fibers and TE-expressing cells were spatially limited to emerging septal tips in GC. In pneumonia cases, increased deposition of elastic fibers was observed surrounding terminal airspaces, but TE expression was similar to GC. In Ureaplasma specimens, accumulation of elastic fibers correlated with duration of ventilation, and TE expression was extensive throughout the walls of terminal airspaces. These findings suggest that Ureaplasma is associated with alveolar macrophage TGFbeta1 immunostaining and myofibroblast proliferation contributing to abnormal septation, interstitial fibrosis, and a prolonged and strong elastogenic response in the preterm lung.","group":"g1","id":"947e6bf2-389c-4c12-9976-2fab7a42bb7a","_showDetails":false},"4b8be2eb-f790-41ce-8208-2ae399bf8762":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Associations of the IGF/IGFBP axis and respiratory diseases in neonatal patients during the first 6 months of life.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ghir.2006.04.006","authors":["Hubler, Axel","Schlenvoigt, Dorothea","Dost, Axel","Schramm, Dirk","Scheidt, Burkhart","Kauf, Eberhard"],"date":"2006//","accessDate":"20060608//","keywords":["Body Weights and Measures","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/bl [Blood]","*Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/an [Analysis]","*Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/an [Analysis]","*Respiration Disorders/bl [Blood]"],"journal":"Growth hormone & IGF research : official journal of the Growth Hormone Research Society and the International IGF Research Society","volume":"16","number":"3","isbn":"1096-6374","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16759894"],"address":"Scotland","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To analyse IGFs in respect to somatic growth and neonatal diseases during the first 6 months of life., METHODS: IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP-1, -2, -3) were determined by immunoassays in neonatal patients after birth (n = 67) and at 3 (3 mo; n = 75) and 6 months (6 mo; n = 47) of corrected postnatal age.

Premature infants are susceptible to BPD due to immature lungs and adverse perinatal episodes of infection, hyperoxia, and mechanical ventilation., Methods: Neutrophils are the first line of host defence, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is an important strategy to immobilize and kill invading microorganisms. This study examined whether NETs were associated with BPD in preterm infants and contributed to hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal mice via the WNT/beta-catenin pathway., Results: In this study, we found that preterm infants with BPD had higher levels of NETs in their tracheal aspirates than those without BPD. Neonatal mice treated with NETs after birth exhibited BPD-like changes in their lungs. Furthermore, the levels of Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and surfactant-associated protein C (SPC), which represent alveolar differentiation and development, were significantly lower than those in the controls. The WNT/beta-catenin pathway is one of the most well-known signalling pathways involved in lung growth. We found that the expression of the target genes c-MYC, cyclin D, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the important proteins WNT3a and beta-catenin significantly decreased. Moreover, heparin, which is a NET inhibitor, attenuated changes in gene and protein expression, thereby attenuating BPD-like changes., Discussion: This finding indicates that NETs are associated with BPD and can induce BPD-like changes in neonatal mice via the WNT/beta-catenin pathway.

It is essential for the generation of electrochemical gradients, which control the ionic environment necessary for electrical activity and water and electrolyte balance. Newborn infants who are at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are frequently treated with corticosteroids. Although these infants are at risk for neurological, water and electrolyte abnormalities, there is little information regarding the effects of clinically relevant doses of corticosteroids on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and protein isoform expression in the brain and kidney of newborns. In the present study, we examined the effects of dexamethasone on cerebral cortical and renal cortical Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and alpha1- and beta1-protein isoform expression in newborn lambs. Lambs were given four injections of a placebo (n = 11) or one of three different doses of dexamethasone (0.01 mg kg(-1), n = 9; 0.25 mg kg(-1), n = 11; or 0.50 mg kg(-1), n = 9) 12 h apart on Postnatal Days 3 and 4 up to 18 h before harvest of the cerebral cortex and renal cortex. We selected doses in a range to approximate those used to treat infants with BPD. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was measured in membrane preparations as ouabain-sensitive inorganic phosphate liberation from ATP and alpha1- and beta1-subunit abundance by Western immunoblot. Postnatal treatment of lambs with dexamethasone resulted in a 21.4% increase in Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and a 30.4% increase in catalytic alpha1-protein expression in the cerebral cortex at a dose of 0.50 mg kg(-1) dexamethasone, but not at the lower doses. Dexamethasone treatment was not associated with changes in beta1-isoform expression in the cerebral cortex. In the kidney, dexamethasone treatment was not associated with significant changes in Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity or alpha1- or beta1-isoform expression for the doses we examined. Therefore, clinically relevant corticosteroid treatment exerts dose-related, differential organ-specific effects on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and protein isoform expression in newborn lambs.","group":"g1","id":"8ebb4f1d-c8e2-4321-bb62-8e2eb4662818","_showDetails":false},"9db6cc86-4560-4ac2-818d-deed94fe3ee9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Inflammation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a continuing story.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2006.03.004","authors":["Speer, Christian P"],"date":"2006//","accessDate":"20060515//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Cytokines/im [Immunology]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Inflammation/co [Complications]","Inflammation/im [Immunology]","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/ph [Physiology]","Risk Factors"],"journal":"Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine","volume":"11","number":"5","isbn":"1744-165X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16702036"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"Increasing evidence indicates that bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) results, at least in part, from an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, with a persistent imbalance that favours pro-inflammatory mechanisms. The inflammatory response is characterised by an accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the airways and pulmonary tissue of preterm infants and, moreover, by an arsenal of pro-inflammatory mediators which affect the alveolar capillary unit and tissue integrity. As well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and toxic oxygen radicals, various lipid mediators as well as potent proteases may be responsible for acute lung injury. During the last decade it has become evident that multiple pre- and postnatal events contribute to the development of BPD in preterm infants. Chorioamnionitis and cytokine exposure in utero, plus sequential lung injury caused by postnatal resuscitation, oxygen toxicity, volu-, barotrauma and infection all lead to a pulmonary inflammatory response which is most probably associated with aberrant wound healing and an inhibition of alveolarisation as well as vascular development in the immature lungs of very preterm infants, causing the 'new BPD'.","group":"g1","id":"9db6cc86-4560-4ac2-818d-deed94fe3ee9","_showDetails":false},"28340a42-b360-45c0-85a0-29092ce47c04":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Body composition in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia predicted from bioelectric impedance and anthropometric variables: comparison with a reference dual X-ray absorptiometry.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2006.02.001","authors":["Bott, L","Beghin, L","Gondon, E","Hankard, R","Pierrat, V","Gottrand, F"],"date":"2006//","accessDate":"20060505//","keywords":["Absorptiometry, Photon/mt [Methods]","*Absorptiometry, Photon","Adipose Tissue/me [Metabolism]","*Anthropometry","*Body Composition/ph [Physiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Child","Child, Preschool","*Electric Impedance","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Male","Muscle, Skeletal/me [Metabolism]","Predictive Value of Tests","Sensitivity and Specificity"],"journal":"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","volume":"25","number":"5","isbn":"0261-5614","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16678309"],"address":"England","abstract":"UNLABELLED: Since children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia often suffer from malnutrition and growth failure, evaluation of body composition is a very important tool to nutritional support.

Newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia for 7 days showed higher lung weight/body weight ratios compared with those exposed to RA + hyperoxia. Hyperoxia for 7 days also caused a significant increase in hepatic and pulmonary CYP1A1/1A2 expression compared with air-breathing controls. RA + hyperoxia treatment lowered the expression of these genes. Seven to 30 days after withdrawal of hyperoxia, the animals showed marked induction of hepatic and pulmonary CYP1A1/1A2 expression, but animals that had been given RA + hyperoxia displayed lower expression of these enzymes. On postnatal days 22 or 38, the hyperoxic animals displayed retarded lung alveolarization; however, the RA + hyperoxia-exposed animals showed improved alveolarization. The improved alveolarization in animals given RA + hyperoxia, in conjunction with the attenuation of CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression in these animals, suggests that this phenomenon may play a role in the beneficial effects of RA.","group":"g1","id":"199bd588-2ff0-4efc-bd02-ba1714a238ad","_showDetails":false},"8a37af20-8ba0-4cf4-9f52-10533b998880":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Deletion allele of angiotensin-converting enzyme is associated with increased risk and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.07.029","authors":["Kazzi, S Nadya J","Quasney, Michael W"],"date":"2005//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Female","*Gene Deletion","Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ep [Epidemiology]","Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Incidence","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Male","Michigan/ep [Epidemiology]","*Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/ge [Genetics]","Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length","Prospective Studies","Severity of Illness Index","Statistics, Nonparametric"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"147","number":"6","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16356438"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the deletion (D) allele of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is associated with the risk or severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) among very low birth weight (BW) infants., STUDY DESIGN: Infants with a BW  .05).

We investigated these factors in relation to current asthma and AHR in a population-based cohort of 81 young people, born with gestational age < or = 28 wk or birth weight < or = 1000 g, and in a matched term-born control population. In the pre-term population, asthma and AHR were additionally studied in relation to neonatal respiratory morbidity. At follow up, more pre-term than control subjects had asthma. Forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) was reduced, AHR was substantially increased, and the level of the urinary leukotriene metabolite E4 (U-LTE4) was increased in the pre-term population compared to the term-born. In control subjects, asthma and AHR was associated with a pattern consistent with inheritance, allergy, airway inflammation, and cigarette exposures. In the pre-terms, asthma and AHR was either unrelated or less related to these factors. Instead, AHR was strongly related to a neonatal history of BPD and prolonged requirement for oxygen treatment. In conclusion, asthma and AHR subsequent to extremely premature birth differed from typical childhood asthma with respect to important features, and AHR was best explained by neonatal variables.

Injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the amniotic fluid of E15 BALB/cJ mice increased the luminal volume density of fetal mouse lungs at embryonic day (E) 17 and E18. LPS also increased luminal volume and decreased distal lung branching in fetal mouse lung explants. This effect required NF-kappaB activation and functional Toll-Like Receptor 4. Airway branching may require fibronectin-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, representing a potential target for innate immune signaling. Anti-fibronectin antibodies and LPS both blocked distal lung branching. By immunofluorescence, fibronectin localized to the clefts between newly formed airways but was restricted to peripheral mesenchymal cells in LPS-exposed explants. These data suggest that LPS may alter the expression pattern of mesenchymal fibronectin, potentially disrupting epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and inhibiting distal airway branching and alveolarization.

Yet, its presentation may overlap with other infant diffuse lung diseases, including those within the spectrum of childhood interstitial lung diseases (chILD). Lung biopsy might differentiate between these entities or identify those with an extremely poor prognosis. Both might alter the clinical management of some infants diagnosed with BPD., METHODS: In this tertiary referral center, we drew on a retrospective cohort of 308 preterm infants with severe BPD. Of these, nine underwent lung biopsy between 2012 and 2017. We aimed to assess the indication for lung biopsy, the prior clinical history, safety of the procedure, and describe the biopsy findings. Finally, we considered management decisions in relation to the biopsy results in these patients., RESULTS: All nine infants undergoing biopsy survived the procedure. The mean gestational age and birth weight of the nine patients were 30 +/- 3 (range 27-34) weeks and 1421 +/- 571 (range 611-2140) grams. All infants received serial echocardiograms to assess pulmonary hypertension, genetic testing, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) before biopsy. In all nine patients moderate to severe alveolar simplification was present and eight had some degree of pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG) ranging from focal to diffuse. Following biopsy, two infants with PIG received high dose systemic steroids and two separate infants had care redirected., CONCLUSION: In our cohort, lung biopsy was safe and well tolerated. Findings from lung biopsy may aid decision making in selected patients as a part of a step-wise diagnostic algorithm.

These results provide proof of principle that HIF stimulation and modulation of HIF-regulated angiogenic proteins through PHI-1 treatment are feasible, effective, and nontoxic in human lung cells, suggesting the use of PHI-1 to enhance angiogenesis and lung growth in evolving BPD.","group":"g1","id":"3fce53d9-f04e-419b-8682-b13905b73d30","_showDetails":false},"5947a1ed-3caf-41e5-9241-5e1d52d7d3f0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2003 to 2004>","title":"Gene expression profile and histopathology of experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia induced by prolonged oxidative stress.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2003.12.007","authors":["Wagenaar, Gerry T M","ter Horst, Simone A J","van Gastelen, Margot A","Leijser, Lara M","Mauad, Thais","van der Velden, Pieter A","de Heer, Emile","Hiemstra, Pieter S","Poorthuis, Ben J H M","Walther, Frans J"],"date":"2004//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Blood Coagulation Factors/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Extracellular Matrix/ge [Genetics]","Extracellular Matrix/me [Metabolism]","Fibrin/me [Metabolism]","Fibrinolysis/ge [Genetics]","Gene Expression Profiling","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Inflammation/ge [Genetics]","Inflammation/me [Metabolism]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Oxidative Stress","*RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 4","Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/ge [Genetics]","Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/me [Metabolism]","Signal Transduction/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Free radical biology & medicine","volume":"36","number":"6","isbn":"0891-5849","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med5&NEWS=N&AN=14990357"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Oxidative stress is an important factor in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of premature infants characterized by arrested alveolar and vascular development of the immature lung. We investigated differential gene expression with DNA microarray analysis in premature rat lungs exposed to prolonged hyperoxia during the saccular stage of development, which closely resembles the development of the lungs of premature infants receiving neonatal intensive care. Expression profiles were largely confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (27 genes) and in line with histopathology and fibrin deposition studied by Western blotting. Oxidative stress affected a complex orchestra of genes involved in inflammation, coagulation, fibrinolysis, extracellular matrix turnover, cell cycle, signal transduction, and alveolar enlargement and explains, at least in part, the pathological alterations that occur in lungs developing BPD. Exciting findings were the magnitude of fibrin deposition; the upregulation of chemokine-induced neutrophilic chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), amphiregulin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12), p21, metallothionein, and heme oxygenase (HO); and the downregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (FGFR4) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (Flk-1).

High oxygen concentrations, however, are detrimental to cell growth and cell survival. Glutamine (Gln) may be protective to cells during periods of stress and recently has been shown to increase survival in A549 cells exposed to lethal concentrations of oxygen (95% O2). We found that supplemental Gln enhances cell growth in A549 cells exposed to moderate concentrations of oxygen (60% O2). We therefore evaluated the effect of moderate hyperoxia on the cell cycle distribution of A549 cells. At 48 h there was no significant difference in the cell cycle distribution between 2 mM Gln cells in 60% O2 and 2 mM cells in room air. Furthermore, 2 mM Gln cells in 60% O2 had stable protein levels of cyclin B1 consistent with ongoing cell proliferation. In contrast, at 48 h, cells not supplemented with glutamine (Gln-) in 60% O2 had evidence of growth arrest by both flow cytometry (increased percentage of G1 cells) and by decreased protein levels of cyclin B1. G1 growth arrest in the Gln- cells exposed to 60% O2 was not, however, associated with induction of p21 protein. At 72 and 96 h, Gln- cells in 60% O2, began to demonstrate a partial loss of G1 checkpoint regulation and an increase in apoptosis, indicating an increased sensitivity to oxygen toxicity. Glutathione (GSH) concentrations were then measured. 2 mM Gln cells in 60% O2 were found to have higher concentrations of GSH compared to Gln- cells in 60% O2, suggesting that Gln confers protection to the cell during exposure to hyperoxia through up-regulation of GSH. When cells in 60% O2 were given higher concentrations of Gln (5 and 10 mM), cell growth at 96 h was increased compared to cells grown in 2 mM Gln (P<0.04). Clonal survival was also increased in cells exposed 60% O2 and supplemented with higher concentrations of Gln compared to Gln- cells in 60% O2. These studies suggest that supplemental glutamine may improve cell growth and cell viability and therefore may be beneficial to the lung during exposure to moderate concentrations of supplemental oxygen.","group":"g1","id":"86c11940-367a-4109-af3b-6bea64c17308","_showDetails":true},"7c2a232f-c1fb-4ab6-911d-25afb7773aa2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2003 to 2004>","title":"Surfactant protein C gene variation in the Finnish population - association with perinatal respiratory disease.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201137","authors":["Lahti, Meri","Marttila, Riitta","Hallman, Mikko"],"date":"2004//","keywords":["Base Sequence","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","DNA Primers","Finland","*Genetics, Population","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Peptides/ge [Genetics]","Polymorphism, Genetic","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein C","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"European journal of human genetics : EJHG","volume":"12","number":"4","isbn":"1018-4813","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med5&NEWS=N&AN=14735158"],"address":"England","abstract":"Surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a small hydrophobic protein component of alveolar surfactant, a lipid-protein complex lining the alveolar surface of the lung. Surfactant deficiency is the main cause of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. RDS is a major risk factor of a chronic lung disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The dominant mutations of the SP-C gene have recently been associated with interstitial lung diseases. However, the common genetic variation in the surfactant protein C gene has not been studied in detail. In the present study, the exonic variation of the SP-C gene in the Finnish population (n=472) was defined, and the association of the allelic variants with the susceptibility to RDS and BPD was examined. Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used to determine the extent of exonic variation in the SP-C gene. Methods of genotyping were generated for three biallelic polymorphisms of the SP-C gene's exons 1, 4 and 5, which encode proSP-C. The frequencies of these polymorphisms were evaluated in a study population consisting of 158 DNA samples from full-term infants. In addition, the linkage disequilibrium between the SP-C alleles was evaluated by haplotype analysis of parent-infant triplets. The role of SP-C gene variation in RDS and in BPD was evaluated in a high-risk population of 245 premature infants. According to the present results, the SP-C polymorphisms were associated with RDS and with very premature birth. The strength of allelic associations differed according to the gender of the premature infants.","group":"g1","id":"7c2a232f-c1fb-4ab6-911d-25afb7773aa2","_showDetails":false},"d9b3c1c2-acf0-4682-860e-5f30ede6c548":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2003 to 2004>","title":"Association of glutathione-S-transferase-P1 (GST-P1) polymorphisms with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jp.7211020","authors":["Manar, Martha H","Brown, Milton R","Gauthier, Theresa W","Brown, Lou Ann S"],"date":"2004//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Case-Control Studies","Female","Gene Frequency","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease","*Glutathione Transferase/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Male","Multivariate Analysis","Pilot Projects","Polymerase Chain Reaction","*Polymorphism, Genetic","Probability","Reference Values","Sensitivity and Specificity"],"journal":"Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association","volume":"24","number":"1","isbn":"0743-8346","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med5&NEWS=N&AN=14726935"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to oxidative lung injury.

Patients We identified premature infants who required tracheostomies from January 1, 1997, through January 31, 2001. Information on weight, gestational age, comorbid conditions, indication for tracheostomy, and outcomes was collected. Infants were divided by birth weight into group 1 (<1000 g; n = 19 [very low birth weight]) and group 2 (> or =1000 g; n = 14). Comorbid conditions were scored and a total score was calculated for each patient., RESULTS: Group 1 had a higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity. The incidence of congenital or genetic defects was equal in groups 1 and 2 (11 infants [58%] and 8 infants [57%], respectively). Group 1 had a higher average number of failed extubations (5.17 vs 3.18) and a higher oxygen requirement (48.7% vs 30.3%) compared with group 2. Weight at tracheostomy was essentially equal in groups 1 and 2 (3.6 vs 3.7 kg). Subglottic stenosis and laryngotracheomalacia were equally common findings in groups 1 and 2. The average comorbidity score for group 1 was higher than that for group 2 (6.7 vs 2.8). The most common indication for tracheostomy was ventilatory dependence (n = 24 [73%]), compared with airway obstruction (n = 6 [18%]) and pulmonary toilet (n = 3 [9%]). Overall, 6 patients (18%) had a complication related to the tracheostomy., CONCLUSIONS: Severity of pulmonary disease was the most significant factor associated with the need for tracheostomy in preterm infants.

Subgroup analysis according to gestational age (GA) (22 to 24, 25 to 28, and 29 to 32 weeks) and plurality (singleton and multiple) was performed using the chi(2) test and an analysis of variance., RESULTS: Of the 1006 infants, 54.3% were white, 21.7% black, 13.7% Hispanic, and 10.3% were classified as Other.

Our aim was to evaluate and compare the newborn and adult rat pulmonary vascular and airway smooth muscle force generation and relaxation potential after exposure to 60% O(2) for 14 days. Vascular and airway intrapulmonary rings 100 microm in diameter were mounted on a myograph and bathed in Krebs-Henseleit solution bubbled with air- 6% CO(2) at 37 degrees C. Significant age-dependent changes in intrapulmonary arteries and their neighboring airway muscle properties were observed. Whereas hyperoxia enhanced force in neonatal vascular and airway muscle, the opposite was seen in adult samples. No changes in endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation were observed at either age, but the dose response to an endothelium-independent NO donor was altered. In the newborn experimental animals, the relaxation was reduced, whereas, in their adult counterparts, it was enhanced. After O(2) exposure, the bronchial muscle relaxation response to epithelium-dependent and -independent stimulation was not altered in either age group, whereas the epithelium-dependent response was decreased only in the adult. The antioxidant Trolox, or an endothelin-A and -B receptor antagonist, reversed the vascular and airway muscle's hyperoxia-induced changes. We conclude that chronic O(2) exposure in the newborn rat results in enhanced lung vascular and airway muscle contraction potential via a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species and the endothelin pathway. The present findings also suggest that the newborn is more susceptible to airway hyperresponsiveness after chronic O(2) exposure.","group":"g1","id":"f5b690cf-9e25-4722-bb38-e7272845b854","_showDetails":false},"c6776549-c2f0-471f-b544-6498088fc43b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Early dexamethasone decreases expression of activation markers on neutrophils and monocytes in preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/080352502320777432","authors":["Nupponen, I","Repo, H","Kari, A","Pohjavuori, M","Andersson, S"],"date":"2002//","keywords":["*Anti-Inflammatory Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*CD11b Antigen/me [Metabolism]","Chemokine CCL3","Chemokine CCL4","*Dexamethasone/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Female","Flow Cytometry","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*L-Selectin/me [Metabolism]","*Leukocytes, Mononuclear/me [Metabolism]","*Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/me [Metabolism]","Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/an [Analysis]","Male","*Neutrophils/me [Metabolism]","Phagocytosis/ph [Physiology]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","volume":"91","number":"11","isbn":"0803-5253","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=12463319"],"address":"Norway","abstract":"AIM: To investigate the effects of early dexamethasone administration on activation of circulating neutrophils and monocytes in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome requiring treatment with surfactant., METHODS: Neonates (n = 30) with respiratory distress were randomized to receive dexamethasone (DEX group, 29.1 +/- 1.2 wk, 1223 +/- 156 g, n = 15) from the first postnatal day, or to serve as controls (control group, 29.2 +/- 1.4 wk, 1250 +/- 148 g, n = 15).

Tissue from 31 fetuses (10-40 weeks) and 24 infants with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (2 days to 7 months) was studied. HNF-3beta was detected in nuclei of epithelial cells of trachea and of conducting and terminal airways at 10 weeks. Thereafter, epithelial nuclei were immunolabeled more widely in peripheral than proximal airways. HNF-3beta was confined to bronchiolo-alveolar portals and Type II cells in nonfetal lung. In infants with BPD, HNF-3beta was expressed abundantly in regenerating epithelial cells at the periphery of lung lobules. HNF-3beta was also detected in fetal esophagus, pancreas, duodenum, stomach, and gallbladder, suggesting that it is a marker for progenitor cells in foregut derivatives.

Following hyperoxia induction and glutamine treatment, ROS levels were detected by DCFH-DA assay and TUNEL staining was performed to detect cell apoptosis. The levels of inflammatory indicators and expression of apoptosis-related proteins were detected through ELISA and Western blot, respectively. Besides, the expression of related proteins in mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) signaling was also detected by Western blot. To further analyze the role of MKP-1/MAPK/cPLA2 signaling, MKP-1 was silenced and anisomycin was used to treat cells, respectively. It was shown that glutamine significantly decreased inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in hyperoxia-induced cells while MKP-1 interference and anisomycin were able to reverse these effects, suggesting that the protective effects of glutamine on BPD induced by hypoxia were related to MKP-1/MAPK/cPLA2 signaling.

Since elastase-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (E-alpha 1-PI) has proved to be a sensitive indicator of intravascular PMN activation, we studied E-alpha 1-PI plasma concentration in preterm neonates during the treatment of RDS with a bovine surfactant preparation (group I: n = 23).

Recent work has identified the nasal submucosal gland as the source of diverse molecules important in mucous membrane host defense. We searched for the presence of antioxidant activity in nasal glandular secretions, the absence of which could possibly predispose to oxygen-induced injury. Employing a low molecular weight preparation of nasal secretions (a pooled concentrate passed over a 10,000-dalton molecular sieve), antioxidant activity capable of inhibiting both horseradish peroxidase and Fenton reagent reactions was discovered. The following lines of evidence suggest that submucosal glands are the source of this activity. (1) Antioxidant activity present in resting, baseline nasal washings is significantly increased after cholinergic stimulation either in response to topical methacholine or induced by a gustatory reflex. (2) Application of atropine reduced the antioxidant activity to baseline levels after either of the cholinergic stimuli. (3) Levels of antioxidant activity correlated very closely with the secretion of lactoferrin, a recognized product secreted solely from the serous cell of the submucosal gland. The antioxidant activity is due to novel, previously unrecognized molecules. This activity is found in nasal secretions containing molecules less than 10,000 daltons, is unaffected by N-ethyl maleimide (which inactivates glutathione, another low molecular weight antioxidant), is not associated with the capacity to reduce cytochrome c (as seen with ascorbic acid), and resides in the water soluble pool of secretions (in contrast to vitamin E, another putative antioxidant).

We hypothesized that infants delivered prematurely have a greater rate of collagen synthesis than do older animals because of their greater rate of lung growth during gestation. Secondly, we hypothesized that lung repair in infants with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is associated with an additional increase in lung collagen synthesis rate. Therefore, lung tissue was obtained during the first week of life from monkeys delivered at 82% of term gestation, a stage at which half of them developed HMD. The rate of total protein synthesis in lung samples was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]proline; the rate of collagen synthesis was determined by measuring the conversion of proline into hydroxyproline. Premature monkeys had a higher rate of collagen synthesis (9.9 +/- 2.7 nmol/mg DNA/h) than did term infants (5.3 +/- 1.1) or older animals (2.1 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.05).

The early stage of recovery from HMD in premature monkeys does not appear to be associated with an increase in collagen production beyond the already increased synthesis rate associated with lung growth.","group":"g1","id":"f0cc5284-974a-4411-9707-14604f9dd964","_showDetails":false},"00a26a87-c65b-46b2-af54-4458548ccfe5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Effects of infusion of prostacyclin on anatomical intrapulmonary right to left shunt: a useful model of human hypoxic vasoconstriction?.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1042/cs0760143","authors":["Bush, A","Busst, C M","Knight, W B","Shinebourne, E A"],"date":"1989//","keywords":["Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]","Cardiac Output/de [Drug Effects]","Child","Child, Preschool","*Epoprostenol/pd [Pharmacology]","Female","Heart Rate/de [Drug Effects]","Humans","Infant","Male","*Oxygen/pd [Pharmacology]","Pulmonary Artery/pp [Physiopathology]","*Pulmonary Circulation/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Gas Exchange/de [Drug Effects]","Vascular Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]","Vascular Resistance/de [Drug Effects]","Vasoconstriction/de [Drug Effects]"],"journal":"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)","volume":"76","number":"2","isbn":"0143-5221","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=2647364"],"address":"England","abstract":"1. Eleven infants and children (mean age 4.3 years, range 0.2-12 years) with pulmonary vascular disease secondary to congenital cardiac anomalies (n = 6) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 5), were studied during cardiac catheterization while ventilated on 100% oxygen. 2.

The elevated shunt was attributed to the effects of 100% oxygen and general anaesthesia causing alveolar collapse, with only partial compensation for impairment of gas exchange by compensatory local hypoxic vasoconstriction. 3. When prostacyclin was infused, pulmonary vascular resistance fell by 3.2 +/- 1.8 units (mmHg litre-1 min m2), and pulmonary blood flow rose by 1.0 +/- 0.7 litre min-1 m-2 (mean +/- 95% confidence intervals). 4.

However, the early changes in innate immunity associated with BPD development are incompletely understood., Methods: In very immature preterm infants below 32 weeks gestational age (GA; n=30 infants), monocyte subtypes were identified by Flow Cytometry at birth and throughout the postnatal course including intracellular TNF expression upon LPS stimulation. Complementing these measurements, cytokine end growth factor expression profiles (Luminex R xMAP R; n=110 infants) as well as gene expression profiles (CodeLinkTM Human I Bioarray; n=22) were characterized at birth., Results: The abundance of monocyte subtypes differed between preterm and term neonates at birth. Specifically, CD14++CD16+ (intermediate) monocytes demonstrated a dependency on PMA and elevated levels of nonclassical (CD14+CD16++) monocytes characterized preterm infants with developing BPD. Postnatally, lung injury was associated with an increase in intermediate monocytes, while high levels of nonclassical monocytes persisted. Both subtypes were revealed as the main source of intracellular TNF-alpha expression in the preterm infant. We identified a cytokine and growth factor expression profile in cord blood specimen of preterm infants with developing BPD that corresponded to the disease-dependent regulation of monocyte abundances. Multivariate modeling of protein profiles revealed FGF2, sIL-2 Ralpha, MCP-1, MIP1a, and TNF-alpha as predictors of BPD when considering GA. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated genes predicting BPD to be overrepresented in inflammatory pathways with increased disease severity characterized by the regulation of immune and defense response pathways and upstream regulator analysis confirmed TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL) -6, and interferon alpha as the highest activated cytokines in more severe disease. Whereas all BPD cases showed downstream activation of chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory response pathways, more severe cases were characterized by an additional activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis., Discussion: In the present study, we identified the early postnatal presence of nonclassical (CD14+CD16++) and intermediate (CD14++CD16+) monocytes as a critical characteristic of BPD development including a specific response pattern of monocyte subtypes to lung injury. Pathophysiological insight was provided by the protein and transcriptome signature identified at birth, centered around monocyte and corresponding granulocyte activation and highlighting TNFalpha as a critical regulator in infants with developing BPD. The disease severity-dependent expression patterns could inform future diagnostic and treatment strategies targeting the monocytic cell and its progeny.

There are many MVs in circulating plasma, and they are in direct contact with lung endothelial cells. However, the molecular mechanism and causative effect of circulating MVs on BPD remain unclear., METHODS: Clinical plasma samples were collected, circulating MVs were isolated, and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing was performed. The BPD model was established, and different MVs were administered. Alveoli and pulmonary vessels were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining, and body weight and length were measured. In vitro, gene expression was disrupted by miRNA mimics, miRNA inhibitors or plasmid transfection. Cell proliferation and protein expression were detected by cell scratch assay, accurate 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine test, western blotting, or immunofluorescence assay., RESULTS: BPD-derived MVs further aggravated pulmonary vascular simplification, while circulating MVs from control mice mitigated pulmonary vascular simplification. Micro-RNA sequencing and independent sample verification revealed that miR139-3p, but not miR6125 or miR193b-3p, was the most critical effector molecule in MVs. Mechanism studies showed that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 was the target gene for miR139-3p. In addition, we found that supplementation of miR139-3p inhibitor partially alleviated pulmonary vascular simplification., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that circulating MVs are involved in forming BPD by carrying miR139-3p molecules and support miR139-3p inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating pulmonary vascular simplification in BPD.

To correct endothelial dysfunction, there is a critical need for the development of nanoparticle systems that can deliver drugs and nucleic acids to endothelial cells with high efficiency and precision. While several nanoparticle delivery systems targeting endothelial cells have been recently developed, none of them are specific to lung endothelial cells without targeting other organs in the body. In the present study, we successfully solved this problem by developing non-toxic poly(beta-amino) ester (PBAE) nanoparticles with specific structure design and fluorinated modification for high efficiency and specific delivery of nucleic acids to the pulmonary endothelial cells. After intravenous administration, the PBAE nanoparticles were capable of delivering non-integrating DNA plasmids to lung microvascular endothelial cells but not to other lung cell types. IVIS whole body imaging and flow cytometry demonstrated that DNA plasmid were functional in the lung endothelial cells but not in endothelial cells of other organs. Fluorination of PBAE was required for lung endothelial cell-specific targeting. Hematologic analysis and liver and kidney metabolic panels demonstrated the lack of toxicity in experimental mice. Thus, fluorinated PBAE nanoparticles can be an ideal vehicle for gene therapy targeting lung microvascular endothelium in pulmonary vascular disorders.

The Hoxa5, Hoxb5, and Hoxc5 paralogs are expressed in the lung mesenchyme and function redundantly during embryonic lung development. Conditional loss-of-function of these genes during postnatal stages leads to severe defects in alveologenesis, specifically in the generation of the elastin network, and animals display bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or BPD-like phenotype. Here we show the surprising results that mesenchyme-specific loss of Hox5 function at adult stages leads to rapid disruption of the mature elastin matrix, alveolar enlargement, and an emphysema-like phenotype. As the elastin matrix of the lung is considered highly stable, adult disruption of the matrix was not predicted. Just 2 weeks after deletion, adult Hox5 mutant animals show significant increases in alveolar space and changes in pulmonary function, including reduced elastance and increased compliance. Examination of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adult Tbx4rtTA; TetOCre; Hox5a f a f bbcc lungs demonstrates a disruption of the elastin network although the underlying fibronectin, interstitial collagen and basement membrane appear unaffected. An influx of macrophages and increased matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) are observed in the distal lung 3 days after Hox5 deletion.

According to maternal HGP, all infants were divided into the HGP group or the non-HGP group. A propensity score matching analysis was used to adjust for confounding factors, including gestational age, twin or multiple births, sex, antenatal steroid administration, delivery mode and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The main complications and the short-term growth status during hospitalization were evaluated in the HGP and non-HGP groups., Results: A total of 2,514 infants were eligible for analysis. After matching, there were 437 infants in the HGP group and 874 infants in the non-HGP group.

Here, we tested if CXCL10 deficiency preserves lung growth after neonatal hyperoxia by preventing macrophage activation. To this end, we exposed Cxcl10 knockout (Cxcl10-/-) and wild-type mice to an experimental model of hyperoxia (85% O2)-induced neonatal lung injury and subsequent regeneration. In addition, cultured primary human macrophages and murine macrophages (J744A.1) were treated with CXCL10 and/or CXCR3 antagonist. Our transcriptomic analysis identified CXCL10 as a central hub in the inflammatory network of neonatal mouse lungs after hyperoxia. Quantitative histomorphometric analysis revealed that Cxcl10-/- mice are in part protected from reduced alveolar. These findings were related to the preserved spatial distribution of elastic fibers, reduced collagen deposition, and protection from macrophage recruitment/infiltration to the lungs in Cxcl10-/- mice during acute injury and regeneration. Complimentary, studies with cultured human and murine macrophages showed that hyperoxia induces Cxcl10 expression that in turn triggers M1-like activation and migration of macrophages through CXCR3. Finally, we demonstrated a temporal increase of macrophage-related CXCL10 in the lungs of infants with BPD. In conclusion, our data demonstrate macrophage-derived CXCL10 in experimental and clinical BPD that drives macrophage chemotaxis through CXCR3, causing pro-fibrotic lung remodeling and arrest of alveolarization. Thus, targeting the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could offer a new therapeutic avenue for BPD. Copyright © 2023.

We utilized a humanized mouse model that supports human progenitor cell engraftment (MISTRG) to test the hypothesis that prenatal monocyte programming alters early lung development and response to hyperoxia., Methods: Cord blood-derived monocytes from 10 human infants were adoptively transferred into newborn MISTRG mice at p0 (1 x 106 cells/mouse, intrahepatic injection) followed by normoxia versus hyperoxia (85% oxygen x 14 days). Lungs were harvested at p14 for alveolar histology (alveolar count, perimeter and area) and vascular parameters (vWF staining for microvessel density, Fulton's index). Human CD45 staining was conducted to compare presence of hematopoietic cells. Murine lung parameters were compared among placebo and monocyte-injected groups. The individual profiles of the 10 patients were further considered, including gestational age (GA; n = 2 term, n = 3 moderate/late preterm, and n = 5 very preterm infants) and preeclampsia (n = 4 patients). To explore the monocyte microenvironment of these patients, 30 cytokines/chemokines were measured in corresponding human plasma by multiplex immunoassay., Results: Across the majority of patients and corresponding mice, MISTRG alveolarization was simplified and microvessel density was decreased following hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced changes were seen in both placebo (PBS) and monocyte-injected mice. Under normoxic conditions, alveolar development was altered modestly by monocytes as compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Monocyte injection was associated with increased microvessel density at P14 as compared with placebo (26.7 +/- 0.73 vs. 18.8 +/- 1.7 vessels per lung field; P < 0.001). Pooled analysis of patients revealed that injection of monocytes from births complicated by lower GA and preeclampsia was associated with changes in alveolarization and vascularization under normoxic conditions. These differences were modified by hyperoxia. CD45+ cell count was positively correlated with plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P < 0.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical staining for human CD206 and mouse F4/80 confirmed absence of macrophages in MISTRG lungs at P14., Conclusions: Despite the inherent absence of macrophages in early stages of lung development, immunodeficient MISTRG mice revealed changes in alveolar and microvascular development induced by human monocytes. MISTRG mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia may serve as a novel model to study isolated effects of human monocytes on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development.

Cuproptosis is a novel form of cell death, but its mechanism of action in the disease is not yet clear. Machine learning, the latest tool for the analysis of biological samples, is still relatively rarely used for in-depth analysis and prediction of diseases., METHODS AND RESULTS: First, the differential expression of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the GSE108754 dataset was extracted and the heat map showed that the expression of NFE2L2 gene was significantly higher in the control group whereas the expression of GLS gene was significantly higher in the treatment group. Chromosome location analysis showed that both the genes were positively correlated and associated with chromosome 2. The results of immune infiltration and immune cell differential analysis showed differences in the four immune cells, significantly in Monocytes cells. Five new pathways were analyzed through two subgroups based on consistent clustering of CRG expression. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) set the screening condition to the top 25% to obtain the disease signature genes. Four machine learning algorithms: Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were used to screen the disease signature genes, and the final five marker genes for disease prediction. The models constructed by GLM method were proved to be more accurate in the validation of two datasets, GSE190215 and GSE188944., CONCLUSION: We eventually identified two copper death-associated genes, NFE2L2 and GLS. A machine learning model-GLM was constructed to predict the prevalence of BPD disease, and five disease signature genes NFATC3, ERMN, PLA2G4A, MTMR9LP and LOC440700 were identified. These genes that were bioinformatics analyzed could be potential targets for identifying BPD disease and treatment. Copyright © 2023.

The long-term kidney effects of neonatal caffeine are unknown.

Participants included if any kidney outcomes were collected at 22-26 months corrected age. Exposure was post-menstrual age of caffeine discontinuation., PRIMARY OUTCOMES: 'reduced eGFR' <90 ml/min/1.73 m2, 'albuminuria' (>30 mg albumin/g creatinine), or 'elevated blood pressure' (BP) >95th %tile. A general estimating equation logistic regression model stratified by bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) status was used., RESULTS: 598 participants had at least one kidney metric at follow up. Within the whole cohort, postmenstrual age of caffeine discontinuation was not associated with any abnormal measures of kidney function at 2 years. In the stratified analysis, for each additional week of caffeine, the no BPD group had a 21% decreased adjusted odds of eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73m2 (aOR 0.78; CI 0.62-0.99) and the BPD group had a 15% increased adjusted odds of elevated BP (aOR 1.15; CI: 1.05-1.25)., CONCLUSIONS: Longer caffeine exposure during the neonatal period is associated with differential kidney outcomes at 22-26 months dependent on BPD status., IMPACT: In participants born <28 weeks' gestation, discontinuation of caffeine at a later post menstrual age was not associated with abnormal kidney outcomes at 22-26 months corrected age. When assessed at 2 years of age, later discontinuation of caffeine in children born <28 weeks' gestation was associated with a greater risk of reduced eGFR in those without a history of BPD and an increased odds of hypertension in those with a history of BPD.

The pathogenesis of BPD is correlated to enhanced inflammation and activated oxidative stress (OS). The application of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory treatment could be hot spots for BPD treatment. Nesfatin-1, a peptide with a suppressive property against inflammation, was tested herein for its potential therapeutic value in BPD. Neonatal SD rats were stimulated with hyperoxia, followed by being intraperitoneally administered with 20 mug/kg/day Nesfatin-1 for 2 weeks. Decreased RAC value in lung tissues, increased wet weight/dry weight (W/D) pulmonary ratio and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) proteins, elevated cytokine release in BALF, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and declined superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were observed in BPD rats, all of which were sharply mitigated by Nesfatin-1. Rat epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) were handled with hyperoxia, and then cultured with 1 and 10 nM Nesfatin-1. Reduced cell viability, elevated lactate dehydrogenase production, elevated cytokine secretion, elevated MDA content, and decreased SOD activity were observed in hyperoxia-handled AECIIs, all of which were markedly alleviated by Nesfatin-1. Furthermore, activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling observed in both BPD rats and hyperoxia-handled AECIIs were notably repressed by Nesfatin-1. Collectively, Nesfatin-1 alleviated hyperoxia-triggered BPD by repressing inflammation and OS via the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study design was used. A total of 939 preterm infants who were admitted to the Department of Neonatology of the West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University within 24 h after birth from January 2019 to December 2021 were enrolled in the study. They were born with a gestational age of <32 weeks and (or) a birth weight of <1 500 g. Of them, 250 preterm infants who developed BPD were enrolled in the BPD group, and each of them was matched to a preterm infant who did not develop BPD (matched for gestational age and birth weight) in the order of priority after calculating propensity score. Their total energy, enteral energy, parenteral energy, total fluid intake and energy per unit of fluid per week were collected within the first 2 weeks of life. The independent sample t-test or Mann Whitney U test was used for continuous variables, and the chi2 test for between-group comparisons of categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between total energy and total fluid and BPD incidence, respectively. The dose-response relationship between parenteral energy and BPD was investigated by a generalized additive model, and the threshold effect of parenteral energy on BPD used a two-piecewise linear regression model. Results: The gestational age was (28.4+/-1.9) weeks in the BPD group and (29.5+/-1.3) weeks in the control group; the birth weight was (1 107+/-258) g in the BPD group and (1 324+/-261) g in the control group; and there were 140 males (56.0%) and 131 males (52.4%) in each group, respectively. An increase in energy per unit of fluid in the second week of life was associated with a reduced risk of BPD (OR=0.32, 95%CI 0.12-0.84, P=0.021), and an increase in total energy in the second week of life was also associated with a reduced risk of BPD, with total energy of >418-502 kJ/(kg.d) was significantly lower than when total energy was <=334 kJ/(kg.d) (OR=0.15, 95%CI 0.03-0.85, P=0.033). There was no association between the average total fluid intake and BPD incidence (both P>0.05) in the first and second week. The increase in the proportion of parenteral energy to total energy in the second week of life was associated with an increased incidence of BPD (OR=8.45, 95%CI 2.14-33.32, P=0.003); specifically, the risk of BPD significantly increased when the parenteral energy was >=305 kJ/(kg.d) (OR=1.02, 95%CI 1.01-1.03, P=0.003). Conclusions: Maintaining a high total energy supply in the early postnatal period in preterm infants may reduce the risk of BPD, but continued reliance on high parenteral energy to meet total energy requirements increases the risk of BPD, so enteral feeds should be initiated as early as possible and maximized as tolerated.","group":"g1","id":"b5d166ff-1cf9-491a-99e3-70ff67b0c55f","_showDetails":false},"272b834e-bbac-40a8-a498-6b23fe788faf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R)","title":"Hyperoxia prevents the dynamic neonatal increases in lung mesenchymal cell diversity.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-50717-w","authors":["Zanini, Fabio","Che, Xibing","Suresh, Nina E","Knutsen, Carsten","Klavina, Paula","Xie, Yike","Domingo-Gonzalez, Racquel","Liu, Min","Kum, Alexander","Jones, Robert C","Quake, Stephen R","Alvira, Cristina M","Cornfield, David N"],"date":"2024//","accessDate":"20240123//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Infant","Humans","*Hyperoxia","Endothelial Cells","*Mesenchymal Stem Cells","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Lung"],"journal":"Scientific reports","volume":"14","number":"1","isbn":"2045-2322","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=medl&NEWS=N&AN=38263350"],"address":"England","abstract":"Rapid expansion of the pulmonary microvasculature through angiogenesis drives alveolarization, the final stage of lung development that occurs postnatally and dramatically increases lung gas-exchange surface area.

Whilst cause of death is resolved for most cases, others remain undetermined following postmortem investigations. There has been a recognition of the role of genetic testing in unexplained cases, where previous studies have demonstrated the resolution of cases through DNA analyses. Here we present two case reports of SUDI cases admitted to Salt River Mortuary, South Africa, and show that underlying causes of death were determined for both infants using clinical exome sequencing. The first infant was heterozygous for a variant (rs148175795) in COL6A3, which suggested a bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype. This hypothesis led to finding of a second candidate variant in DMP1 (rs142880465), which may contribute towards a digenic/polygenic mechanism of a more severe phenotype. Histological analysis of retained tissue sections showed an asphyxial mechanism of death, where bronchiolar muscle weakness from an underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia may have contributed to the asphyxia by affecting respiration. In the second infant, a homozygous variant (rs201340753) was identified in MASP1, which was heterozygous in each parent, highlighting the value of including parental DNA in genetic studies. Whilst mannose-binding lectin deficiency could not be assessed, it is plausible that this variant may have acted in combination with other risk factors within the triple-risk model to result in sudden death. These results may have genetic implications for family members, and represent possible new candidate variants for molecular autopsies. Copyright © 2023.

We hypothesized a role for Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) activity in BPD. RAS is comprised of a pro-developmental pathway consisting of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2), and a pro-fibrotic pathway mediated by angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). We investigated associations between neonatal hyperoxia, airflow restriction, and RAS activity in a BPD mouse model. C57 mouse pups were randomized to normoxic (FiO2 = 0.21) or hyperoxic (FiO2 = 0.75) conditions for 15 days (P1-P15). At P15, P20, and P30, we measured airflow restriction using plethysmography and ACE2, AT1, and AT2 mRNA and protein expression via polymerase chain reaction and Western Blot. Hyperoxia increased airflow restriction P15 and P20, decreased ACE2 and AT2 mRNA, decreased AT2 protein, and increased AT1 protein expression. ACE2 mRNA and protein remained suppressed at P20. By P30, airflow restriction and RAS expression did not differ between groups. Hyperoxia caused high airflow restriction, increased pulmonary expression of the pro-fibrotic RAS pathway, and decreased expression of the pro-developmental in our BPD mouse model. These associated findings may point to a causal role for RAS in hyperoxia-induced airflow restriction. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Unfortunately, current diagnostic and treatment options for this condition are insufficient. Hence, this study aimed to identify potential biomarkers in the peripheral blood of neonates affected by BPD. The Gene Expression Omnibus provided the expression dataset GSE32472 for BPD. Initially, using this database, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GSE32472. Subsequently, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis on the DEGs and employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to screen the most relevant modules for BPD. We then mapped the DEGs to the WGCNA module genes, resulting in a gene intersection. We conducted detailed functional enrichment analyses on these overlapping genes. To identify hub genes, we used 3 machine learning algorithms, including SVM-RFE, LASSO, and Random Forest. We constructed a diagnostic nomogram model for predicting BPD based on the hub genes. Additionally, we carried out transcription factor analysis to predict the regulatory mechanisms and identify drugs associated with these biomarkers. We used differential analysis to obtain 470 DEGs and conducted WGCNA analysis to identify 1351 significant genes. The intersection of these 2 approaches yielded 273 common genes. Using machine learning algorithms, we identified CYYR1, GALNT14, and OLAH as potential biomarkers for BPD. Moreover, we predicted flunisolide, budesonide, and beclomethasone as potential anti-BPD drugs. The genes CYYR1, GALNT14, and OLAH have the potential to serve as diagnostic biomarkers for BPD. This may prove beneficial in clinical diagnosis and prevention of BPD. Copyright © 2024 the Author(s).

Our group found that integrin beta4 (ITGB4) is downregulated in the airway epithelium of asthma patients. Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory illness in childhood. Therefore, we suspect whether the deletion of ITGB4 would affect fetal lung development. In this study, we characterized the role of ITGB4 deficiency in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). ITGB4 was conditionally knocked out in CCSP-rtTA, Tet-O-Cre and ITGB4f/f triple transgenic mice. Lung tissues at different developmental stages were collected for experimental detection and transcriptome sequencing. The effects of ITGB4 deficiency on lung branching morphogenesis were observed by fetal mouse lung explant culture. Deleting ITGB4 from the airway epithelial cells results in enlargement of alveolar airspaces, inhibition of branching, the abnormal structure of epithelium cells and the impairment of cilia growth during lung development. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the airway epithelial cilia of the beta4ccsp.cre group appear to be sparse, shortened and lodging. Lung-development-relevant factors such as SftpC and SOX2 significantly decreased both mRNA and protein levels. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that multiple ontogenesis-regulating-relevant pathways converge to FAK. Accordingly, ITGB4 deletion decreased phospho-FAK, phospho-GSK3beta and SOX2 levels, and the correspondingly contrary consequence was detected after treatment with GSK3beta agonist (wortmannin). Airway branching defect of beta4ccsp.cre mice lung explants was also partly recovered after wortmannin treatment. Airway epithelial-specific deletion of ITGB4 contributes to lung developmental defect, which could be achieved through the FAK/GSK3beta/SOX2 signal pathway. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. The clinical data of 626 very premature infants whose gestational age <32 weeks and who suffered from BPD were collected from October 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2021 of the Seventh Medical Center of the People's Liberation Army General Hospital as a modeling set. The clinical data of 229 very premature infants with BPD of Hunan Children's Hospital from January 1 st, 2020 to December 31st, 2021 were collected as a validation set for external verification. The very premature infants with BPD were divided into PH group and non PH group based on the echocardiogram after 36 weeks' corrected age in the modeling set and validation set, respectively. Univariate analysis was used to compare the basic clinical characteristics between groups, and collinearity exclusion was carried out between variables. The risk factors of BPD associated PH were further screened out by multivariate Logistic regression, and the risk assessment model was established based on these variables. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to evaluate the model's discrimination and calibration power, respectively. And the calibration curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the model and draw the nomogram. The bootstrap repeated sampling method was used for internal verification. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the clinical practicability of the model was used. Results: A total of 626 very premature infants with BPD were included for modeling set, including 85 very premature infants in the PH group and 541 very premature infants in the non PH group. A total of 229 very premature infants with BPD were included for validation set, including 24 very premature infants in the PH group and 205 very premature infants in the non PH group. Univariate analysis of the modeling set found that 22 variables, such as artificial conception, fetal distress, gestational age, birth weight, small for gestational age, 1 minute Apgar score <=7, antenatal corticosteroids, placental abruption, oligohydramnios, multiple pulmonary surfactant, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS)>stage II, early pulmonary hypertension, moderate-severe BPD, and hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) all had statistically significant influence between the PH group and the non PH group (all P<0.05). Antenatal corticosteroids, fetal distress, NRDS >stage II, hsPDA, pneumonia and days of invasive mechanical ventilation were identified as predictive variables and finally included to establish the Logistic regression model. The AUC of this model was 0.86 (95%CI 0.82-0.90), the cut-off value was 0.17, the sensitivity was 0.77, and the specificity was 0.84. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test showed that P>0.05. The AUC for external validation was 0.88, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test suggested P>0.05. Conclusions: A high sensitivity and specificity risk prediction model of PBD associated PH in very premature infants was established. This predictive model is useful for early clinical identification of infants at high risk of BPD associated PH.","group":"g1","id":"609722c7-616d-4296-bd26-369850337666","_showDetails":false},"f7fb4dca-b3c2-465b-b044-f335b4c2bdd8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Physical fitness trajectories from childhood to adolescence in extremely preterm children: A longitudinal cohort study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.26410","authors":["Praprotnik, Marina","Stucin Gantar, Irena","Krivec, Uros","Lucovnik, Miha","Rodman Berlot, Jasna","Starc, Gregor"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230410//","keywords":["Female","Child","Infant, Newborn","Humans","Adolescent","Longitudinal Studies","Infant, Extremely Premature","*Premature Birth","Cohort Studies","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Physical Fitness"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"58","number":"7","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=37036048"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Cohort studies on physical fitness (PF) in former extremely preterm children are scarce and yield conflicting results. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effect of extremely preterm birth on PF in school-age with a focus on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Eighty school-aged children were enrolled in the longitudinal cohort study. Fifty were born extremely preterm (<completed 28 weeks of gestation): 19 had BPD, and 31 did not; 30 term-born healthy children were included as controls. They were monitored annually throughout primary school (ages 7-14 years) with eight annual fitness testings within the Slovenian national surveillance system of children's somatic and motor development (SLOfit). The physical fitness index (PFI), calculated as the mean of percentiles of eight fitness tests, was used as an indicator of overall PF. Generalised estimating equations were used to compare changes in PFI between ages 7 and 14 in the three cohort groups: preterm children with BPD, preterm children without BPD and term controls., RESULTS: Preterm children with BPD had significantly and persistently lower PFI than preterm children without BPD and term-born children throughout primary school age. Their PFI was less than half that of national median values (15.1st-19.7th percentile). Preterm children without BPD experienced progressive improvement in PFI during their school age (from 32.6th to 44.7th percentile of national median PFI values), while the ones with BPD did not., CONCLUSION: Extreme prematurity per se is not a risk factor for lower PF at school age. However, if complicated by BPD, PF is significantly and sustainably reduced. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Diaphragmatic function was assessed by measurement of the maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax)-a measure of diaphragmatic strength, and the pressure-time index of the diaphragm (PTIdi)-a measure of the load-to-capacity ratio of the diaphragm. The Pdimax was higher in term than preterm infants without BPD (90.1 +/- 16.3 vs 81.1 +/- 11.8 cmH2O; P = 0.001). Term-born infants also had lower PTIdi compared to preterms without BPD (0.052 +/- 0.014 vs 0.060 +/- 0.017; P = 0.006). In term and preterm infants without BPD, GA was the most significant predictor of Pdimax and PTIdi, independently of the duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen support. In infants with GA < 32 weeks (n = 30), the Pdimax was higher in infants without BPD compared to those with BPD (76.1 +/- 11.1 vs 65.2 +/- 11.9 cmH2O; P = 0.015).

Conclusions: Preterm infants present lower diaphragmatic strength and impaired ability to sustain the generated force over time, which renders them prone to diaphragmatic fatigue. In very preterm infants, BPD may further aggravate diaphragmatic function. What is Known: * The diaphragm of preterm infants has limited capacity to undertake the work of breathing effectively. * The maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure (a measure of diaphragmatic strength) and the pressure-time index of the diaphragm (a measure of the load-to-capacity ratio of the muscle) have not been extensively assessed in small infants. What is New: * Preterm infants have lower diaphragmatic strength and impaired ability to sustain the generated force over time, which renders them prone to diaphragmatic fatigue. * In very preterm infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia may further impair diaphragmatic function.

We tested the hypothesis that pulmonary endothelial cells will show increased expression of EndoMT markers upon exposure to hyperoxia and that sex as a biological variable will modulate differences in expression. Wild-type (WT) and Cdh5-PAC CreERT2 (endothelial reporter) neonatal male and female mice (C57BL6) were exposed to hyperoxia (0.95 [Formula: see text]) either during the saccular stage of lung development (95% [Formula: see text]; postnatal day 1-5 [PND1-5]) or through the saccular and early alveolar stages of lung development (75% [Formula: see text]; PND1-14).

Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have larger and fewer alveoli, a lung pathology that can persist into adulthood. Although recent data point to a role for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in mediating pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolarization, the cell-specific role of HIF-1alpha remains incompletely understood. Thus, we hypothesized that HIF-1alpha, in a distinct subset of mesenchymal cells, mediates postnatal alveolarization. To test the hypothesis, we generated mice with a cell-specific deletion of HIF-1alpha by crossing SM22alpha promoter-driven Cre mice with HIF-1alphaflox/flox mice (SM22alpha-HIF-1alpha-/-), determined SM-22alpha-expressing cell identity using single-cell RNA sequencing, and interrogated samples from preterm infants. Deletion of HIF-1alpha in SM22alpha-expressing cells had no effect on lung structure at day 3 of life. However, at 8 days, there were fewer and larger alveoli, a difference that persisted into adulthood. Microvascular density, elastin organization, and peripheral branching of the lung vasculature were decreased in SM22alpha-HIF-1alpha-/- mice, compared with control mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that three mesenchymal cell subtypes express SM22alpha: myofibroblasts, airway smooth muscle cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells from SM22alpha-HIF-1alpha-/- mice had decreased angiopoietin-2 expression and, in coculture experiments, a diminished capacity to promote angiogenesis that was rescued by angiopoietin-2. Angiopoietin-2 expression in tracheal aspirates of preterm infants was inversely correlated with overall mechanical ventilation time, a marker of disease severity. We conclude that SM22alpha-specific HIF-1alpha expression drives peripheral angiogenesis and alveolarization in the lung, perhaps by promoting angiopoietin-2 expression.","group":"g1","id":"ba0482f3-7a10-46cd-898a-8d4673565302","_showDetails":false},"8ed7258c-0dd8-407b-8b8c-fa72ff2d1c67":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023 to 2024>","title":"The effect of leucocytosis on retinopathy of prematurity.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-47298-z","authors":["Sun, Zhihong","He, Lu","Zhao, Congcong","Zhang, Hongbo","Cheng, Ping","Wang, Yingying","Li, Mingchao","Yu, Zengyuan","Sun, Huiqing"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20231121//","keywords":["Infant","Infant, Newborn","Humans","Infant, Premature","Retinopathy of Prematurity/di [Diagnosis]","*Retinopathy of Prematurity","Leukocytosis/co [Complications]","Gestational Age","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Risk Factors","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Scientific reports","volume":"13","number":"1","isbn":"2045-2322","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med24&NEWS=N&AN=37989837"],"address":"England","abstract":"Postnatal leukocytosis reflects the general condition of inflammatory.

Oxidative stress injury, caused by Nrf2 imbalance, results in increased pyroptosis, DNA damage, and inflammatory activation, which may lead to the arrest of alveolar development and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants under hyperoxic conditions. We established a BPD mouse model to investigate the effects of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), an Nrf2 activator, on oxidative stress injury, pyroptosis, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and alveolar development. TBHQ reduced abnormal cell death in the lung tissue of BPD mice and restored the number and normal structure of the alveoli. TBHQ administration activated the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway, resulting in the decrease in the following: reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and IL-18 and IL-1beta expression and activation, as well as inhibition of pyroptosis. In contrast, after Nrf2 gene knockout in BPD mice, there was more severe oxidative stress injury and cell death in the lungs, there were TUNEL + and NLRP3 + co-positive cells in the alveoli, the pyroptosis was significantly increased, and the development of alveoli was significantly blocked. We demonstrated that TBHQ may promote alveolar development by enhancing Nrf2-induced antioxidation in the lung tissue of BPD mice and that the decrease in the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis caused by Nrf2 activation may be the underlying mechanism. These results suggest that TBHQ is a promising treatment for lung injury in premature infants with hyperoxia. Copyright © 2023.

Effective and safe prophylactic therapies for BPD are urgently required. Systemic corticosteroids reduce rates of BPD in the short term but are associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes if given to ventilated infants in the first week after birth. Intratracheal administration of corticosteroid admixed with exogenous surfactant could overcome these concerns by minimizing systemic sequelae. Several small, randomized trials have found intratracheal budesonide in a surfactant vehicle to be a promising therapy to increase survival free of BPD. The primary objective of the PLUSS trial is to determine whether intratracheal budesonide mixed with surfactant increases survival free of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) in extremely preterm infants born before 28 weeks' gestation., METHODS: An international, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized trial of intratracheal budesonide (a corticosteroid) mixed with surfactant for extremely preterm infants to increase survival free of BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA; primary outcome). Extremely preterm infants aged < 48 h after birth are eligible if (1) they are mechanically ventilated, or (2) they are receiving non-invasive respiratory support and there is a clinical decision to treat with surfactant. The intervention is budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) mixed with poractant alfa (200 mg/kg first intervention, 100 mg/kg if second intervention), administered intratracheally via an endotracheal tube or thin catheter. The comparator is poractant alfa alone (at the same doses). Secondary outcomes include the components of the primary outcome (death, BPD prior to or at 36 weeks' PMA), and potential systemic side effects of corticosteroids. Longer-term outcomes will be published separately, and include cost-effectiveness, early childhood health until 2 years of age, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age (corrected for prematurity)., STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN: A sample size of 1038 infants (519 in each group) is required to provide 90% power to detect a relative increase in survival free of BPD of 20% (an absolute increase of 10%), from the anticipated event rate of 50% in the control arm to 60% in the intervention (budesonide) arm, alpha error 0.05. To allow for up to 2% of study withdrawals or losses to follow-up, PLUSS aimed to enroll a total of 1060 infants (530 in each arm). The binary primary outcome will be reported as the number and percentage of infants who were alive without BPD at 36 weeks' PMA for each randomization group. To estimate the difference in risk (with 95% CI), between the treatment and control arms, binary regression (a generalized linear multivariable model with an identity link function and binomial distribution) will be used. Along with the primary outcome, the individual components of the primary outcome (death, and physiological BPD at 36 weeks' PMA), will be reported by randomization group and, again, binary regression will be used to estimate the risk difference between the two treatment groups for survival and physiological BPD at 36 weeks' PMA.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease with pre- and postnatal origins including intra-amniotic infection as main risk factor. Recently, postnatal pathologic lung microbiota colonization was associated with BPD. The objectives of this prospective observational cohort study were to describe differences in bacterial signatures in the amniotic fluid (AF) of intact pregnancies without clinical signs or risk of preterm delivery and AF samples obtained during preterm deliveries and their variations between different BPD disease severity stages., METHODS: AF samples were collected under sterile conditions during fetal intervention from intact pregnancies (n = 17) or immediately before preterm delivery < 32 weeks (n = 126). Metabarcoding based approaches were used for the molecular assessment of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to describe bacterial community structure., RESULTS: The absolute amount of 16S rRNA genes was significantly increased in AF of preterm deliveries and detailed profiling revealed a reduced alpha diversity and a significant change in beta diversity with a reduced relative abundance of 16S rRNA genes indicative for Lactobacillus and Acetobacter while Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas, Ureaplasma and Staphylococcus 16S rRNA gene prevailed. Although classification of BPD by disease severity revealed equivalent absolute 16S rRNA gene abundance and alpha and beta diversity in no, mild and moderate/severe BPD groups, for some 16S rRNA genes differences were observed in AF samples. Bacterial signatures of infants with moderate/severe BPD showed predominance of 16S rRNA genes belonging to the Escherichia-Shigella cluster while Ureaplasma and Enterococcus species were enriched in AF samples of infants with mild BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified distinct and diverse intrauterine 16S rRNA gene patterns in preterm infants immediately before birth, differing from the 16S rRNA gene signature of intact pregnancies. The distinct 16S rRNA gene signatures at birth derive from bacteria with varying pathogenicity to the immature lung and are suited to identify preterm infants at risk. Our results emphasize the prenatal impact to the origins of BPD. Copyright © 2023.

Activated IL-17A+ lymphocytes are key drivers of inflammation in preterm infants. We have shown that in immature mice chronic airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces pulmonary inflammation, increased IL-17a expression, and hypoalveolarization, a BPD-like phenotype. The source of IL-17a and contribution to lung pathology is unknown. The natural-killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor mediates activation and IL-17a production in gammadelta T cells by binding to stress molecules. LPS induces NKG2D ligand expression, including Rae-1 and MULT1. We hypothesized that IL-17a+ gammadelta T cells and NKG2D signaling mediate neonatal LPS-induced lung injury. Immature C57BL/6J (wild type), Nkg2d-/- or Tcrd-/- (lacking gammadelta T cells) mice were inoculated with 3ug/10ul of LPS from E. coli O26:B6 or 10ul of PBS intranasally on day of life 3, 5, 7, and 10. Selected mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against IL-17a, or NKG2D intraperitoneally. Lung immune cells were assessed by flow cytometry and gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. Alveolar growth was assessed by lung morphometry. We established that anti-IL-17a antibody treatment attenuated LPS-induced hypoalveolarization. We found that LPS induced the fraction of IL-17a+NKG2D+ gammadelta T cells, a major source of IL-17a in the neonatal lung. LPS also induced lung mRNA expression of NKG2D, Rae-1, MULT1, and the DNA damage regulator p53. Anti-NKG2D treatment attenuated the effect of LPS on gammadelta T cell IL-17a expression, immune cell infiltration and hypoalveolarization. LPS-induced hypoalveolarization was also attenuated in Nkg2d-/- and Tcrd-/- mice. In tracheal aspirates of preterm infants IL-17A and its upstream regulator IL-23 were higher in infants who later developed BPD. Also, human ligands of NKG2D, MICA and MICB were present in the aspirates and MICA correlated with median FiO2. Our novel findings demonstrate a central role for activated IL-17a+ gammadelta T cells and NKG2D signaling in neonatal LPS-induced lung injury. Future studies will determine the role of NKG2D ligands and effectors, other NKG2D+ cells in early-life endotoxin-induced lung injury and inflammation with a long-term goal to understand how inflammation contributes to BPD pathogenesis.

Melatonin has been shown to improve BPD. However, the protective effect of melatonin on hyperoxia-induced apoptosis in AECIIs and the precise mechanisms involved remain unclear., METHODS: Human alveolar epithelial type II A549 cells were treated with hyperoxia as an in vitro model to investigate the antiapoptotic mechanism of melatonin. CCK-8 assays were performed to investigate the viability of A549 cells. Hoechst 33,258 staining was carried out to quantify apoptosis in A549 cells. The protein expression levels of E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1), Bcl-2, Bax, Bim, Wnt, beta-catenin, AKT and phosphorylated AKT were measured by western blotting. LY294002, SC79 and the downregulation of ETS1, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and MT2 with specific siRNAs were used to investigate the role of the PI3K/AKT pathway, ETS1, MT1 and MT2 in hyperoxia-induced apoptosis in A549 cells., RESULTS: Melatonin prevented hyperoxia-induced apoptosis in A549 cells, and the upregulation of E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1) contributed to the antiapoptotic effect of melatonin. Melatonin activated the PI3K/AKT axis, which led to ETS1 upregulation and inhibited apoptosis in hyperoxia-exposed A549 cells. Furthermore, melatonin-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT axis, upregulation of ETS1 and inhibition of apoptosis were reversed by melatonin receptor 2 (MT2) siRNA in hyperoxia-exposed A549 cells., CONCLUSION: Melatonin prevents hyperoxia-induced apoptosis by activating the MT2/PI3K/AKT/ETS1 axis in alveolar epithelial cells.

It has been well documented that BPD disproportionally affects males compared to females, but the molecular mechanisms behind this sex-dependent bias remain unclear. Female mice show greater preservation of alveolarization and angiogenesis when exposed to hyperoxia, accompanied by increased miR-30a expression. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that loss of miR-30a would result in male and female mice experiencing similar impairments in alveolarization and angiogenesis under hyperoxic conditions., METHODS: Wild-type and miR-30a-/- neonatal mice were exposed to hyperoxia [95% FiO2, postnatal day [PND1-5] or room air before being euthanized on PND21. Alveolarization, pulmonary microvascular development, differences in lung transcriptome, and miR-30a expression were assessed in lungs from WT and miR-30a-/- mice of either sex. Blood transcriptomic signatures from preterm newborns (with and without BPD) were correlated with WT and miR-30a-/- male and female lung transcriptome data., RESULTS: Significantly, the sex-specific differences observed in WT mice were abrogated in the miR-30a-/- mice upon exposure to hyperoxia. The loss of miR-30a expression eliminated the protective effect in females, suggesting that miR-30a plays an essential role in regulating alveolarization and angiogenesis. Transcriptome analysis by whole lung RNA-Seq revealed a significant response in the miR-30a-/- female hyperoxia-exposed lung, with enrichment of pathways related to cell cycle and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction.

To uncover biomarkers of BPD risk, this study investigated epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures of prematurity at birth and during the neonatal period at day 14 and 28. Peripheral blood DNAs from preterm infants were applied to methylation arrays and cell-type composition was estimated by deconvolution. Covariate-adjusted robust linear regression elucidated BPD- and prolonged oxygen (>= 14 days) exposure-associated CpGs. RNAs from cord and peripheral blood were sequenced, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for BPD or oxygen exposure were determined. Estimated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios in peripheral blood at day 14 in BPD infants were significantly higher than nonBPD infants, suggesting an heightened inflammatory response in developing BPD. BPD-DEGs in cord blood indicated lymphopoiesis inhibition, altered Th1/Th2 responses, DNA damage, and organ degeneration. On day 14, BPD-associated CpGs were highly enriched in neutrophil activation, infection, and CD4 + T cell quantity, and BPD-DEGs were involved in DNA damage, cellular senescence, T cell homeostasis, and hyper-cytokinesis. On day 28, BPD-associated CpGs along with BPD-DEGs were enriched for phagocytosis, neurological disorder, and nucleotide metabolism. Oxygen supplementation markedly downregulated mitochondrial biogenesis genes and altered CpGs annotated to developmental genes. Prematurity-altered DNA methylation could cause abnormal lymphopoiesis, cellular assembly and cell cycle progression to increase BPD risk. Similar pathways between epigenome and transcriptome networks suggest coordination of the two in dysregulating leukopoiesis, adaptive immunity, and innate immunity.

They are known to be involved in inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to describe the breast milk oxylipin profile following a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation of mothers of preterm infants. We examined the oxylipins profile in breast milk collected at day 14 post-delivery, of 40 mothers who delivered before 29 weeks of gestation and who were supplemented with either DHA-rich algae oil (S-DHA) or a placebo (PL). These mothers were selected from the MOBYDIck cohort (NCT02371460 registered on 25/05/2015 in ClinicalTrials.gov) according to the supplementation received (S-DHA vs. PL) and the DHA content quartiles as measured in breast milk (Low vs. High) to generate four study groups. Milk oxylipins, as ng/mL of milk, were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Ten oxylipins derived from DHA were higher in the S-DHA-High group than the other three groups (P < 0.001). The 18-HEPE, was also higher in the S-DHA-High group (0.11 +/- 0.01) compared to the other groups (P = 0.0001). Compared to the PL-Low group, there was a reduction in pro-inflammatory prostaglandins found in the S-DHA-High group with lower levels of prostaglandins PGF2alpha (0.21 +/- 0.45 in the S-DHA-High group vs. 1.87 +/- 0.44 in the PL-Low group, P = 0.03) and of PGE2 (0.33 +/- 0.26 in the S-DHA-High group vs. 1.28 +/- 0.25 in the PL-Low group, P = 0.04). In sum, the DHA supplementation was linked with a predominance of anti-inflammatory oxylipins in breast milk of mothers who delivered very preterm, like 17(S)-HDHA and 18-HEPE, precursors of D and E resolvins respectively. This was also accompanied with a lower level of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Copyright © 2023.

Thickness analysis was performed using Materialise Mimics., RESULTS: The chronic lung disease team treated 319 patients during the study interval of which, 58 patients (18.2%) had head CT available. Twenty-eight (48.3%) were found to have calvarial thickening. The rate of premature suture closure in the study population was 36.2% (21 of 58 patients), with 50.0% of affected cohort having evidence of premature suture closure on the first CT scan. Multivariate logistic regression identified 2 risk factors, requiring invasive ventilation at 6 months of age and fraction of inspired oxygen requirement at 6 months of age. Increased head circumference at birth protected against the development of calvarial thickening., CONCLUSIONS: We have described a novel subset of patients with chronic lung disease of prematurity who have calvarial thickening with remarkably high rates of premature closure of cranial sutures. The exact etiology of the association is unknown. In this patient population with radiographic evidence of premature suture closure, operative decision should be made after considering unequivocal evidence of elevated intracranial pressure or dysmorphology and balanced against the risk of the procedure.

This study aimed to determine whether and how BPD-EXO affect the development of BPD in a mouse model. We showed that treating BPD mice with BPD-EXO chronically and irreversibly aggravated lung injury. BPD-EXO up-regulated 139 and down-regulated 735 genes in the mouse lung tissue.

Our main objective is to identify markers to help understand biological processes and characterize infants with pulmonary hypertension associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia using tracheal aspirates. We conducted an unbiased multiomic analysis of tracheal aspirates via microRNA (miRNA) polymerase chain reaction arrays, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry proteomics in preterm infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia with and without pulmonary hypertension (n = 46). Our pilot study analysis revealed 12 miRNAs (hsa-miR-29a, has-miR-542-3p, has-miR-624, has-miR-183, hsa-miR-501-3p, hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-3131, hsa-miR-3683, hsa-miR-3193, hsa-miR-3672, hsa-miR-3128, and hsa-miR-1287), 6 transcripts (IL6, RPL35P5, HSD3B7, RNA5SP215, OR2A1-AS1, and RNVU1-19), and 5 proteins (CAPS, AAT, KRT5, SFTPB, and LGALS3BP) with significant differential expression in preterm infants with severe lung disease with pulmonary hypertension when compared with infants with severe lung disease but no pulmonary hypertension. Pathway analysis of the integrated multiomic expression signatures revealed NFkB, VEGF, SERPINA1, IL6, and ERK1/2 as target molecules and cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, and cellular movement as key affected molecular functions.

Pharmacogenomics can help guide individualized drug therapy and improve outcomes., CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a preterm infant with multiple complications, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, and hypertension. The infant was treated with various drugs, including dexamethasone and amlodipine. The infant was diagnosed with neonatal hypertension based on blood pressure measurements exceeding the 95th percentile for his age and sex. The possible causes of hypertension included dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone, and BPD. The infant was treated with oral amlodipine to lower his blood pressure. A pharmacogenomic test was performed to evaluate the genetic polymorphisms of ABCB1 and CYP3A5, which are involved in the metabolism and transport of dexamethasone and amlodipine. The infant's blood pressure was well controlled after the dose of amlodipine was reduced according to the pharmacogenomic results. The infant had a stable general condition and was discharged on the 100th d after birth., CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of regular blood pressure monitoring and etiological investigation in preterm infants with hypertension. Pharmacogenomics can provide useful information for individualized drug therapy and safety in this population. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

However, the function of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in BPD remains poorly understood. The gene expression omnibus (GEO) database was searched for information on genes associated with BPD. Twenty-five BPD-related DE-PRGs were identified, all of which were closely associated with pyroptosis regulation and immunological response. LASSO and SVM-RFE algorithms identified CHMP7, NLRC4, NLRP2, NLRP6, and NLRP9 among the 25 differentially expressed PRGs as marker genes with acceptable diagnostic capabilities. Using these five genes, we also generated a nomogram with excellent predictive power. Annotation enrichment analyses revealed that these five genes may be implicated in BPD and numerous BPD-related pathways. In addition, the ceRNA network showed an intricate regulatory link based on the marker genes. In addition, CIBERSORT-based studies revealed that alterations in the immunological microenvironment of BPD patients may be associated with the marker genes. We constructed a diagnostic nomogram and gave insight into the mechanism of BPD. Its diagnostic value for BPD must be evaluated in further research before it can be used in clinical practice.

Hyperoxia-induced pulmonary vascular and alveolar damage in premature infants is one of the most common and frequent factors contributing to BPD. The purpose of the present study was to explore the key molecules and the underlying mechanisms in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal mice and to provide a new strategy for the treatment of BPD. In this work, we reported that hyperoxia decreased the proportion of endothelial cells (ECs) in the lungs of neonatal mice. In hyperoxic lung ECs of neonatal mice, we detected upregulated fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression, accompanied by upregulation of the classic downstream signaling pathway of activated FGFR1, including the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Specific deletion of Fgfr1 in the ECs of neonatal mice protected the lungs from hyperoxia-induced lung injury, with improved angiogenesis, alveologenesis and respiratory metrics. Intriguingly, the increased Fgfr1 expression was mainly attributed to aerosol capillary endothelial (aCap) cells rather than general capillary endothelial (gCap) cells. Deletion of endothelial Fgfr1 increased the expression of gCap cell markers but decreased the expression of aCap cell markers. Additionally, inhibition of FGFR1 by an FGFR1 inhibitor improved alveologenesis and respiratory metrics. In summary, this study suggests that in neonatal mice, hyperoxia increases the expression of endothelial FGFR1 in lung ECs and that deficiency of endothelial Fgfr1 can ameliorate hyperoxia-induced BPD. These data suggest that FGFR1 may be a potential therapeutic target for BPD, which will provide a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of BPD.

The current knowledge on the molecular regulation of lung development mainly derives from mechanistic studies conducted in newborn rodents exposed to postnatal hyperoxia, which have been proven useful but have some limitations., METHODS: Here, we used the rabbit model of BPD as a cost-effective alternative model that mirrors human lung development and, in addition, enables investigating the impact of premature birth per se on the pathophysiology of BPD without further perinatal insults (e.g., hyperoxia, LPS-induced inflammation). First, we characterized the rabbit's normal lung development along the distinct stages (i.e., pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar phases) using histological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Then, the impact of premature birth was investigated, comparing the sequential transcriptomic profiles of preterm rabbits obtained at different time intervals during their first week of postnatal life with those from age-matched term pups., RESULTS: Histological findings showed stage-specific morphological features of the developing rabbit's lung and validated the selected time intervals for the transcriptomic profiling. Cell cycle and embryo development, oxidative phosphorylation, and WNT signaling, among others, showed high gene expression in the pseudoglandular phase. Autophagy, epithelial morphogenesis, response to transforming growth factor beta, angiogenesis, epithelium/endothelial cells development, and epithelium/endothelial cells migration pathways appeared upregulated from the 28th day of gestation (early saccular phase), which represents the starting point of the premature rabbit model. Premature birth caused a significant dysregulation of the inflammatory response. TNF-responsive, NF-kappaB regulated genes were significantly upregulated at premature delivery and triggered downstream inflammatory pathways such as leukocyte activation and cytokine signaling, which persisted upregulated during the first week of life. Preterm birth also dysregulated relevant pathways for normal lung development, such as blood vessel morphogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition., CONCLUSION: These findings establish the 28-day gestation premature rabbit as a suitable model for mechanistic and pharmacological studies in the context of BPD.

To address this need in neonates, the FDA and the Critical Path Institute (C-Path) established the International Neonatal Consortium (INC) to advance regulatory science and expedite neonatal drug development. FDA recently provided funding for INC to generate RWE to support regulatory decision making in neonatal drug development. One study is focused on developing a validated definition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in neonates. BPD is difficult to diagnose with diverse disease trajectories and few viable treatment options. Despite intense research efforts, limited understanding of the underlying disease pathobiology and disease projection continues in the context of a computable phenotype. It will be important to determine if: 1) a large, multisource aggregation of real-world data (RWD) will allow identification of validated risk factors and surrogate endpoints for BPD, and 2) the inclusion of these simulations will identify risk factors and surrogate endpoints for studies to prevent or treat BPD and its related long-term complications. The overall goal is to develop qualified, fit-for-purpose disease progression models which facilitate credible trial simulations while quantitatively capturing mechanistic relationships relevant for disease progression and the development of future treatments. The extent to which neonatal RWD can inform these models is unknown and its appropriateness cannot be guaranteed. A component of this approach is the critical evaluation of the various RWD sources for context-of use (COU)-driven models. The present manuscript defines a landscape of the data including targeted literature searches and solicitation of neonatal RWD sources from international stakeholders; analysis plans to develop a family of models of BPD in neonates, leveraging previous clinical trial experience and real-world patient data is also described.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of influenza by age and underlying medical conditions in hospitalized Norwegian children aged <18 years., Methods: Active surveillance for influenza in children <18 years was implemented in five hospitals during 2015-18. Children with respiratory symptoms and/or fever were prospectively enrolled and tested for influenza. Surveillance data were linked to health registry data to estimate the national burden of influenza in hospitals., Results: In 309 (10%) out of 3,010 hospital contacts, the child tested positive for influenza, corresponding to an average incidence of 0.96 hospital-attended influenza cases per 1,000 children <18 years of age. Children <1 year of age (3.8 per 1,000 children) and children with underlying medical conditions (17 per 1,000 children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) had the highest average incidence.

Despite advances in current management strategies, limited progress has been made in reducing the BPD-related systemic damage. Meanwhile, although the protective effects of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) or their exosomes on hyperoxia-induced lung injury have been explored by many researchers, the underlying mechanism has not been addressed in detail, and few studies have focused on the therapeutic effect on systemic multiple organ injury., AIM: To investigate whether hUC-MSC intratracheal administration could attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung, heart, and kidney injuries and the underlying regulatory mechanisms., METHODS: Neonatal rats were exposed to hyperoxia (80% O2), treated with hUC-MSCs intratracheal (iT) or intraperitoneal (iP) on postnatal day 7, and harvested on postnatal day 21. The tissue sections of the lung, heart, and kidney were analyzed morphometrically. Protein contents of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were examined. Pulmonary inflammatory cytokines were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A comparative transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung tissue was conducted via RNA-sequencing. Subsequently, we performed reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis to explore the expression of target mRNA and proteins related to inflammatory and oxidative responses., RESULTS: iT hUC-MSCs administration improved pulmonary alveolarization and angiogenesis (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05 for mean linear intercept, septal counts, vascular medial thickness index, and microvessel density respectively). Meanwhile, treatment with hUC-MSCs iT ame liorated right ventricular hypertrophy (for Fulton's index, P < 0.01), and relieved reduced nephrogenic zone width (P < 0.01) and glomerular diameter (P < 0.001) in kidneys. Among the beneficial effects, a reduction of BALF protein, MPO, and MDA was observed in hUC-MSCs groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05 respectively). Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 expression observed in the hyperoxia group were significantly attenuated by hUC-MSCs administration (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05 respectively). In addition, we observed an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 expression in rats that received hUC-MSCs iT compared with rats reared in hyperoxia (P < 0.05). Tran scriptomic analysis showed that the DEGs in lung tissues induced by hyperoxia were enriched in pathways related to inflammatory responses, epithelial cell proliferation, and vasculature development. hUC-MSCs administration blunted these hyperoxia-induced dysregulated genes and resulted in a shift in the gene expression pattern toward the normoxia group. hUC-MSCs increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), JAK2, and STAT3 expression, and their phosphorylation in the lung, heart, and kidney (P < 0.05). Remarkably, no significant difference was observed between the iT and iP administration., CONCLUSION: iT hUC-MSCs administration ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung, heart, and kidney injuries by activating HO-1 expression and JAK/STAT signaling. The therapeutic benefits of local iT and iP administration are equivalent. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2022. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The aim of this investigation was to determine the systemic expression of APPs, i.e., lactoferrin (LF) and human neutrophil protein (HNP) 1-3 in preterm infants in the period of highest vulnerability for infection and to correlate these biomarkers with short-term outcome. We therefore conducted a prospective two-center study including plasma samples of 278 preterm infants and 78 corresponding mothers. APP levels were analyzed on day 1, 3, 7, and 21 of life via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of LF and HNP1-3 remained stable during the first 21 days of life and were not influenced by maternal levels. Elevated APP levels were found at day 1 in infants born to mothers with amniotic infection syndrome (AIS vs. no AIS, mean +/- SD in ng/ml: LF 199.8 +/- 300 vs. 124.1 +/- 216.8, HNP 1-3 16,819 +/- 36,124 vs. 8,701 +/- 11,840; p = 0.021, n = 179). We found no elevated levels of APPs before the onset of sepsis episodes or in association with other short-term outcomes that are in part mediated by inflammation such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Interestingly, infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) showed higher levels of HNP1-3 on day 21 than infants without BPD (13,473 +/- 16,135 vs. 8,388 +/- 15,938, n = 111, p = 0.008). In infants born without amniotic infection, levels of the measured APPs correlated with gestational age and birth weight. In our longitudinal study, systemic levels of LF and HNP 1-3 were not associated with postnatal infection and adverse short-term outcomes in preterm infants.

Maternal vaginal microbiota can be a determining factor of spontaneous Preterm Birth (SPPTB), the leading cause of perinatal mortality. The aim of the study is to investigate the likelihood of a causal relationship between the maternal vaginal microbiota composition and neonatal lung and intestinal microbiota profile at birth, in cases of SPPTB. The association between the lung and/or meconium microbiota with the subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was also investigated. Maternal vaginal swabs, newborns' bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (1st, 3rd, 7th day of life) and first meconium samples were collected from 20 women and 23 preterm newborns with gestational age <= 30 weeks (12 = SPPTB; 11 = Medically Indicated Preterm Birth-MIPTB). All the samples were analyzed for culture examination and for microbiota profiling using metagenomic analysis based on the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. No significant differences in alpha e beta diversity were found between the neonatal BALF samples of SPPTB group and the MIPTB group. The vaginal microbiota of mothers with SPPTB showed a significant difference in alpha diversity with a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in Proteobacteria abundance. No association was found between BALF and meconium microbiota with the development of BPD. Vaginal colonization by Ureaplasma bacteria was associated with increased risk of both SPPTB and newborns' BPD occurrence. In conclusion, an increase in alpha-diversity values and a consequent fall in Lactobacillus in vaginal environment could be associated to a higher risk of SPPTB. We could identify neither a specific neonatal lung or meconium microbiota profiles in preterm infants born by SPPTB nor a microbiota at birth suggestive of subsequent BPD development. Although a strict match has not been revealed between microbiota of SPPTB mother-infant couples, a relationship cannot be excluded. To figure out the reciprocal influence of the maternal-neonatal microbiota and its potential role in the pathogenesis of SPPTB and BPD further research is needed.

To date, there are comprehensive therapeutic strategy for this disease, but the underlying mechanism is still in progress. By using lentivirus, we constructed microRNA34a (miR34a)-overexpressing or knockdown A549 cell lines, and exposure to hyperoxia to mimic oxygen induce lung injury. In this study, we investigated 4 proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the secreted sputum of infants who received mechanical ventilation, and found that IL-1beta was substantially elevated in the first week after oxygen therapy and with no significant decrease until the fourth week, while TNF-alpha, Ang-1, and COX-2 were increased in the first week but decreased quickly in the following weeks. In addition, in vitro assay revealed that hyperoxia significantly increased the expression of miR-34a, which positively regulated the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in A549 cells. Overexpressing or knockdown miR34 would exacerbate or inhibit production of IL-1beta and its upstream NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway. Mechanically, it's found that TNFAIP3 interacting protein 2 (TNIP2), an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), is a direct target of miR34a, negatively regulated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of IL-1beta. Overexpressing TNIP2 ameliorated hyperoxia-induced production of IL-1beta and cell apoptosis. Our findings suggest that TNIP2 may be a potential clinical marker in the diagnosis of BPD.

The current study sought to identify an optimal culture supplement of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) for BPD therapy. In this study, we found that UC-MSCs cultured with human platelet lysate (hPL-UCMSCs) were maintained a small size from Passage 1 (P1) to P10, while UC-MSCs cultured with fetal bovine serum (FBS-UCMSCs) became wide and flat. Furthermore, hPL was associated with lower levels of senescence in UC-MSCs during in vitro expansion compared with FBS, as indicated by the results of beta-galactosidase staining and measures of senescence-related genes (CDKN2A, CDKN1A, and mTOR). In addition, hPL enhanced the proliferation and cell viability of the UC-MSCs and reduced their doubling time in vitro. Compared with FBS-UCMSCs, hPL-UCMSCs have a greater potential to differentiate into osteocytes and chondrocytes. Moreover, using hPL resulted in greater expression of Nestin and specific paracrine factors (VEGF, TGF-beta1, FGF2, IL-8, and IL-6) in UC-MSCs compared to using FBS. Critically, we also found that hPL-UCMSCs are more effective than FBS-UCMSCs for the treatment of BPD in a rat model, with hPL leading to improvements in survival rate, lung architecture and fibrosis, and lung capillary density. Finally, qPCR of rat lung mRNA demonstrated that hPL-UCMSCs had lower expression levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and a key chemokine (MCP-1) at postnatal day 10, and there was significant reduction of CD68+ macrophages in lung tissue after hPL-UCMSCs transplantation. Altogether, our findings suggest that hPL is an optimal culture supplement for UC-MSCs expansion in vitro, and that hPL-UCMSCs promote lung repair in rat BPD disease.

Current strategies, albeit successful in moderately reducing morbidity and mortality of BPD, failed to draw overall satisfactory conclusion. Here, using a typical mouse model mimicking hallmarks of BPD, we revealed that both cord blood-derived mononuclear cells (CB-MNCs) and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are efficient in alleviating BPD. Notably, infusion of CB-MNCs has more prominent effects in preventing alveolar simplification and pulmonary vessel loss, restoring pulmonary respiratory functions and balancing inflammatory responses. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms within the divergent therapeutic effects of UC-MSC and CB-MNC, we systematically investigated the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA)-miRNA-mRNA networks by whole-transcriptome sequencing. Importantly, pathway analysis integrating Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)/gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method indicates that the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network is mainly related to the regulation of GTPase activity (GO: 0043087), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 signal cascade (GO: 0070371), chromosome regulation (GO: 0007059), and cell cycle control (GO: 0044770). Through rigorous selection of the lncRNA/circRNA-based ceRNA network, we demonstrated that the hub genes reside in UC-MSC- and CB-MNC-infused networks directed to the function of cell adhesion, motor transportation (Cdk13, Lrrn2), immune homeostasis balance, and autophagy (Homer3, Prkcd) relatively. Our studies illustrate the first comprehensive mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA and mRNA-miRNA-circRNA networks in stem cell-infused BPD model, which will be valuable in identifying reliable biomarkers or therapeutic targets for BPD pathogenesis and shed new light in the priming and conditioning of UC-MSCs or CB-MNCs in the treatment of neonatal lung injury.

Newborn preterm pigs were intubated and randomized to receive intratracheal rhKGF (20 mug/kg; n = 6) or saline (0.5 ml 0.9% saline; control; n = 6) before initiating 24 h of ventilation followed by extubation to nasal oxygen for 12 h before euthanasia and collection of lungs for histopathology and immunohistochemistry to assess expression of surfactant protein B and markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. rhKGF pigs required less oxygen during mechanical ventilation, had higher tidal volumes at similar peak pressures indicative of improved lung compliance, and survival was higher after extubation (83% vs. 16%). rhKGF increased surfactant protein B expression (p < 0.05) and reduced TGF-1beta (p < 0.05), that inhibits surfactant production and is a prominent marker for epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

Neonatal C57BL/6 mouse pups were exposed to 75% oxygen from postnatal day (PN)-1 for 5, 8, or 14 days, and their lungs were examined at PN14 and PN40. While all mice showed some degree of lung damage, mice exposed to hyperoxia for 8 or 14 days exhibited the greatest septal wall thickening and airspace enlargement. Furthermore, when assessed at PN40, mice exposed for 8 or 14 days to supplemental oxygen exhibited augmented septal wall thickness and emphysema, with the severity increased with the longer exposure, which translated into a decline in respiratory function at PN80 in the 14-day model. In addition to this, mice exposed to hyperoxia for 8 days showed significant expansion of alveolar epithelial type II cells as well as the greatest fibrosis when assessed at PN40 suggesting a healing response, which was not seen in mice exposed to high oxygen for a longer period. While evidence of lung inflammation was apparent at PN14, chronic inflammation was absent from all three models. Finally, exposure to high oxygen for 14 days also induced concurrent outer retinal degeneration. This study shows that early postnatal exposure to high oxygen generates hallmark acute and chronic pathologies in mice that highlights its use as a translational model of BPD.

Alveolar maldevelopment is the crucial pathological change of BPD highly associated with oxidative stress-mediated excessive apoptosis. Cellular injury can be propagated and amplified by gap junction (GJ)-mediated intercellular communication. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the most ubiquitous and critical GJ protein. Gap26 is a specific Cx43 mimic peptide, playing as a Cx43-GJ inhibitor. We hypothesized that Cx43-GJ was involved in alveolar maldevelopment of BPD via amplifying oxidative stress signaling and inducing excessive apoptosis. Neonatal Sprague Dawley rats were kept in either normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2) continuously from postnatal day (PN) 1 to 14 in the presence or absence of Gap26. Moreover, RLE-6TN cells (type II alveolar epithelial cells of rats) were cultured in vitro under normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2). RLE-6TN cells were treated by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (a kind of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger) or Gap26. Morphological properties of lung tissue are detected. Markers associated with Cx43 expression, ROS production, the activity of the ASK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway, and apoptotic level are detected in vivo and in vitro, respectively. In vitro, the ability of GJ-mediated intercellular communication was examined by dye-coupling assay. In vitro, our results demonstrated ROS increased Cx43 expression and GJ-mediated intercellular communication and Gap26 treatment decreased ROS production, inhibited ASK1-JNK/p38 signaling, and decreased apoptosis. In vivo, we found that hyperoxia exposure resulted in increased ROS production and Cx43 expression, activated ASK1-JNK/p38 signaling, and induced excessive apoptosis. However, Gap26 treatment reversed these changes, thus improving alveolar development in neonatal rats with hyperoxia exposure. In summary, oxidative stress increased Cx43 expression and Cx43-GJ-mediated intercellular communication. And Cx43-GJ-mediated intercellular communication amplified oxidative stress signaling, inducing excessive apoptosis via the ASK1-JNK/p38 signaling pathway. The specific connexin 43-inhibiting peptide Gap26 was a novel therapeutic strategy to improve the alveolar development of BPD.

Methods: This birth cohort study enrolled 109 VLBW preterm infants, including 32 infants who developed BPD. Hsp-70 and 8-OHdG concentrations from TA were measured by immunoassay. The apoptosis of TA epithelial cells obtained on Day 28 after birth was measured using annexin-V staining assay. Results: Hsp-70 and 8-OHdG levels in TA fluid were persistently increased from Day 1 to Day 28 of life in the BPD group. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that BPD was significantly associated with gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, and TA Hsp-70 and 8-OHdG levels on post-natal Day 28. The TA Hsp-70 level positively correlated with TA 8-OHdG level on the Day 1 (r = 0.47) and Day 28 of life (r = 0.68). Incubation of recombinant Hsp-70 with primary epithelial cells derived from TA of patients decreased hydrogen peroxide-induced epithelial cell death.

Exosomes and exosomal miRNAs (EXO-miRNAs) from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are involved in the development of BPD and might serve as predictive biomarkers for BPD. However, the roles of exosomes and EXO-miRNAs from umbilical cord blood of BPD infants in regulating angiogenesis are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that umbilical cord blood-derived exosomes from BPD infants impaired angiogenesis in vitro. Next-generation sequencing of EXO-miRNAs from preterm infants without (NBPD group) or with BPD (BPD group) uncovered a total of 418 differentially expressed (DE) EXO-miRNAs. These DE EXO-miRNAs were primarily enriched in cellular function-associated pathways including the PI3K/Akt and angiogenesis-related signaling pathways. Among those EXO-miRNAs which are associated with PI3K/Akt and angiogenesis-related signaling pathways, BPD reduced the expression of hsa-miR-103a-3p and hsa-miR-185-5p exhibiting the most significant reduction (14.3% and 23.1% of NBPD group, respectively); BPD increased hsa-miR-200a-3p expression by 2.64 folds of the NBPD group. Furthermore, overexpression of hsa-miR-103a-3p and hsa-miR-185-5p in normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and cell migration, whereas overexpressing hsa-miR-200a-3p inhibited these cellular responses. This study demonstrates that exosomes derived from umbilical cord blood of BPD infants impair angiogenesis, possibly via DE EXO-miRNAs, which might contribute to the development of BPD.

We have previously shown that antenatal endotoxin (ETX) causes abnormal lung structure and function in 2-week-old rats, but whether ETX impairs lung mechanics at birth and increases risk for VILI is unknown. Fetal rats were exposed to 10 mug endotoxin or saline via intra-amniotic injection. At birth (D0) or 7 days (D7), rats received 90 min of lung protective ventilation [PROTECT group; tidal volume (Vt) = 6 ml/kg with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) = 2 cmH2O]; P20 ventilation [plateau pressure (Pplat) = 20 cmH2O, PEEP = 0]; or P24 ventilation (Pplat = 24 cmH2O, PEEP = 0, only applied to D7). Prior to prolonged ventilation at D0, endotoxin-exposed rats had decreased compliance and inspiratory capacity (IC) compared to controls. At D7, endotoxin was associated with reduced compliance. High-pressure ventilation (P20 and P24) tended to increase IC and compliance in all saline-treated groups. Ventilation at D0 with P20 increased IC and compliance when applied to saline-treated but not endotoxin-exposed pups. At D7, P24 ventilation of endotoxin-exposed pups increased elastance, bronchoalveolar lavage protein content, and IL-1b and TEN-C mRNA expression in comparison to the saline group. In summary, antenatal endotoxin exposure alters lung mechanics at birth and 1 week of life and increases susceptibility to VILI as observed in lung mechanics, alveolocapillary barrier injury, and inflammatory mRNA expression. We speculate that antenatal inflammation primes the lung for a more marked VILI response, suggesting an adverse synergistic effect of antenatal and postnatal exposures.

The accurate molecular etiology of BPD remains largely unclear. This study aimed to identify key BPD-associated genes and pathways functionally enriched using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We analyzed microarray data of 62 pre-term patients with BPD and 38 pre-term patients without BPD from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). WGCNA was used to construct a gene expression network, and genes were classified into definite modules. In addition, the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of BPD-related hub genes were performed. Firstly, we constructed a weighted gene co-expression network, and genes were divided into 10 modules. Among the modules, the yellow module was related to BPD progression and severity and included the following hub genes: MMP25, MMP9, SIRPA, CKAP4, SLCO4C1, and SLC2A3; and the red module included some co-expression molecules that displayed a continuous decline in expression with BPD progression and included the following hub genes: LEF1, ITK, CD6, RASGRP1, IL7R, SKAP1, CD3E, and ICOS. GO and KEGG analyses showed that high expression of inflammatory response-related genes and low expression of T cell receptor activation-related genes are significantly correlated with BPD progression. The present WGCNA-based study thus provides an overall perspective of BPD and lays the foundation for identifying potential pathways and hub genes that contribute to the development of BPD.

There is mounting evidence that BPD may be due to a systemic insult, such as acute kidney injury (AKI). Our hypothesis was that severe AKI would be associated with BPD., METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of premature infants [24-27 weeks gestation] in the Recombinant Erythropoietin for Protection of Infant Renal Disease cohort (N = 885). We evaluated the composite outcome of Grade 2/3 BPD or death using generalized estimating equations. In an exploratory analysis, urinary biomarkers of angiogenesis (ANG1, ANG2, EPO, PIGF, TIE2, FGF, and VEGFA/D) were analyzed., RESULTS: 594 (67.1%) of infants had the primary composite outcome of Grade 2/3 BPD or death. Infants with AKI (aOR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.16-2.46) and severe AKI (aOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.19-3.54). had increased risk of the composite outcome after multivariable adjustment Among 106 infants with urinary biomarkers assessed, three biomarkers (VEGFA, VEGFD, and TIE2) had AUC > 0.60 to predict BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Infants with AKI had a higher likelihood of developing BPD/death, with the strongest relationship seen in those with more severe AKI. Three urinary biomarkers of angiogenesis may have potential to predict BPD development., IMPACT: AKI is associated with lung disease in extremely premature infants, and urinary biomarkers may predict this relationship. Infants with AKI and severe AKI have higher odds of BPD or death. Three urinary angiogenesis biomarkers are altered in infants that develop BPD. These findings have the potential to drive future work to better understand the mechanistic pathways of BPD, setting the framework for future interventions to decrease BPD rates. A better understanding of the mechanisms of BPD development and the role of AKI would have clinical care, cost, and quality of life implications given the long-term effects of BPD. Copyright © 2023.

In different healthcare systems, outpatient KMC programmes (KMCPs) have been pioneers in the follow-up of these high-risk newborns.Here, we describe an overview analysis performed in an unprecedented data set comprising Colombian infants and spanning 28 years., METHODS: Cohort study of 57 154 infants discharged home in kangaroo position (KP) for follow-up in four KMCPs between 1993 and 2021., RESULTS: At birth and at hospital discharge to a KMCP, median gestational age and weight were 34.5 and 36 weeks, 2000 g and 2200 g, respectively. Chronological age at admission was 8 days. Over time, anthropometric measures at birth and somatic growth during follow-up improved; on the other hand, percentages of mechanical ventilation, intraventricular haemorrhage and need for intensive care decreased as neuropsychomotor, sensory disorders and bronchopulmonary dysplasia incidence at 40 weeks. Risk of cerebral palsy and teenage mothers' frequency was higher in the poorest population. Early home discharge in KP in less than 72 hours was possible in 19% of the cohort. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a more than twofold increase in exclusive breast feeding at 6 months and a reduction in readmission rates., CONCLUSION: This study provides a general overview of KMCPs follow-up during the last 28 years within the Colombian healthcare system. These descriptive analyses have allowed us to structure KMC as an evidence-based method. KMCPs allow close monitoring with regular feedback about preterm or LBW infants' perinatal care, quality of care over time and health status during their first year of life.

We examined body mass and ratio of wet-to-dry lung tissue weights of neonatal rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed to examine histopathological alterations of lung tissues. In addition, enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was conducted to measure pro-inflammatory cytokine levels within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Apoptosis of lung tissues was observed using TUNEL assay. Western blotting was performed for detecting endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-associated protein levels. The results showed that Gln promoted body weight gain, significantly reduced pathological damage and oxidative stress in lung tissue, and improved lung function in neonatal rats. Gln reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release as well as inflammatory cell production in BALF and inhibited apoptosis in lung tissue cells. Furthermore, we found that Gln could downregulate ERS-associated protein levels (GRP78, Caspase-12, CHOP) and inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1alpha) phosphorylation. These results in an animal model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) suggest that Gln may have a therapeutic effect on BPD by reducing lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis and improving lung function; its mechanism of action may be related to the inhibition of the IRE1alpha/JNK pathway.

Recent studies have suggested that microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of BPD and may serve as biomarkers for early detection. We conducted a directed search for dysregulated miRNAs in lung and heart autopsy samples of infants with histologic BPD., METHODS: We used archived lung and heart samples from BPD (13 lung, 6 heart) and control (24 lung, 5 heart) subjects. To measure miRNA expression, RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens then reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized to miRNA microarrays. The microarrays were scanned, and data were quantile normalized. Statistical analysis with a moderated t-test and control of the false discovery rate (5%) was used to compare normalized miRNA expression values between clinical categories., RESULTS: With our set of 48 samples, 43 miRNAs had a significant difference in expression comparing BPD to non-BPD controls. Among the most statistically significant miRNAs, miR-378b, miRNA-184, miRNA-3667-5p, miRNA-3976, miRNA-4646-5p, and miRNA-7846-3p were all consistently upregulated in both the heart and lung tissues of BPD subjects. The cellular pathway predicted to be most affected by these miRNAs is the Hippo signaling pathway., CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies miRNAs that are similarly dysregulated in postmortem lung and heart samples in subjects with histologic BPD. These miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD, have potential as biomarkers, and may provide insight to novel approaches for diagnosis and treatment.

To date, intervention strategies to prevent or treat BPD are limited. We aimed to determine the effects of umbilical cord blood-derived exosomes (UCB-EXOs) from healthy term pregnancies on hyperoxia-induced lung injury and to identify potential targets for BPD intervention. A mouse model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury was created by exposing neonatal mice to hyperoxia after birth until the 14th day post birth. Age-matched neonatal mice were exposed to normoxia as the control. Hyperoxia-induced lung injury mice were intraperitoneally injected with UCB-EXO or vehicle daily for 3 days, starting on day 4 post birth. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were insulted with hyperoxia to establish an in vitro model of BPD to investigate angiogenesis dysfunction. Our results showed that UCB-EXO alleviated lung injuries in hyperoxia-insulted mice by reducing histopathological grade and collagen contents in the lung tissues. UCB-EXO also promoted vascular growth and increased miR-185-5p levels in the lungs of hyperoxia-insulted mice. Additionally, we found that UCB-EXO elevated miR-185-5p levels in HUVECs. MiR-185-5p overexpression inhibited cell apoptosis, whereas promoted cell migration in HUVECs exposed to hyperoxia. The luciferase reporter assay results revealed that miR-185-5p directly targeted cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), which was downregulated in the lungs of hyperoxia-insulted mice. Together, these data suggest that UCB-EXO from healthy term pregnancies protect against hyperoxia-induced lung injuries via promoting neonatal pulmonary angiogenesis partially by elevating miR-185-5p.

The mechanisms driving the chronic respiratory symptoms are ill-defined. We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice (a model of BPD) increases the activated lung CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) and these DCs are required for exaggerated proinflammatory responses to rhinovirus (RV) infection. Since CD103+ DC are essential for specific antiviral responses and their development depends on the growth factor Flt3L, we hypothesized that early-life hyperoxia stimulates Flt3L expression leading to expansion and activation of lung CD103+ DCs and this mediates inflammation. We found that hyperoxia numerically increased and induced proinflammatory transcriptional signatures in neonatal lung CD103+ DCs, as well as CD11bhi DCs. Hyperoxia also increased Flt3L expression. Anti-Flt3L antibody blocked CD103+ DC development in normoxic and hyperoxic conditions, and while it did not affect the baseline number of CD11bhi DCs, it neutralized the effect of hyperoxia on these cells. Anti-Flt3L also inhibited hyperoxia-induced proinflammatory responses to RV. In tracheal aspirates from preterm infants mechanically-ventilated for respiratory distress in the first week of life levels of FLT3L, IL-12p40, IL-12p70 and IFN-gamma were higher in infants who went on to develop BPD and FLT3L levels positively correlated with proinflammatory cytokines levels. This work highlights the priming effect of early-life hyperoxia on lung DC development and function and the contribution of Flt3L in driving these effects.

Histopathological changes to the lungs were evaluated through immunohistochemistry, and the activation of disheveled and Wnt /beta-catenin signaling pathway components was assessed by Western blotting and real-time PCR. The abilities of proliferation, apoptosis and migration were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry and scratch wound assay, respectively., RESULTS: Contrasting with normoxic lungs, hyperoxia-exposed lungs demonstrated larger alveoli, fewer alveoli and thicker alveolar septa.

In this study, we investigated whether the HIF-1alpha stabilization modulated by Grx1 ablation could ameliorate the pathological changes in the mouse model of BPD, including angiogenesis and alveolar formation. We found that depletion of Grx1 increased levels of GSH-protein adducts, which was associated with the improvement in the numbers of alveoli, the capillary density in the pulmonary microcirculation and the survival rate in the littermates with hyperoxic exposure. Grx1 ablation could promote HIF-1alpha glutathionylation by increasing GSH adducts to stabilize HIF-1alpha and to induce VEGF-A production in the lung tissue. The above phenotype of capillary density and VEGF-A production was removed by the pharmacological administration of YC-1, the HIF-1alpha inhibitor, suggesting the HIF-1alpha dependent manner for pulmonary microcirculatory perfusion. These data indicate that HIF-1alpha stabilization plays an critical role in modification pulmonary microcirculatory perfusion, which is associated with the pathological damage under hyperoxic conditions, suggesting that targeting with HIF-1alpha stabilization should be a potential clinical and therapeutic strategy for BPD treatment.

Many clinical studies indicate that BPD is associated with advanced ROP. However, the mechanistic link between hyperoxia, BPD, and ROP remains to be explored. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a key executor of inflammasome-induced pyroptosis and inflammation. Inhibition of GSDMD has been shown to attenuate hyperoxia-induced BPD and brain injury in neonatal mice. The objective of this study was to further define the mechanistic roles of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced BPD and ROP in mouse models. Here we show that global GSDMD knockout (GSDMD-KO) protects against hyperoxia-induced BPD by reducing macrophage infiltration, improving alveolarization and vascular development, and decreasing cell death. In addition, GSDMD deficiency prevented hyperoxia-induced ROP by reducing vasoobliteration and neovascularization, improving thinning of multiple retinal tissue layers, and decreasing microglial activation. RNA sequencing analyses of lungs and retinas showed that similar genes, including those from inflammatory, cell death, tissue remodeling, and tissue and vascular developmental signaling pathways, were induced by hyperoxia and impacted by GSDMD-KO in both models. These data highlight the importance of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of BPD and ROP and suggest that targeting GSDMD may be beneficial in preventing and treating BPD and ROP in premature infants.

However, the importance of AMs in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a significant role of abnormal AM proliferation and polarization in alveolar dysplasia during BPD, which is closely related to the activation of the IL-33-ST2 pathway. Compared with the control BPD group, AMs depletion partially abolished the epithelialmesenchymal transition process of AECII and alleviated pulmonary differentiation arrest. In addition, IL-33 or ST2 knockdown has protective effects against lung injury after hyperoxia, which is associated with reduced AM polarization and proliferation. The protective effect disappeared following reconstitution of AMs in injured IL-33 knockdown mice, and the differentiation of lung epithelium was blocked again. In conclusion, the IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting AMs proliferation and polarization in BPD, which shows a novel strategy for manipulating the IL-33-ST2-AMs axis for the diagnosis and intervention of BPD.

This study compared the perinatal characteristics and outcomes of singletons and twins admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China., METHODS: The study population comprised all infants born before 32 weeks in the Chinese Neonatal Network (CHNN) between January 2019 and December 2019. Three-level and population-average generalized estimating equation (GEE)/alternating logistic regression (ALR) models were used to determine the association of twins with neonatal morbidities and the use of NICU resources., RESULTS: During the study period, there were 6634 (71.2%) singletons and 2680 (28.8%) twins, with mean birth weights of 1333.70 g and 1294.63 g, respectively. Twins were significantly more likely to be delivered by caesarean section (p < 0.01), have antenatal steroid usage (p = 0.048), have been conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) (p < 0.01), have a higher prevalence of maternal diabetes (p < 0.01) and be inborn (p < 0.01) than singletons. In addition, twins had a lower prevalence of small for gestational age, maternal hypertension, and primigravida mothers than singletons (all p < 0.01). After adjusting for potential confounders, twins had higher mortality rates (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.49), higher incidences of short-term composite outcomes (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (AOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.50), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (AOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.21), more surfactant usage (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.41) and prolonged hospital stays (adjusted mean ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), compared to singletons., CONCLUSION: Our work suggests that twins have a greater risk of mortality, a higher incidence of RDS and BPD, more surfactant usage, and longer NICU stays than singletons among VPIs in China.

Growing evidence indicates that BPD is associated with the dysregulation of circular RNAs (circRNAs). Therefore, we aimed to explore the expression profiles of circRNAs and investigate the underlying molecular network associated with BPD., METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants at 5-8 days of life to extract PBMCs. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR tests were performed to determine the differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) between BPD and non-BPD VLBW infants. Simultaneous analysis of GSE32472 was conducted to obtain differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNA) from BPD infants. The miRNAs were predicted by DEcircRNAs and DEmRNAs of upregulated, respectively, and then screened for overlapping ones. GO and KEGG analysis was performed following construction of the competing endogenous RNA regulatory network (ceRNA) for further investigation., RESULTS: A total of 65 circRNAs (52 upregulated and 13 downregulated) were identified as DEcircRNAs between the two groups (FC >2.0 and p.adj <0.05). As a result, the ceRNA network was constructed based on three upregulated DEcircRNAs validated by qRT-PCR (hsa_circ_0007054, hsa_circ_0057950, and hsa_circ_0120151). Bioinformatics analysis indicated these DEcircRNAs participated in response to stimulus, IL-1 receptor activation, neutrophil activation, and metabolic pathways., CONCLUSIONS: In VLBW infants with a high risk for developing BPD, the circRNA expression profiles in PBMCs were significantly altered in the early post-birth period, suggesting immune dysregulation caused by infection and inflammatory response already existed.

But not only the susceptibility to infection is increased in neonates, but also their risk for developing post-inflammatory diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). This may be due to an impaired ability to terminate inflammation. In the study presented here, we aimed to investigate the proliferative response and the expression of immune-checkpoint molecules (ICM) and activation markers on neonatal T-cells in comparison to adult T-cells with the hypothesis that an increased activation of neonatal T-cells may contribute to the failure of inflammation resolution observed in neonates. We show that neonatal CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells show an increased proliferative capacity and an increased expression of activation markers compared to adult T-cells upon stimulation with OKT3 as well as a decreased expression of ICM, especially PD-L1 on their surface. This decreased expression of PD-L1 by neonatal T-cells was also observed after stimulation with GBS, but not after stimulation with E. coli, the two most important pathogens in neonatal sepsis. Expression of the T-cell receptor CD3 and the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 did not differ between adult and neonatal T-cells upon bacterial stimulation. Decreased expression of ICM upon T-cell activation may be a reason for the increased risk of neonates to develop post-inflammatory diseases. Copyright © 2022.

Recent studies suggest insufficient AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation as a potential cause of impaired autophagy in rodent and nonhuman primate models of BPD. Impaired autophagy is associated with enhanced inflammatory signaling in alveolar macrophages (AMs) and increased severity of murine BPD induced by neonatal hyperoxia exposure. The goal of this study was to determine the role of autophagy and AMPK activation in macrophage responses in murine BPD. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to neonatal hyperoxia starting on postnatal day (P)1 and treated with the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) between P3 and P6. Mice were euthanized on P7, and markers of AMPK activation and autophagy were assessed by immunoblotting. Alveolarization was assessed using radial alveolar counts, mean linear intercept measurements, and quantification of alveolar septal myofibroblasts. Relative mRNA expression of M1-like and M2-like genes was assessed in AMs isolated from BAL fluid from wild-type, LysMCre--Becn1fl/fl, and LysMCre+-Becn1fl/fl mice after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. AICAR treatment resulted in AMPK activation and induction of autophagic activity in whole-lung and BAL cell lysates and attenuated hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification in neonatal lungs. AICAR-treated control but not Beclin1-deficient AMs demonstrated significantly decreased expression of M1-like markers and significantly increased expression of M2-like markers. In conclusion, pharmacologic activation of AMPK by AICAR resulted in induction of autophagy and played a protective role, at least in part, through attenuation of proinflammatory signaling in AMs via autophagy-dependent mechanisms in a murine model of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"9234357b-bc85-4cf0-a878-bf2533d658a2","_showDetails":false},"8ce171d6-eab8-4989-a14e-e614d85fdff3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels predict adverse respiratory outcomes in premature neonates.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.26197","authors":["Almudares, Faeq","Hagan, Joseph","Chen, Xinpu","Devaraj, Sridevi","Moorthy, Bhagavatula","Lingappan, Krithika"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20221014//","keywords":["Pregnancy","Female","Infant, Newborn","Humans","*Infant, Premature","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Gestational Age","Respiration, Artificial","Growth Differentiation Factor 15"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"58","number":"1","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=36205439"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a stress-responsive cytokine, and its expression increases during inflammation, hyperoxia, and senescence. Significantly, GDF15 is secreted by the placenta, and maternal levels increase throughout pregnancy. Serum GDF15 level is a promising biomarker for many lung diseases like pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. However, circulating GDF15 levels in preterm infants and their role as a predictor of respiratory outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesized that GDF15 levels would increase with gestational age at birth, and that postnatal GDF15 will be correlated with adverse respiratory outcomes in preterm infants. Scavenged blood samples were retrieved from 57 preterm infants at five time points, from birth until 36-weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). GDF15 levels were measured using ELISA in 114 samples. We performed two-sample t-test, correlation and linear regression, logistic regression, and mixed-effects linear models for statistical analysis, and significance was identified when p < 0.05. Contrary to our hypothesis, for every 1-week increase in gestational age at birth, the predicted GDF15 level decreased by 475.0 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Greater PMA was significantly associated with lower serum GDF15 levels (p < 0.001). Interestingly, higher GDF15 levels were associated with a longer need for mechanical ventilation (p = 0.034), prolonged respiratory support need (p < 0.001), and length of hospital stay (p = 0.006). In conclusion, in preterm infants, GDF15 levels show an inverse correlation with gestational age at birth, with higher levels in more preterm babies, and levels trend down postnatally. Furthermore, longitudinal GDF15 levels through 36 weeks PMA predict adverse respiratory outcomes in preterm infants.

The dimeric trans-activation of GCs induces unfavorable effects, while monomeric trans-repression suppresses inflammation-related genes. Recently, non-steroidal-selective glucocorticoid-receptor agonists and modulators (SEGRAMs) with only the trans-repressive action have been designed., METHODS: Using a bleomycin (Bleo)-induced alveolar simplification newborn rat model (recapitulating arrested alveolarization during BPD), we evaluated the therapeutic effects of compound-A (CpdA), a SEGRAM. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered Bleo from postnatal day (PD) 0 to 10 and treated with dexamethasone (Dex) or CpdA from PD 0 to 13. The morphological changes and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), and C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2) were investigated., RESULTS: Similar to the effects of Dex, CpdA exerted protective effects on morphological derangements and inhibited macrophage infiltration and production of pro-inflammatory mediators in Bleo-treated animals. The effects of CpdA were probably mediated by GC receptor (GR)-dependent trans-repression, because unlike the Dex-treated group, anti-inflammatory genes specifically induced by GR-dependent trans-activation (such as \"glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper, GILZ\") were not upregulated., CONCLUSIONS: CpdA improved lung inflammation, inhibited the arrest of alveolar maturation, and restored histological and biochemical changes in a Bleo-induced alveolar simplification model., IMPACT: SEGRAMs have attracted widespread attention because they are expected to not exhibit unfavorable effects of GCs. Compound A, one of the SEGRAMs, improved lung morphometric changes and decreased lung inflammation in a bleomycin-induced arrested alveolarization, a newborn rat model representing one of the main features of BPD pathology. Compound A did not elicit bleomycin-induced poor weight gain, in contrast to dexamethasone treatment. SEGRAMs, including compound A, may be promising candidates for the therapy of BPD with less adverse effects compared with GCs. Copyright © 2022.

Brainstem auditory-evoked response was studied using maximum length sequence. Wave latencies and intervals were analyzed in detail. The controls were 37 normal term infants and 35 very preterm non-BPD infants., RESULTS: Compared with normal term controls, BPD survivors showed significantly shortened I-III interval but significantly prolonged III-V interval and greater III-V/I-III interval ratio. Compared with very preterm non-BPD controls, BPD survivors showed a significant shortening in waves III latency and I-III interval, moderate prolonged III-V interval, and significantly greater III-V/I-III interval ratio. These differences were generally similar at all click rates used. The slopes of latency- and interval-click rate functions in BPD survivors did not differ significantly from the two control groups., CONCLUSIONS: Brainstem neural conduction in BPD survivors differed from normal term and age-matched non-BPD infants; neural maturation is accelerated in caudal brainstem regions but delayed in rostral regions.

No major differences were found between normal term and very preterm non-BPD infants in brainstem auditory conduction.

Group 2: continuous infusion of rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 (0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/kg/day; n = 2) for 3 days in mechanically ventilated (MV) preterm lambs determined that 1.5 mg/kg/day dosage attained physiologic plasma IGF-1 concentration of ~125 ng/mL, which was infused in four more MV preterm lambs., RESULTS: Group 1: plasma IGF-1 protein increased from ~75 ng/mL at 128 days gestation to ~220 ng/L at 5 months.

RhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 was not toxic to the liver, kidneys, or lungs., CONCLUSIONS: Three days of continuous iv infusion of rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 at 1.5 mg/kg/day improved some pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes without toxicity., IMPACT: Preterm birth is associated with rapid decreases in serum or plasma IGF-1 protein level. This decline adversely impacts the growth and development of the lung and cardiovascular system. For this pilot study, continuous infusion of optimal dosage of rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 (1.5 mg/kg/day) to maintain physiologic plasma IGF-1 level of ~125 ng/mL during mechanical ventilation for 3 days statistically improved some structural and biochemical outcomes related to the alveolar formation that would favor improved gas exchange compared to vehicle-control.

However, the role and possible mechanism of P311 in hyperoxia-induced injury in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC II) need to be elucidated. In our study, rat AEC II (RLE-6TN) were exposure to normoxia (21% O2 and 5% CO2) or hyperoxia (95% O2 and 5% CO2) for 24 h, followed by determination of P311 expression. After knockdown of P311 and hyperoxic treatment, cell viability, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and the Smad3 signaling pathway were examined. Rat AEC II were pretreated with SIS3 HCl for 4 h and then subjected to P311 overexpression plasmid transfection and hyperoxic exposure. Then, cell viability, apoptosis and the Smad3 signaling pathway were determined. The results showed that hyperoxic exposure significantly elevated P311 levels in rat AEC II. P311 knockdown increased cell viability, accelerated cell cycle progression and inhibited apoptosis, as well as suppression of the Smad3 signaling pathway in hyperoxia-exposed AEC II. Additionally, we found that P311 overexpression enhanced the effects of hyperoxia. Interestingly, SIS3 HCl incubation blocked the effects of P311 overexpression on rat AEC II function under hyperoxic condition, as evidenced by an increase in cell viability, and suppressions of apoptosis and the Smad3 signaling pathway. These results indicate that P311 knockdown may ameliorate hyperoxia-induced injury by inhibiting the Smad3 signaling pathway in rat AEC II. P311 may be a novel target for the treatment of hyperoxia-induced lung injury and even bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Copyright © 2022.

In experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH), pulmonary expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, and plasma 5-HT are increased. 5-HT blockade increases pulmonary blood flow and prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH in neonatal models of PH with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesized that neonatal tph1 knock-out (KO) mice would be protected from hypoxia-induced alveolar simplification, decreased vessel density, and PH. Newborn wild-type (WT) and tph1 KO mice were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 2 weeks. Normoxic WT and KO mice exhibited similar alveolar development, pulmonary vascular density, right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSPs), and right heart size. Circulating (plasma and platelet) 5-HT decreased in both hypoxia-exposed WT and KO mice. Tph1 KO mice were not protected from hypoxia-induced alveolar simplification, decreased pulmonary vascular density, or right ventricular hypertrophy, but displayed attenuation to hypoxia-induced RVSP elevation compared with WT mice. Tph1 KO neonatal mice are not protected against hypoxia-induced alveolar simplification, reduction in pulmonary vessel density, or RVH. While genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of tph1 has protective effects in adult models of PH, our results suggest that tph1 inhibition would not be beneficial in neonates with PH associated with BPD.

Subsequent vascular disease and its progression into pulmonary arterial hypertension critically determines long-term outcome in the BPD infant but lacks identification of early, disease-defining changes., METHODS: We link impaired bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling to the earliest onset of vascular pathology in the human preterm lung and delineate the specific effects of the most prevalent prenatal and postnatal clinical risk factors for lung injury mimicking clinically relevant conditions in a multilayered animal model using wild-type and transgenic neonatal mice., RESULTS: We demonstrate (1) the significant reduction in BMP receptor 2 (BMPR2) expression at the onset of vascular pathology in the lung of preterm infants, later mirrored by reduced plasma BMP protein levels in infants with developing BPD, (2) the rapid impairment (and persistent change) of BMPR2 signalling on postnatal exposure to hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation, aggravated by prenatal cigarette smoke in a preclinical mouse model and (3) a link to defective alveolar septation and matrix remodelling through platelet derived growth factor-receptor alpha deficiency. In a treatment approach, we partially reversed vascular pathology by BMPR2-targeted treatment with FK506 in vitro and in vivo., CONCLUSION: We identified impaired BMP signalling as a hallmark of early vascular disease in the injured neonatal lung while outlining its promising potential as a future biomarker or therapeutic target in this growing, high-risk patient population.

Groups were compared using parametric tests; multinomial regression was used., RESULTS: 22.6% of 544 preterm-born (mean gestation: 31 weeks) and 9.2% of 195 term-born children, with satisfactory data available, were classified into one of four abnormal spirometry groups. Each phenotype was generally more prevalent in preterm-born children than in the term-born children. For the preterm group, POLD-reversible (4.4%) was associated with increased FENO, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and intrauterine growth restriction. POLD-fixed group (3.3%) did not have increased FENO but was associated with BPD. 41% of the pDysanapsis group (5.9%) had bronchodilator response, 31% had increased FENO and was associated with postnatal weight gain. In the pPRISm group (9%), 13% responded to bronchodilators, FENO was not increased and was non-significantly associated with body mass index (p=0.064)., CONCLUSIONS: Further to airway obstruction, we describe airway dysanapsis and pPRISm spirometry phenotypes in survivors of prematurity, both of which have poor outlook in other disease groups.

This study was conducted to test whether differences in endogenous MSC mitochondrial bioenergetics, proliferation and survival are associated with BPD risk in ELBW infants. Umbilical cord-derived MSCs of ELBW infants who later died or developed moderate/severe BPD had lower oxygen consumption and aconitase activity but higher extracellular acidification-indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidant stress-when compared to MSCs from infants who survived with no/mild BPD. Hyperoxia-exposed MSCs from infants who died or developed moderate/severe BPD also had lower PINK1 expression but higher TOM20 expression and numbers of mitochondria/cell, indicating that these cells had decreased mitophagy. Finally, these MSCs were also noted to proliferate at lower rates but undergo more apoptosis in cell cultures when compared to MSCs from infants who survived with no/mild BPD. These results indicate that mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction and mitophagy deficit induced by oxidant stress may lead to depletion of the endogenous MSC pool and subsequent disruption of lung development in ELBW infants at increased risk for BPD.

This study was aimed at identifying and analysing the risk factors associated with BPD using bioinformatic and mechanical analyses and establishing a predictive model to assess the risk of BPD in preterm infants., Methods: We identified differentially expressed RNAs via the intersection of miRNAs between datasets. Online analysis tools were used to predict genes targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and to generate and visualise competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) coexpression networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were subsequently performed on the DEmiRNAs. In addition, an intersection analysis was performed on mRNA and neuropeptide-related genes in the ceRNA network. DEmiRNAs associated with BPD and those involved in ceRNA networks were used to establish a diagnostic prediction model. The GSE108604 dataset was used as a validation set to verify the model., Results: A total of 26 DEmiRNAs were identified from the tracheal aspirates (TAs) of patients with BPD and healthy controls. In addition, a total of 1076 DEmRNAs were obtained from the GSE8586 dataset. Functional enrichment analysis of DEmRNAs revealed an abnormal reduction in mitochondrial-related activity and cellular responses to oxidative stress in patients with BPD. The neuropeptide-related genes OPRL1 and NPPA were found to be upregulated in BPD samples. Eventually, hsa-miR-1258, hsa-miR-298, hsa-miR-483-3p, and hsa-miR-769-5p were screened out and used to establish the prediction model.

There is extensive evidence that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of these illnesses. Two decades of clinical use in paediatric and adult medicine have established an excellent safety and efficacy record for IL-1 blockade with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, medication name anakinra). Building on robust pre-clinical evidence, the Anakinra Pilot trial aims to demonstrate safety and feasibility of administering anakinra to preterm infants, and to establish pharmacokinetics in this population. Its ultimate goal is to facilitate large studies that will test whether anakinra can ameliorate early-life inflammation, thus alleviating multiple complications of prematurity., Methods and analysis: Anakinra Pilot is an investigator-initiated, single arm, safety and feasibility dose-escalation trial in extremely preterm infants born between 24 weeks 0 days (240) and 276 weeks of gestational age (GA). Enrolled infants will receive anakinra intravenously over the first 21 days after birth, starting in the first 24 h after birth. In the first phase, dosing is 1 mg/kg every 48 h, and dosage will increase to 1.5 mg/kg every 24 h in the second phase. Initial anakinra dosing was determined through population pharmacokinetic model simulations. During the study, there will be a interim analysis to confirm predictions before undertaking dose assessment. Anakinra therapy will be considered safe if the frequency of adverse outcomes/events does not exceed that expected in infants born at 240-276 weeks GA., Clinical Trial Registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT05280340.

A mouse model of BPD and two in vitro models of BPD using A549 cells and type II alveolar epithelial (ATII) cells were established by exposure to hyperoxia. We found that LTBR and CREB1 exhibited a significant upregulation in lungs of mouse model of BPD. LTBR and CREB1 expression were also increased by hyperoxia in A549 and ATII cells. According to results of cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, silencing of LTBR rescued the suppressive effect of hyperoxia on cell viability and its promotive effect on cell apoptosis of A549 and ATII cells. Bioinformatics revealed CREB1 as a transcriptional factor for LTBR, and the luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay subsequently confirmed it. The NF-kappaB pathway was regulated by LTBR. CREB1 induced LTBR expression at the transcriptional level to regulate NF-kappaB pathway and further modulate A549 and ATII cells viability and apoptosis.

Despite the advances in perinatal care, BPD remains a major clinical and costly complication in premature infants. The pathogenesis of BPD is complex and multifactorial. Prematurity, mechanical ventilation, oxidative stress, and inflammation are recognized as major interrelated contributing factors. Recently, some candidate genes involved in angiogenesis and alveolarization regulating mechanisms have been associated to BPD risk development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms on BPD onset in VLBW newborns., Methods: Eighty-two VLBW infants, without major anomalies, were consecutively enrolled: 33 developed BPD (BPD group) and 49 infants without BPD served as controls (control group). In all infants, two polymorphisms, respectively (VEGF receptor) VEGFR1-710 C/T and VEGF +936 C/T, were determined through salivary brush. Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from saliva samples by using the MasterAmp Buccal Swab DNA Extraction Kit (Tebu-bio, Milan, Italy)., Results: Significant statistic differences were found between BPD newborns and controls with regard to gestational age, birth weight, mechanical ventilation, duration of oxygen therapy, maternal preeclampsia, and chorioamnionitis. No differences were detected between genotypic and allelic levels regarding VEGFR1 and VEGF molecular polymorphisms., Conclusions: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms within VEGF and VEGFR1 genes are not associated with BPD. Further researches are needed to reveal gene polymorphisms involved in vascular development as contributors to the onset of BPD.

Accumulating evidence supports the vascular hypothesis of BPD, in which lung endothelial cell dysfunction drives this disease. We recently reported that endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) is reduced by hyperoxia, and that endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice are more susceptible to developing hyperoxia-induced injury than wild type mice. Whether Cpt1a upregulation attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and lung injury remains unknown. We hypothesized that upregulation of Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and persistent lung injury., METHODS: Lung endothelial cells or newborn mice (< 12 h old) were treated with baicalin or L-carnitine after hyperoxia (50% and 95% O2) followed by air recovery., RESULTS: We found that incubation with L-carnitine (40 and 80 mg/L) and baicalin (22.5 and 45 mg/L) reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis, impaired cell migration and angiogenesis in cultured lung endothelial cells. This was associated with increased Cpt1a gene expression. In mice, neonatal hyperoxia caused persistent alveolar and vascular simplification in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with L-carnitine (150 and 300 mg/kg) and baicalin (50 and 100 mg/kg) attenuated neonatal hyperoxia-induced alveolar and vascular simplification in adult mice. These effects were diminished in endothelial cell-specific Cpt1a knockout mice., CONCLUSIONS: Upregulating Cpt1a by baicalin or L-carnitine ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung endothelial cell dysfunction, and persistent alveolar and vascular simplification. These findings provide potential therapeutic avenues for using L-carnitine and baicalin as Cpt1a upregulators to prevent persistent lung injury in premature infants with BPD. Copyright © 2022.

Disorders of lung development can present with secondary PH, which is a leading cause of mortality in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor 1) is a collagen-binding receptor that regulates tissue fibrosis and inflammation and controls cellular growth and migration. However, the roles of DDR1 in lung development or the pathogenesis of PH are unknown. Studying mice with a DDR1 deletion (Ddr1-/-), we have noted 35% mortality between 1 and 4 months of age, and we demonstrate that DDR1 deficiency results in reduced right ventricular contractility and muscularization of distal pulmonary arteries, consistent with PH. Pathology analysis revealed enlarged alveolar spaces in Ddr1-/- mice by Postnatal Day 7, consistent with impaired alveolar development. Gene expression analysis showed that Ddr1-/- mice have reduced concentrations of alveologenesis factors and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Mechanistic studies in vitro confirmed that DDR1 mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, and growth of alveolar epithelial cells. Taken together, these data suggest that DDR1 plays important roles mediating alveolarization during lung development. Our studies also describe a new model of spontaneous PH and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in mice.","group":"g1","id":"26127522-a27c-4d4e-b4fa-e58b64fc9e98","_showDetails":false},"32474c30-d85c-423e-8e6d-2aeb7c8118c0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"Neurodevelopmental outcome of Italian preterm ELBW infants: an eleven years single center cohort.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13052-022-01303-9","authors":["Caporali, Camilla","Longo, Stefania","Tritto, Giovanna","Perotti, Gianfranco","Pisoni, Camilla","Naboni, Cecilia","Gardella, Barbara","Spinillo, Arsenio","Manzoni, Federica","Ghirardello, Stefano","Borgatti, Renato","Orcesi, Simona","Olivieri I","La Piana R","Tonduti D","Decio A","Ravelli C","Olivotto S","Ariaudo G","Spairani S","Figar T","ELBWI Neurodevelopmental Follow-up Study Group"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20220719//","keywords":["Birth Weight","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Cerebral Palsy/ep [Epidemiology]","*Cerebral Palsy","Humans","Infant","Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Language"],"journal":"Italian journal of pediatrics","volume":"48","number":"1","isbn":"1720-8424","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med22&NEWS=N&AN=35854369"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Preterm extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWi) are known to be at greater risk of developing neuropsychiatric diseases. Identifying early predictors of outcome is essential to refer patients for early intervention. Few studies have investigated neurodevelopmental outcomes in Italian ELBWi. This study aims to describe neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months of corrected age in an eleven-year single-center cohort of Italian ELBWi and to identify early risk factors for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes., METHODS: All infants born with birth weight < 1000 g and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the \"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo\" hospital in Pavia, Italy, from Jan 1, 2005 to Dec 31, 2015 were eligible for inclusion. At 24 months, Griffiths' Mental Developmental Scales Extended Revised (GMDS-ER) were administered. Neurodevelopmental outcome was classified as: normal, minor sequelae (minor neurological signs, General Quotient between 76 and 87), major sequelae (cerebral palsy; General Quotient <= 75; severe sensory impairment). Univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regression models were performed to analyze the correlation between neonatal variables and neurodevelopmental outcome., RESULTS: 176 ELBWi were enrolled (mean gestational age 26.52 weeks sd2.23; mean birthweight 777.45 g sd142.89). 67% showed a normal outcome at 24 months, 17% minor sequelae and 16% major sequelae (4.6% cerebral palsy on overall sample). The most frequent major sequela was cognitive impairment (8.52%). In the entire sample the median score on the Hearing-Speech subscale was lower than the median scores recorded on the other subscales and showed a significantly weaker correlation to each of the other subscales of the GMDS-ER. Severely abnormal cUS findings (RRR 10.22 p 0.043) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (RRR 4.36 p 0.008) were independent risk factors for major sequelae and bronchopulmonary dysplasia for minor sequelae (RRR 3.00 p 0.018) on multivariate multinomial logistic regression., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an improvement in ELBWI survival rate without neurodevelopmental impairment at 24 months compared to previously reported international cohorts. Cognitive impairment was the most frequent major sequela. Median scores on GMDS-ER showed a peculiar developmental profile characterized by a selective deficit in the language domain. Severely abnormal cUS findings and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were confirmed as independent risk factors for major sequelae. Copyright © 2022.

Exosomes are abundant in breast milk, but the function of HBM-derived exosomes (HBM-Exo) in BPD is still unclear. This study was to investigate the role and mechanism of HBM-Exo in BPD. Overall lung tissue photography and H&E staining showed that HBM-Exo improved the lung tissue structure collapse, alveolar structure disorder, alveolar septum width, alveolar number reduction and other injuries caused by high oxygen exposure. Immunohistochemical results showed that HBM-Exo improved the inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis caused by hyperoxia. qPCR and Western blot results also showed that HBM-Exo improved the expression of Type II alveolar epithelium (AT II) surface marker SPC. In vivo study, CCK8 and flow cytometry showed that HBM-Exo improved the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of AT II cells induced by hyperoxia, qPCR and immunofluorescence also showed that HBM-Exo improved the down-regulation of SPC. Further RNA-Seq results in AT II cells showed that a total of 88 genes were significantly different between the hyperoxia and HBM-Exo with hyperoxia groups, including 24 up-regulated genes and 64 down-regulated genes. KEGG pathway analysis showed the enrichment of IL-17 signalling pathway was the most significant. Further rescue experiments showed that HBM-Exo improved AT II cell damage induced by hyperoxia through inhibiting downstream of IL-17 signalling pathway (FADD), which may be an important mechanism of HBM-Exo in the prevention and treatment of BPD. This study may provide new approach in the treatment of BPD. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Histologically, BPD is characterized by larger and fewer alveoli. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) may be protective in the context of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, but the cell-specific effects of HIF expression in neonatal lung injury remain unknown. Thus, we sought to determine whether HIF stabilization in SM22alpha-expressing cells can limit hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. We generated SM22alpha-specific HIF-1alpha-stabilized mice (SM22alpha-PHD1/2-/- mice) by cross-breeding SM22alpha-promotor-driven Cre recombinase mice with prolyl hydroxylase PHD1flox/flox and PHD2flox/flox mice. Neonatal mice were randomized to 21% O2 (normoxia) or 80% O2 (hyperoxia) exposure for 14 days. For the hyperoxia recovery studies, neonatal mice were recovered from normoxia for an additional 10 wk. SM22alpha-specific HIF-1alpha stabilization mitigated hyperoxia-induced lung injury and preserved microvessel density compared with control mice for both neonates and adults. In SM22alpha-PHD1/2-/- mice, pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) were more proliferative and pulmonary arteries expressed more collagen IV compared with control mice, even under hyperoxic conditions. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) mRNA expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) was greater in SM22alpha-PHD1/2-/- compared with control mice in both normoxia and hyperoxia. Pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) cocultured with PASMC isolated from SM22alpha-PHD1/2-/- mice formed more tubes and branches with greater tube length compared with PEC cocultured with PASMC isolated from SM22alpha-PHD1/2+/+ mice. Addition of Ang2 recombinant protein further augmented tube formation for both PHD1/2+/+ and PHD1/2-/- PASMC. Cell-specific deletion of PHD1 and 2 selectively increases HIF-1alpha expression in SM22alpha-expressing cells and protects neonatal lung development despite prolonged hyperoxia exposure. HIF stabilization in SM22alpha-expressing cells preserved endothelial cell proliferation, microvascular density, increased angiopoietin-2 expression, and lung structure, suggesting a role for cell-specific HIF-1alpha stabilization to prevent neonatal lung
