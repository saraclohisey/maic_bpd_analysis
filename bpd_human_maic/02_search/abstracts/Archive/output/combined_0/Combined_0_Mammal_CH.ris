AB  - Myeloid cells are key factors in the progression of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis. Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) mediates myeloid cell trafficking. The origin and physiological mechanism by which EMAP II affects pathogenesis in BPD is unknown. The objective was to determine the functional consequences of elevated EMAP II levels in the pathogenesis of murine BPD and to investigate EMAP II neutralization as a therapeutic strategy. Three neonatal mouse models were used: (1) BPD (hyperoxia), (2) EMAP II delivery, and (3) BPD with neutralizing EMAP II antibody treatments. Chemokinic function of EMAP II and its neutralization were assessed by migration in vitro and in vivo. We determined the location of EMAP II by immunohistochemistry, pulmonary proinflammatory and chemotactic gene expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, lung outcome by pulmonary function testing and histological analysis, and right ventricular hypertrophy by Fulton's Index. In BPD, EMAP II initially is a bronchial club-cell-specific protein-derived factor that later is expressed in galectin-3+ macrophages as BPD progresses. Continuous elevated expression corroborates with baboon and human BPD. Prolonged elevation of EMAP II levels recruits galectin-3+ macrophages, which is followed by an inflammatory state that resembles a severe BPD phenotype characterized by decreased pulmonary compliance, arrested alveolar development, and signs of pulmonary hypertension. In vivo pharmacological EMAP II inhibition suppressed proinflammatory genes Tnfa, Il6, and Il1b and chemotactic genes Ccl2 and Ccl9 and reversed the severe BPD phenotype. EMAP II is sufficient to induce macrophage recruitment, worsens BPD progression, and represents a targetable mechanism of BPD development.

AB  - Background: Intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI) is associated with increased risk of preterm birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the mechanisms by which IAI leads to preterm birth and BPD are poorly understood, and there are no effective therapies for preterm birth and BPD. The transcription factor c-Myc regulates various biological processes like cell growth, apoptosis, and inflammation. We hypothesized that c-Myc modulates inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface, and neonatal lung remodeling. The objectives of our study were 1) to determine the kinetics of c-Myc in the placenta, fetal membranes and neonatal lungs exposed to IAI, and 2) to determine the role of c-Myc in modulating inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface, and neonatal lung remodeling induced by IAI. Methods: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: 1) Intra-amniotic saline injections only (control), 2) Intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections only, and 3) Intra-amniotic LPS injections with c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4. c-Myc expression, markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, immunohistochemistry, and transcriptomic analyses were performed on placenta and fetal membranes, and neonatal lungs to determine kinetics of c-Myc expression in response to IAI, and effects of prenatal systemic c-Myc inhibition on lung remodeling at postnatal day 14. Results: c-Myc was upregulated in the placenta, fetal membranes, and neonatal lungs exposed to IAI. IAI caused neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in the placenta and fetal membranes, and neonatal lung remodeling with pulmonary hypertension consistent with a BPD phenotype. Prenatal inhibition of c-Myc with 10058-F4 in IAI decreased neutrophil infiltration and NET formation, and improved neonatal lung remodeling induced by LPS, with improved alveolarization, increased angiogenesis, and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling. Discussion: In a rat model of IAI, c-Myc regulates neutrophil recruitment and NET formation in the placenta and fetal membranes. c-Myc also participates in neonatal lung remodeling induced by IAI. Further studies are needed to investigate c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for IAI and IAI-associated BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease commonly seen in preterm infants. It is characterized by delayed development of the alveoli and lung fibrosis. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is an inflammatory driver that plays a proinflammatory role mainly through the P38 MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway., METHODS: Newborn rat pups were kept under air or oxygen at >60% concentration. Lung tissues were collected at postnatal days (P) 1, 4, 7, and 10 to observe pathological changes and take measurements., RESULTS: In the hyperoxic group, P4 and P7 rats showed delayed alveolar development, septal thickening, and disturbances in alveolar structure.PAR2, P38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, and IL-18 expression at P4, P7, and P10 was significantly higher than in the air group., CONCLUSION: PAR2 is involved in lung injury induced by persistent hyperoxia. Activated PAR2 promotes IL-18 overexpression through the P38 MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, which may be an important mechanism of PAR2-mediated lung injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common devastating pulmonary complication in preterm infants. Supplemental oxygen is a lifesaving therapeutic measure used for premature infants with pulmonary insufficiency. However, oxygen toxicity is a significant trigger for BPD. Oxidative stress disrupts lung development, accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression and immune cells infiltration in lung tissue. Licorice, a typical traditional herbal medicine, is commonly used in the medicine and food industries. 18beta-Glycyrrhetinic acid (18beta-GA), a primary active ingredient of licorice, has powerful anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to determine whether 18beta-GA has a protective effect on neonatal rats with hyperoxia exposure. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were kept in either 21% (normoxia) or 80% O2 (hyperoxia) continuously from postnatal day (PN) 1 to 14. 18beta-GA was injected intragastrically at 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight once a day from PN 1 to 14. We examined the body weight and alveolar development and measured ROS level and the markers of pulmonary inflammation. Mature-IL-1beta and NF-kappaB pathway proteins, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, were assessed; concurrently, caspase-1 activity was measured. Our results indicated that hyperoxia resulted in alveolar simplification and decreased bodyweight of neonatal rats. Hyperoxia increased ROS level and pulmonary inflammation and activated NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome. 18beta-GA treatment inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome, decreased ROS level and pulmonary inflammation, improved alveolar development, and increased the bodyweight of neonatal rats with hyperoxia exposure. Our study demonstrates that 18beta-GA has a protective effect on neonatal rats with hyperoxia exposure. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - Metformin has potential anti-inflammatory properties and accelerates wound healing by enhancing vascular development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on pulmonary vascular development and the underlying mechanism. Newborn mice were subcutaneously injected with metformin from day 2 after exposure to hyperoxia. Pulmonary vascular development, inflammation, and Shh signaling pathway-related protein expression were evaluated by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. M2 macrophage polarization was measured by flow cytometry. The effect of metformin on macrophage polarization was determined using RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to 90% oxygen in vitro. The role of metformin and purmorphamine on M1 and M2 polarization was observed by flow cytometry. M2 polarization of pulmonary macrophages was inhibited after hyperoxic exposure, and metformin increased the number of M2 macrophages in the lung on postnatal day 14. Metformin upregulated CD31 expression and suppressed inflammation in the lung of mice exposed to hyperoxia on postnatal days 7 and 14. Metformin downregulated the Gli1 expression in macrophages in the lung after exposure to hyperoxia on postnatal day 14. In vitro studies showed that metformin inhibited the Gli1 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to 90% oxygen, which was reversed after purmorphamine pretreatment. Exposure to 90% oxygen inhibited the polarization of M2 macrophages, whereas metformin increased the number of M2 macrophages. Purmorphamine reversed the effects of metformin on M2 polarization and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulation in RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to hyperoxia. In conclusion, metformin regulates macrophage polarization via the Shh signaling pathway to improve pulmonary vascular development in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease characterized by interrupted alveologenesis and alveolar simplification caused by oxygen therapy in premature infants. Metabolic dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of BPD. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is significantly increased in specific lung tissues in patients with BPD. Therefore, we investigated whether BMS309403, an FABP4 inhibitor that can mitigate tissue fibrosis, can regulate pulmonary fibrotic processes in newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia. Newborn rat pups were exposed to room air (RA; 21% O2 ) or 85% O2 from 5 to 14 days of age and were then allowed to recover in RA until 29 days of age. They received intraperitoneal injection with placebo (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) or BMS 309403 (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg kg-1 d-1 ) every other day from 4 to 14 days of age then were divided into O2 plus PBS or low dose or high dose and RA plus PBS or low dose or high dose groups. We assessed lung histology and evaluated lung collagen I, FABP4 as well as TGF-beta1 expression at 14 and 29 days of age. In the hyperoxia injury-recovery model, prophylactic BMS309403 treatment reduced mean linear intercept values and FABP4 expression (p < 0.001). Prophylactic BMS309403 treatment mitigated pulmonary fibrosis and TGF-beta1 expression immediately after hyperoxia exposure (p < 0.05). The attenuation of hyperoxia-induced alveolar developmental impairment and pulmonary fibrosis by FABP4 inhibition indicated that such inhibition has potential clinical and therapeutic applications.

AB  - RATIONALE: Premature infants exposed to oxygen are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterised by lung growth arrest. Inflammation is important, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated inflammatory pathways and therapeutic targets in severe clinical and experimental BPD., METHODS AND RESULTS: First, transcriptomic analysis with in silico cellular deconvolution identified a lung-intrinsic M1-like-driven cytokine pattern in newborn mice after hyperoxia. These findings were confirmed by gene expression of macrophage-regulating chemokines (Ccl2, Ccl7, Cxcl5) and markers (Il6, Il17A, Mmp12). Secondly, hyperoxia-activated interleukin 6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling was measured in vivo and related to loss of alveolar epithelial type II cells (ATII) as well as increased mesenchymal marker. Il6 null mice exhibited preserved ATII survival, reduced myofibroblasts and improved elastic fibre assembly, thus enabling lung growth and protecting lung function. Pharmacological inhibition of global IL-6 signalling and IL-6 trans-signalling promoted alveolarisation and ATII survival after hyperoxia. Third, hyperoxia triggered M1-like polarisation, possibly via Kruppel-like factor 4; hyperoxia-conditioned medium of macrophages and IL-6-impaired ATII proliferation. Finally, clinical data demonstrated elevated macrophage-related plasma cytokines as potential biomarkers that identify infants receiving oxygen at increased risk of developing BPD. Moreover, macrophage-derived IL6 and active STAT3 were related to loss of epithelial cells in BPD lungs., CONCLUSION: We present a novel IL-6-mediated mechanism by which hyperoxia activates macrophages in immature lungs, impairs ATII homeostasis and disrupts elastic fibre formation, thereby inhibiting lung growth. The data provide evidence that IL-6 trans-signalling could offer an innovative pharmacological target to enable lung growth in severe neonatal chronic lung disease. Copyright ©The authors 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common respiratory disease of preterm infants. Lower circulatory/intrapulmonary levels of the adipokine, adiponectin (APN), occur in premature and small-for-gestational-age infants and at saccular/alveolar stages of lung development in the newborn rat. However, the role of low intrapulmonary APN during hyperoxia exposure in developing lungs is unknown., METHODS: We test the hypothesis that treatment of hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice with recombinant APN protein attenuates the BPD phenotype characterized by inflammation, impaired alveolarization, and dysregulated vascularization. We used developmentally appropriate in vitro and in vivo BPD modeling systems as well as human lung tissue., RESULTS: We observed reduced levels of intrapulmonary APN in experimental BPD mice and human BPD lungs. APN-deficient (APN-/-) newborn mice exposed to moderate (60% O2) hyperoxia showed a worse BPD pulmonary phenotype (inflammation, enhanced endothelial dysfunction, impaired pulmonary vasculature, and alveolar simplification) as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment of hyperoxia-exposed newborn WT mice with recombinant APN protein attenuated the BPD phenotype (diminished inflammation, decreased pulmonary vascular injury, and improved pulmonary alveolarization) and improved pulmonary function tests., CONCLUSIONS: Low intrapulmonary APN is associated with disruption of lung development during hyperoxia exposure, while recombinant APN protein attenuates the BPD pulmonary phenotype., IMPACT: Intrapulmonary APN levels were significantly decreased in lungs of experimental BPD mice and human BPD lung tissue at various stages of BPD development. Correlative data from human lung samples with decreased APN levels were associated with increased lung adhesion markers (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin). Decreased APN levels were associated with endothelial dysfunction and moderate BPD phenotype in APN-deficient, as compared to WT, experimental BPD mice. WT experimental BPD mice treated with recombinant APN protein had an improved pulmonary structural and functional phenotype. Exogenous APN may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent BPD. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in premature infants, characterized by alveolar dysplasia and pulmonary microvascular remodeling. In the present study, we have investigated the functional roles of ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) in BPD, and its relationship with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) mediated type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII) apoptosis., METHODS: A hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model was constructed and the pathologic changes of lung tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cell apoptosis and protein expression were determined by TUNEL assay and Western blotting, respectively. Further reagent kit with specific fluorescent substrate was utilized to measure the activity of 20 s proteasome. Meanwhile, AECII were cultured in vitro and exposed to hyperoxia. AECII apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. In contrast, MG132 treatment was induced to explore UPP during hyperoxia exposure on AECII apoptosis and ERS sensors expression., RESULTS: A significant increase in apoptosis and total ubiquitinated proteins expression were observed in BPD rats and AECII culture, and the change of UPP was associated with ERS. In order to confirm the role of UPP in AECII apoptosis of BPD, AECII cells were treated by MG132 with the concentration of 10 mumol/L under hyperoxia exposure. We found that the proteins expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP-78), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), as well as AECII apoptosis were increased following MG132 treatment. Furthermore, the relatively up-regulated in the levels of total ubiquitinated proteins expression and 20 s proteasome activity were correlated with increased ERS sensors expression., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that UPP may participate in the ERS-induced AECII apoptosis under hyperoxia condition.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown as an effective medicinal means to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The widely used MSCs were from Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs). Amniotic fluid MSCs (AF-MSCs) may be produced before an individual is born to treat foetal diseases by autoplastic transplantation. We evaluated intratracheal (IT) MSCs as an approach to treat an hyperoxia-induced BPD animal model and compared the therapeutic effects between AF-, UC- and BM-MSCs. A BPD animal model was generated by exposing newborn rats to 95% O2 . The continued stress lasted 21 days, and the treatment of IT MSCs was conducted for 4 days. The therapeutic effects were analysed, including lung histology, level of inflammatory cytokines, cell death ratio and state of angiogenesis, by sacrificing the experimental animal at day 21. The lasting hyperoxia stress induced BPD similar to the biological phenotype. The treatment of IT MSCs was safe without deaths and normal organ histopathology. Specifically, the treatment was effective by inhibiting the alveolar dilatation, reducing inflammatory cytokines, inducing angiogenesis and lowering the cell death ratio. AF-MSCs had better therapeutic effects compared with UC-MSCs in relieving the pulmonary alveoli histological changes and promoting neovascularization, and UC-MSCs had the best immunosuppressive effect in plasma and lung lysis compared with AF-MSCs and BM-MSCs. This study demonstrated the therapeutic effects of AF-, UC- and BM-MSCs in BPD model. Superior treatment effect was provided by antenatal MSCs compared to BM-MSC in a statistical comparison.

AB  - Treating premature infants with high oxygen is a routine intervention in the context of neonatal intensive care. Unfortunately, the increase in survival rates is associated with various detrimental sequalae of hyperoxia exposure, most notably bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease of disrupted lung development. The effects of high oxygen exposure on other developing organs of the infant, as well as the possible impact such disrupted development may have on later life remain poorly understood. Using a neonatal mouse model to investigate the effects of hyperoxia on the immature immune system we observed a dramatic involution of the thymic medulla, and this lesion was associated with disrupted FoxP3+ regulatory T cell generation and T cell autoreactivity. Significantly, administration of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MEx) restored thymic medullary architecture and physiological thymocyte profiles. Using single cell transcriptomics, we further demonstrated preferential impact of MEx treatment on the thymic medullary antigen presentation axis, as evidenced by enrichment of antigen presentation and antioxidative-stress related genes in dendritic cells (DCs) and medullary epithelial cells (mTECs). Our study demonstrates that MEx treatment represents a promising restorative therapeutic approach for oxygen-induced thymic injury, thus promoting normal development of both central tolerance and adaptive immunity.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced lung injury plays a key role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by inflammatory injury and impaired lung development in preterm infants. Although BPD is a predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, currently it is uncertain how lung injury contributes to brain injury in preterm infants. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures that regulate intercellular and inter-organ communications. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) has emerged as a key executor of inflammasome-mediated cell death and inflammation. In this study, we utilized a neonatal rat model of BPD to assess if hyperoxia stimulates lung release of circulating EVs and if these EVs induce lung and brain injury. We found that hyperoxia-exposed rats had elevated numbers of plasma-derived EVs compared to rats maintained in room air. These EVs also had increased cargos of surfactant protein C, a marker of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), and the active (p30) form of GSDMD. When these EVs were adoptively transferred into normal newborn rats via intravenous injection, they were taken up both by lung and brain tissues. Moreover, EVs from hyperoxic animals induced not only the pathological hallmarks of BPD, but also brain inflammatory injury in recipient rats, as well as inducing cell death in cultured pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and neural stem cells (NSC). Similarly, hyperoxia-exposed cultured AEC-like cells released EVs that also contained increased GSDMD-p30 and these EVs induced pyroptotic cell death in NSC. Overall, these data indicate that hyperoxia-activated circulating EVs mediate a lung to brain crosstalk resulting in brain injury and suggest a mechanism that links lung injury and neurodevelopmental impairment in BPD infants.

AB  - The proliferation of fetal alveolar type II cells (FATIICs) was impaired in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is modulated by hyperoxia and inflammatory response. Interleukin 24 (IL-24), a cytokine produced by certain cell types, plays an essential role in inflammation and host protection against infection. However, the ability of FATIICs to produce IL-24 remains unclear, and the role of IL-24 in BPD progression is yet to be determined. With reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the authors evaluated whether FATIICs produce IL-24 in physiological conditions. The authors quantified IL-24 expression in the lungs of newborn rat pups exposed to hyperoxia (70% oxygen) and in FATIICs isolated on embryonic day 19 that were exposed to 95% oxygen or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The role of IL-24 in FATIICs, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle were further evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and flow cytometric analysis. Also, they assessed caspase-3 and SOCS3 mRNA in IL-24 siRNA-treated cells by using RT-qPCR. During culture, IL-24 mRNA and protein levels in FATIICs gradually decreased with FATIIC differentiation. IL-24 expression increased significantly in rat lungs exposed to hyperoxia and FATIICs exposed to oxygen or LPS. Recombinant IL-24 enhanced cell proliferation by decreasing the proportion of apoptotic cells and increasing the proportion of cells in the S phase. The IL-24 siRNA-treated cells expressed more caspase-3 mRNA. Furthermore, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) mRNA was significantly decreased in rats and FATIICs exposed to oxygen, whereas it dramatically increased in FATIICs exposed to LPS. The IL-24 siRNA-treated cells expressed more SOCS3 mRNA. These studies suggest IL-24 is a pulmonary target cytokine in BPD, and may possibly regulate SOCS3 in oxidative stress and inflammation of the lung.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most prevalent chronic paediatric lung disease and is linked to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. MicroRNA-based regulation of type II alveolar epithelial cell (T2AEC) proliferation and apoptosis is an important factor in the pathogenesis of BPD and warrants further investigation., EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Two murine models of hyperoxic lung injury (with or without miR-342-5p or Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 3 [Spred3] modulation) were employed: a hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury model (100% O2 on postnatal days 1-7) and the BPD model (100% O2 on postnatal days 1-4, followed by room air for 10 days). Tracheal aspirate pellets from healthy control and moderate/severe BPD neonates were randomly selected for clinical miR-342-5p analysis., KEY RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased miR-342-5p levels in primary T2AECs, MLE12 cells and neonatal mouse lungs. Transgenic miR-342 overexpression in neonatal mice ameliorated survival rates and improved the BPD phenotype and BPD-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). T2AEC-specific miR-342 transgenic overexpression, as well as miR-342-5p mimic therapy, also ameliorated the BPD phenotype and associated PAH. miR-342-5p targets the 3'UTR of the Raf1 regulator Spred3, inhibiting Spred3 expression. Treatment with recombinant Spred3 exacerbated the BPD phenotype and associated PAH. Notably, miR-342-5p inhibition under room air conditions did not mimic the BPD phenotype. Moderate/severe BPD tracheal aspirate pellets exhibited decreased miR-342-5p levels relative to healthy control pellets., CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that miR-342-5p mimic therapy may show promise in the treatment or prevention of BPD.

AB  - We investigated the hypothesis that exposure of lungs at the saccular stage of development to hyperoxia leads to persistent growth arrest and dysfunction of 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key energy sensor in the cell. We exposed neonatal rat pups from postnatal day 1- day 10 (P1-P10) to >=90% oxygen or control normoxia. Pups were euthanized at P4 or P10 or recovered in normoxia until euthanasia at P21. Half of the pups in each group received AMPK activator, metformin, or saline intraperitoneally from P1 to P10. Lung histology, morphometric analysis, immunofluorescence, and immunoblots were done for changes in lung structure at P10 and P21 and AMPK function at P4, P10, and P21. Phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) was decreased in lungs at P10 and P21 in hyperoxia-exposed pups. Metformin increased the levels of p-AMPK and PGC-1alpha, a downstream AMPK target which regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, at P4, P10, and P21 in hyperoxia pups. Lung ATP levels decreased during hyperoxia and were increased by metformin at P10 and P21. Radial alveolar count and alveolar septal tips were decreased and mean linear intercept increased in hyperoxia-exposed pups at P10 and the changes persisted at P21; these were improved by metformin. Lung capillary number was decreased in hyperoxia-exposed pups at P10 and P21 and was restored by metformin. Hyperoxia leads to impaired AMPK function, energy balance and alveolar simplification. The AMPK activator, metformin improves AMPK function and alveolar and vascular growth in this rat pup model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common lung disease of premature infants. Hyperoxia exposure and microbial dysbiosis are contributors to BPD development. However, the mechanisms linking pulmonary microbial dysbiosis to worsening lung injury are unknown. Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a transcription factor that regulates oxidative stress responses and modulates hyperoxia-induced lung injury. We hypothesized that airway dysbiosis would attenuate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant function, resulting in a more severe phenotype of BPD. Here, we show that preterm infants with a Gammaproteobacteria-predominant dysbiosis have increased endotoxin in tracheal aspirates, and mice monocolonized with the representative Gammaproteobacteria Escherichia coli show increased tissue damage compared with germ-free (GF) control mice. Furthermore, we show Nrf2-deficient mice have worse lung structure and function after exposure to hyperoxia when the airway microbiome is augmented with E. coli. To confirm the disease-initiating potential of airway dysbiosis, we developed a novel humanized mouse model by colonizing GF mice with tracheal aspirates from human infants with or without severe BPD, producing gnotobiotic mice with BPD-associated and non-BPD-associated lung microbiomes. After hyperoxia exposure, BPD-associated mice demonstrated a more severe BPD phenotype and increased expression of Nrf2-regulated genes, compared with GF and non-BPD-associated mice. Furthermore, augmenting Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity by supporting colonization with Lactobacillus species improved dysbiotic-augmented lung injury. Our results demonstrate that a lack of protective pulmonary microbiome signature attenuates an Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, which is augmented by a respiratory probiotic blend. We anticipate antioxidant pathways will be major targets of future microbiome-based therapeutics for respiratory disease.

AB  - Sex-specific differences in the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are due to different susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury, but the mechanism is unclear. In this study, neonatal male and female mouse pups (C57BL/6J) were exposed to hyperoxia and lung tissues were excised on postnatal day 7 for histological analysis and tandem mass tags proteomic analysis. We found that the lung sections from the male mice following postnatal hyperoxia exposure had increased alveolar simplification, significant aberrant pulmonary vascularization and arrest in angiogenesis compared with females. Comparison of differentially expressed proteins revealed 377 proteins unique to female and 425 unique to male as well as 750 proteins in both male and female. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that several differentially expressed proteins could contribute to the differences in sex-specific susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury. Our results may help identify sex-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets of BPD. Copyright © The author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth implies an array of respiratory diseases including apnea of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Caffeine has been introduced to treat apneas but also appears to reduce rates of BPD. Oxygen is essential when treating preterm infants with respiratory problems but high oxygen exposure aggravates BPD. This experimental study is aimed at investigating the action of caffeine on inflammatory response and cell death in pulmonary tissue in a hyperoxia-based model of BPD in the newborn rat. Material/Methods. Lung injury was induced by hyperoxic exposure with 80% oxygen for three (P3) or five (P5) postnatal days with or without recovery in ambient air until postnatal day 15 (P15). Newborn Wistar rats were treated with PBS or caffeine (10 mg/kg) every two days beginning at the day of birth. The effects of caffeine on hyperoxic-induced pulmonary inflammatory response were examined at P3 and P5 immediately after oxygen exposure or after recovery in ambient air (P15) by immunohistological staining and analysis of lung homogenates by ELISA and qPCR., RESULTS: Treatment with caffeine significantly attenuated changes in hyperoxia-induced cell death and apoptosis-associated factors. There was a significant decrease in proinflammatory mediators and redox-sensitive transcription factor NFkappaB in the hyperoxia-exposed lung tissue of the caffeine-treated group compared to the nontreated group. Moreover, treatment with caffeine under hyperoxia modulated the transcription of the adenosine receptor (Adora)1. Caffeine induced pulmonary chemokine and cytokine transcription followed by immune cell infiltration of alveolar macrophages as well as increased adenosine receptor (Adora1, 2a, and 2b) expression., CONCLUSIONS: The present study investigating the impact of caffeine on the inflammatory response, pulmonary cell degeneration and modulation of adenosine receptor expression, provides further evidence that caffeine acts as an antioxidative and anti-inflammatory drug for experimental oxygen-mediated lung injury. Experimental studies may broaden the understanding of therapeutic use of caffeine in modulating detrimental mechanisms involved in BPD development. Copyright © 2020 Stefanie Endesfelder et al.

AB  - Systemic sepsis is a known risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants, a disease characterized by dysregulated angiogenesis and impaired vascular and alveolar development. We have previoulsy reported that systemic endotoxin dysregulates pulmonary angiogenesis resulting in alveolar simplification mimicking BPD in neonatal mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We undertook an unbiased discovery approach to identify novel signaling pathways programming sepsis-induced deviant lung angiogenesis. Pulmonary endothelial cells (EC) were isolated for RNA-Seq from newborn C57BL/6 mice treated with intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic systemic sepsis. LPS significantly differentially-regulated 269 genes after 6 h, and 1,934 genes after 24 h. Using bioinformatics, we linked 6 h genes previously unknown to be modulated by LPS to 24 h genes known to regulate angiogenesis/vasculogenesis to identify pathways programming deviant angiogenesis. An immortalized primary human lung EC (HPMEC-im) line was generated by SV40 transduction to facilitate mechanistic studies. RT-PCR and transcription factor binding analysis identified FOSL1 (FOS like 1) as a transcriptional regulator of LPS-induced downstream angiogenic or vasculogenic genes. Over-expression and silencing studies of FOSL1 in immortalized and primary HPMEC demonstrated that baseline and LPS-induced expression of ADAM8, CXCR2, HPX, LRG1, PROK2, and RNF213 was regulated by FOSL1. FOSL1 silencing impaired LPS-induced in vitro HPMEC angiogenesis. In conclusion, we identified FOSL1 as a novel regulator of sepsis-induced deviant angiogenic signaling in mouse lung EC and human fetal HPMEC.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a devastating lung condition that develops in premature newborns exposed to prolonged mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with this costly disease and effective therapies are limited. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can repair injured tissue by secreting paracrine factors known to restore the function and integrity of injured lung epithelium and endothelium. Most preclinical studies showing therapeutic efficacy of MSCs for BPD are administered either intratracheally or intravenously. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of human cord tissue-derived MSC administration given via the intranasal route. Human umbilical cord tissue MSCs were isolated, characterized, and given intranasally (500 000 cells per 20 muL) to a hyperoxia-induced rat model of BPD. Lung alveolarization, vascularization, and pulmonary vascular remodeling were restored in animals receiving MSC treatment. Gene and protein analysis suggest the beneficial effects of MSCs were attributed, in part, to a concerted effort targeting angiogenesis, immunomodulation, wound healing, and cell survival. These findings are clinically significant, as neonates who develop BPD have altered alveolar development, decreased pulmonary vascularization and chronic inflammation, all resulting in impaired tissue healing. Our study is the first to report the intranasal delivery of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly MSCs in experimental BPD is feasible, noninvasive, and an effective route that may bear clinical applicability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are key regulators of various biological processes. The present study aimed to explore the biological roles of circRNAs in BPD pathogenesis., METHODS: A newborn BPD rat model was developed to construct a circRNA library; Illumina deep sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to reveal differential expression of circRNAs in the hyperoxia-induced BPD rat models. Sanger sequencing and a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were performed to confirm circRNAs that may be related to BPD. After miRNA binding-site prediction, we constructed a network diagram of circRNA-competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) related to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and p53 pathways using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis., RESULTS: In total, 256 differentially expressed circRNAs were detected between the hyperoxia group and the normoxia group. Of these circRNAs, 195 were up-regulated and 61 were down-regulated. The differences of circRNA distribution between the two groups were analyzed and six circRNAs were validated in the tissue samples. GO analysis indicated that 6519 target genes were enriched in cell location and biological processes. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that circRNAs involved in 242 KEGG pathways. A network diagram of circRNA-ceRNA related to TGF-beta and p53 pathways was constructed., CONCLUSIONS: CircRNAs are differentially expressed between the BPD model and control group. Many target genes of circRNAs are involved in the developmental process, which suggests that BPD may be associated with pathways including extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, vascular endothelial growth factor signaling and vascular smooth muscle contraction.

AB  - Being of the male sex has been identified as a risk factor for multiple morbidities associated with preterm birth, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Exposure to inflammatory stress is a well-recognized risk factor for developing BPD. Whether there is a sex difference in pulmonary innate immune TLR4 signaling, lung injury and subsequent abnormal lung development is unknown. Neonatal (P0) male and female mice (ICR) were exposed to systemic LPS (5 mg/kg, IP) and innate immune signaling, and the transcriptional response were assessed (1 and 5 hours), along with lung development (P7). Male and female mice demonstrated a similar degree of impaired lung development with decreased radial alveolar counts, increased surface area, increased airspace area and increased mean linear intercept. We found no differences between male and female mice in the baseline pulmonary expression of key components of TLR4-NFkappaB signaling, or in the LPS-induced pulmonary expression of key mediators of neonatal lung injury. Finally, we found no difference in the kinetics of LPS-induced pulmonary NFkappaB activation between male and female mice. Together, these data support the conclusion that the innate immune response to early postnatal LPS exposure and resulting pulmonary sequelae is similar in male and female mice.

AB  - New perinatal care technologies have improved the survival rate of preterm neonates, but the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most intractable problems in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), remains unchanged. In present study, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was performed to detect the expression profiles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) in hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model. Significant differentially expressed RNAs were selected and clustered between the BPD group and the control group. The results revealed that expressions of 1778 lncRNAs, 1240 mRNAs, 97 circRNAs, and 201 miRNAs were significantly altered in the BPD group. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to predict the potential functions of differentially expressed RNAs. lncRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA coexpression networks were constructed to detect their association with the pathogenesis of BPD. Our study provides a systematic perspective on the potential function of RNAs during BPD. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) is being trialled in preterm infants to reduce brain injury, but high doses increase lung injury in ventilated preterm lambs. We aimed to determine whether early administration of lower doses of EPO could reduce ventilation-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation in preterm lambs. Ventilation was initiated in anaesthetized preterm lambs [125 +/- 1 (SD) days gestation] using an injurious strategy for the first 15 min. Lambs were subsequently ventilated with a protective strategy for a total of 2 h. Lambs were randomized to receive either intravenous saline (Vent; n = 7) or intravenous 300 ( n = 5), 1,000 (EPO1000; n = 5), or 3,000 (EPO3000; n = 5) IU/kg of human recombinant EPO via an umbilical vein. Lung tissue was collected for molecular and histological assessment of inflammation and injury and compared with unventilated control lambs (UVC; n = 8). All ventilated groups had similar blood gas and ventilation parameters, but EPO1000 lambs had a lower fraction of inspired oxygen requirement and lower alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen. Vent and EPO lambs had increased lung interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA, early lung injury genes connective tissue growth factor, early growth response protein 1, and cysteine-rich 61, and liver serum amyloid A3 mRNA compared with UVCs; no difference was observed between Vent and EPO groups. Histological lung injury was increased in Vent and EPO groups compared with UVCs, but EPO3000 lambs had increased lung injury scores compared with VENT only. Early low-doses of EPO do not exacerbate ventilation-induced lung inflammation and injury and do not provide any short-term respiratory benefit. High doses (>=3,000 IU/kg) likely exacerbate lung inflammation and injury in ventilated preterm lambs. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Trials are ongoing to assess the efficacy of erythropoietin (EPO) to provide neuroprotection for preterm infants. However, high doses of EPO increase ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) in preterm lambs. We investigated whether early lower doses of EPO may reduce VILI. We found that lower doses did not reduce, but did not increase, VILI, while high doses (>=3,000 IU/kg) increase VILI. Therefore, lower doses of EPO should be used in preterm infants, particularly those receiving respiratory support.

AB  - Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are at risk for frequent respiratory infections and reduced pulmonary function. We studied whether neonatal hyperoxia disrupts adaptive immune responses in adult mice, contributing to higher respiratory-related morbidities seen in these infants. Newborn mice litters were randomized at 3 days to 85% O2 or room air (RA) for 12 days. Whole lung mRNA was isolated in both the groups at 2 weeks and 3 months. Gene expression for T-cell and B-cell adaptive immune response was performed by real-time PCR and qRT-PCR; protein expression (p21, IL4, IL10, IL27, cd4) was performed by enzyme immunoassay along with p21 immunohistochemistry. Hyperoxia increased expression of p21 and decreased expression of 19 genes representing T/B-cell activation by >= fourfold; three of them significantly (Rag1, Cd1d1, Cd28) compared to the RA group at 2 weeks. Despite RA recovery, the expression of IFNgamma, IL27, and CD40 was significantly reduced at 3 months in the hyperoxia group. Expression of p21 was significantly higher and IL27 protein lower at 2 weeks following hyperoxia. Adult mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia had lower IL4 and IL10 in the lung at 3 months. Adaptive immune responses are developmentally regulated and neonatal hyperoxia suppresses expression of genes involved in T-/B-cell activation with continued alterations in gene expression at 3 months. Dysfunction of adaptive immune responses increases the risk for susceptibility to infection in premature infants. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Lysyl oxidases are credited with pathogenic roles in lung diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Lysyl oxidases facilitate the covalent intra- and intermolecular cross-linking of collagen and elastin fibers, thereby imparting tensile strength to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Alternative ECM-independent roles have recently been proposed for lysyl oxidases, including regulation of growth factor signaling, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation, all of which impact cell phenotype. We demonstrate here that three of the five lysyl oxidase family members, Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2, are highly expressed in primary mouse lung fibroblasts compared with other constituent cell types of the lung. Microarray analyses revealed that small interfering RNA knockdown of Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 was associated with apparent changes in the expression of 134, 3,761, and 3,554 genes, respectively, in primary mouse lung fibroblasts. The impact of lysyl oxidase expression on steady-state Mmp3, Mmp9, Eln, Rarres1, Gdf10, Ifnb1, Csf2, and Cxcl9 mRNA levels was validated, which is interesting, since the corresponding gene products are relevant to lung development and BPD, where lysyl oxidases play a functional role. In vivo, the expression of these genes broadly correlated with Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 expression in a mouse model of BPD. Furthermore, beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a selective lysyl oxidase inhibitor, did not affect the steady-state mRNA levels of lysyl oxidase target genes, in vitro in lung fibroblasts or in vivo in BAPN-treated mice. This study is the first to report that lysyl oxidases broadly influence the cell transcriptome. Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen (H2) is regarded as a novel therapeutic agent against several diseases owing to its inherent biosafety. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been widely considered among adverse pregnancy outcomes, without effective treatment. Placenta plays a role in defense, synthesis, and immunity, which provides a new perspective for the treatment of BPD. This study aimed to investigate if H2 reduced the placental inflammation to protect the neonatal rat against BPD damage and potential mechanisms., METHODS: We induced neonatal BPD model by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 microg) into the amniotic fluid at embryonic day 16.5 as LPS group. LPS + H2 group inhaled 42% H2 gas (4 h/day) until the samples were collected. We primarily analyzed the neonatal outcomes and then compared inflammatory levels from the control group (CON), LPS group and LPS + H2 group. HE staining was performed to evaluate inflammatory levels. RNA sequencing revealed dominant differentially expressed genes. Bioinformatics analysis (GO and KEGG) of RNA-seq was applied to mine the signaling pathways involved in protective effect of H2 on the development of LPS-induced BPD. We further used qRT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA methods to verify differential expression of mRNA and proteins. Moreover, we verified the correlation between the upstream signaling pathways and the downstream targets in LPS-induced BPD model., RESULTS: Upon administration of H2, the inflammatory infiltration degree of the LPS-induced placenta was reduced, and infiltration significantly narrowed. Hydrogen normalized LPS-induced perturbed lung development and reduced the death ratio of the fetus and neonate. RNA-seq results revealed the importance of inflammatory response biological processes and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in protective effect of hydrogen on BPD. The over-activated upstream signals [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-kappaB p65), Caspase1 (Casp1) and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome] in LPS placenta were attenuated by H2 inhalation. The downstream targets, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, IL-1beta, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1)], were decreased both in mRNA and protein levels by H2 inhalation in LPS-induced placentas to rescue them from BPD. Correlation analysis displayed a positive association of TLR4-mediated signaling pathway both proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in placenta., CONCLUSION: H2 inhalation ameliorates LPS-induced BPD by inhibiting excessive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the TLR4-NFkappaB-IL6/NLRP3 signaling pathway in placenta and may be a potential therapeutic strategy for BPD.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation of preterm lambs causes lung inflammation and injury to the airway epithelium, which is repaired by 15 days after ventilation. In mice, activated basal cells (p63+, KRT14+, KRT8+) initiate injury repair to the trachea, whereas club cells coordinate distal airway repair. In both human and sheep, basal cells line the pseudostratified airways to the distal bronchioles with club cells only present in terminal bronchioles. Mechanical ventilation causes airway epithelial injury that is repaired through basal cell activation in the fetal lung. Ewes at 123 +/- 1 day gestational age had the head and chest of the fetus exteriorized and tracheostomy placed. With placental circulation intact, fetal lambs were mechanically ventilated with up to 15 ml/kg for 15 min with 95% N2/5% CO2 Fetal lambs were returned to the uterus for up to 24 h. The trachea, left mainstem bronchi, and peripheral lung were evaluated for epithelial injury and cellular response consistent with repair. Peripheral lung tissue had inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, epithelial growth factor receptor ligand upregulation, increased p63 expression, and proliferation of pro-SPB, TTF-1 positive club cells. In bronchi, KRT14 and KRT8 mRNA increased without increases in Notch pathway mRNA or proliferation. In trachea, mRNA increased for Notch ligands, SAM pointed domain-containing Ets transcription factor and mucin 5B, but not for basal cell markers. A brief period of mechanical ventilation causes differential epithelial activation between trachea, bronchi, and peripheral lung. The repair mechanisms identified in adult mice occur at different levels of airway branching in fetal sheep with basal and club cell activation. Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - A significant portion of lung development is completed postnatally during alveolarization, rendering the immature lung vulnerable to inflammatory stimuli that can disrupt lung structure and function. Although the NF-kappaB pathway has well-recognized pro-inflammatory functions, novel anti-inflammatory and developmental roles for NF-kappaB have recently been described. Thus, to determine how NF-kappaB modulates alveolarization during inflammation, we exposed postnatal day 6 mice to vehicle (PBS), systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or the combination of LPS and the global NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (LPS + BAY). LPS impaired alveolarization, decreased lung cell proliferation, and reduced epithelial growth factor expression. BAY exaggerated these detrimental effects of LPS, further suppressing proliferation and disrupting pulmonary angiogenesis, an essential component of alveolarization. The more severe pathology induced by LPS + BAY was associated with marked increases in lung and plasma levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). Experiments using primary neonatal pulmonary endothelial cells (PEC) demonstrated that MIP-2 directly impaired neonatal PEC migration in vitro; and neutralization of MIP-2 in vivo preserved lung cell proliferation and pulmonary angiogenesis and prevented the more severe alveolar disruption induced by the combined treatment of LPS + BAY. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a key anti-inflammatory function of the NF-kappaB pathway in the early alveolar lung that functions to mitigate the detrimental effects of inflammation on pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolarization. Furthermore, these data suggest that neutralization of MIP-2 may represent a novel therapeutic target that could be beneficial in preserving lung growth in premature infants exposed to inflammatory stress.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen, used to treat hypoxia in preterm and term neonates, increases the risk of neonatal lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and asthma. There is a known sex predilection for BPD, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that altered, local estradiol following hyperoxia contributes to pathophysiological changes observed in immature lung. In human fetal airway smooth muscle (fASM) cells exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia, we measured the expression of proteins involved in estrogen metabolism and cell proliferation responses to estradiol. In fASM cells, CYP1a1 expression was increased by hyperoxia, whereas hyperoxia-induced enhancement of cell proliferation was blunted by estradiol. Pharmacological studies indicated that these effects were attributable to upregulation of CYP1a1 and subsequent increased metabolism of estradiol to a downstream intermediate 2-methoxyestradiol. Microarray analysis of mouse lung exposed to 14 days of hyperoxia showed the most significant alteration in CYP1a1 expression, with minimal changes in expression of five other genes related to estrogen receptors, synthesis, and metabolism. Our novel results on estradiol metabolism in fetal and early postnatal lung in the context of hyperoxia indicate CYP1a1 as a potential mechanism for the protective effect of estradiol in hyperoxia-exposed immature lung, which may help explain the sex difference in neonatal lung diseases.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolar simplification with decreased numbers of alveoli and increased airspace. BPD, frequently suffered by very low birth weight infants, has been closely associated with intrauterine infection. However, the underlying mechanisms of BPD remain unclear. In the present study, it was identified that administration of intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to pregnant rats on embryonal day 16.5 (E16.5) induced significant alveolarization arrest similar to that of BPD in neonatal pups, and theophylline injected subcutaneously into the newborns improved the pathological changes. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of the morphogenesis amelioration of theophylline, cytokine antibody arrays were performed with the lung lysates of neonatal rats. The results indicated that LPS upregulated a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines and theophylline significantly attenuated the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-2, and markedly elevated the production of tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta family members TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3, which are anti-inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that theophylline may protect against BPD and improve chorioamnionitis-induced alveolar arrest by regulating the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression.

AB  - As well-known regulators of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role not only in cell proliferation and differentiation, but also in tumorigenesis and organ development. Furthermore, it is estimated that miRNAs may be responsible for regulating the expression of nearly one-third of the human genome. Simultaneously, in the clinic, with advances in neonatal care, a larger number of premature infants are being saved, and thus diseases of lung development, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have become more and more common. However, only a few miRNA studies have studied their connection with diseases of lung development. In our study, we used a miRNA microarray including more than 1891 capture probes to profile the expression of miRNAs at three time points of rat lung development [embryonic (E) Day 16 (E16), E19, E21]. miRNAs found to have consistent fold-changes (fold-change>2.0) during all three time points were selected and validated by real-time PCR. As a result, 167 differentially expressed miRNAs were found during rat lung organogenesis, including 81 upregulated and 86 downregulated miRNAs. Seven miRNAs were selected and characterized by having a consistent >2-fold changes between all three groups. Among these 7 miRNAs, except for let-7a, the other 6 miRNAs (miR-1949, miR-125b-5p, miR-296, miR-93, miR-146b, miR-3560) are all first reported for the first time in lung development. Finally, due to the fact that they demonstrated higher fold changes, from these 7 miRNAs we selected miR-125b-5p, miR-296, miR-93, miR-146b and miR-3560 for real-time PCR. We hypothesized that these newly identified miRNAs may play an important role in fetal lung development, and this experimental result could help us to further clarify the mechanism of normal lung development including the development of type II pneumocytes. This may provide a physiological basis for future research on diseases of lung development.

AB  - Pulmonary inflammation is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. We have previously shown that perinatal pulmonary expression of human IL-1beta is sufficient to cause a lung disease similar to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by inflammation, impaired alveolarization, poor postnatal growth, and increased mortality in infant mice. The alphavbeta6 integrin plays a critical role in regulating inflammation in the adult lung. To study the role of the beta6 integrin subunit in neonatal inflammatory lung disease, we compared the pulmonary development in IL-1beta-expressing infant mice with wild-type or null beta6 integrin loci. Absence of the beta6 integrin subunit decreased the mortality and improved the postnatal growth of IL-1beta-expressing pups. The disrupted alveolar development of IL-1beta-expressing mice was improved by beta6 integrin deficiency. IL-1beta-expressing beta6(-/-) pups had shorter alveolar chord length and thinner alveolar walls than IL-1beta-expressing beta6(+/+) pups. In addition, the absence of the beta6 integrin subunit reduced IL-1beta-induced neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the alveolar spaces. beta6 integrin subunit deficiency suppressed inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in the airways and alleviated airway remodeling in IL-1beta-expressing mice. The expression of the chemoattractant proteins, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, calgranulin A, and calgranulin B, of osteopontin, and of the chitinase-like lectins, Ym1 and Ym2, was lower in IL-1beta-expressing beta6(-/-) than in IL-1beta-expressing beta6(+/+) mice. We conclude that absence of the beta6 integrin subunit protects the infant murine lung against IL-1beta-induced inflammation and injury.

AB  - Two common lung-related complications in the neonate are respiratory distress syndrome, which is associated with a failure to generate low surface tension at the air-liquid interface because of pulmonary surfactant insufficiency, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung injury with reduced alveolarization. Surfactant phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species composition during alveolarization has not been examined. Mass spectrometry analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rodents and humans revealed significant changes in surfactant PC during alveolar development and BPD. In rats, total PC content rose during alveolarization, which was caused by an increase in palmitoylmyristoyl-PC (16:0/14:0PC) concentration. Furthermore, two animal models of BPD exhibited a specific reduction in 16:0/14:0PC content. In humans, 16:0/14:0PC content was specifically decreased in patients with BPD and emphysema compared with patients without alveolar pathology. Palmitoylmyristoyl-PC content increased with increasing intrinsic surfactant curvature, suggesting that it affects surfactant function in the septating lung. The changes in acyl composition of PC were attributed to type II cells producing an altered surfactant during alveolar development. These data are compatible with extracellular surfactant 16:0/14:0PC content being an indicator of alveolar architecture of the lung.

AB  - RATIONALE: The p66(Shc) adapter protein antagonizes mitogen-activated protein, or MAP, kinase, mediates oxidative stress, and is developmentally regulated in fetal mouse lungs., OBJECTIVES: To determine if p66(Shc) is similarly regulated in primates and in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which results from oxidative injury to immature lungs., METHODS: Normal and injured lungs from humans and baboons were evaluated by Western analysis and immunohistochemistry., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In baboons, p66(Shc) decreased 80% between 125 and 175 days' gestation (p = 0.025), then doubled after term delivery at 185 days (p = 0.0013). In the hyperoxic 140-day fetal baboon BPD model, p66(Shc) expression persisted, and its localization shifted from the epithelium of gestational controls to the mesenchyme of diseased lungs, coincident with expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cleaved poly(adenyl ribose) polymerase, a marker of apoptosis. Treatment with the antibombesin antibody 2A11 attenuated BPD, reduced cell proliferation, increased p66(Shc) expression 10.5-fold, and preserved epithelial p66(Shc) localization. p66(Shc) also decreased during normal human lung development, falling 87% between 18 and 24 weeks' gestation (p = 0.02). p66(Shc) was expressed throughout 18-week human lungs, became restricted to scattered epithelial cells by 24 weeks, and localized to isolated mesenchymal cells after term delivery. In contrast, p66(Shc) remained prominent in the epithelium of lungs with acute injury or mild BPD, and in the mesenchyme of lungs with severe disease. p66(Shc) localized to tissues expressing proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cleaved poly(adenyl ribose) polymerase., CONCLUSIONS: p66(Shc) expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis are concomitantly altered during lung development and in BPD.

AB  - Chorioamnionitis is associated with preterm delivery and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by impaired alveolar and pulmonary vascular development and vascular dysfunction. To study the vascular effects in a model of chorioamnionitis, preterm lambs were exposed to 20 mg of intra-amniotic endotoxin or saline for 1, 2, 4, or 7 days and delivered at 122 days gestational age (term = 150 days). This intra-amniotic endotoxin dose was previously shown to induce lung maturation. The effect of intra-amniotic endotoxin on expression of endothelial proteins was evaluated. Muscularization of the media and collagen deposition in adventitia of small pulmonary arteries was used to assess vascular remodeling. Compared with controls, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein content was increased 2 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin exposure. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165 isoform mRNA decreased 2-4 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin. VEGF, VEGF receptor-2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and Tie-2 protein expression in the lung coordinately decreased 1-7 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin. Intra-amniotic endotoxin appeared to selectively decrease eNOS expression in small pulmonary vessels compared with large vessels. Medial smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased adventitial fibrosis were observed 4 and 7 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin. These results demonstrate that, in the preterm lamb lung, antenatal inflammation inhibits endothelial cell protein expression followed by vascular remodeling changes in small pulmonary arteries. Exposure to antenatal inflammation may cause vascular remodeling and contribute to the development of BPD.

AB  - Bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) are elevated in newborns who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In baboon models, anti-BLP blocking antibodies abrogate BPD. We now demonstrate hyperplasia of both neuroendocrine cells and mast cells in lungs of baboons with BPD, compared with non-BPD controls or BLP antibody-treated BPD baboons. To determine whether BLPs are proinflammatory, bombesin was administered intratracheally to mice. Forty-eight hours later, we observed increased numbers of lung mast cells. We analyzed murine mast cells for BLP receptor gene expression, and identified mRNAs encoding bombesin receptor subtype 3 and neuromedin-B receptor (NMB-R), but not gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. Only NMB-R-null mice accumulated fewer lung mast cells after bombesin treatment. Bombesin, gastrin-releasing peptide, NMB, and a bombesin receptor subtype 3-specific ligand induced mast cell proliferation and chemotaxis in vitro. These observations support a role for multiple BLPs in promoting mast cell responses, suggesting a mechanistic link between BLPs and chronic inflammatory lung diseases.

AB  - Ureaplasma urealyticum respiratory tract colonization in preterm infants has been associated with a high incidence of pneumonia and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, study of this human pathogen has been hampered by the absence of animal models. We have developed the first juvenile mouse model of Ureaplasma pneumonia and characterized the histopathology during the month following inoculation. C3H/HeN mice were inoculated intratracheally with a mouse-adapted clinical Ureaplasma isolate (biovar 2) or sham inoculated with 10B broth. Culture of lung homogenates and PCR of DNA from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) confirmed the presence of Ureaplasma in 100% of inoculated animals at 1 day, 60% at 2 days, 50% at 3 days, and 25% at 7 and 14 days. Ureaplasma was undetectable 28 days postinoculation. There were marked changes in BAL and interstitial-cell composition with increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes 1 to 2 days and 14 days postinoculation and macrophages at 2 and 14 days postinoculation. The Ureaplasma infection caused a persistent focal loss of airway ciliated epithelium and a mild increase in interstitial cellularity. There were no differences in BAL protein concentration during the first 28 days, suggesting that pulmonary vascular endothelial barrier integrity remained intact. Comparison of BAL cytokine and chemokine concentrations revealed low levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) at 3 days and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 at 7 days in Ureaplasma-infected mice but a trend toward increased TNF-alpha at 14 days and increased granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-10 at 28 days. These data suggest that Ureaplasma alone may cause limited inflammation and minimal tissue injury in the early phase of infection but may promote a mild chronic inflammatory response in the later phase of infection (days 14 to 28), similar to the process that occurs in human newborns.

AB  - Alteration of gut microbiota can affect chronic lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, through abnormal immune and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown a feasible connection between gut microbiota and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. However, whether BPD can be ameliorated by restoring the gut microbiota remains unclear. In preterm infants with BPD, we found variance in the diversity and structure of gut microbiota. Similarly, BPD rats showed gut dysbiosis, characterized by a deficiency of Lactobacillus, which was abundant in normal rats. We therefore explored the effect and potential mechanism of action of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum L168, in improving BPD. The BPD rats were treated with L. plantarum L168 by gavage for 2 weeks, and the effect was evaluated by lung histopathology, lung function, and serum inflammatory markers. Subsequently, we observed reduced lung injury and improved lung development in BPD rats exposed to L. plantarum L168. Further evaluation revealed that L. plantarum L168 improved intestinal permeability in BPD rats. Serum metabolomics showed altered inflammation-associated metabolites following L. plantarum L168 intervention, notably a marked increase in anti-inflammatory metabolites. In agreement with the metabolites analysis, RNA-seq analysis of the intestine and lung showed that inflammation and immune-related genes were down-regulated. Based on the information from RNA-seq, we validated that L. plantarum L168 might improve BPD relating to down-regulation of TLR4 /NF-kappaB /CCL4 pathway. Together, our findings suggest the potential of L. plantarum L168 to provide probiotic-based therapeutic strategies for BPD. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Proper formation of the pulmonary microvasculature is essential for normal lung development and gas exchange. Lung microvascular development may be disrupted by chronic injury of developing lungs in clinical diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We examined microvascular development, angiogenic growth factors, and endothelial cell receptors in a fetal baboon model of chronic lung disease (CLD). In the last third of gestation, the endothelial cell marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 increased 7.5-fold, and capillaries immunostained for PECAM-1 changed from a central location in airspace septa to a subepithelial location. In premature animals delivered at 67% of term and supported with oxygen and ventilation for 14 days, PECAM-1 protein and capillary density did not increase, suggesting failure to expand the capillary network. The capillaries of the CLD animals were dysmorphic and not subepithelial. The angiogenic growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (Flt-1) were significantly decreased in CLD. Angiopoietin-1, another angiogenic growth factor, and its receptor tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains were not significantly changed. These data suggest that CLD impairs lung microvascular development and that a possible mechanism is disruption of VEGF and Flt-1 expression.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) commonly develops in premature infants. An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of BPD requires better models. In this study, neonatal FVB/N mice were exposed to room air or 85% oxygen for 28 days. Neonatal hyperoxia resulted in decreased alveolar septation, increased terminal air space size, and increased lung fibrosis. These changes were evident after 7 days and more pronounced by 28 days. Decreased alveolarization was preceded by decreased proliferation of lung cells. After 3 days of hyperoxia, cell proliferation was decreased compared with room air littermates. Cell proliferation continued to be decreased in the first 2 wk but normalized by 4 wk. Hyperoxia caused an increased number of inflammatory cells in lung tissue and in lung lavage fluid. Analysis of lung tissue RNA by RT-PCR showed that hyperoxia increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha. Prolonged neonatal hyperoxia caused functional changes, decreasing lung volume and pulmonary compliance. We conclude that prolonged exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia creates a lesion that is very similar to human BPD and suggests that altered cell proliferation may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic neonatal lung disease.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) extracellular vesicles (EVs) have beneficial effects in preclinical bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) models. The optimal source, dosing, route, and duration of effects are however unknown. The objectives of this study were to (a) compare the efficacy of GMP-grade EVs obtained from Wharton's Jelly MSCs (WJ-MSCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs), (b) determine the optimal dosing and route of administration, (c) evaluate its long-term effects, and (d) determine how MSC EVs alter the lung transcriptome. Newborn rats exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P)1-P14 were given (a) intra-tracheal (IT) BM or WJ-MSC EVs or placebo, (b) varying doses of IT WJ-MSC EVs, or (c) IT or intravenous (IV) WJ-MSC EVs on P3. Rats were evaluated at P14 or 3 months. Early administration of IT BM-MSC or WJ-MSC EVs had similar beneficial effects on lung structure and PH in hyperoxia-exposed rats. WJ-MSC EVs however had superior effects on cardiac remodeling. Low, medium, and high dose WJ-MSC EVs had similar cardiopulmonary regenerative effects. IT and IV WJ-MSC EVs similarly improved vascular density and reduced PH in hyperoxic rats. Gene-set enrichment analysis of transcripts differentially expressed in WJ-MSC EV-treated rats showed that induced transcripts were associated with angiogenesis. Long-term studies demonstrated that a single early MSC EV dose has pulmonary vascular protective effects 3 months after administration. Together, our findings have significant translational implications as it provides critical insight into the optimal source, dosing, route, mechanisms of action, and duration of effects of MSC-EVs for BPD-PH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common and serious chronic lung disease in preterm infants with pathological characteristics of arrested lung development. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a serious manifestation of oxidative stress damage, but little is known about the role of DSBs in BPD. The current study set out to detect DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest in BPD and study the expression of genes related to DNA damage and repair in BPD through DNA damage signaling pathway-based PCR array to determine a suitable target to improve arrested lung development associated with BPD., METHODS: DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest were detected in a BPD animal model and primary cells, then a DNA damage signaling pathway-based PCR array was used to identify the target of DSB repair in BPD., RESULTS: DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest were shown in BPD animal model, primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) and cultured cells after exposure to hyperoxia. Of the 84 genes in the DNA damage-signaling pathway PCR array, eight genes were overexpressed and 11 genes were repressed. Rad1, an important protein for DSB repair, was repressed in the model group. Real-time PCR and western blots were used to verify the microarray results. Next, we confirmed that silencing Rad1 expression aggravated the accumulation of DSBs and cell cycle arrest in AECII cells, whereas its overexpression alleviated DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest., CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of DSBs in AECII might be an important cause of alveolar growth arrest associated with BPD. Rad1 could be an effective target for intervention to improve this arrest in lung development associated with BPD. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal lung disease developing in premature babies characterized by arrested alveologenesis and associated with decreased Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression. One-week hyperoxia (HYX) exposure of newborn mice leads to a permanent arrest in alveologenesis. To test the role of Fgf10 signaling to promote de novo alveologenesis following hyperoxia, we used transgenic mice allowing inducible expression of Fgf10 and recombinant FGF10 (rFGF10) protein delivered intraperitoneally. We carried out morphometry analysis, and IF on day 45. Alveolospheres assays were performed co-culturing AT2s from normoxia (NOX) with FACS-isolated Sca1Pos resident mesenchymal cells (rMC) from animals exposed to NOX, HYX-PBS, or HYX-FGF10. scRNAseq between rMC-Sca1Pos isolated from NOX and HYX-PBS was also carried out. Transgenic overexpression of Fgf10 and rFGF10 administration rescued the alveologenesis defects following HYX. Alveolosphere assays indicate that the activity of rMC-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by HYX and partially rescued by rFGF10 treatment. Analysis by IF demonstrates a significant impact of rFGF10 on the activity of resident mesenchymal cells. scRNAseq results identified clusters expressing Fgf10, Fgf7, Pdgfra, and Axin2, which could represent the rMC niche cells for the AT2 stem cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that rFGF10 administration is able to induce de novo alveologenesis in a BPD mouse model and identified subpopulations of rMC-Sca1Pos niche cells potentially representing its cellular target.

AB  - Infants with a history of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia have a high risk of asthma and viral-induced exacerbations later in life. We hypothesized that hyperoxic exposure, a predisposing factor to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, modulates the innate immune response, producing an exaggerated proinflammatory reaction to viral infection. Two- to 3-d-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 d. Mice were infected intranasally with rhinovirus (RV) immediately after O2 exposure. Lung mRNA and protein expression, histology, dendritic cells (DCs), and airway responsiveness were assessed 1-12 d postinfection. Tracheal aspirates from premature human infants were collected for mRNA detection. Hyperoxia increased lung IL-12 expression, which persisted up to 12 d postexposure. Hyperoxia-exposed RV-infected mice showed further increases in IL-12 and increased expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, as well as increased airway inflammation and responsiveness. In RV-infected, air-exposed mice, the response was not significant. Induced IL-12 expression in hyperoxia-exposed, RV-infected mice was associated with increased IL-12-producing CD103(+) lung DCs. Hyperoxia also increased expression of Clec9a, a CD103(+) DC-specific damaged cell-recognition molecule. Hyperoxia increased levels of ATP metabolites and expression of adenosine receptor A1, further evidence of cell damage and related signaling. In human preterm infants, tracheal aspirate Clec9a expression positively correlated with the level of prematurity. Hyperoxic exposure increases the activation of CD103(+), Clec9a(+) DCs, leading to increased inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness upon RV infection. In premature infants, danger signal-induced DC activation may promote proinflammatory airway responses, thereby increasing respiratory morbidity.

AB  - Oxygen supplementation in preterm infants disrupts alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cell proliferation through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, newborn mice are used to understand how hyperoxia stimulates an early aberrant wave of AT2 cell proliferation that occurs between Postnatal Days (PNDs) 0 and 4. RNA-sequencing analysis of AT2 cells isolated from PND4 mice revealed hyperoxia stimulates expression of mitochondrial-specific methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 and other genes involved in mitochondrial one-carbon coupled folate metabolism and serine synthesis. The same genes are induced when AT2 cells normally proliferate on PND7 and when they proliferate in response to the mitogen fibroblast growth factor 7. However, hyperoxia selectively stimulated their expression via the stress-responsive activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Administration of the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia suppressed ATF4 and thus early AT2 cell proliferation, but it had no effect on normative AT2 cell proliferation seen on PND7. Because ATF4 and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase are detected in hyperplastic AT2 cells of preterm infant humans and baboons with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, dampening mitochondrial oxidative stress and ATF4 activation may provide new opportunities for controlling excess AT2 cell proliferation in neonatal lung disease.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature infants, which results in substantial morbidity. The pathophysiology of BPD includes oxidant injury, baro/volutrauma, and disordered lung repair. As lung development, differentiation, and repair require cell division, we hypothesized dysregulation of the cell cycle in oxygen exposure of premature infants that may contribute to the evolution of BPD. In this investigation, we studied the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) that regulate transition from G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. We report here that expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin A is modulated in premature baboons in respiratory distress. In addition, the expression of cdk1 or cdk4 was also modulated in these premature animals. The phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein was progressively decreased in 125-day animals and in 140-day animals exposed to 6 or 14 days of PRN oxygen. These results indicate that due to altered cyclin and cdk expression, the repair of injured epithelium may proceed in a disordered manner that is characteristic of BPD. Thus, altered cell cycle regulation may be an important factor in the evolution of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that specifically affects preterm infants. Oxygen therapy administered to treat BPD can lead to hyperoxia-induced lung injury, characterized by apoptosis of lung alveolar epithelial cells. Our epitranscriptomic microarray analysis of normal mice lungs and hyperoxia-stimulated mice lungs revealed elevated RNA expression levels of IL-33, as well as increased m6A RNA methylation levels of IL-33 and PVT1 in the hyperoxia-stimulated lungs. This study aimed to investigate the role of the PVT1/IL-33 axis in BPD. A mouse model of BPD was established through hyperoxia induction, and lung histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Parameters such as radial alveolar count and mean chord length were measured to assess lung function. Mouse and human lung alveolar epithelial cells (MLE12 and A549, respectively) were stimulated with hyperoxia to create an in vitro BPD model. Cell apoptosis was detected using Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis. Our results demonstrated that silencing PVT1 suppressed apoptosis in MLE12 and A549 cells and improved lung function in hyperoxia-stimulated lungs. Additionally, IL-33 reversed the effects of PVT1 both in vivo and in vitro. Through online bioinformatics analysis and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays, YTHDC1 was identified as a RNA-binding protein (RBP) for both PVT1 and IL-33. We found that PVT1 positively regulated IL-33 expression by recruiting YTHDC1 to mediate m6A modification of IL-33. In conclusion, silencing PVT1 demonstrated beneficial effects in alleviating BPD by facilitating YTHDC1-mediated m6A modification of IL-33. Inhibition of the PVT1/IL-33 axis to suppress apoptosis in lung alveolar epithelial cells may hold promise as a therapeutic approach for managing hyperoxia-induced lung injury in BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease in premature infants, and alveolar dysplasia and pulmonary vascular development disorders are the predominant pathological features. Apoptosis of lung epithelial cells is a key factor in the pathological process of alveolar developmental arrest. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-associated apoptosis is a noncanonical apoptotic pathway involved in the development of several pulmonary diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and activating transcription factor 6 can initiate the apoptosis signaling pathway mediated by ERS and induce apoptosis of injured cells. Among them, the IRE1alpha pathway is the most conservative pathway in the unfolded protein response, which serves an important role in a number of pathological environments, to the extent of determining cell fate; however, it is rarely reported in BPD. Based on the establishment of a rat BPD model, the present study verified the activation of ERS in BPD and further confirmed that prolonged ERS inhibited the protective pathway, IRE1alpha/X-box binding proteins, and activated the proapoptotic pathway, IRE1alpha/c-Jun N-terminal kinase, to induce the apoptosis of lung epitheliums.

AB  - BACKGROUND Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease mostly affecting premature infants. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) X inactive specific transcript (Xist) is actively involved in pulmonary disease development. The present study explored the potential mechanism of Xist in BPD development. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, newborn BPD mouse models were successfully established. lncRNAs and genes with differential expression were identified using microarray analysis. Various injuries and radial alveolar counts of lung tissues of BPD mice were detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Functional assays were utilized to detect alterations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), vascular endothelial growth factor, collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle Actin, TGF-s1, and Smad3. Then, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down assay were performed to clarify the targeting relationship between Xist and miR-101-3p and between miR-101-3p and high-mobility group protein B3 (HMGB3). RESULTS In BPD mice, radial alveolar counts value and SOD activity declined while MDA level increased. Results of microarray analysis found that Xist and HMGB3 were highly expressed in BPD mice. Next, silenced Xist alleviated lung damage in BPD mice. Xist competitively bound to miR-101-3p to activate HMGB3, and overexpressed miR-101-3p mitigated lung damage in BPD mice. Additionally, silenced Xist downregulated the TGF-s1/Smad3 axis. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that silencing of Xist suppressed BPD development by binding to miR-101-3p and downregulating HMGB3 and the TGF-b1/Smad3 axis. Our results may provide novel insights for BPD treatment.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Hyperoxia causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We showed that adult mice deficient in aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) are more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than wild type (WT) controls due to marked decreases in the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A enzymes. Whether AhR protects newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that AhR dysfunctional newborn mice have increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification compared to WT newborn mice upon exposure to hyperoxia. Methods Used: One-day old C57BL/6J (WT) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor dysfunctional (AhRd) mice were exposed to air or hyperoxia (FiO2 85%) for 14 d. Following exposure to air or hyperoxia, the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the mice were collected to determine AhR activation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolarization. Pulmonary AhR activation was assessed by analyzing the expression of pulmonary CYP 1A1 NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and microsomal glutathione Stransferase 1. Lung inflammation was determined by macrophage infiltration and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression, and alveolarization was determined by lung morphometry. Oxidative stress was determined by analyzing protein carbonyls expression in the BALF. Summary of Results: In both newborn WT and AhRd mice, exposure to hyperoxia increased lung inflammation and oxidative stress. However, hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress was significantly increased in AhRd mice compared to WT mice. Likewise, hyperoxia increased alveolar simplification in both newborn WTand AhRd mice with the latter being more significantly affected than the former. Interestingly, activation of the AhR was inversely related to hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification. Conclusion(s): AhRd newborn mice have increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification compared to WT newborn mice upon exposure to hyperoxia. Our data suggest that strategies directed towards increasing the functional activation of the AhR would be effective in the prevention and treatment of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease resulting from the impact of injury (including oxygen toxicity, barotrauma, volutrauma, and infection) on the immature lung. Oxygen toxicity is thought to be a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis in BPD. Previous animal studies have shown that exposure to hyperoxia in the neonatal period causes lung structural changes that are similar to the histology seen in human infants with BPD. Erythropoietin (EPO) has pleiotropic actions including antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. Animal experiments reveal that EPO may have protective effects on hyperoxic lung injury, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects and understand mechanism of action of EPO on the hyperoxia-induced BPD in newborn rats., METHOD: Several litters of Wistar pups were pooled together within 12 hours after birth and randomly divided into four groups: I. air-exposed control group, II. air-exposed human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO)-treated group, III. hyperoxia-exposed placebo group and IV. hyperoxia-exposed rhEPO-treated group . Group III and IV rats were exposed to 85% oxygen. Group II and IV rats received rhEPO (1200 IU/kg) subcutaneously on postnatal days 0 and 2. Group I and III received 0.9% saline in the same way. Pups from each group were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14. Blood hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count were determined by blood cell analyzer. Total protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured by biochemical assay. Changes of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) mRNA expressions were measured by RT-PCR., RESULT: In group III, there were a few inflammatory cells infiltrations in interstitium on day 3 and inflammatory response worsened on day 7. Alveolar and capillary hypoplasia and interstitial fibrosis were evident on day 14. The pathological changes were ameliorated greatly in group IV and the survival was prolonged. There were no abnormal raises of hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count in group IV compared with group I. Total protein concentration in BALF was measured as a marker for capillary leakage. MPO is a major constituent of neutrophil cytoplasmic granules and its activity therefore is a direct measure of neutrophil presence and an indirect indicator of lung injury. Total protein concentration and MPO in BALF were greatly depressed in group IV compared with group III, P<0.05, P<0.001. The upregulation of genes of CINC-1 and MCP-1 was closely related with lung inflammation caused by oxidative stress. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression were detected and it was found that their changes were in line with the degree of lung inflammation. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression increased in group III compared with group I especially on day 7, P<0.01 or <0.001. The changes of MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA were positively correlated with changes of MPO in BALF covering all groups on days 3, 7 and 14, respectively (r = 0.391, P<0.05; r = 0.701, P<0.01; r = 0.600, P<0.01; r = 0.471, P<0.01; r = 0.789, P<0.01; r = 0.588, P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: EPO could significantly reduce the lung inflammatory cell infiltration, and capillary endothelial cell injury in hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rats. The mechanism may be related with the inhibition of MCP-1 and CINC-1 gene expression by EPO.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease of preterm neonates; the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood. Recent studies suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in BPD., STUDY DESIGN: miRNA and mRNA microarrays were performed to analyze the expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA in BPD and control lung tissues after oxygen and air exposure on day 21. Bioinformatics methods, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were performed to predict the potential functions of differentially expressed genes. Then, miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and TarBase data., RESULTS: Our results showed that a total of 192 differentially expressed miRNAs (74 downregulated and 118 upregulated) and 1,225 differentially expressed mRNAs (479 downregulated and 746 upregulated) were identified between BPD mice and normoxia-control mice. GO and KEGG analysis showed that for downregulated genes, the top significant enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were both mainly related to immune and inflammation processes; for upregulated genes, the top significant enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were both mainly related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. PPI network and miRNA-mRNA regulatory network construction revealed that the key genes and pathways associated with inflammation and immune regulation., CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed the integrated miRNA-mRNA data of distinct expression profiles in hyperoxia-induced BPD mice, and may provide some clues of the potential biomarkers for BPD, and provide novel insights into the development of new promising biomarkers for the treatment of BPD., KEY POINTS: . Integrated advanced bioinformatics methods may offer a better way to understand the molecular expression profiles involved in BPD.. . ECM remodeling, inflammation, and immune regulation may be essential to BPD.. . The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network construction may contribute to develop new biomarkers for the treatment of BPD..

AB  - Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, and its expression increases under various stress conditions, including inflammation, hyperoxia, and senescence. GDF15 expression is increased in neonatal murine bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) models, and GDF15 loss exacerbates oxidative stress and decreases cellular viability in vitro. Our overall hypothesis is that the loss of GDF15 will exacerbate hyperoxic lung injury in the neonatal lung in vivo. We exposed neonatal Gdf15-/- mice and wild-type (WT) controls on a similar background to room air or hyperoxia (95% [Formula: see text]) for 5 days after birth. The mice were euthanized on postnatal day 21 (PND 21). Gdf15-/- mice had higher mortality and lower body weight than WT mice after exposure to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia exposure adversely impacted alveolarization and lung vascular development, with a greater impact in Gdf15-/- mice. Interestingly, Gdf15-/- mice showed lower macrophage count in the lungs compared with WT mice both under room air and after exposure to hyperoxia. Analysis of the lung transcriptome revealed marked divergence in gene expression and enriched biological pathways in WT and Gdf15-/- mice and differed markedly by biological sex. Notably, pathways related to macrophage activation and myeloid cell homeostasis were negatively enriched in Gdf15-/- mice. Loss of Gdf15 exacerbates mortality, lung injury, and the phenotype of the arrest of alveolarization in the developing lung with loss of female-sex advantage in Gdf15-/- mice. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show for the first time that loss of Gdf15 exacerbates mortality, lung injury, and the phenotype of the arrest of alveolarization in the developing lung with loss of female-sex advantage in Gdf15-/- mice. We also highlight the distinct pulmonary transcriptomic response in the Gdf15-/- lung including pathways related to macrophage recruitment and activation.

AB  - Ventilatory support, such as supplemental oxygen, used to save premature infants impairs the growth of the pulmonary microvasculature and distal alveoli, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although lung cellular composition changes with exposure to hyperoxia in neonatal mice, most human BPD survivors are weaned off oxygen within the first weeks to months of life, yet they may have persistent lung injury and pulmonary dysfunction as adults. We hypothesized that early-life hyperoxia alters the cellular landscape in later life and predicts long-term lung injury. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped lung cell subpopulations at postnatal day (pnd)7 and pnd60 in mice exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 3 days as neonates. We interrogated over 10,000 cells and identified a total of 45 clusters within 32 cell states. Neonatal hyperoxia caused persistent compositional changes in later life (pnd60) in all five type II cell states with unique signatures and function. Premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation with different durations also showed similar alterations in these unique signatures of type II cell states. Pathologically, neonatal hyperoxic exposure caused alveolar simplification in adult mice. We conclude that neonatal hyperoxia alters the lung cellular landscape in later life, uncovering neonatal programing of adult lung dysfunction. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.
