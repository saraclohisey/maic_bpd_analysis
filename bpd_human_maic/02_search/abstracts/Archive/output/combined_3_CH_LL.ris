AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that occurs in premature infants who have needed mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. BPD is defined as the presence of persistent respiratory symptoms, the need for supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia, and an abnormal chest radiograph at 36 weeks gestational age. Proinflammatory cytokines and altered angiogenic gene signaling impair prenatal and postnatal lung growth, resulting in BPD. Postnatal hyperoxia exposure further increases the production of cytotoxic free radicals, which cause lung injury and increase the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Magnesium is the fourth most abundant metal in the body. It is commonly used for the treatment of preeclamsia, as well as for premature labor alleviation. Magnesium's role in BPD development is not clear. A significant association between high magnesium levels at birth and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), pulmonary interstitial emphysema in the extremely low birth weight, respiratory failure, and later development BPD was found. Conversely, low magnesium intake is associated with lower lung functions, and hypomagnesemia was found in 16% of patients with acute pulmonary diseases. Magnesium is used for the treatment of asthmatic attacks. Magnesium deficiency in pregnant women is frequently seen due to low intake. Hypomagnesemia was also found among preterm neonates and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Experimental hypomagnesemia evokes an inflammatory response, and oxidative damage of tissues. These were accompanied by changes in gene expression mostly involved in regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis and remodeling, processes associated with BPD. It is rational to believe that hypomagnesemia can contribute to BPD pathogenesis.

AB  - The use of dexamethasone in premature infants to prevent and/or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia adversely affects neurocognitive development and is associated with cerebral palsy. The underlying mechanisms of these effects are multifactorial and likely include apoptosis. The objective of this study was to confirm whether dexamethasone causes apoptosis in different regions of the developing rat brain. On postnatal day 2, pups in each litter were randomly divided into the dexamethasone-treated (n = 91) or vehicle-treated (n = 92) groups. Rat pups in the dexamethasone group received tapering doses of dexamethasone on postnatal days 3-6 (0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.06 mg/kg/day, respectively). Dexamethasone treatment significantly decreased the gain of body and brain weight and increased brain caspase-3 activity, DNA fragments, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and cleaved caspse-3-positive cells at 24 hr after treatment. Dexamethasone increased cleaved caspse-3-positive cells in the cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, dentate gyrus, and subventricular zone. Double-immunofluorescence studies show that progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus preferentially undergo apoptosis following dexamethasone exposure. These results indicate that dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in immature cells in developing brain is one of the mechanisms of its neurodegenerative effects in newborn rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) prevent pulmonary inflammation and injury in fetal sheep exposed to intrauterine lipopolysaccharide. We hypothesized that hAECs would similarly mitigate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury., METHODS: Newborn mouse pups were randomized to either normoxia (inspired O2 content (FiO2) = 0.21, n = 60) or hyperoxia (FiO2 = 0.85, n = 57). On postnatal days (PND) 5, 6 and 7, hAECs or sterile saline (control) was administered intraperitoneally. All animals were assessed at PND 14., RESULTS: Hyperoxia was associated with lung inflammation, alveolar simplification and reduced postnatal growth. Administration of hAECs to hyperoxia-exposed mice normalized body weight and significantly attenuated some aspects of hyperoxia-induced lung injury (mean linear intercept and septal crest density) and inflammation (interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor-beta). However, hAECs did not significantly alter changes to alveolar airspace volume, septal tissue volume, tissue-to-airspace ratio, collagen content or leukocyte infiltration induced by hyperoxia., CONCLUSIONS: Intraperitoneal administration of hAECs to neonatal mice partially reduced hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and structural lung damage. These observations suggest that hAECs may be a potential therapy for neonatal lung disease. Copyright © 2013 International Society for Cellular Therapy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The tremendous advancement that has occurred in neonatal intensive care over the last 40-50 years can be largely attributed to greater understanding of developmental pathobiology in the newborn lung. Nonetheless, this improved survival from respiratory distress syndrome has been associated with continuing longer-term morbidity in the form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). As a result, neonatal lung injury is a renewed focus of scientific interest. The onset of such an injury may begin in the delivery room, and this has generated interest in minimizing oxygen therapy and aggressive ventilatory support during the transition from fetal to neonatal lung. Fortunately, antenatal steroid therapy and selective use of surfactant therapy are now widely practiced, although fine tuning of this therapy for selected populations is ongoing. Newer therapeutic approaches address many aspects of BPD, including the pro-inflammatory component that characterizes this disorder. Finally, there is a greater need to understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the longer-term respiratory morbidity, most notably asthma, that persists in the preterm survivors of neonatal intensive care.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common chronic lung disease in infancy, has serious long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental consequences right up to adulthood, and is associated with significant healthcare costs. BPD is a multifactorial disease, with genetic and environmental factors interacting to culminate in the characteristic clinical and pathological phenotype. Among the environmental factors, invasive endotracheal tube ventilation is considered a critical contributing factor to the pathogenesis of BPD. Since BPD currently has no specific preventive or effective therapy, considerable interest has focused on the use of non-invasive ventilation as a means to potentially decrease the incidence of BPD. This article reviews the progress made in the last 5 years in the use of nasal continuous positive airways pressure (NCPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as it pertains to impacting on BPD rates. Research efforts are summarized, and some guidelines are suggested for clinical use of these techniques in neonates. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease in infants. Its treatment imposes considerable healthcare burden and costs in the perinatal and early childhood period and patients are usually left with lifelong deficits in lung function. Evidence exists for different pathophysiologic pathways that can promote the structural changes that characterize BPD, including the impairment in alveolarization; however, there is increasing interest regarding heritable factors that may predispose very low birth weight infants to BPD. Our review focuses on recent publications that have investigated genetic factors that may potentially contribute to such reported heritability. These publications point us toward some possible genomic candidates for further study, but certainly do not identify any particular gene or gene pathway that would be inferred to be contributing substantially to the underlying etiology of BPD.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen is often used as a life-saving therapy in the treatment of preterm infants. However, its protracted use can lead to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and more recently, has been associated with adversely affecting the general health of children and adolescents who were born preterm. Efforts to understand how exposure to excess oxygen can disrupt lung development have historically focused on the interplay between oxidative stress and antioxidant defense mechanisms. However, there has been a growing appreciation for how changes in gene-environment interactions occurring during critically important periods of organ development can profoundly affect human health and disease later in life. Here, we review the concept that oxygen is an environmental stressor that may play an important role at birth to control normal lung development via its interactions with genes and cells. Understanding how changes in the oxygen environment have the potential to alter the developmental programing of the lung, such that it now proceeds along a different developmental trajectory, could lead to novel therapies in the prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases, such as BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is among the most common chronic lung diseases in infants in the US. Improved survival of preterm infants who developed BPD is becoming increasingly important because of the high risk for persistent pulmonary morbidities such as poor respiratory gas exchange, pulmonary hypertension, and excess airway expiratory resistance later in life. This review focuses on unique insights provided by the two large-animal, physiological models of neonatal chronic lung disease: preterm baboons and preterm lambs. The models' are valuable because they contribute to better understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenic mechanisms. An epigenetic hypothesis is proposed as a pathogenic mechanism for BPD and its persistent pulmonary morbidities. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a complex disorder secondary to gene-environment interactions, and is the commonest chronic lung disease in infancy. There is no specific or effective treatment available to date for BPD. Since the aetiopathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial, involving diverse molecular signaling pathways, a variety of biomarkers detected in biological fluids have been proposed for early identification of infants predisposed to BPD. This review will be restricted to biomarker studies in human infants, conducted mostly in the last decade. The majority of the studies have been conducted using blood, urine or tracheal aspirate samples. Despite the multitude of biomarkers proposed, most studies have been conducted in small numbers of infants, with few being replicated by independent investigators. Confirmatory studies with adequate sample sizes and assessment of the role of putative biomarkers in the aetiology of BPD in developmentally appropriate animal models and human lungs with BPD will enhance the potential for therapeutic interventions. Genomic and proteomic approaches have the greatest potential to significantly advance the field of biomarkers in BPD. Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease in premature infants and is mainly caused by hyperoxia exposure and mechanical ventilation. Alveolar simplification, pulmonary vascular abnormalities and pulmonary inflammation are the main pathological changes in hyperoxic lung injury animals. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is an important endogenous lipid that can mediate the regression of inflammation and plays a role in acute lung injury and asthma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of LXA4 on inflammation and lung function in neonatal rats with hyperoxic lung injury and to explore the mechanism of the PINK1 pathway. After 85% oxygen exposure in newborn rats for 7days, the BPD model was established. We found that LXA4 could significantly reduce cell and protein infiltration and oxidative stress in rat lungs, improve pulmonary function and alveolar simplification, and promote weight gain. LXA4 inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha, MCP-1 and IL-1beta in serum and BALF from hyperoxic rats. Moreover, we found that LXA4 could reduce the expression of the PINK1 gene and down-regulate the expression of PINK1, Parkin, BNIP3L/Nix and the autophagic protein LC3B. These protective effects of LXA4 could be partially reversed by addition of BOC-2.Thus, we concluded that LXA4 can alleviate the airway inflammatory response, reduce the severity of lung injury and improve lung function in a hyperoxic rat model of BPD partly through the PINK1 signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) is recommended to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Our objective was to evaluate the effect of VAS on vitamin A (VA) status. We hypothesized that VAS would improve VA status in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of infants 1 year before and after initiation of VAS (5000 IU 3 times a week intramuscularly [IM]; total 12 doses). Linear regression was used to model impact of VAS on VA status (retinol level and retinol/retinol binding protein [RBP] ratio). Models were adjusted for time and generalized estimating equations were used to account for intraindividual correlation., RESULTS: Sixty-seven infants (mean gestational age 26 +/- 2 weeks; mean body weight 803 +/- 142 g) were included; 35 received VAS and 32 did not (no-VAS). Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. Infants who received VAS had mean retinol levels that were 9.0 mcg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9-13.2; P < .001) higher and mean retinol/RBP ratios that were 0.21 (95% CI, 0.07-0.36; P = .005) higher than the no-VAS group. Retinol and retinol/RBP ratio increased with time (P < .001). Fewer infants in the VAS group had VA deficiency (retinol/RBP ratios <0.7) compared with the no-VAS group. Culture-positive sepsis was more common in the VAS group (48% vs 12%; P = .002)., CONCLUSIONS: VA status in ELBW infants was improved and maintained over the first month of life with IM VAS. Because of concerns for potential risks of repeated injections, further studies are indicated to evaluate the optimal mode of VA delivery in preterm infants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most frequently occurring complications following preterm birth, is increasing due to increased survival of preterm infants., METHODS: Systematic literature review., CONCLUSION: The etiology is multifactorial, with prematurity being a prerequisite for the development of BPD. Over time, there have been many different and new treatment modalities, some of them have reduced the severity of the disease, but none of them have been able to impact upon the increasing incidence of BPD.

AB  - In recent years, translational research with various animal models has been helpful to answer basic questions about the effect of antenatal inflammation on maturation and development of the fetal lung and immune system. The fetal lung and immune systems are very plastic and their development can be conditioned and influenced by both endogenous and/or exogenous factors. Antenatal inflammation can induce pulmonary inflammation, leading to lung injury and remodeling in the fetal lung. Exposure to antenatal inflammation can induce interleukin-1alpha production, which enhances surfactant protein and lipid synthesis thereby promoting lung maturation. Interleukin-1alpha is therefore a candidate for the link between lung inflammation and lung maturation, preventing respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. Antenatal inflammation can, however, cause structural changes in the fetal lung and affect the expression of growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-beta, connective tissue growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-10, or bone morphogenetic protein-4, which are essential for branching morphogenesis. These alterations cause alveolar and microvascular simplification resembling the histology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Antenatal inflammation may also affect neonatal outcome by modulating the responsiveness of the immune system. Lipopolysaccharide-tolerance (endotoxin hyporesponsiveness/immunoparalysis), induced by exposure to inflammation in utero, may prevent fetal lung damage, but increases susceptibility to postnatal infections. Moreover, prenatal exposure to inflammation appears to be a predisposition for the development of adverse neonatal outcomes, like bronchopulmonary dysplasia, if the preterm infant is exposed to a second postnatal hit, such as mechanical ventilation oxygen exposure, infections, or steroids.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a well-known cause of adverse neonatal outcomes. As it may have an impact on innate immune responses, we aimed to investigate several parameters of the innate immune response in preterm infants of <=32 weeks gestation who were small for gestational age (SGA)., METHODS: We compared clinical data of SGA (n = 20) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n = 124) newborns with a gestational age of <=32 weeks. We investigated full blood counts at birth and on days 3 and 7 of life and cytokine immune responses in a human whole cord blood assay., RESULTS: SGA preterm infants had a higher risk of the combined outcome mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Numbers of white blood cells and neutrophils were diminished in SGA infants at birth and on day 3. At birth, platelet counts were also diminished while the number of nucleated red blood cells tended to be elevated in SGA infants. After stimulation of whole blood cell cultures with lipopolysaccharides, the concentrations of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 were significantly lower in SGA preterm infants compared to AGA infants., CONCLUSIONS: SGA infants differ remarkably from AGA infants in full blood counts and in their ability to mount an immune response. Whether the quantitative deficiency in innate immunity plays a role for adverse outcomes needs to be investigated in larger future trials. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Gaucher disease (GD), caused by a defect of acid beta-glucosidase (beta-Glu), is one of the most common sphingolipidoses. Recently, ambroxol, an FDA-approved drug used to treat airway mucus hypersecretion and hyaline membrane disease in newborns, was identified as a chemical chaperone for GD. In the present study, we investigated the chaperone activity and toxicity of ambroxol on both cultured GD patient cells and normal mice. We found that ambroxol treatment significantly increased N370S, F213I, N188S/G193W and R120W mutant beta-Glu activities in GD fibroblasts with low cytotoxicity. Additionally, we measured the beta-Glu activity in the tissues of normal mice which received water containing increasing concentrations of ambroxol ad libitum for one week. No serious adverse effect was observed during this experiment. Ambroxol significantly increased the beta-Glu activity in the spleen, heart and cerebellum of the mice. This result showed its oral availability and wide distribution and chaperone activity in the tissues, including the brain, and its lack of acute toxicity. These characteristics of ambroxol would make it a potential therapeutic chaperone in the treatment of GD with neurological manifestations. Copyright © 2012 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - Hyperoxia exposure of newborn rodents has served as a model for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) phenotypes found in a sub-population of human premature infants. We previously demonstrated that Nrf2 modulates molecular events during saccular-to-alveolar lung maturation and also has a protective role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury, mortality, arrest of saccular-to-alveolar transition, and lung injury, using Nrf2-deficient and wild-type neonate mice. In this review, we describe how whole-genome transcriptome analyses can identify the means through which Nrf2 transcriptionally modulates organ injury and morphology, cellular growth/proliferation, vasculature development, and immune response during BPD-like pathogenesis. We illustrate how recently developed bioinformatics tools can be used to identify sets of Nrf2-dependently modulated genes in the BPD model, and elucidate direct Nrf2 downstream targets and chemicals/drugs that may act on them. These approaches will provide significant insights into promising therapeutic agents for Nrf2-dependent treatments of complications of preterm birth like BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that apoptosis is regulated by a local angiotensin (ANG) system in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Autocrine generation of angiotensin II (ANGII) in response to endogenous or xenobiotic inducers is required for apoptosis in adult rat AECs and in AEC-derived human lung carcinoma cell line A549. Therefore, we hypothesized that a similar mechanism might also be involved in bleomycin (Bleo)-induced murine neonatal lung injury., METHODS: To investigate the local production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and ANGII in neonatal lung injury, lung explants were obtained from C57/BL6 wild type neonatal mice and were treated with Bleo in the presence or absence of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. AGT protein, ANGII levels and caspase-9 were then measured., RESULTS: Exposure to Bleo significantly induced AGT protein (p<0.02), extracellular ANGII levels (p< 0.005) and the active form of caspase-9 (p<0.05) in neonatal lung tissue. Further, Bleo inducetion of both AGT protein and of caspase-9 were prevented by the ACE inhibitor lisinopril., CONCLUSION: These data clearly demonstrate the synthesis of AGT and ANGII in the lungs of neonates in response to Bleo. Furthermore, they suggest that manipulation of the angiotensin system may hold therapeutic potential for neonatal lung injury.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The REGAL (RSV evidence-a geographical archive of the literature) series provide a comprehensive review of the published evidence in the field of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Western countries over the last 20 years. This third publication covers the risk and burden of RSV infection in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD), formerly called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken of publications between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2015 across PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Studies reporting data for hospital visits/admissions for RSV infection among infants with CLD/BPD who were not prophylaxed, as well as studies reporting RSV-associated morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, were included. Burdens of disease data were compared with preterm infants without CLD/BPD, other high-risk groups and term infants. Study quality and strength of evidence (SOE) were graded using recognized criteria., RESULTS: A total of 1837 studies were identified and 39 were included. CLD/BPD is a significant independent risk factor for RSV hospitalization [RSVH (odds ratio 2.2-7.2); high SOE]. Infants and young children with CLD/BPD had high RSVH rates which were generally similar in Europe, the United States, and Canada, mostly varying between 12 and 21%. Infants with CLD also had a longer length of hospital stay than other high-risk groups and term infants (high SOE). On average, infants spent 4-11 days in hospital (moderate SOE). Once hospitalized for RSV, affected children were at risk for a more severe course of disease than children with no RSVH (moderate SOE)., CONCLUSION: Severe RSV infection in infants and young children with CLD/BPD poses a significant health burden in Western countries. Further studies focussing on the burden of RSV infection in this well-recognized population at high risk for severe disease are needed to help improve outcomes and plan allocation of healthcare resources., FUNDING: AbbVie.

AB  - The lung is a complex organ with a vast surface area whose main function is to release cellular waste to be exhaled and to replenish the supply of oxygen to the tissues of the body. The conduction of air from the external environment is not without risks, and the lung contains many specialized epithelial cell subtypes that are protecting the lung from foreign material and injury. Specialized cell subtypes are produced during lung development in the fetus as well as postnatally and injury to them due to genetic disease, premature birth, or postnatal environmental injury may lead to devastating disease. Chronic diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet successful interventions are often limited. Stem/progenitor cells have emerged as a potentially new preventative or therapeutic option. They are generally defined by the ability to undergo self-renewal and give rise to more differentiated cells. They are important in the early development of embryonic structures and organ differentiation in utero. Postnatally, they function in continued growth, maintenance, and regeneration. Clinically, the immunomodulatory properties of some classes of stem/progenitor cells avoid the major obstacle of immunological rejection seen in organ transplantation and other cell therapies. This review highlights some known human progenitor/stem cells and the most recent advances in stem cell therapies both in vivo and in vitro to prevent and treat pediatric lung disease.

AB  - The respiratory tract, once believed to be sterile, harbors diverse bacterial communities. The role of microorganisms within health and disease is slowly being unraveled. Evidence points to the neonatal period as a critical time for establishing stable bacterial communities and influencing immune responses important for long-term respiratory health. This review summarizes the evidence of early airway and lung bacterial colonization and the role the microbiome has on respiratory health in the short and long term. The challenges of neonatal respiratory microbiome studies and future research directions are also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite some clinician advocacy for the use of gabapentin to treat neonatal irritability of presumed neurological origin, the extent of gabapentin administration to hospitalized neonates is unknown. We aimed to identify trends in gabapentin utilization among infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across the United States and to evaluate the associations between clinical diagnoses and gabapentin treatment., METHODS: We analyzed neonates admitted to the NICU using the Pediatric Health Information System (2005 to 2016) to measure treatment timing, duration, and frequency. We used modified Poisson regression with a robust between-cluster variance estimator to calculate a probability (adjusted relative risk) for gabapentin administration., RESULTS: Of 278,403 neonates, 374 were administered gabapentin (0.13%). The median treatment duration was 16 days (25th to 75th percentile: 8; 40). Gabapentin use increased from 0% in 2005 to 0.39% in 2016. Treatment was prescribed to neonates at 31 of 48 studied hospitals; 73% of total treated infants localized to five neonatal intensive care units. Term (0.16%) and <=28 weeks' gestation preterm infants (0.22%) were most likely to receive gabapentin. Varying by gestational age, a diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, hemorrhagic stroke, and neonatal abstinence syndrome were associated with higher treatment with gabapentin. The majority (88.8%) of treated infants did not have a seizure diagnosis., CONCLUSION: Gabapentin use in NICU in the United States increased in recent years and varies markedly between institutions. Term infants, <=28 weeks' gestation preterm infants, and neonates with chronic genetic, neurological, and gastrointestinal diagnoses were more likely to receive gabapentin.

AB  - Proteomics, the large-scale study of the structure and function of proteins of a cell or organism, is a rapidly developing area of biomedical research which is perfectly suited to the study of pediatric lung injury, where a variety of samples are easily, and repeatedly, accessible including plasma (reflecting a whole body response) and broncheoalveolar lung fluid (reflecting the lungs response). When applied to pediatric lung injury, proteomics could be used to develop much needed early biomarkers of lung injury, elucidate pathological pathways and determine protein alterations associated with specific disease processes. However despite the obvious benefits and need, proteomics is rarely utilized in studies of pediatric injury. This review primarily reports on the last decade of pediatric research into proteomes associated with specific respiratory diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory infection, cystic fibrosis and asthma whilst also reflecting on the challenges unique to proteomic studies of the pediatric respiratory disease population. We conclude that the number of key pathological differences between the pediatric and adult study populations inhibit inference of results from adult studies onto a pediatric population and necessitate studies of the pediatric proteome. Furthermore the disparity amongst pediatric lung disease in terms of age at onset and underlying pathological mechanism (genetic, immunological, intervention-based, developmental arrest, inhaled toxin) will require proteomic studies which are well designed, with large disease specific patient sets to ensure adequate power as well as matched controls. Regardless of causative agent, pulmonary biomarkers are needed to predict the clinical course of pediatric lung disease, status, progression and response to treatment. Identification of early biomarkers is particularly pertinent in order to understand the natural history of disease and monitor progression so prevention of ongoing lung injury and impact on childhood can targeted.

AB  - Pathogenic variants in mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases result in a broad range of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders despite their shared role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. LARS2 encodes the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, which attaches leucine to its cognate tRNA. Sequence variants in LARS2 have previously been associated with Perrault syndrome, characterized by premature ovarian failure and hearing loss (OMIM #615300). In this study, we report variants in LARS2 that are associated with a severe multisystem metabolic disorder. The proband was born prematurely with severe lactic acidosis, hydrops, and sideroblastic anemia. She had multisystem complications with hyaline membrane disease, impaired cardiac function, a coagulopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and progressive renal disease and succumbed at 5 days of age. Whole exome sequencing of patient DNA revealed compound heterozygous variants in LARS2 (c.1289C>T; p.Ala430Val and c.1565C>A; p.Thr522Asn). The c.1565C>A (p.Thr522Asn) LARS2 variant has previously been associated with Perrault syndrome and both identified variants are predicted to be damaging (SIFT, PolyPhen). Muscle and liver samples from the proband did not display marked mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiency. Immunoblotting of patient muscle and liver showed LARS2 levels were reduced in liver and complex I protein levels were reduced in patient muscle and liver. Aminoacylation assays revealed p.Ala430Val LARS2 had an 18-fold loss of catalytic efficiency and p.Thr522Asn a 9-fold loss compared to wild-type LARS2. We suggest that the identified LARS2 variants are responsible for the severe multisystem clinical phenotype seen in this baby and that mutations in LARS2 can result in variable phenotypes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of preterm birth that contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units. BPD results from life-saving interventions, such as mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation used to manage preterm infants with acute respiratory failure, which may be complicated by pulmonary infection. The pathogenic pathways driving BPD are not well-delineated but include disturbances to the coordinated action of gene expression, cell-cell communication, physical forces, and cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), which together guide normal lung development. Efforts to further delineate these pathways have been assisted by the use of animal models of BPD, which rely on infection, injurious mechanical ventilation, or oxygen supplementation, where histopathological features of BPD can be mimicked. Notable among these are perturbations to ECM structures, namely, the organization of the elastin and collagen networks in the developing lung. Dysregulated collagen deposition and disturbed elastin fiber organization are pathological hallmarks of clinical and experimental BPD. Strides have been made in understanding the disturbances to ECM production in the developing lung, but much still remains to be discovered about how ECM maturation and turnover are dysregulated in aberrantly developing lungs. This review aims to inform the reader about the state-of-the-art concerning the ECM in BPD, to highlight the gaps in our knowledge and current controversies, and to suggest directions for future work in this exciting and complex area of lung development (patho)biology.

AB  - The concerted interaction of genetic and environmental factors acts on the preterm human immature lung with inflammation being the common denominator leading to the multifactorial origin of the most common chronic lung disease in infants - -bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Adverse perinatal exposure to infection/inflammation with added insults like invasive mecha nical ventilation, exposure to hyperoxia, and sepsis causes persistent immune dysregulation. In this review article, we have attempted to analyze and consolidate current knowledge about the role played by persistent prenatal and postnatal inflammation in the pathogenesis of BPD. While some parameters of the early inflammatory response (neutrophils, cytokines, etc.) may not be detectable after days to weeks of exposure to noxious stimuli, they have already initiated the signaling pathways of the inflammatory process/immune cascade and have affected permanent defects structurally and functionally in the BPD lungs. Hence, translational research aimed at prevention/amelioration of BPD needs to focus on dampening the inflammatory response at an early stage to prevent the cascade of events leading to lung injury with impaired healing resulting in the pathologic pulmonary phenotype of alveolar simplification and dysregulated vascularization characteristic of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a unique injury syndrome caused by prolonged injury and repair imposed on an immature and developing lung. The decreased septation and decreased microvascular development phenotype of BPD can be reproduced in newborn rodents with increased chronic oxygen exposure and in premature primates and sheep with oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation. The inflammation caused by oxidants, inflammatory agonists, and/or stretch injury from mechanical ventilation seems to promote the anatomic abnormalities. Multiple interventions targeted to specific inflammatory cells or pathways or targeted to decreasing ventilation-mediated injury can substantially prevent the anatomic changes associated with BPD in term rodents and in preterm sheep or primate models. Most of the anti-inflammatory therapies with benefit in animal models have not been tested clinically. None of the interventions that have been tested clinically are as effective as anticipated from the animal models. These inconsistencies in responses likely are explained by the antenatal differences in lung exposures of the developing animals relative to very preterm humans. The animals generally have normal lungs while the lungs of preterm infants are exposed variably to intrauterine inflammation, growth abnormalities, antenatal corticosteroids, and poorly understood effects from the causes of preterm delivery. The animal models have been essential for the definition of the mediators that can cause a BPD phenotype. These models will be necessary to develop and test future-targeted interventions to prevent and treat BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major complication of premature birth. Despite great achievements in perinatal medicine over the past decades, there is no treatment for BPD. Recent insights into the biology of stem/progenitor cells have ignited the hope of regenerating damaged organs. Animal experiments revealed promising lung protection/regeneration with stem/progenitor cells in experimental models of BPD and led to first clinical studies in infants. However, these therapies are still experimental and knowledge on the exact mechanisms of action of these cells is limited. Furthermore, heterogeneity of the therapeutic cell populations and missing potency assays currently limit our ability to predict a cell product's efficacy. Here, we review the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stromal, endothelial progenitor, and amniotic epithelial cells for BPD. Current knowledge on the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of stem cells is briefly summarized. Finally, we discuss the obstacles constraining their transition from bench-to-bedside and present potential approaches to overcome them.

AB  - Continuous improvements in perinatal care have resulted in increased survival of premature infants. Their immature lungs are prone to injury with mechanical ventilation and this may develop into chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Strategies to minimize the risk of lung injury have been developed and include improved antenatal management (education, regionalization, steroids, and antibiotics), exogenous surfactant administration and reduction of barotrauma by using exclusive or early noninvasive ventilatory support. The most frequently used mode of assisted ventilation is pressure support ventilation that may lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony that is associated with poor outcome. Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction or disuse atrophy of diaphragm fibers may also occur. This has led to the development of new ventilation modes including neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). This ventilation mode is controlled by electrodes embedded within a nasogastric catheter which detect the electrical diaphragmatic activity (Edi) and transmit it to trigger the ventilator in synchrony with the patient's own respiratory efforts. This permits the patient to control peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure and tidal volume. Back up pressure control (PC) is provided when there is no Edi signal and no pneumatic trigger. Compared with standard conventional ventilation, NAVA improves blood gas regulation with lower peak inspiratory pressure and oxygen requirements in preterm infants. NAVA is safe mode of ventilation. The majority of studies have shown no significant adverse events in neonates ventilated with NAVA nor a difference in the rate of intraventricular hemorrhage, pneumothorax, or necrotizing enterocolitis when compared to conventional ventilation. Future large size randomized controlled trials should be established to compare NAVA with volume targeted and pressure controlled ventilation in newborns with mature respiratory drive. Most previous studies and trials were not sufficiently large and did not include long-term patient oriented outcomes. Multicenter, randomized, outcome trials are needed to determine whether NAVA is effective in avoiding intubation, facilitating extubation, decreasing time of ventilation, reducing the incidence of CLD, decreasing length of stay, and improving long-term outcomes such as the duration of ventilation, length of hospital stay, rate of pneumothorax, CLD and other major complications of prematurity. In order to prevent barotrauma, next generations of NAVA equipment for neonatal use should enable automatic setting of ventilator parameters in the backup PC mode based on the values generated by NAVA. They should also include an upper limit to the inspiratory time as in conventional ventilation. The manufacturers of Edi catheters should produce smaller sizes available for extreme low birth weight infants. Newly developed ventilators should also include leak compensation and high frequency ventilation. A peripheral flow sensor is also essential to the proper delivery of all modes of conventional ventilation as well as NAVA.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that predominantly affects prematurely born infants. Initially, BPD was described in infants who had suffered severe respiratory failure and required high pressure, mechanical ventilation with high concentrations of supplementary oxygen. Now, it also occurs in very prematurely born infants who initially had minimal or even no signs of lung disease. These differences impact the nature of the lung function abnormalities suffered by "BPD" infants, which are also influenced by the criteria used to diagnose BPD and the oxygen saturation level used to determine the supplementary oxygen requirement. Key also to interpreting lung function data in this population is whether appropriate lung function tests have been used and in an adequately sized population to make meaningful conclusions. It should also be emphasized that BPD is a poor predictor of long-term respiratory morbidity. Bearing in mind those caveats, studies have consistently demonstrated that infants who develop BPD have low compliance and functional residual capacities and raised resistances in the neonatal period. There is, however, no agreement with regard to which early lung function measurement predicts the development of BPD, likely reflecting different techniques were used in different populations in often underpowered studies. During infancy, lung function generally improves, but importantly airflow limitation persists and small airway function appears to decline. Improvements in lung function following administration of diuretics or bronchodilators have not translated into long-term improvements in respiratory outcomes. By contrast, early differences in lung function related to different ventilation modes have led to investigation and demonstration that prophylactic, neonatal high-frequency oscillation appears to protect small airway function.

AB  - The early mouse embryonic lung, with its robust and apparently reproducible branching pattern, has always fascinated developmental biologists. They have extensively used this embryonic organ to decipher the role of mammalian orthologs of Drosophila genes in controlling the process of branching morphogenesis. During the early pseudoglandular stage, the embryonic lung is formed mostly of tubes that keep on branching. As the branching takes place, progenitor cells located in niches are also amplified and progressively differentiate along the proximo-distal and dorso-ventral axes of the lung. Such elaborate processes require coordinated interactions between signaling molecules arising from and acting on four functional domains: the epithelium, the endothelium, the mesenchyme, and the mesothelium. These interactions, quite well characterized in a relatively simple lung tubular structure remain elusive in the successive developmental and postnatal phases of lung development. In particular, a better understanding of the process underlying the formation of secondary septa, key structural units characteristic of the alveologenesis phase, is still missing. This structure is critical for the formation of a mature lung as it allows the subdivision of saccules in the early neonatal lung into alveoli, thereby considerably expanding the respiratory surface. Interruption of alveologenesis in preterm neonates underlies the pathogenesis of chronic neonatal lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. De novo formation of secondary septae appears also to be the limiting factor for lung regeneration in human patients with emphysema. In this review, we will therefore focus on what is known in terms of interactions between the different lung compartments and discuss the current understanding of mesenchymal cell lineage formation in the lung, focusing on secondary septae formation.

AB  - Excessive oxygen (O2) can cause tissue injury, scarring, aging, and even death. Our laboratory is studying O2-sensing pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and the PNEC-derived product gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from exposure to hyperoxia, ozone, or ionizing radiation (RT) can induce PNEC degranulation and GRP secretion. PNEC degranulation is also induced by hypoxia, and effects of hypoxia are mediated by free radicals. We have determined that excessive GRP leads to lung injury with acute and chronic inflammation, leading to pulmonary fibrosis (PF), triggered via ROS exposure or by directly treating mice with exogenous GRP. In animal models, GRP-blockade abrogates lung injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. The optimal time frame for GRP-blockade and the key target cell types remain to be determined. The concept of GRP as a mediator of ROS-induced tissue damage represents a paradigm shift about how O2 can cause injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. The host PNEC response in vivo may depend on individual ROS sensing mechanisms and subsequent GRP secretion. Ongoing scientific and clinical investigations promise to further clarify the molecular pathways and clinical relevance of GRP in the pathogenesis of diverse pediatric lung diseases.

AB  - Damage to alveoli, the gas-exchanging region of the lungs, is a component of many chronic and acute lung diseases. In addition, insufficient generation of alveoli results in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a disease of prematurity. Therefore visualising the process of alveolar development (alveologenesis) is critical for our understanding of lung homeostasis and for the development of treatments to repair and regenerate lung tissue. Here we show live alveologenesis, using long-term, time-lapse imaging of precision-cut lung slices. We reveal that during this process, epithelial cells are highly mobile and we identify specific cell behaviours that contribute to alveologenesis: cell clustering, hollowing and cell extension. Using the cytoskeleton inhibitors blebbistatin and cytochalasin D, we show that cell migration is a key driver of alveologenesis. This study reveals important novel information about lung biology and provides a new system in which to manipulate alveologenesis genetically and pharmacologically.

AB  - The alveolar surface is covered by large flat Type I cells (alveolar epithelial cells 1, AEC1). The normal physiological function of AEC1s involves gas exchange, based on their location in approximation to the capillary endothelium and their thinness, and in ion and water flux, as shown by the presence of solute active transport proteins, water channels, and impermeable tight junctions between cells. With the recent ability to produce relatively pure cultures of AEC1 cells, new functions have been described. These may be relevant to lung injury, repair, and the abnormal development that characterizes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To hypothesize a potential role for AEC1 in the development of lung injury and abnormal repair/development in premature lungs, evidence is presented for their presence in the developing lung, how their source may not be the Type II cell (AEC2) as has been assumed for 40 years, and how the cell can be damaged by same type of stressors as those which lead to BPD. Recent work shows that the cells are part of the innate immune response, capable of producing pro-inflammatory mediators, which could contribute to the increase in inflammation seen in early BPD. One of the receptors found exclusively on AEC1 cells in the lung, called RAGE, may also have a role in increased inflammation and alveolar simplification. While the current evidence for AEC1 involvement in BPD is circumstantial and limited at present, the accumulating data supports several hypotheses and questions regarding potential differences in the behavior of AEC1 cells from newborn and premature lung compared with the adult lung.

AB  - There is a strong evidence that histologic chorioamnionitis is associated with a reduction of incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Short-term maturational effects on the lungs of extremely premature infants seem to be, however, accompanied by a greater susceptibility of the lung, eventually contributing to an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Genetic susceptibility to BPD is an evolving area of research and several studies have directly related the risk of BPD to genomic variants. There is a substantial heterogeneity across the studies in the magnitude of the association between chorioamnionitis and BPD, and whether or not the association is statistically significant. Considerable variation is largely dependent on differences of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as on clinical and histopathological definitions. The presence of significant publication bias may exaggerate the magnitude of the association. Controlling for publication bias may conduct to adjusted results that are no longer significant. Recent studies generally seem to confirm the effect of chorioamnionitis on RDS incidence, while no effect on BPD is seen. Recent data suggest susceptibility for subsequent asthma to be increased on long-term followup. Additional research on this field is needed.

AB  - Gas exchange is a critical process required for sufficient tissue perfusion. The environment, genetics, or a combination of the two can affect this process. Various strategies have evolved to overcome the specific gas exchange challenges in different environments and it is clear that some genes are pivotal to the development of gas exchanging organs (e.g. Bmp4). Lower partial pressure of oxygen (hypoxia), reducing the partial pressure gradient, makes gas exchange more challenging and therefore the height to which gas exchangers can travel above sea level is limited. However, some human populations (e.g. Tibetans) and other animals (e.g. Bar-headed goose) have adapted well to profoundly hypoxic conditions, suggesting genetic factors are important. Gas exchange can also be affected by air pollution, including particulate matter and ozone among others, and exposure can lead to cardiopulmonary responses depending on individual susceptibility or preexisting disease, both of which have genetic and environmental components. Diseases that affect gas exchange include, but are not limited to, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Moreover, different species successfully exchange gases in their specific environment, for example animals that fly or burrow. Under these conditions, common genetic mechanisms, and their interaction with environment, help to maintain, or are detrimental to, gas exchange.

AB  - Advances in molecular genetics have enabled improvement of knowledge in pathogenesis and diagnosis of either monogenic or multifactorial neonatal lung diseases. Variants in genes regulating surfactant function and metabolism are implicated in some rare and common respiratory diseases. Congenital surfactant deficiencies are rare diseases due to mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins and cause significant and often lethal respiratory failure in newborns and interstitial lung disease in older children. Diagnosis is made by molecular analysis and eventually confirmed by histological analysis of lung tissue. A multifactorial contribution, resulting from interaction between multiple genes and environmental factors, has been supposed for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Several potential candidate genes, especially regarding surfactant proteins and cytokines, have been shown in association with these diseases. Genetic variants predisposing to RDS or BPD are usually polymorphisms which are not causative, but can increase susceptibility to the disease. Identification of infants at risk of disease can be useful to provide them individualized therapies. (www.actabiomedica.it).

We considered the evidence supporting the actual fluid and energy intake, proteins, lipids, and electrolytes requirement, and need for other nutrients in preterm infant at risk of developing BPD or with BPD. We concluded that, although many areas remain to be investigated, early nutrition support and careful adjustment of parenteral nutrition and appropriate enteral feeding selection may enhance the growth and contribute a better neurodevelopment in these patients.

AB  - ME, a 12-week-old premature infant with a history of complicated ventilatory support at birth, was referred to as a large tertiary centre for urgent retinal laser photocoagulation for retinopathy of prematurity. Following routine induction by a consultant paediatric anaesthetist, immediate ventilation difficulties were encountered, associated with a distended abdomen. Rapid assessment and escalation of the situation occurred, including assistance from several consultants. ME was diagnosed as having a pneumothorax. Rapid intervention, including needle decompression and insertion of a chest drain stabilised the patient. The procedure was cancelled, and the patient returned to intensive care. Over the next few days the patient gradually improved, and was gradually stepped down. The patient continued to improve, successfully overcoming the pneumothorax, pneumonia and insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and eventually was discharged back to the referring hospital.

AB  - AIM: To characterize postnatal changes in serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) in relation to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very preterm infants., METHODS: Longitudinal study of 108 infants with mean (SD) gestational age (GA) 27.2 (2.2) weeks. Weekly serum samples of IGF-I were analysed from birth until postmenstrual age (PMA) 36 weeks. Multivariate models were developed to identify independent predictors of BPD., RESULTS: Postnatal mean IGF-I levels at postnatal day (PND) 3-21 were lower in infants with BPD compared with infants with no BPD (16 vs. 26 mug/L, p < 0.001). Longitudinal postnatal change in IGF-I levels (IGF-I regression coefficient (beta)), PNDs 3-21, was lower in infants with BPD compared with infants with no BPD (0.28 vs. 0.97, p = 0.002) and mean IGF-I during PMA 30-33 weeks was lower in infants with BPD as compared with infants without BPD (22 vs. 29 mug/L, p < 0.001). In a binomial multiple regression model, lower GA, male gender and lower mean serum IGF-I levels during PND 3-21 were the most predictive risk factors associated with BPD (r(2) = 0.634, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Lower IGF-I concentrations during the first weeks after very preterm birth are associated with later development of BPD.

AB  - A case of a 19-year-old with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is presented. This case illustrates genetic (severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) and host factors (such as developmental diaphragmatic hernia and the innate response to injury), and environmental (high oxidative stress and lung injury) interactions that lead to severe chronic obstructive lung disease. The development of chronic lung disease was caused by lung injury under high oxidative and inflammatory conditions in the setting of a diaphragmatic hernia. In the absence of normal alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, a pro-elastolytic environment in the early period of lung growth enhanced the development of severe hyperinflation and precocious airflow obstruction.

AB  - The introduction of assisted ventilation for neonatal pulmonary insufficiency has resulted in the successful treatment of many previously fatal diseases. During the past three decades, refinement of invasive mechanical ventilation techniques has dramatically improved survival of many high-risk neonates. However, as with many advances in medicine, while mortality has been reduced, morbidity has increased in the surviving high-risk neonate. In this regard, introduction of assisted ventilation has been associated with chronic lung injury, also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This disease, unknown prior to the appearance of mechanical ventilation, has produced a population of patients characterized by ventilator or oxygen dependence with serious accompanying pulmonary and neurodevelopmental morbidity. The purpose of this article is to review non-invasive respiratory support methodologies to address the physiologic mechanisms by which these methods may prevent the pathophysiologic effects of invasive mechanical ventilation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common morbidities in preterm infants are associated with vascular pathology. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been implicated in repair of the vasculature, but their role in the pathogenesis of prematurity complications is not clear., OBJECTIVES: We prospectively investigated an association between the number of EPCs circulating in blood during delivery as well as 2 and 6 weeks afterwards, the level of growth factors regulating their migration/homing, and the incidence of premature birth complications., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study groups consisted of 90 preterm and 52 full-term infants. Early-EPCs (CD133+CD34+CD144+) and late-EPCs (CD133-CD34+CD144+) were analysed in cord blood (CB) and peripheral blood (PB)., RESULTS: We found higher early- and late-EPC counts in the CB of premature infants compared with full-term babies. The number of circulating early- and late-EPCs was inversely associated with the Apgar score of preterm infants. A positive association between the early-EPC count and the risk of respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and infections was found. Nevertheless, multivariate analysis revealed that a higher number of EPCs was not an independent predictor of prematurity complications, which were directly related to lower gestational age. The EPC count in full-term infants maintained a constant, relatively low level over the 6-week follow-up, whereas the EPC population in preterm infants gradually decreased during this period. Furthermore, the number of CB late-EPCs in preterm infants positively correlated with VEGF concentration., CONCLUSIONS: EPCs may play a considerable role in vascular development in preterm infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The laboratory mouse is widely used in preclinical models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, where lung alveolarization is stunted by exposure of pups to hyperoxia. Whether the diverse genetic backgrounds of different inbred mouse strains impacts lung development in newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia has not been systematically assessed., METHODS: Hyperoxia (85% O2 , 14 days)-induced perturbations to lung alveolarization were assessed by design-based stereology in C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, FVB/NJ, C3H/HeJ, and DBA/2J inbred mouse strains. The expression of components of the lung antioxidant machinery was assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot., RESULTS: Hyperoxia-reduced lung alveolar density in all five mouse strains to different degrees (C57BL/6J, 64.8%; FVB/NJ, 47.4%; BALB/cJ, 46.4%; DBA/2J, 45.9%; and C3H/HeJ, 35.9%). Hyperoxia caused a 94.5% increase in mean linear intercept in the C57BL/6J strain, whilst the C3H/HeJ strain was the least affected (31.6% increase). In contrast, hyperoxia caused a 65.4% increase in septal thickness in the FVB/NJ strain, where the C57BL/6J strain was the least affected (30.3% increase). The expression of components of the lung antioxidant machinery in response to hyperoxia was strain dependent, with the C57BL/6J strain exhibiting the most dramatic engagement. Baseline expression levels of components of the lung antioxidant systems were different in the five mouse strains studied, under both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions., CONCLUSION: The genetic background of laboratory mouse strains dramatically influenced the response of the developing lung to hyperoxic insult. This might be explained, at least in part, by differences in how antioxidant systems are engaged by different mouse strains after hyperoxia exposure. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Extremely low gestational age (GA) newborns (ELGANs) have the highest risk of ROP and might benefit most from treatment with antioxidants., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether recombinant human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (rhSOD) decreases the incidence or severity of ROP in ELGANs., METHODS: A previous multicenter trial of intratracheal rhSOD for prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia randomized 302 preterm infants to receive intratracheal rhSOD or placebo at birth and every 48 h for 1 month. An analysis of the incidence and severity of ROP was performed in ELGANs., RESULTS: The risk of ROP increased with decreasing GA. Within the entire cohort, no significant differences in ROP were found in the placebo versus rhSOD groups. Subgroup analysis on infants born at <26 weeks (n = 72) revealed a 22% reduction in ROP from 85% (placebo) to 66% (rhSOD) (p = 0.06). In subjects born at <25 weeks (n = 24), ROP was reduced by 53% from 85% (placebo) to 40% (rhSOD) (p = 0.03). ROP severity above stage 2 was found in 42% of placebo-treated infants but only 25% of rhSOD-treated subjects with ROP., CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis suggests that rhSOD reduces the risk of developing ROP in ELGANs, although further studies are required to confirm this observation.

AB  - Immaturity of the pulmonary and immune systems represents an important risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in neonates. Surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D, linking molecules between these two systems, are critical for lung homeostasis as they regulate surfactant metabolism and host immunodefense activities in innate and adaptive immunity. Preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome showed lower concentrations of SP-A and SP-D, and the administration of exogenous surfactant was found to strengthen the secretion of SPs. Low levels of SP-A and SP-D also correlated with a higher risk of infection and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Moreover, SP-A- and SP-D-enriched surfactant formulations were more resistant to the inhibitory action of the plasmatic proteins in animal models. Based on these assumptions, new-generation surfactants, enriched with SP-A and/or SP-D, may enhance the function of immune system and lungs in neonates, potentially improving the clinical outcome.

AB  - Palivizumab is one of the monoclonal antibodies for RS virus(RSV), and has been widely used to preterm infants, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and infants with congenital heart disease. Palivizumab can reduce admission rate and length of hospital stay due to lower respiratory tract infection by RSV. Palivizumab can also reduce the rate of later recurrent wheezing. Motavizumab, the 2nd generation monoclonal antibody, has 18-fold greater neutralizing capacity to RSV. Clinical trials of motavizumab finished, however, motavizumab has not been granted because of skin complication. In anti RSV drugs, ribavirin administration is not recommended because the effect is unclear. Clinical trials of some new anti RSV drugs and two live attenuated intranasal vaccines are underway.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a main complication of extreme prematurity. Bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) prevent lung injury in an O(2)-induced model of BPD. The low level of lung BM-MSC engraftment suggests alternate mechanisms-beyond cell replacement-to account for their therapeutic benefit. We hypothesized that BM-MSC prevent O(2)-induced BPD through a paracrine-mediated mechanism and that preconditioning of BM-MSC would further enhance this paracrine effect. To this end, conditioned medium (CM) from BM-MSC (MSCcm) or preconditioned CM harvested after 24 h of BM-MSC exposure to 95% O(2) (MSC-O2cm) were administrated for 21 days to newborn rats exposed to 95% O(2) from birth until postnatal day (P)14. Rat pups exposed to hyperoxia had fewer and enlarged air spaces and exhibited signs of pulmonary hypertension (PH), assessed by echo-Doppler, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary artery medial wall thickness. Daily intraperitoneal administration of both CM preserved alveolar growth. MSC-O2cm exerted the most potent therapeutic benefit and also prevented PH. CM of lung fibroblasts (control cells) had no effect. MSCcm had higher antioxidant capacity than control fibroblast CM. Preconditioning did not increase the antioxidant capacity in MSC-O2cm but produced higher levels of the naturally occurring antioxidant stanniocalcin-1 in MSC-O2cm. Ex vivo preconditioning enhances the paracrine effect of BM-MSC and opens new therapeutic options for cell-based therapies. Ex vivo preconditioning may also facilitate the discovery of MSC-derived repair molecules.

AB  - D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-trisphosphate (IP3) is an isomer of the naturally occurring second messenger D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, and exerts anti-inflammatory and antiedematous effects in the lung. Myo-inositol (Inos) is a component of IP3, and is thought to play an important role in the prevention of neonatal pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and neonatal acute lung injury (nALI). Inflammatory lung diseases are characterized by augmented acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) activity leading to ceramide production, a pathway that promotes increased vascular permeability, apoptosis, and surfactant alterations. A novel, clinically relevant triple-hit model of nALI was developed, consisting of repeated airway lavage, injurious ventilation, and lipopolysaccharide instillation into the airways, every 24 hours. Thirty-five piglets were randomized to one of four treatment protocols: control (no intervention), surfactant alone, surfactant + Inos, and surfactant + IP3. After 72 hours of mechanical ventilation, lungs were excised from the thorax for subsequent analyses. Clinically, oxygenation and ventilation improved, and extravascular lung water decreased significantly with the S + IP3 intervention. In pulmonary tissue, we observed decreased aSMase activity and ceramide concentrations, decreased caspase-8 concentrations, reduced alveolar epithelial apoptosis, the reduced expression of interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta1, and amphiregulin (an epithelial growth factor), reduced migration of blood-borne cells and particularly of CD14(+)/18(+) cells (macrophages) into the airspaces, and lower surfactant surface tensions in S + IP3-treated but not in S + Inos-treated piglets. We conclude that the admixture of IP3 to surfactant, but not of Inos, improves gas exchange and edema in our nALI model by the suppression of the governing enzyme aSMase, and that this treatment deserves clinical evaluation.

AB  - Continuous improvements in perinatal care have allowed the survival of ever more premature infants, making the task of protecting the extremely immature lung from injury increasingly challenging. Premature infants at risk of developing chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are now born at the late canalicular stage of lung development, just when the airways become juxtaposed to the lung vasculature and when gas-exchange becomes possible. Readily available strategies, including improved antenatal management (education, regionalization, steroids, and antibiotics), together with exogenous surfactant and exclusive/early noninvasive ventilatory support, will likely decrease the incidence/severity of BPD over the next few years. Nonetheless, because of the extreme immaturity of the developing lung, the extent to which disruption of lung growth after prematurity and neonatal management lead to an earlier or more aggravated decline in respiratory function in later life is a matter of concern. Consequently, much more needs to be learned about the mechanisms of lung development, injury, and repair. Recent insight into stem cell biology has sparked interest for stem cells to repair damaged organs. This review summarizes the exciting potential of stem cell-based therapies for lung diseases in general and BPD in particular.

AB  - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is widely used in neonatal units both as a primary mode of respiratory support and following extubation from mechanical ventilation. In this review, the evidence for CPAP use particularly in prematurely born infants is considered. Studies comparing methods of CPAP generation have yielded conflicting results, but meta-analysis of randomised trials has demonstrated that delivering CPAP via short nasal prongs is most effective in preventing re-intubation. At present, there is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or efficacy of high flow nasal cannulae for prematurely born infants. Observational studies highlighted that early CPAP use rather than intubation and ventilation was associated with a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but this has not been confirmed in three large randomised trials. Meta-analysis of the results of randomised trials has demonstrated that use of CPAP reduces extubation failure, particularly if a CPAP level of 5 cm H2O or more is used. Nasal injury can occur and is related to the length of time CPAP is used; weaning CPAP by pressure rather than by "time-cycling" reduces the weaning time and may reduce BPD. In conclusion, further studies are required to identify the optimum mode of CPAP generation and it is important that prematurely born infants are weaned from CPAP as soon as possible.

AB  - Normally developed thyroid function is critical to the transition from fetal to neonatal life with the onset of independent thermoregulation, the most conspicuous of the many ways in which thyroid secretions act throughout the body. A role for thyroid secretions in growth and maturation of the lungs as part of the preparation for the onset of breathing has been recognized for some time but how this contributes to tissue and cell processes and defenses under the duress of respiratory distress has not been well examined. Extensive archival autopsy material was searched for thyroid and adrenal weights, first by gestational age, and then for changes during the first hours after birth as ratios to body weight. After a gestational age of 22 weeks the fetal thyroid and adrenal glands at autopsy in those with hyaline membrane disease are persistently half the size of those in "normal" infants dying with other disorders. When the thyroid is examined shortly after birth it reveals a post natal loss of mass per body weight of similar orders of magnitude which does not occur in the control group. A clinical sample of premature infants with (12) and without (14) hyaline membrane disease was tested for T(4), TSH, TBG, and total serum protein. The results also demonstrate a special subset with lower birth weights at the same gestational age, and lower serum T(4) and total serum protein. Ventilatory distress in newborn rabbits was induced by bilateral cervical vagotomy at 24 h post natal following earlier injection of thyroxine (T(4)) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and comparisons were made with untreated animals and by dose. Early life thyroidectomy was performed followed by exposure to either air or 100% oxygen. A final experiment in air was vagotomy after thyroidectomy. Composite analysis of these methods indicates that thyroid factors are both operative and important in the newborn animal with ventilatory distress. This work and the archival data indicate those infants destined to develop hyaline membrane disease through respiratory distress are a distinct developmental and clinical subset with the point of departure from otherwise normal development and maturation in the second or early third trimester. This interval is known to be a period of marked variation in the overview indicators of fetal progress through gestational time. The initiating factor or circumstance which then separates this special subset from normal future development is placed by these observations firmly into the period when human fetal TSH dramatically rises 7-fold (17.5-25.5 weeks) followed by a lesser 3 to 4-fold increase in T(4) which is extended into the early third trimester. The earlier part of this interval is characterized by the thyrotrophic action of chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The possibility that abnormalities in the intrauterine environment secondary to maternal infection play a role within this time frame is indicated by the demonstration that interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces an anterior pituitary release of TSH. Since IL-2 has this property and is not an acute phase cytokine, some form of chronic infection or an immunopathic process seems more likely as a possible active factor in pathogenesis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in infants born extremely preterm, typically before 28 weeks' gestation, characterized by a prolonged need for supplemental oxygen or positive pressure ventilation beyond 36 weeks postmenstrual age. The limited number of autopsy samples available from infants with BPD in the postsurfactant era has revealed a reduced capacity for gas exchange resulting from simplification of the distal lung structure with fewer, larger alveoli because of a failure of normal lung alveolar septation and pulmonary microvascular development. The mechanisms responsible for alveolar simplification in BPD have not been fully elucidated, but mounting evidence suggests that aberrations in the cross-talk between growth factors of the lung mesenchyme and distal airspace epithelium have a key role. Animal models that recapitulate the human condition have expanded our knowledge of the pathology of BPD and have identified candidate matrix components and growth factors in the developing lung that are disrupted by conditions that predispose infants to BPD and interfere with normal vascular and alveolar morphogenesis. This review focuses on the deviations from normal lung development that define the pathophysiology of BPD and summarizes the various candidate mesenchyme-associated proteins and growth factors that have been identified as being disrupted in animal models of BPD. Finally, future areas of research to identify novel targets affected in arrested lung development and recovery are discussed. Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this systematic literature review was to examine current empirical research on general and respiratory health outcomes in adult survivors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: We searched seven databases up to the end of November 2010 (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Knowledge). We independently screened and included only those studies concerning the assessment of outcome measures in adult survivors of BPD. Data on methodologic design and findings were extracted from each included study; in addition, the methodologic quality of each study was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist., RESULTS: Fourteen cohort studies met the review criteria. Of those, a total of eight studies were considered to be of high quality (score 9-12), five of moderate quality (score 5-8), and only one was of low quality (score 0-4). In all studies of adult survivors of BPD, differences were found between the index and control groups, suggesting that many adults survivors of BPD who were born preterm or with very low birth weight had more respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function abnormalities compared with their peers. Five studies concerning radiologic findings reported structural changes persisting into adulthood. Findings from three studies suggested impairment in exercise capacity, although firm conclusions were limited by the small sample size in the studies reviewed., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with adults born at term, adult survivors of BPD have more impairment in general and respiratory health, which does not seem to diminish over time.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endocan levels were found to be associated with severity and mortality of the respiratory system diseases., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to figure out whether endocan was an important marker for the diagnosis, severity and follow-up of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infants with moderate/severe BPD, and who required hydrocortisone treatment were included in the study group. Infants without BPD were allocated in the control group. Endocan levels were compared between the control group and the study group, and before and after the treatment in the study group., RESULTS: A total of 148 infants, 74 infants in the control group and 74 infants in the BPD group, were included. The endocan level was higher in the BPD group than in the control group (P = .001). Endocan levels before treatment in the BPD group was found to be higher than endocan level after treatment (P = .021)., CONCLUSION: Our study found that endocan levels increased in moderate/severe BPD. Serum endocan levels may be a safe and novel indicator for the follow-up of response to treatment and the prognosis of the severity of the disease. Copyright © 2019 SEPAR.

AB  - Current evidence supports a major role for inherited factors in determining bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) susceptibility. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family of proteins maintain pulmonary homeostasis in the developing lung by aiding pathogen recognition and clearance, regulating inflammation, and facilitating reparative tissue growth. We hypothesized that sequence variation in the TLR pathway genes would alter the susceptibility/severity of BPD in preterm infants. Very low birth-weight infants were recruited prospectively in a multi-center study involving collection of blood samples and clinical information. Nine TLR pathway single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using a multiplexed single-base extension assay. BPD outcomes were compared among infants with and without the variant allele using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. In our cohort (n = 289), 66 (23.6%) infants developed BPD, out of which 32 (11.2%) developed severe BPD. The TLR5 (g.1174C > T) variant was associated with BPD (P = 0.03) and severe BPD (P = 0.004). The TIRAP (g.2054C > T) variant was associated with BPD (P = 0.04). Infants heterozygous for the X-linked IRAK1 (g.6435T > C) variant had a lower incidence of BPD compared to infants homozygous for either the reference or variant allele (P = 0.03). In regression models that controlled for potential epidemiological confounders, the TIRAP variant was associated with BPD, and the TLR5 variant was associated with severe BPD. Our data support the hypothesis that aberrant pathogen recognition in premature infants arising from TLR pathway genetic variation can contribute to BPD pathogenesis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) poses a significant global health problem. It mainly occurs in preterm infants. It is histopathologically characterized by fewer and larger alveoli and less secondary septa, suggesting an arrested or disordered lung development. To date, the mechanisms that lead to the pathophysiological changes in BPD have still not been totally understood. In embryonic development, histone deacetylase (HDAC) plays an important role by regulating gene transcription. Here, we hypothesize that a decreased HDAC expression and activity, caused by preterm birth or environmental stresses, contribute to a disorder in alveolar development in BPD. To this end, newborn Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to hyperoxia (85% O(2) ) were used to investigate the gene expression and protein activity of HDAC and alveolar development in lungs. Our results showed that hyperoxia exposure led to a suppression of the HDAC1/HDAC2 expression and activity, and the overall HDAC activity, as well as arrest of alveolarization, and an elevated expression of the cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) in the lungs of newborn rats. However, preservation of HDAC activity by theophylline significantly improved alveolar development and attenuated CINC-1 release, all of which were blocked by a specific HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). TSA alone can disturb the alveolar development in neonatal rats. Our findings indicate that a persistent exposure to hyperoxia leads to a suppressed HDAC activity, which causes disorders in pulmonary development. This effect may be mediated by CINC-1. Attenuation of CINC-1-mediated inflammation by activating HDAC may have a protective effect in BPD. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the major morbidity of extreme preterm birth. The incidence of BPD has remained stable despite recent efforts to reduce postnatal exposures to volutrauma and hyperoxia. This review will focus on recent clinical and experimental insights that provide support for the concept that the 'new BPD' is the result of inflammation-mediated injury and altered lung development during a window of vulnerability in genetically susceptible infants that is modified by maternal and postnatal exposures.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the major cause of pulmonary disease in infants. The pathophysiology and management of BPD changed with the improvement of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) management and with the increase of survival rates. Despite the improvements made, BPD is still a public health concern, resulting in frequent hospitalizations with high rates of mortality, impaired weight and height growth, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Lung injury in the neonatal period has multiple etiologic factors - genetic, hemodynamic, metabolic, nutritional, mechanical, and infectious mechanisms - act in a cumulative and synergic way. Free radical (FR) generation is largely recognized as the major cause of lung damage. Oxidative stress (OS) is the final common endpoint for a complex convergence of events, some genetically determined and some triggered by in utero stressors. Inflammatory placental disorders and chorioamnionitis also play an important role due to the coexistence of inflammatory and oxidative lesions. In addition, the contribution of airway inflammation has been extensively studied. The link between inflammation and OS injury involves the direct activation of inflammatory cells, especially granulocytes, which potentiates the inflammatory reaction. Individualized interventions to support ventilation, minimize oxygen exposure, minimize apnea, and encourage growth should decrease both the frequency and severity of BPD. Future perspectives suggest supplementation with enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic antioxidants. The use of antioxidants in preterm newborns particularly exposed to OS and at risk for BPD represents a logical strategy to ameliorate FRs injury, but further studies are needed to support this hypothesis.

AB  - Premature infants frequently develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Lung immaturity and impaired epithelial differentiation contribute together with invasive oxygen treatment to BPD onset and disease progression. Substantial evidence suggests that prematurity is associated with long term pulmonary consequences. Moreover, there is increasing concern that lung immaturity at birth may increase the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon remains unknown, largely as a consequence of inadequate experimental models and clinical follow-up studies. Recent evidence suggests that defective transcriptional regulation of epithelial differentiation and maturation may contribute to BPD pathogenesis as well as early onset of COPD. The transcriptional regulators CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha and C/EBPbeta, SMAD family member (Smad)3, GATA binding protein (GATA)6, and NK2 homeobox (NKX)2-1 are reported to be involved in processes contributing to pathogenesis of both BPD and COPD. Increased knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to early onset COPD among BPD survivors could translate into improved treatment strategies and reduced frequency of respiratory disorders among adult survivors of BPD. In this paper, we introduce critical transcriptional regulators in epithelial differentiation and summarize the current knowledge on the contribution of impaired epithelial maturation to the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disorders.

AB  - Inflammation is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is associated with prematurity of birth, sepsis, with increased production of both cytokines and nitric oxide, and with the shedding of bronchial epithelial cells. The pathological mechanisms involved in this disease remain unclear, in particular the role that epithelial maturity plays. The effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon immature and mature cells are examined within this study, using primary culture of human lung epithelial cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines increase inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and raise NO production, irrespective of cellular maturity. Pre-incubation with 1400W, a specific iNOS inhibitor, abrogated pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced NO generation and apoptosis. However, immature fetal lung epithelial cells were uniquely sensitive to cellular injury in response to cytokine exposure. These observations suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are present within BPD, may cause apoptosis of lung epithelial cells via de novo generation of NO. Furthermore, the prematurity of lung epithelial cells may be a factor in free radical mediated pulmonary damage.

AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most critical morbidities in preterm infants. The incidence of NEC is 7% in very-low-birth-weight infants, and its mortality is 15 to 30%. Infants who survive NEC have various complications, such as nosocomial infection, malnutrition, growth failure, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and neurodevelopmental delays. The most important etiology in the pathogenesis of NEC is structural and immunological intestinal immaturity. In preterm infants with immature gastrointestinal tracts, development of NEC may be associated with a variety of factors, such as colonization with pathogenic bacteria, secondary ischemia, genetic polymorphisms conferring NEC susceptibility, anemia with red blood cell transfusion, and sensitization to cow milk proteins. To date, a variety of preventive strategies has been accepted or attempted in clinical practice with regard to the pathogenesis of NEC. These strategies include the use of breast feeding, various feeding strategies, probiotics, prebiotics, glutamine and arginine, and lactoferrin. There is substantial evidence for the efficacy of breast feeding and the use of probiotics in infants with birth weights above 1,000 g, and these strategies are commonly used in clinical practice. Other preventive strategies, however, require further research to establish their effect on NEC.

AB  - Recent progress in neonatal medicine has enabled survival of many extremely low-birth-weight infants. Prenatal steroids, surfactants, and non-invasive ventilation have helped reduce the incidence of the classical form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia characterized by marked fibrosis and emphysema. However, a new form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia marked by arrest of alveolarization remains a complication in the postnatal course of extremely low-birth-weight infants. To better understand this challenging complication, detailed alveolarization mechanisms should be delineated. Proper alveolarization involves the temporal and spatial coordination of a number of cells, mediators, and genes. Cross-talk between the mesenchyme and the epithelium through soluble and diffusible factors are key processes of alveolarization. Lung interstitial cells derived from the mesenchyme play a crucial role in alveolarization. Peak alveolar formation coincides with intense lung interstitial cell proliferation. Myofibroblasts are essential for secondary septation, a critical process of alveolarization, and localize to the front lines of alveologenesis. The differentiation and migration of myofibroblasts are strictly controlled by various mediators and genes. Disruption of this finely controlled mechanism leads to abnormal alveolarization. Since arrest in alveolarization is a hallmark of a new form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, knowledge regarding the role of lung interstitial cells during alveolarization and their control mechanism will enable us to find more specific therapeutic strategies for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this review, the role of lung interstitial cells during alveolarization and control mechanisms of their differentiation and migration will be discussed.

AB  - Recent changes were introduced in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure children ventilation methods. There are evidences that less aggressive ventilation strategies can improve severe pulmonary injury survival. Experimental trials evidenced a relationship between inappropriate ventilatory measures and delayed acute pulmonary injury improvement, or even worsening. From this, a protective ventilatory measure arises in combination with alveolar recruitment maneuver. This association is believed in clinical practice to determine importantly reduced morbidity and mortality as well as reduced mechanic ventilation-induced injuries. It is indicated for acute lung injury patients, generally from pneumonia or sepsis, with severe hypoxemia. Its main contraindications are homodynamic instability, pneumothorax and intracranial hypertension. Experimental trials showed beneficial maneuver effects on both oxygenation and alveolar collapse. Adult studies showed improved pulmonary function with hypoxemia reversion. In children, the maneuver lead to significant inspired oxygen fraction and alveolar collapse reductions, less oxygen dependency, improved pulmonary complacency, and reduced bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, studies in children are limited. Additional investigation is warranted on this matter, and its clinical application evidence. A literature review was conducted based on textbooks and MEDLINE, Pubmed, Cochrane library, SciELO, and Ovid databases, from 1998 to 2009, both in Portuguese and English. Publications on alveolar recruitment maneuver both in adults and children, review articles, experimental and clinical trials were included using the key words: protective ventilatory strategy, alveolar recruitment maneuver, pediatrics and mechanic ventilation.

AB  - Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is primarily due to decreased production of pulmonary surfactant, and it is associated with significant neonatal morbidity and mortality. Exogenous pulmonary surfactant therapy is currently the treatment of choice for RDS, as it demonstrates the best clinical and economic outcomes. Studies confirm the benefits of surfactant therapy to include reductions in mortality, pneumothorax, and pulmonary interstitial emphysema, as well as improvements in oxygenation and an increased rate of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Phospholipids (PL) and surfactant-associated proteins (SP) play key roles in the physiological activity of surfactant. Different types of natural and synthetic surfactant preparations are currently available. To date, natural surfactants demonstrate superior outcomes compared to the synthetic surfactants, at least during the acute phase of RDS. This disparity is often attributed to biochemical differences including the presence of surfactant-associated proteins in natural products that are not found in the currently available synthetic surfactants. Comparative trials of the natural surfactants strive to establish the precise differences in clinical outcomes among the different preparations. As new surfactants become available, it is important to evaluate them relative to the known benefits of the previously existing surfactants. In order to elucidate the role of surfactant therapy in the management of RDS, it is important to review surfactant biochemistry, pharmacology, and outcomes from randomized clinical trials.

AB  - Oxidative stress and fibrosis are important stress responses that characterize bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease for which only a therapy but not a cure has been developed. In this work, we investigated the effects of mesenchymal stromal cells-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) on lung and brain compartment in an animal model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. Rat pups were intratracheally injected with MSC-EVs produced by human umbilical cord-derived MSC, following the Good Manufacturing Practice-grade (GMP-grade). After evaluating biodistribution of labelled MSC-EVs in rat pups left in normoxia and hyperoxia, oxidative stress and fibrosis investigation were performed. Oxidative stress protection by MSC-EVs treatment was proved both in lung and in brain. The lung epithelial compartment ameliorated glycosaminoglycan and surfactant protein expression in MSC-EVs-injected rat pups compared to untreated animals. Pups under hyperoxia exhibited a fibrotic phenotype in lungs shown by increased collagen deposition and also expression of profibrotic genes. Both parameters were reduced by treatment with MSC-EVs. We established an in vitro model of fibrosis and another of oxidative stress, and we proved that MSC-EVs suppressed the induction of alphaSMA, influencing collagen deposition and protecting from the oxidative stress. In conclusion, intratracheal administration of clinical-grade MSC-EVs protect from oxidative stress, improves pulmonary epithelial function, and counteracts the development of fibrosis. In the future, MSC-EVs could represent a new cure to prevent the development of BPD. Copyright © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Preoperative assessment of surgical neonates often relates to issues of prematurity, low birth weight, or associated malformations. This review explores the preoperative cardiopulmonary evaluation in specific newborn surgical populations, the role of echocardiography in congenital diaphragmatic hernia perioperative management, the impact of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the ex-preterm surgical neonate and a brief discussion on the risk of general anesthesia and specific anesthetic considerations for any surgical neonate. Newborns with congenital anomalies requiring early general surgical intervention should have an assessment for congenital heart disease. In the asymptomatic neonate, a thorough physical exam may be sufficient preoperatively. Neonates born with esophageal atresia or anorectal malformations should have a full evaluation for VACTERL associations. Initial echocardiography in congenital diaphragmatic hernia is used to evaluate anatomy, but there is emerging evidence to suggest the use of echocardiography in the ongoing surveillance of CDH to influence the timing of surgical intervention. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is present in up to 40% of ex-premature neonates and increases the risk of postoperative apneas and need for ventilatory support. However, all surgical neonates have an increased risk of post-operative apneas, and the need for surgical intervention should be balanced with the risk of general anesthesia. Copyright © 2019.

AB  - OBJECTIVE : Evaluate the efficacy and problems associated with nasal CPAP use. METHODS: 96 preterm newborns needing nasal CPAP either as initial ventilatory support or as weaning from the ventilator were studied prospectively. RESULTS: Nasal CPAP was used in children weighing 480g to 2,450g and corrected gestational age of 24 to 39 weeks. It was indicated in cases of apnea (12.5%), hyaline membrane disease (32.3%), pneumonia (4.2%), transient tachypnea (22%), and weaning from the ventilator (29%). The last indication was more frequent in children with lower weight (p<0.01). The median time in nasal CPAP was 60.3h. After CPAP installation, there was a significant improvement in the respiratory distress that was not shown in the blood gases analysis. The percentage of children with nasal hyperemia, nasal bleeding, abdominal distention and children that could be fed was directly proportional to how long they had been in nasal CPAP. Children weighting </= 1,000g had higher incidence of abdominal distention (p<0.01) and those with weight between 1,500 to 2,500g faced higher difficulty to be maintained on nasal CPAP (p=0.04). Therapeutic success was of 37% for children weighing </=1,000g, 59% for the ones weighing 1,000 to 1,500g, and 83% for those weighing 1,500 to 2,500g. CONCLUSIONS : Nasal CPAP is a good option for ventilatory assistance in preterm babies. It is a safe therapy which in general has only topic complications; it does not prevent patients from being fed during its use. Furthermore, it was successful in 59% of the studied patients. do CPAP nasal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite strong evidence linking infections to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), limitations of bacterial culture methods have precluded systematic studies of airway organisms relative to disease outcomes. Application of molecular bacterial identification strategies may provide new insight into the role of bacterial acquisition in the airways of preterm infants at risk for BPD., METHODS: Serial (within 72 hours, 7, 14, and 21 days of life) tracheal aspirate samples were collected from 10 preterm infants with gestational age <=34 weeks at birth, and birth weight of 500-1250 g who required mechanical ventilation for at least 21 days. Samples were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR assays for total bacterial load and by pyrosequencing for bacterial identification., RESULTS: Subjects were diagnosed with mild (1), moderate (3), or severe (5) BPD. One patient died prior to determination of disease severity. 107,487 sequences were analyzed, with mean of 3,359 (range 1,724-4,915) per sample. 2 of 10 samples collected <72 hours of life contained adequate bacterial DNA for successful sequence analysis, one of which was from a subject exposed to chorioamnionitis. All other samples exhibited bacterial loads >70copies/reaction. 72 organisms were observed in total. Seven organisms represented the dominant organism (>50% of total sequences) in 31/32 samples with positive sequences. A dominant organism represented>90% of total sequences in 13 samples. Staphylococcus, Ureaplasmaparvum, and Ureaplasmaurealyticum were the most frequently identified dominant organisms, but Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Escherichia were also identified., CONCLUSIONS: Early bacterial colonization with diverse species occursafter the first 3 days of life in the airways of intubated preterm infants, and can be characterized by bacterial load and marked species diversity. Molecular identification of bacteria in the lower airways of preterm infants has the potential to yield further insight into the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the chronic lung disease of prematurity mainly affecting preterm infants that are born at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Surfactant therapy, antenatal steroids and incremental improvements in perinatal care have modified the pattern of injury and allowed survival of ever more immature infants, but there is still no specific treatment for BPD. As a consequence, this disorder remains the most common complication of extreme prematurity. Arrested alveolar growth and disrupted vasculogenesis, the histological hallmarks of BPD, may persist beyond childhood and lead to chronic lung diseases in adults. Recent advances in our understanding of stem cells and their potential to repair damaged organs offer the possibility for cell-based treatment for intractable diseases. This review summarizes basic concepts of stem cell biology and discusses the recent advances and challenges of stem cell-based therapies for lung diseases, with a particular focus on BPD.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of infancy affecting mostly premature infants with significant morbidity and mortality. Improved survival of very immature infants has led to increased numbers of infants with this disorder. Acute and chronic lung injury and impaired postnatal lung growth are thought to be responsible for the development of BPD. Whereas changes in clinical practice have improved the clinical course and outcomes for infants with BPD, over the past decade, the overall incidence of BPD has not changed. This review will describe the prenatal and postnatal factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD as well as current and experimental therapies for treatment of BPD., RECENT FINDINGS: The factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD are well described; however, recent studies have better defined how these factors modulate lung growth. Inflammation, proinflammatory cytokines and altered angiogenic gene signaling contribute to lung injury and impair prenatal and postnatal lung growth resulting in BPD; however, to date no therapy has been identified that potently and consistently prevents or reverses their effects on lung growth. We will discuss the cell signaling pathways affected in BPD and current therapies available for modulating these pathways., SUMMARY: Despite current advances in neonatal care, BPD remains a heavy burden on healthcare resources. New treatments directed at either reducing lung injury or improving lung growth are under study.

AB  - Few signaling molecules have the potential to influence the developing mammal as the nucleoside adenosine. Adenosine levels increase rapidly with tissue hypoxia and inflammation. Adenosine antagonists include the methylxanthines caffeine and theophylline. The receptors that transduce adenosine action are the A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 adenosine receptors (ARs). In the postnatal period, A1AR activation may contribute to white matter injury in the preterm infant by altering oligodendrocyte (OL) development. In models of perinatal brain injury, caffeine is neuroprotective against periventricular white matter injury (PWMI) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Supporting the notion that blockade of adenosine action is of benefit in the premature infant, caffeine reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and CP in clinical studies. In comparison with the adverse effects on the postnatal brain, adenosine acts via A1ARs to play an essential role in protecting the embryo from hypoxia. Embryo protective effects are blocked by caffeine, and caffeine intake during early pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage and fetal growth retardation. Adenosine and adenosine antagonists play important modulatory roles during mammalian development. The protective and deleterious effects of adenosine depend on the time of exposure and target sites of action.

AB  - Premature birth is a major public health problem in the United States and internationally. Infants born at or before 32 weeks' gestation (2% of all births in the United States in 2007) are at extremely high risk for death in the neonatal period or for pulmonary, visual, and neurodevelopmental morbidities with lifelong consequences including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and brain injury. Risks for adverse outcomes increase with decreasing gestational age. The economic costs to care for these infants are also substantial (estimated at $26 billion in 2005 in the United States). It is clear that the need for strategies to improve outcomes for this high-risk population is great, and this need has prompted testing of new therapies with the potential to decrease pulmonary and other complications of prematurity. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) emerged as one such therapy. To provide health care professionals, families, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding the benefits and risks of iNO in premature infants, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health convened a consensus-development conference. Findings from a substantial body of experimental work in developing animals and other model systems suggest that nitric oxide may enhance lung growth and reduce lung inflammation independently of its effects on blood vessel resistance. Although this work demonstrates biological plausibility and the results of randomized controlled trials in term and near-term infants were positive, combined evidence from the 14 randomized controlled trials of iNO treatment in premature infants of <= 34 weeks' gestation shows equivocal effects on pulmonary outcomes, survival, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether angiopoietin-1 and endostatin levels in the cord blood could predict the subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 102 preterm (gestational age <= 32 weeks) infants (28 infants developed BPD and 74 had no BPD) were enrolled in the study. Cord plasma levels of angiopoietin-1 and endostatin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: Preterm infants who subsequently developed BPD had significantly lower cord plasma levels of angiopoietin-1 than those who did not (p < 0.001). Our results showed that cord plasma levels of endostatin were significantly higher in infants with BPD than in those without (p < 0.001). In infants with BPD, angiopoietin-1 levels in cord plasma correlated negatively with endostatin (r = -0.48; p = 0.008)., CONCLUSION: In preterm infants, low-angiopoietin-1 and high-endostatin levels in cord plasma at birth predict the subsequent development of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Whether the 4 Ureaplasma parvum and 10 Ureaplasma urealyticum serovars differ in virulence is unknown. This study was conducted to determine the distribution of Ureaplasma serovars in respiratory secretions of a prospective cohort of preterm infants and to assess whether any of the serovars are associated with BPD., METHODS: Serial endotracheal and/or nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained for Ureaplasma culture and PCR from 136 infants of gestational age <33 weeks. All positive samples were speciated and serovars were determined by real-time PCR., RESULTS: A total of 51 (37.5%) infants were Ureaplasma-positive one or more times during the first month of life. Respiratory colonization was inversely related to gestational age. Sixty-five percent of infants <26 weeks compared with 31% infants >= 26 weeks were culture or PCR positive. U. parvum was more common (N = 32, 63%) than U. urealyticum (N = 17, 33%); both species were present in 2 samples. Serovars 3 and 6 alone and in combination accounted for 96% U. parvum isolates. U. urealyticum isolates were commonly a mixture of multiple serovars, with serovar 11 alone or combined with other serovars (10/17, 59%) being the most common serovar. No individual species or serovars or serovar mixtures were associated with moderate-to-severe BPD., CONCLUSIONS: U. parvum serovars 3 and 6 and U. urealyticum serovar 11 were the most common serovars detected in respiratory samples from a prospective cohort of preterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide healthcare providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data on the use of inhaled nitric oxide in early routine, early rescue, or later rescue regimens in the care of premature infants <34 weeks gestation who require respiratory support., PARTICIPANTS: A non-Department of Health and Human Services, nonadvocate 16-member panel representing the fields of biostatistics, child psychology, clinical trials, ethics, family-centered care, neonatology, neurodevelopmental follow-up, nursing, pediatric epidemiology, neurobehavior, neurological surgery, neurology, and pulmonology, perinatology, and research methodology. In addition, 18 experts from pertinent fields presented data to the panel and conference audience., EVIDENCE: Presentations by experts and a systematic review of the literature prepared by the Johns Hopkins University Evidence-based Practice Center, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience., CONFERENCE PROCESS: The panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on published scientific literature. The draft statement was presented on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is a report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government., CONCLUSIONS: (1) Taken as a whole, the available evidence does not support use of inhaled nitric oxide in early routine, early rescue, or later rescue regimens in the care of premature infants <34 weeks gestation who require respiratory support. (2) There are rare clinical situations, including pulmonary hypertension or hypoplasia, that have been inadequately studied in which inhaled nitric oxide may have benefit in infants <34 weeks gestation. In such situations, clinicians should communicate with families regarding the current evidence on its risks and benefits as well as remaining uncertainties. (3) Basic research and animal studies have contributed to important understandings of inhaled nitric oxide benefits on lung development and function in infants at high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These promising results have only partly been realized in clinical trials of inhaled nitric oxide treatment in premature infants. Future research should seek to understand this gap. (4) Predefined subgroup and post hoc analyses of previous trials showing potential benefit of inhaled nitric oxide have generated hypotheses for future research for clinical trials. Prior strategies shown to be ineffective are discouraged unless new evidence emerges. The positive results of one multicenter trial, which was characterized by later timing, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment, require confirmation. Future trials should attempt to quantify the individual effects of each of these treatment-related variables (timing, dose, and duration), ideally by randomizing them separately. (5) Based on assessment of currently available data, hospitals, clinicians, and the pharmaceutical industry should avoid marketing inhaled nitric oxide for premature infants <34 weeks gestation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with chorioamnionitis and fetal lung inflammation. Ureaplasma species are the bacteria most frequently isolated from chorioamnionitis. Very chronic ureaplasma colonization of amniotic fluid causes low-grade lung inflammation and functional lung maturation in fetal sheep. Less is known about shorter exposures of the fetal lung. Therefore, we hypothesized that ureaplasmas would cause an acute inflammatory response that would alter lung development. Singleton ovine fetuses received intra-amniotic Ureaplasma parvum serovar 3 or control media at 110, 117, or 121 days and were delivered at 124 days gestational age (term = 150 days). Inflammation was assessed by 1) cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and 2) cytokine mRNA measurements, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry for inflammatory cells and elastin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) staining in lung tissue. Neutrophils were increased in BALF 3 days after exposure to ureaplasmas (P = 0.01). Myeloperoxidase-positive cells increased after 3 days (P = 0.03), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-positive cells increased after 14 days of ureaplasma exposure (P = 0.001). PU.1 (macrophage marker)- or CD3 (T lymphocyte marker)-positive cells were not induced by ureaplasmas. CD3-positive cells in the posterior mediastinal lymph node increased in ureaplasma-exposed animals at 3, 7, and 14 days (P = 0.002). Focal elastin depositions decreased in alveolar septa at 14 days (P = 0.002), whereas alpha-SMA increased in arteries and bronchioli. U. parvum induced a mild acute inflammatory response and changed elastin and alpha-SMA deposition in the lung, which may affect lung structure and subsequent development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are at high risk for long-term morbidities and an increased rate of re-hospitalization., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the type of re-hospitalization of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, from infancy through adolescence, and to assess the association of neonatal morbidities with specific types of re-hospitalization., STUDY DESIGN: The study cohort comprised 6,385 VLBW infants who were registered with the Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS) from their birth hospitalization. Data were collected for up to 18 years (median 10.7 years) following neonatal intensive care unit discharge. Hospitalization types were determined from the MHS coding. Neonatal morbidities included necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), grades 3-4 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Overall, 3,956 infants were re-hospitalized at least once and a total of 11,595 hospitalization types were identified. NEC, IVH, PVL, and BPD were associated with significantly higher aHRs for general pediatric (aHR 1.28-1.55), general surgical (aHR 1.18-1.46), and pediatric intensive care unit (aHR 1.57-2.04) hospitalizations. IVH and PVL were associated with significantly higher aHRs for orthopedic (aHR 2.12 and 4.88, respectively) and ophthalmology (1.76 and 4.02, respectively) hospitalizations. IVH was associated with a 14.2-fold higher aHR for neurosurgical admissions, and ROP with a 1.62-fold higher aHR for ophthalmology hospitalizations., CONCLUSION: Among VLBW infants, specific patterns of re-hospitalization types associated with major neonatal morbidities were identified as particularly high risks for orthopedic and ophthalmology hospitalizations in infants with IVH and PVL, and for intensive care admissions in infants with NEC and BPD.

AB  - AIMS: to summarize present knowledge regarding the relation between oxidative stress and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: relevant literature searched at Pubmed and other sources., RESULTS: Oxidative stress is generated in a number of conditions and by a number of causes such as inflammation and hyperoxia. Ontogenic aspects are discussed. Oxidative stress as physiological regulators, its relation to transcription factors and inflammation is summarized. The role of oxygen and antioxidant therapy and newborn resuscitation for development and prevention of BPD as well as new therapeutic modes especially the use of growth factors, gene therapy and stem cells, are briefly discussed., CONCLUSION: oxidative stress and BPD are associated. A better understanding of this association is necessary in order to reduce the severity and the incidence of the condition.

AB  - RATIONALE: Apelin, a potent vasodilator and angiogenic factor, may be a novel therapeutic agent in neonatal chronic lung disease, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia., OBJECTIVES: To determine the beneficial effect of apelin in neonatal rats with hyperoxia-induced lung injury, a model for premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: The cardiopulmonary effects of apelin treatment (62 mug/kg/d) were studied in neonatal rats by exposure to 100% oxygen, using two treatment strategies: early concurrent treatment during continuous exposure to hyperoxia for 10 days and late treatment and recovery in which treatment was started on Day 6 after hyperoxic injury for 9 days and continued during the 9-day recovery period. We investigated in both models the role of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in apelin treatment by specific inhibition of the nitric oxide synthase activity with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 25 mg/kg/d)., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Parameters investigated include survival, lung and heart histopathology, pulmonary fibrin deposition and inflammation, alveolar vascular leakage, lung cGMP levels, right ventricular hypertrophy, and differential mRNA expression in lung and heart tissue. Prophylactic treatment with apelin improved alveolarization and angiogenesis, increased lung cGMP levels, and reduced pulmonary fibrin deposition, inflammation, septum thickness, arteriolar wall thickness, and right ventricular hypertrophy. These beneficial effects were completely absent in the presence of L-NAME. In the injury-recovery model apelin also improved alveolarization and angiogenesis, reduced arteriolar wall thickness, and attenuated right ventricular hypertrophy., CONCLUSIONS: Apelin reduces pulmonary inflammation, fibrin deposition, and right ventricular hypertrophy, and partially restores alveolarization in rat pups with neonatal hyperoxic lung injury via a nitric oxide synthase-dependent mechanism.

AB  - A review of the evidence on prevention of acute bronchiolitis is presented. Acute bronchiolitis prevention arises from three basic approaches: preventive treatment to reduce recurrent wheezing following an episode of acute bronchiolitis, preventive treatment to reduce the frequency and severity of RSV bronchiolitis in the population at risk (prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, etc.), and general preventive measures to reduce nosocomial infection with RSV. There is sufficient evidence on the lack of efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids and montelukast. Intravenous RSV immunoglobulin has an unfavorable risk-benefit balance, particularly with the availability of monoclonal antibodies. Palivizumab is effective as preventive treatment of RSV infection in risk populations (high risk preterm infants and hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease), but not in the frequency and severity (ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation and mortality) of the acute bronchiolitis. The benefits of palivizumab (less admissions) seem to be worth the adverse effects, but we do not know the cost-benefit ratio. The control and prevention measures of nosocomial transmission of RSV infection (isolation, hand washing, use of mask, gloves, cap and shoes) are based on indirect evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is an accepted mode of respiratory support for preterm infants with respiratory insufficiency. To avoid potential sequelae of endotracheal (ET) intubation and mechanical ventilation, prophylactic aerosolization of surfactant delivered via nCPAP has been attempted with limited success., METHODS: To determine the feasibility and safety of prophylactic aerosolization of a peptide-containing synthetic surfactant, Aerosurf R (lucinactant for inhalation) was delivered by nCPAP to preterm infants at risk for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Neonates were enrolled into treatment group 1 (Aerosurf retreatment separated by at least 3 h) or treatment group 2 (Aerosurf retreatment separated by at least 1 h). A vibrating membrane nebulizer Aeroneb Pro R was used to aerosolize 20 mg/mL Aerosurf. All neonates received the initial 3-h treatment, and three retreatments were permitted within 48 h based on clinical response., RESULTS: Seventeen infants were enrolled. Aerosurf was well tolerated, with transient desaturations observed during dosing without bradycardia or hypotension. Variability in output rates of the Aeroneb Pro was observed leading to different average dispensed drug volumes per treatment per patient. All infants survived; 29.4% required subsequent ET surfactant replacement therapy, 23.5% were diagnosed with RDS at 24 h, and 11.8% with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days of life. Mean FiO2 was 0.4 at baseline, and 0.32 at 4 h posttreatment., CONCLUSIONS: Aerosurf can be safely administered via nCPAP in preterm infants at risk for RDS and may provide an alternative to surfactant administration via an ET tube. Further studies are required to evaluate this delivery approach.

AB  - The authors were given the charge of providing a vision of the future in paediatric respirology. Themes selected for being ripe for this visionary analysis include bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), lung infections, obstructive sleep disordered breathing (OSDB) and pulmonary diagnostics and monitoring. A profound reduction or elimination of BPD is seen. Given the strong genetic component of this disease, genetic biomarkers will likely be identified that will permit much earlier recognition of BPD susceptibility and potentially the ability to modify disease course by altering gene expression. The ultimate prevention of BPD will be to prevent prematurity, but recognition of both the genetic basis of BPD and the inflammatory background should lead to improved prevention and therapy. A clear understanding and definition of asthma phenotypes will lead to more specific and targeted therapy, earlier detection and prevention, better monitoring of severity and adherence to therapy, lower mortality and decreased inappropriate diagnosis of asthma. The greatest opportunities in asthma care will likely come through tools to improve adherence to effective therapy. Also, areas are identified where better therapies are needed such as in patients with severe mucus hypersecretion (secretory hyperresponsiveness) especially in those with life-threatening asthma. The future of CF is easier to foresee with early successes seen in clinical trials. After the expected ability to correct the CF transmembrane regulator, care will need to change and additional research will be needed. Additionally, the face of CF is changing with more adults than children presently having the disease. This will necessitate changes to our approach to treating this disease in a fortunately aging population. If we are going to affect the worldwide lung health of children, we will need to address respiratory infections particularly pneumonia, tuberculosis and HIV-associated infections. Preventive, diagnostic and treatment strategies will shape the future face of these problems. The availability of inexpensive, readily available, and rapid molecular techniques to identify true infection (including HIV and tuberculosis) may permit earlier use of effective therapy while preventing the inappropriate use of antibiotics for common viral diseases. Sleep medicine will continue to be an important aspect of paediatric pulmonology. The evaluation of OSDB cannot rely on full-night attended polysomnography due to limited access. Identifying reliable markers of end organ dysfunction in children with OSDB may permit more rapid identification of patients in need of intervention like CPAP and assisted breathing. In addition, management options, as an alternative to adenotonsilectomy, are listed with a call for further research. Pulmonary diagnostics and monitoring will see the development and refinement of tools like the lung clearance index and the analysis of exhaled gases, volatiles and dissolved biomarkers of inflammation as techniques that might help clinicians identify both the initiation of inflammation while it is more amenable to therapy, and to identify more readily the early changes associated with chronic lung diseases in children. The authors hope that these visionary articles will generate comments, arguments, inspiration, and perhaps even motivate funding agencies.

AB  - Chronic lung disease (CLD) is one of the most common long-term complications in very preterm infants. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of CLD in infancy. Modern neonatal respiratory care has witnessed the emergence of a new BPD that exhibits decreased fibrosis and emphysema, but also decreased alveolar septation, and microvascular development. CLD encompasses the classic and the new BPD, and recognizes that lung injury can occur in term infants who need aggressive ventilatory support and who develop lung injury as a result, and that CLD is a multisystem disease. Controversy exists on whether quality improvement (QI) methods that implement multiple interventions will be effective in limiting pathology with multiple causes. Caution in generalization of QI findings is encouraged. QI methods toward improvement in CLD or any other outcome should be considered as a tool for implementing evidence and studying the effects of change in complex adaptive systems.

AB  - Heparan sulfate (HS) is a structurally complex polysaccharide located on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, where it participates in numerous biological processes through interactions with a vast number of regulatory proteins such as growth factors and morphogens. HS is crucial for lung development; disruption of HS synthesis in flies and mice results in a major aberration of airway branching, and in mice, it results in neonatal death as a consequence of malformed lungs and respiratory distress. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions governing lung morphogenesis are directed by various diffusible proteins, many of which bind to, and are regulated by HS, including fibroblast growth factors, sonic hedgehog, and bone morphogenetic proteins. The majority of research into the molecular mechanisms underlying defective lung morphogenesis and pulmonary pathologies, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypoplasia associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), has focused on abnormal protein expression. The potential contribution of HS to abnormalities of lung development has yet to be explored to any significant extent, which is somewhat surprising given the abnormal lung phenotype exhibited by mutant mice synthesizing abnormal HS. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of HS and HS-binding proteins in lung morphogenesis and will present in vitro and in vivo evidence for the fundamental importance of HS in airway development. Finally, we will discuss the future possibility of HS-based therapeutics for ameliorating insufficient lung growth associated with lung diseases such as CDH. Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and young children, accounting for approximately 75,000-125,000 hospitalizations per year. It is estimated that in 2000, RSV infection accounted for 1.7 million office visits, 402,000 emergency room visits, and 236,000 hospital outpatient visits per year for children younger than 5 years of age. Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against RSV, is the only immunoprophylaxis therapy approved by the FDA for prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants (up to 2 years of age) who meet 1 or more of the following criteria for high risk: (a) gestational age up to 35 weeks;(b) diagnosis of chronic lung disease (CLD, formerly bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]); or (c) diagnosis of cyanotic or complex congenital heart disease. The RSV season typically occurs between November and March but may vary by region. During the period of our review, depending on local duration of the RSV season, infants usually required 5 monthly (every 28-30 days) intramuscular injections of palivizumab. Infants born in the middle of the season received their palivizumab doses from the time of birth to the end of the season and, therefore, may have required less than 5 doses.It is unclear if compliance with monthly doses is a problem and whether noncompliance increases the risk of RSV hospitalizations in routine clinical practice., OBJECTIVES: To (a) identify and describe compliance rates and the factors that influence parental compliance with immunoprophylaxis regimens, (b)review intervention programs and describe those that have been associated with increased compliance, and (c) summarize the association of compliance with RSV hospitalization rates., METHODS: An electronic literature search was conducted using journal databases, including Ovid, Current Contents, Embase, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; Ovid Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science;and an abstract database, Medical Intelligence Solution, for citations through April 2008. Specific search terms used were palivizumab with patient compliance, patient adherence, or patient persistence., RESULTS: Twenty-five articles and abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Available studies were mostly retrospective or observational prospective.Compliance, defined in various ways across the studies, varied between 25% and 100%, and 12 studies identified some of the factors related to noncompliance. Compliance generally was lower among Medicaid patients,African American patients, and other minorities. Ten studies (3 manuscripts and 7 abstracts) investigated the association of administration of prophylaxis through monthly home visits by a health professional with parental compliance with therapy. Most of the home-based programs were associated with higher compliance rates compared with clinic or office programs.Rates as high as 94% and 64% were achieved when Medicaid infants and infants of minority descent, respectively, received their doses through a home health program. When these infants received their doses at a clinic or office, depending on the definition of compliance, rates were 61%-100% for Medicaid infants and 44% for infants of minority descent. Reminder telephone calls to parents or caregivers, comprehensive multidisciplinary programs that included extensive counseling of parents, calendars with sticker reminders, and education in the language native to parents also were associated with increased compliance, although statistical significance was reported in only 1 study. Several studies recommended educating parents on the benefits of RSV prophylaxis, alleviating transportation and language difficulties, recognizing cultural differences and biases, and clarifying misperception of RSV illness severity. Home health programs had lower rates of RSV hospitalizations than office-based programs in 3 analyses conducted in 2 studies. In 4 other abstracts, the rates of RSV hospitalization for home health programs and office-based administration did not significantly differ. In a large, 4-season, prospective outcome study, compliant infants had lower RSV hospitalization rates than those who were not compliant under one definition of compliance (doses within 35-day intervals). RSV hospitalization rates were not significantly different using another definition of compliance (receipt of anticipated doses, expected vs. observed rates). In a large survey of 10,390 infants identified from pharmacy dispensing records, RSV hospitalization rates were 1.4% in the compliant group versus 3.1% in the noncompliant group (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001). Adjustment for confounding was not reported in these studies., CONCLUSION: Medicaid and minority infants were less likely to receive scheduled palivizumab doses. Home-based programs for the administration of palivizumab have been investigated more than other interventions and are associated with improved compliance compared with office-based administration. Compliance with dosing, in general, was associated with lower RSV hospitalization rates. However, these strategies should be further investigated using well-designed studies.

AB  - Although premature infants are increasingly surviving the neonatal period, up to one-third develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Despite evidence that bacterial colonization of the neonatal respiratory tract by certain bacteria may be a risk factor in BPD development, little is known about the role these bacteria play. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of culture-independent molecular profiling methodologies to identify potential etiological agents in neonatal airway secretions. This study used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone sequence analyses to characterize bacterial species in endo-tracheal (ET) aspirates from eight intubated pre-term infants. A wide range of different bacteria was identified in the samples. Forty-seven T-RF band lengths were resolved in the sample set, with a range of 0-15 separate species in each patient. Clone sequence analyses confirmed the identity of individual species detected by T-RFLP. We speculate that the identification of known opportunistic pathogens including S. aureus, Enterobacter sp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus sp., within the airways of pre-term infants, might be causally related to the subsequent development of BPD. Further, we suggest that culture-independent techniques, such as T-RFLP, hold important potential for the characterization of neonatal conditions, such as BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant. A variety of surfactant products including protein free synthetic surfactant have been developed and tested in the prevention and treatment of RDS., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of prophylactic administration of protein free synthetic surfactant (SS) on mortality, chronic lung disease and other morbidities associated with prematurity in preterm newborns at risk for developing RDS. Subgroup analysis were planned according to the degree of prematurity, surfactant product and dosage schedule., SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches were made of the The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL from 1966 to 2009. In addition, previous reviews including cross references and abstracts from the Society for Pediatric Research were searched. No language restrictions were applied., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of protein free SS administered to high risk preterm newborns at or shortly after birth in order to prevent RDS, mortality and complications of prematurity., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data regarding clinical outcomes was excerpted from the clinical trials by the reviewers. Data were analyzed according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group., MAIN RESULTS: Studies of prophylactic administration of protein free SS note a variable improvement in the respiratory status and a decrease in respiratory distress syndrome in infants who receive prophylactic protein free SS. The meta-analysis supports a decrease in the risk of pneumothorax (typical relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 0.50, 0.90), pulmonary interstitial emphysema (typical relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.50, 0.93), and neonatal mortality (typical relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.58, 0.85). No differences were seen in the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity and cerebral palsy. The meta-analysis supports an increase in the risk of patent ductus arteriosus associated with prophylactic SS administration (typical relative risk 1.11, 95% CI 1.00, 1.22), and an increase in the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage (typical relative risk 3.28, 95% CI 1.50, 7.16)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic intratracheal administration of protein free synthetic surfactant to infants at risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcome. Infants who receive prophylactic protein free SS have a decreased risk of pneumothorax, a decreased risk of pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and a decreased risk of neonatal mortality. Infants who receive prophylactic protein free SS have an increased risk of developing patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary hemorrhage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aurothioglucose- (ATG-) mediated inhibition of thioredoxin reductase-1 (TXNRD1) improves alveolarization in experimental murine bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Glutathione (GSH) mediates susceptibility to neonatal and adult oxidative lung injury. We have previously shown that ATG attenuates hyperoxic lung injury and enhances glutathione- (GSH-) dependent antioxidant defenses in adult mice., HYPOTHESIS: The present studies evaluated the effects of TXNRD1 inhibition on GSH-dependent antioxidant defenses in newborn mice in vivo and lung epithelia in vitro., METHODS: Newborn mice received intraperitoneal ATG or saline prior to room air or 85% hyperoxia exposure. Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic (Gclc) and modifier (Gclm) mRNA levels, total GSH levels, total GSH peroxidase (GPx) activity, and Gpx2 expression were determined in lung homogenates. In vitro, murine transformed club cells (mtCCs) were treated with the TXNRD1 inhibitor auranofin (AFN) or vehicle in the presence or absence of the GCL inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)., RESULTS: In vivo, ATG enhanced hyperoxia-induced increases in Gclc mRNA levels, total GSH contents, and GPx activity. In vitro, AFN increased Gclm mRNA levels, intracellular and extracellular GSH levels, and GPx activity. BSO prevented AFN-induced increases in GSH levels., CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with a model in which TXNRD1 inhibition augments hyperoxia-induced GSH-dependent antioxidant responses in neonatal mice. Discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro results highlight the need for methodologies that permit accurate assessments of the GSH system at the single-cell level.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: According to recent evidence, susceptibility to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants is predominantly inherited. The purpose of this review is to discuss current published genetic association studies in light of the accumulated knowledge in genomics., RECENT FINDINGS: Major advances in the development of next-generation genotyping and sequencing platforms, statistical methodologies, inventories of functional outcome of some common genetic polymorphisms and large-scale cataloguing of genetic variability among many of the world's ethnic populations have greatly facilitated the study of polygenic conditions. For BPD, genetic-association studies have primarily focused on components of innate (e.g. first-line) immune and antioxidant defences, mechanisms of vascular and lung remodelling, and surfactant proteins. However, studies have been limited in sample size and therefore fraught with a high probability of false-positive and false-negative associations. Nonetheless, candidate gene associations have indicated some novel biological pathways and provide a conceptual framework for the design of larger, collaborative population-based studies., SUMMARY: Although studies to date have not been able to identify reproducible genetic risk markers for BPD, they have directed us towards new, promising research avenues.

AB  - The role of infection in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. We present an observational study of 55 premature infants born weighing less than 1.3 kg within two level III neonatal intensive care units. Endotracheal aspirates (ETA) and nasogastric aspirates (NGA) were studied with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiling to elucidate the total bacterial community, and species-specific PCR was used to detect the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum. DGGE identified bacterial species in 59% of NGA and ETA samples combined. A diverse range of species were identified including several implicated in preterm labor. Species-specific PCR identified M. hominis in 25% of NGA and 11% of ETA samples. Among the 48 infants surviving up to 36 wk-postconceptual age, ordinal logistic regression showed the odds ratio for BPD or death where Ureaplasma was present/absent as 4.80 (95% CI 1.15-20.13). After adjusting for number of days ventilated, this was reduced to 2.04 (0.41-10.25). These data demonstrate how the combined use of DGGE and species-specific PCR identifies a high exposure in utero and around the time of birth to bacteria that might be causally related to preterm delivery and subsequent lung injury.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) refers to a heterogeneous group of lung disorders in infants that is commonly associated with prematurity and surfactant deficiency. BPD results from the complex interplay between impairments in the premature lung such as surfactant deficiency, perinatal insults such as infection, and damage resulting from supportive care of the infant due to barotrauma or volutrauma from mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity from supplemental oxygen administration. These factors result in chronic inflammation in the infant lung with recurring cycles of lung damage and repair that may impair alveolarization and vascularization in the developing lungs. As our insight in how to treat BPD improves along with the ability to do so with developing technology and therapies, the underlying pathogenesis will also change. The term 'new' BPD is now commonly used, to describe the changes seen in the post-surfactant era. This discussion reviews the pathogenesis of BPD according to the current medical literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-ins/del) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor 1166A/C polymorphism (ATR1166A/C) were reported to be associated with several unfavorable outcome parameters in preterm infants like bronchopulmonary dysplasia, persistent ductus arteriosus and impaired insulin sensitivity., OBJECTIVE: To confirm the above-mentioned associations in a large cohort of very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants., METHOD: Clinical data of VLBW infants were prospectively recorded. The ACE-ins/del polymorphism and the ATR1166A/C polymorphism were determined by polymerase chain reaction in 1,209 and 1,168 infants, respectively., RESULTS: There was no significant association between ACE-ins/del or ATR1166A/C genotype and outcome parameters (death, intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ventilation, supplemental oxygen at discharge, postnatal treatment with insulin, surgery for intestinal perforation/necrotizing enterocolitis/retinopathy of prematurity/persistent ductus arteriosus., CONCLUSION: Both known functional polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system do not seem to be associated with the outcome of VLBW infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal mortality remains high among infants of mothers with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although high glucose levels have been implicated, the mechanism is not well understood., AIMS: 1) to identify the causes of stillbirth and neonatal death in infants of women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes; 2) to determine whether the causes of perinatal mortality are the same for women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes; and 3) to ascertain the relationship between perinatal mortality and maternal glycemic control., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The case notes of women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus who had a stillbirth or neonatal death were identified and examined by 2 reviewers independently., RESULTS: Ninety-three perinatal deaths were identified (59 women with type 1 diabetes; 34 women with type 2 diabetes). There were 73 stillbirths, 12 were early neonatal deaths, and 8 were late neonatal deaths. Eighteen deaths were attributed to congenital anomalies, 64 to antepartum asphyxia, 4 to intrapartum asphyxia, 3 to postnatal hyaline membrane disease, 2 to postnatal infection, 1 was unclassifiable, and 1 case had no details available. Median postmenstrual age at death was 34 weeks for both women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Congenital anomalies were less common in women with type 1 diabetes than those with type 2 diabetes (rate ratio, 0.37 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.95]). The relationship between preconceptional and maximal maternal glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations and birth weight was curvilinear: at low HbA1c levels, the fetal weight was normal; when HbA1c levels were moderately raised, there was macrosomia; very high HbA1c levels were associated with severe intrauterine growth restriction., CONCLUSION: We describe a relationship between HbA1c and fetal weight. We consider that this provides evidence that hyperglycemia not only causes fetal macrosomia but also an angiopathy affecting the utero-placental blood vessels and consequent fetal hypoxia. These observations provide further evidence that good pre- and periconceptional glycemic control is likely to be of great importance in improving the outcome of pregnancies of women with diabetes.

AB  - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) should be diagnosed in the prenatal period and prompt referral to a tertiary referral center for imaging, genetic testing, and multidisciplinary counseling. Individual prediction of prognosis is based on the absence of additional anomalies, lung size, and liver herniation. In severe cases, a prenatal endotracheal balloon procedure is currently being offered at specialized centers. Fetal intervention is now also offered to milder cases within a trial, hypothesizing that this may reduce the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in survivors. Postnatal management has been standardized by European high-volume centers for the purpose of this and other trials.

AB  - Pulmonary inflammation has a central role in the multifactorial and complex pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Pre- and postnatal factors such as chorioamnionitis, oxygen toxicity, mechanical ventilation and postnatal infections can induce and perpetuate an injurious and complex inflammatory response in the airways and lung tissue of very immature infants. This inflammatory process is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory cells and an arsenal of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines, toxic oxygen radicals, lipid mediators and potent proteases. An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors favoring the proinflammatory process can be considered as a hallmark of lung injury. In addition, impaired mechanisms of tissue remodeling and repair together with a subnormal generation of growth factors could affect alveolarization and vascular development with lifelong consequences for the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease associated with premature birth and characterized by early lung injury. In this review we discuss some pitfalls, problems, and progress in this condition over the last decade, focusing mainly on the last 5 years, limited to studies in human neonates. Changes in the definition, pathogenesis, genetic susceptibility, and recent biomarkers associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be discussed. Progress in current management strategies, along with novel approaches/therapies, will be critically appraised. Finally, recent data on long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be summarized.

AB  - RATIONALE: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in lung development and perinatal lung function, and pulmonary NO synthases (NOS) are decreased in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) following preterm birth. Fetal estradiol levels increase during late gestation and estradiol up-regulates NOS, suggesting that after preterm birth estradiol deprivation causes attenuated lung NOS resulting in impaired pulmonary function., OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of postnatal estradiol administration in a primate model of BPD over 14 days after delivery at 125 days of gestation (term = 185 d)., METHODS: Cardiopulmonary function was assessed by echocardiography and whole body plethysmography. Lung morphometric and histopathologic analyses were performed, and NOS enzymatic activity and abundance were measured., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Estradiol caused an increase in blood pressure and ductus arteriosus closure. Expiratory resistance and lung compliance were also improved, and this occurred before spontaneous ductal closure. Furthermore, both oxygenation and ventilation indices were improved with estradiol, and the changes in lung function and ventilatory support requirements persisted throughout the study period. Whereas estradiol had negligible effect on indicators of lung inflammation and on lung structure assessed after the initial 14 days of ventilatory support, it caused an increase in lung neuronal and endothelial NOS enzymatic activity., CONCLUSIONS: In a primate model of BPD, postnatal estradiol treatment had favorable cardiovascular impact, enhanced pulmonary function, and lowered requirements for ventilatory support in association with an up-regulation of lung NOS. Estradiol may be an efficacious postnatal therapy to improve lung function and outcome in preterm infants.

AB  - A considerable body of human and animal experimental evidence links antenatal inflammation to both accelerated maturation and adverse development of the lung. Initial reports suggest that in preterm infants histological chorioamnionitis is associated with a decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), while the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is increased. Considerable variation exists in the findings of subsequent human studies, largely dependent on differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Taking these differences into account, recent studies generally seem to confirm the effect of chorioamnionitis on RDS incidence, while no effect on BPD is seen. The increased use of antenatal steroids and the diminished effects of secondary pro-inflammatory hits seem to explain part of this change. Additional research is needed to explore these complex interactions and their underlying mechanisms, and evaluate the long term pulmonary effects of antenatal inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral iron supplementation and RBC transfusions are routinely administered to very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants, although the potential risks of these exposures have not been adequately quantified. This study evaluated the association between the cumulative dose of enteral iron supplementation, total volume of RBCs transfused, and risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in VLBW infants., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter observational cohort study in Atlanta, Georgia. Cumulative supplemental enteral iron exposure and total volume of RBCs transfused were measured until the age at assessment of BPD. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to control for confounding, and the reliability of the factors was assessed in 1000 bootstrap models., RESULTS: A total of 598 VLBW infants were studied. In multivariable analyses, a greater cumulative dose of supplemental enteral iron exposure was associated with an increased risk of BPD (adjusted relative risk per 50-mg increase, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.11; p = 0.002). Similarly, a greater volume of RBCs transfused was associated with a higher risk of BPD (adjusted relative risk per 20-mL increase, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07; p < 0.001). Both factors were reliably associated with BPD (>50%). Volume of RBCs transfused was similar to gestational age in reliability as a risk factor for BPD (present in 100% of models) and was more reliable than mechanical ventilation at 1 week of age., CONCLUSION: The cumulative dose of supplemental enteral iron exposure and total volume of RBC transfusion are both independently associated with an increased risk of BPD in VLBW infants.

AB  - Interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, may have therapeutic potential in the fetal inflammatory response syndrome and its sequelae such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Our aim was to compare the effects of IL-10 versus dexamethasone (DEX) on important PMN functions of the newborn. PMNs were isolated into culture medium from cord blood after elective cesarean section deliveries. IL-10 and DEX were compared on an equimolar basis corresponding to previously measured plasma levels of DEX from infants treated for BPD. The endotoxin (LPS)-stimulated release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) and IL-1 beta, were markedly inhibited equally by IL-10 and DEX; the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 was not released and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) was released less with DEX compared with IL-10. PMNs exposed to LPS, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP), or S. aureus did not show a significant difference between control, DEX and IL-10 for apoptosis, respiratory burst, phagocytosis or killing respectively. Chemotaxis to fMLP or IL-8 was unaffected by DEX or IL-10. The principal effects of both IL-10 and DEX, on the PMN functions studied, are related to the control of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine release.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is thought to be one form of developmental arrest of the lung. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) participates in normal lung growth and in lung regeneration., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether HGF can improve alveolarization and attenuates functional abnormalities of a murine model of BPD induced by hyperoxia., METHODS: Three-day-old CD-1 mice were exposed to 90% of oxygen or room air (control group) for 7 days. These animals were then kept in room air for the next 7 days. Recombinant human (rh) HGF (100 microg/g b.w., divided 3 times, rhHGF group) or vehicle (vehicle group) was administered intraperitoneally during hyperoxia. On day 17, the pulmonary function test and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were examined. Mean linear intercepts (MLI) were measured as parameters of alveolarization. Cell renewal (on day 10) and vascularization of the lung were also evaluated., RESULTS: Exposure to hyperoxia induced increased airway resistance and BHR. These animals showed a severely simplified alveolar structure, increased MLI, decreased cell renewal (16.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 29.6 +/- 2.4%, p < 0.05), and decreased vascularization (15.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 18.4 +/- 1.5 vessels/hpf, p < 0.05, vehicle vs. control group, respectively). rhHGF treatment during exposure to hyperoxia significantly reduced all of these changes (27.9 +/- 1.7%, 18.2 +/- 0.5 vessels/hpf for cell renewal and vascularization, respectively; all values are p < 0.05 against vehicle animals)., CONCLUSION: HGF partially protects against the inhibition of alveolarization and improves functional abnormality in the hyperoxia-induced neonatal mice model of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oxidant injury and lung inflammation in extremely premature infants are associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Surfactant dysfunction resulting from these events may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Treatment with exogenous surfactant may decrease the incidence or severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We conducted a masked, multicenter, multinational, randomized, controlled, pilot study to estimate the effects of treating infants at high risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia with lucinactant, a synthetic, peptide-containing surfactant, on safety during dosing and the incidence of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: Preterm infants between 600 and 900 g requiring mechanical ventilation and a fraction of inspired oxygen of > or =0.30 between 3 and 10 days of age were randomly assigned to receive either sham air (placebo) or 1 of 2 doses of lucinactant (90 or 175 mg/kg total phospholipid) every 48 hours to a maximum of 5 doses, if they remained on mechanical ventilation., RESULTS: Of 136 infants enrolled at 34 sites, 44 received placebo, 47 received 90 mg/kg total phospholipid, and 45 received 175 mg/kg total phospholipid. The 90 mg/kg group had a significantly higher percentage of boys (64%) compared with the placebo group (39%); no other significant differences in baseline characteristics among groups were present. Compared with placebo, both the 90 mg/kg and 175 mg/kg groups experienced a significantly higher incidence of desaturation and bradycardia during dosing. Twenty-four hours after dosing, the mean fraction of inspired oxygen was lower in both lucinactant groups (33%) compared with the placebo group (39%). The incidence of mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 66% in the placebo group, 79% in the 90 mg/kg group, and 58% in the 175 mg/kg group. These differences were not statistically significant. There were no statistical differences among groups for pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, or mortality., CONCLUSIONS: There were trends toward lower oxygen requirements and toward a lower incidence of mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age in infants who received the higher dose of lucinactant, and this warrants further investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary vein stenosis is a rare, although often lethal, anomaly. Risk factors for the diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis are poorly characterized. In this study we sought to identify factors associated with pulmonary vein stenosis, paying particular attention to preterm birth., METHODS: By review of the cardiac database we identified all of the subjects with pulmonary vein stenosis over a 10-year period at our institution. Those children with anomalous pulmonary venous connection were not included. Patient-related variables were analyzed for their association with pulmonary vein stenosis. Pulmonary vein stenosis was diagnosed by spectral Doppler interrogation of the pulmonary veins (continuous, turbulent flow with calculated mean gradient > 5 mm Hg) and confirmed by cardiac catheterization in nearly all of the cases., RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with pulmonary vein stenosis were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 7.4 months; range: 1 day to 35 months. Congenital heart defects were present in the majority of subjects. Associated genetic syndromes were present in 8 subjects (31%). The 2-year survival rate from diagnosis was 43%. The majority of subjects (16 [61%]) were preterm. Gestational ages ranged from 24.2 to 41.0 weeks, and birth weights ranged from 460 to 4445 g. Preterm birth was strongly associated with the diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis, odds ratio 10.2 (95% CI 4.7-22.6), p < .001. Eleven (42%) of the 26 subjects were treated for bronchopulmonary dysplasia before being diagnosed with pulmonary vein stenosis., CONCLUSIONS: Prematurity is associated with the diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis. It is interesting to note that many of these patients also have intracardiac shunt lesions, which may act in concert with preterm endothelium to produce pulmonary vein stenosis.

AB  - This review briefly summarizes the evidence for a number of mainly drug-related strategies to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Oxygen supplementation is frequently used in neonatal units and oxygen toxicity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD. However, current evidence for an optimal oxygen saturation for extremely premature infants is scarce. This gap in knowledge will hopefully be closed by a number of ongoing or prospective trials addressing this issue. The role of inhalational nitric oxide in the prevention of BPD is still unclear despite existing data from a number of large randomized trials. Early administration of caffeine seems to confer a benefit with regard to BPD. Prophylactic or early application of surfactant may also be beneficial. High intramuscular doses of vitamin A slightly reduce the incidence of the disease. There is currently no evidence supporting other nutritional interventions to prevent BPD. Anti-inflammatory drugs, like alpha(1)-proteinase inhibitor, pentoxifylline and azithromycin, and antioxidants, like N-acetylcysteine and superoxide dismutase, have not been proven effective yet. Diuretics can ameliorate lung function, but there is no evidence supporting their long-term use. Ureaplasma urealyticum colonization of airways is associated with an increased risk of BPD. However, there is no proof for an effect of erythromycin on BPD. The potential roles for therapies like bombesin-like peptide-blocking antibodies or Clara cell 10-kDa protein have yet to be defined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Erythropoietin has been shown to be protective against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries in cell culture, animal models of brain injury, and clinical trials of adult humans. The rationale for our study was that early administration of high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin may reduce perinatal brain injury (intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia) in very preterm infants and improve neurodevelopmental outcome. We investigated whether administration of high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin to very preterm infants shortly after birth and subsequently during the first 2 days is safe in terms of short-term outcome., METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, single-center trial with a 2:1 allocation in favor of recombinant human erythropoietin. Preterm infants (gestational age: 24 to 31 weeks) were given recombinant human erythropoietin or NaCl 0.9% intravenously 3, 12 to 18, and 36 to 42 hours after birth., RESULTS: The percentage of infants who survived without brain injury or retinopathy was 53% in the recombinant human erythropoietin group and 60% in the placebo group. There were no relevant differences regarding short-term outcomes such as intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. For 5 infants who were in the recombinant human erythropoietin group and had a gestational age of <26 weeks, withdrawal of intensive care was decided (3 of 5 with severe bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, 2 of 5 with pulmonary insufficiency); no infant of the control group died. Recombinant human erythropoietin treatment did not result in significant differences in blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation, hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet count., CONCLUSIONS: No significant adverse effects of early high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin treatment in very preterm infants were identified. These results enable us to embark on a large multicenter trial with the aim of determining whether early high-dose administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to very preterm infants improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months' and 5 years' corrected age.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common, serious sequela of premature birth. Inflammation is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of BPD. Often initiated by a pulmonary fetal inflammatory response, lung inflammation is exacerbated by mechanical ventilation and exposure to supplemental oxygen. In response to these initiators of injury, a complex interaction occurs between proteins that attract inflammatory cells (ie, chemokines), proteins that facilitate the transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells from blood vessels (ie, adhesion molecules), proteins that promote tissue damage (ie, pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases), and proteins that modulate the process (eg, anti-inflammatory cytokines, binding proteins and receptor antagonists). In addition, during recovery from inflammatory injury, growth factors and other substances that control normal lung growth and mediate repair influence subsequent lung structure. In this review, we discuss the role of each aspect of the inflammatory process in the development of BPD. This discussion will include data from measurements of biomarkers in samples of fluid aspirated from the airways of human infants relevant to each phase of inflammation. Despite their limitations, these measurements provide some insight into the role of inflammation in the development of BPD and may be useful in identifying infants at risk for the disease.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or early surfactant therapy with early extubation onto nCPAP rather than continued mechanical ventilation has been adopted by many centres, particularly in Scandinavia, as part of the treatment of newborns with respiratory distress syndrome. It has been suggested that bronchopulmonary dysplasia is less of a problem in centres adopting such a policy. Results from randomized trials suggest prophylactic or early nCPAP may reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but further studies are required to determine the relative contributions of an early lung recruitment policy, early surfactant administration and nCPAP in reducing BPD. In addition, the optimum method of generating and delivering CPAP needs to be determined., CONCLUSION: The efficacy of nCPAP in improving long-term respiratory outcomes needs to be compared with the newer ventilator techniques with the optimum and timing of delivery of surfactant administration.

AB  - We reviewed the literature on the use of inhaled nitric oxide and the influence of supplemental oxygen on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and the role of endogenous nitric oxide-synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor, the interplay of nitric oxide and superoxide, protein nitration and the nuclear factor kappa B-pathway. BPD is a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity leading to arrested lung development in newborns. Several studies indicate that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) improves pulmonary angiogenesis, lung alveolarization, distal lung growth and pulmonary function in preterm infants. Given the inconclusive results of clinical studies, however, it is unclear which subpopulations of infants might benefit. Moreover, data on iNO are conflicting whether exogenous nitric oxide is protective or damaging in the presence of hyperoxia. The toxicology of iNO is poorly understood and its potential interaction with oxygen has to be considered given that infants treated with iNO are also supplemented with oxygen. The underlying mechanisms of the effects of iNO in the newborn lung need further analysis. New data clarifying the role of endogenous nitric oxide-synthases, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the interplay of nitric oxide and superoxide, and protein nitration with concurrent iNO-therapy might answer some of these questions.

AB  - Background The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) includes arrest of alveolar septation and enhanced fibrosis. We hypothesized that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in tracheal aspirates of mechanically ventilated premature infants differ in BPD and non-BPD infants. Methods Tracheal aspirates were collected during the first week of life. Mononuclear cells were separated, cultured and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. MSCs colony/cluster ratio was calculated as an index for dysplastic potentials. TGF-beta1 was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Setting : Neonatal intensive care unit. Patients Premature infants at risk for BPD. Results A total of 121 preterm infants were enrolled; 27 of them died and among the 94 survivors 23 infants had BPD. MSCs were identified in younger [gestational age (GA): 30.9+/-1.7 vs. 31.8+/-1.8, P=0.025] and smaller [birth weight (BW): 1.3+/-0.28 vs. 1.44+/-0.37 kg, P=0.04] infants with lower Apgar scores. The recovery rate of MSCs in BPD and non-BPD groups did not differ. BPD group had significantly smaller colony/cluster ratio compared to non-BPD (0.97 vs. 4.25, P=0.002). TGF-beta1 was significantly greater in BPD infants (4173.9+/-864.3 vs. 3705.8+/-540.5 pg/mL, P=0.021). Conclusion Infants with BPD had different MSCs morphology and greater TGF-beta1 expression. The pathogenesis for these morphological changes of resident lung MSCs needs further studying.

AB  - At least four premature newborn complications have been reported to be associated with low serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis and brain damage. Local IGF-I concentrations have only been reported for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and these findings show that lung IGF-I levels are clearly increased (epithelial lining fluid levels), emphasizing the fact that IGF-I is differently regulated in the general circulation or at local level. The present review discusses the meaning of the association between serum IGF-I amounts and development of complications in premature newborns. Finally, some methodological indications are reported regarding the IGF-I assay procedures. It is important to establish what are the possible relationships between blood levels and those of different compartments involved in the diseases.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to have a pivotal role in lung development and in a variety of pathologic conditions in the adult lung. Our earlier studies have shown that NO is a critical mediator of VEGF-induced vascular and extravascular effects in the adult murine lung. As significant differences have been reported in the cytokine responses in the adult versus the neonatal lung, we hypothesized that there may be significant differences in VEGF-induced alterations in the developing as opposed to the mature lung. Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) mediation of these VEGF-induced effects may be developmentally regulated. Using a novel externally regulatable lung-targeted transgenic murine model, we found that VEGF-induced pulmonary hemorrhage was mediated by NO-dependent mechanisms in adults and newborns. VEGF enhanced surfactant production in adults as well as increased surfactant and lung development in newborns, via an NO-independent mechanism. While the enhanced survival in hyperoxia in the adult was partly NO-dependent, there was enhanced hyperoxia-induced lung injury in the newborn. In addition, human amniotic fluid VEGF levels correlated positively with surfactant phospholipids. Tracheal aspirate VEGF levels had an initial spike, followed by a decline, and then a subsequent rise, in human neonates with an outcome of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death. Our data show that VEGF can have injurious as well as potentially beneficial developmental effects, of which some are NO dependent, others NO independent. This opens up the possibility of selective manipulation of any VEGF-based intervention using NO inhibitors for maximal potential clinical benefit.

AB  - Patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development represent severe affections for premature newborns, therefore the research of early markers for these two conditions is really important. The aim of this study is to analyze epithelial lining fluid (ELF) Neutrophil-gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels for prediction of lung injury or possible involvement of this molecule in PDA. Only scarce and contrasting results have previously been published in this field. In contrast, this molecule, included in a large macromolecular complex together with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), is considered an acceptable marker of infectious/inflammatory processes, cancer monitoring and induction of apoptotic pathway. NGAL was detected in 28 pre-term newborns by means of a commercially available kit in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The results have been corrected to ELF levels, by the urea method, to eliminate bias due to BALF collection. ELF NGAL levels were found significantly increased both in infants developing BPD or in those affected by PDA. By means of multivariate logistic regression analysis the significances were confirmed after adjusting for possible interfering variables such as gestational age and concomitant presence of both PDA and BPD. Our results stress the involvement of NGAL in the mechanisms leading to BPD and also suggest a possible association with PDA, which is often linked to prematurity and BPD development, probably due to the involvement of inflammatory and angiogenetic processes in both pathologies.

AB  - A large body of research indicates that children born very preterm are at increased risk for neurobehavioral impairments; however, research examining outcome for extremely preterm (EP) children is limited. This chapter will review the literature focusing on early development delay, general intellectual functioning, specific cognitive skills, basic educational skills, and behavioral and emotional functioning in children born <26 weeks' gestation or with a birth weight <750 g. Findings are generally consistent and indicate that a large proportion of EP children and their families will face major challenges, including significant development delay, cognitive impairments, learning disabilities, and behavioral and emotional problems. However, a considerable proportion of these high-risk children will escape major impairments, and this variability in outcome is thought to be related to genetic (gender), perinatal (brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and social-environmental (social risk, parenting) factors.

AB  - Despite tremendous advances in neonatology, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among premature infants. Any intervention that would reduce the risk of BPD or improve its outcome is likely to have substantial clinical and financial benefits. However, there is a clear lack of an effective agent for the treatment and/or prevention of BPD. This is due to an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. Taking a basic biological approach, our laboratory has discovered that disruption of normal alveolar homeostatic signaling is centrally involved in this process. Using a number of in vitro and in vivo models, our laboratory has demonstrated that stabilization of the normal alveolar homeostatic signaling pathway(s) can prevent and/or rescue the molecular injuries caused by the insults that lead to BPD. Here, we review the existing approaches to prevent and treat BPD and then, based on our insights into the pathogenesis of BPD, we propose novel and innovative therapeutic options that impact the disease on a cell/molecular level, unlike most of the current treatments available for BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Addition of energy supplements to preterm formulas is an optional strategy to increase the energy intake in infants requiring fluid restriction, in conditions like bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This strategy may lead to an undesirable increase in osmolality of feeds, the maximum recommended safe limit being 400 mOsm/kg. The aim of the study was to measure the changes in osmolality of several commercialized preterm formulas after addition of glucose polymers and medium-chain triglycerides., METHODS: Osmolality was measured by the freezing point depression method. Six powdered formulas with concentrations of 14 g/100 ml and 16 g/100 ml, and five ready-to-feed liquid formulas were analyzed. All formulas, were supplemented with 10% (low supplementation) or 20% (high supplementation) of additional calories, respectively, in the form of glucose polymers and medium chain triglycerides, maintaining a 1:1 glucose:lipid calorie ratio. Inter-analysis and intra-analysis coefficients of variation of the measurements were always < 3.9%., RESULTS: The mean osmolality (mOsm/kg) of the non-supplemented formulas varied between 268.5 and 315.3 mOsm/kg, increasing by 3-5% in low supplemented formulas, and by 6-10% in high supplemented formulas. None of the formulas analyzed exceeded 352.8 mOsm/kg., CONCLUSION: The supplementation of preterm formulas with nonprotein energy supplements with up to 20% additional calories did not exceed the maximum recommended osmolality for neonatal feedings.

AB  - The genital mycoplasmas represent a complex and unique group of microorganisms that have been associated with a wide array of infectious diseases in adults and infants. The lack of conclusive knowledge regarding the pathogenic potential of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. in many conditions is due to a general unfamiliarity of physicians and microbiology laboratories with their fastidious growth requirements, leading to difficulty in their detection; their high prevalence in healthy persons; the poor design of research studies attempting to base association with disease on the mere presence of the organisms in the lower urogenital tract; the failure to consider multifactorial aspects of diseases; and considering these genital mycoplasmas only as a last resort. The situation is now changing because of a greater appreciation of the genital mycoplasmas as perinatal pathogens and improvements in laboratory detection, particularly with regard to the development of powerful molecular nucleic acid amplification tests. This review summarizes the epidemiology of genital mycoplasmas as causes of neonatal infections and premature birth; evidence linking ureaplasmas with bronchopulmonary dysplasia; recent changes in the taxonomy of the genus Ureaplasma; the neonatal host response to mycoplasma and ureaplasma infections; advances in laboratory detection, including molecular methods; and therapeutic considerations for treatment of systemic diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was first described 40 years ago, the epidemiology of premature infants has changed considerably. With improved prenatal and obstetrical care and improved/less invasive ventilatory support, severe BPD is now rarely seen in infants born after 32 weeks gestational age, but it is still the most frequent complication to severe prematurity. Depending on the diagnostic criteria, between 40-60% of the infants weighing < 1000 g at birth have BPD., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Selected recent publications on BPD, with focus on etiology, prophylaxis, management and more recent diagnostic criteria form the basis for the article and discussions., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: BPD is a multifactorial condition, where the degree of prematurity plays an important role. Intrauterine environmental factors, genetics, inflammation, oxygen toxicity and ventilator treatment in acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome are also of importance. Much is still uncertain concerning the etiology, and BPD is also seen in infants with no or minimal ventilatory support. As a consequence, present strategies for prevention or treatment of BPD have so far been of only limited success.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication characterized by an anti-angiogenic environment. This can affect fetal pulmonary vascular and alveolar development but data of the impact of PE on respiratory outcome in extremely premature infants are inconclusive. The objective of this study was to determine if PE is associated with an increased risk for severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely premature infants., METHODS: Prospectively collected single center data from a cohort of infants born at 23-28 w gestational age between January 2005 and December 2015 were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis and generalized estimating equations were used to model the association between PE and severe RDS (>=30% supplemental oxygen on d1), BPD and severe BPD [supplemental oxygen and >=30% oxygen at 36 w postmenstrual age (PMA), respectively]., RESULTS: The cohort included 1218 infants of whom 23% were exposed to PE. PE was associated with increased risk for severe RDS as well as severe BPD among infants alive at 36w PMA., CONCLUSION: Exposure to preeclampsia is independently associated with an increased risk for severe RDS and adverse respiratory outcome in extreme premature infants. The mechanisms behind these associations need to be investigated.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common perinatal complication of very low birth weight preterm infants with a significant risk of long-term disability and morbidity. While clinical conditions such as prematurity and mechanical ventilation are its major risk factors, studies suggest that there is an individual susceptibility to BPD. This comprehensive review summarizes data collected about the implication of genetic polymorphisms in BPD and in its risk factors. Some studies have directly related the risk of BPD to genotype. Indeed, carrier states of genetic variants of cytokines (IFNgamma T+874A), adhesion molecules (L-selectin-Pro213Ser), elements of renin-angiotensin system (ACE-I/D), antioxidant enzymes (GST-P1 Val105Ile), and surfactant proteins (SPA1, SPB intron 4) has been identified as risk factors to BPD. Other studies investigated the role of genotype in BPD risk factors. Premature birth has been linked to carrier states of genetic variants with an impact on immune status (such as IL-6 G(-174)C, MBL2 54G/A, VEGF G+405C, HSP72 A+1267G genes) and matrix metalloproteases. Fetal inflammatory response syndrome, a major determinant of BPD is also affected by genotype (including LTalpha A+250G). Disturbed intrauterine lung development and vascularization may also contribute to BPD; these processes may be impaired in the presence of some rare genetic mutations. Furthermore, there is also a genetic component in the susceptibility to other perinatal adaptational disturbances such as respiratory distress syndrome that are associated with an increased need for mechanical ventilation, and, hence, with lung damage. The genetic variants presented in this article may help to identify infants at risk for BPD. Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We have taken a basic biologic approach to elucidate the pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, based on cell/molecular mechanisms of physiologic lung development. Stretch coordinates parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) signaling between the alveolar type II cell and the mesoderm to coordinately up-regulate key genes for the homeostatic fibroblast phenotype- including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP), and leptin- and the retrograde stimulation of type II cell surfactant synthesis by leptin. Each of these paracrine interactions requires cell-specific receptors on adjacent cells derived from the mesoderm or endoderm, respectively, to serially up-regulate the signaling pathways between and within each cell-type. It is this functional compartmentation that is key to understanding how specific agonists and antagonists can predictably affect this mechanism of alveolar homeostasis. Using a wide variety of pathophysiologic insults associated with BPD- barotrauma, oxotrauma, and infection, we have found that there are type II cell and/or fibroblast cell/molecular effects generated by these insults, which can lead to the BPD phenotype. We have exploited these cell-specific mechanisms to effectively prevent and treat lung injuries using PPARgamma agonists to sustain this signaling pathway. It is critically important to judiciously select physiologically and developmentally relevant interventions when treating the preterm neonate.

AB  - The pulmonary vascular endothelial cell plays a crucial role in the regulation of the pulmonary vascular tone and in the maintenance of the barrier function and integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane. It also plays a major role in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and angiogenesis and participates in inflammatory reactions. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a central growth and survival factor for the endothelial cell. Particularly high levels of VEGF are expressed in the lungs, reflecting the critical role of VEGF for lung development and structural integrity of the adult lung. Vascular endothelial growth factor exerts a variety of physiological and pathophysiological actions in the lung. Recent evidence suggests its involvement in the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, acute lung injury, emphysema, and pulmonary hypertension. To summarize the critical effects of VEGF on the pulmonary endothelial cell in the pathogenesis of these diseases, the purposes of this review are to (1) discuss the biological activities and intracellular signaling pathways of VEGF in the lung; (2) summarize the regulatory mechanisms involved in VEGF expression; (3)address the effects of VEGF on endothelial cells in hyperoxia-induced and other forms of lung injury; (4) highlight the endothelial effects of VEGF in the pathogenesis of emphysema; and (5) explore the role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

AB  - Microorganisms are hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. This hypothesis remains controversial. We sought to determine whether endotracheal colonization with Ureaplasma sp., adenovirus, or Chlamydia sp. increases the risk of BPD. Intubated VLBW infants were included. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was used to detect Ureaplasma sp., adenovirus, and Chlamydia sp. The outcome measure was BPD or death due to lung disease. Detection of microorganisms was compared between subjects with and without BPD. Logistic regression was used to control for covariates. Of 139 subjects, 33 (25%) screened positive for Ureaplasma sp., 22 of 136 (16%) were positive for adenovirus; eight of 133 (6%) were positive for Chlamydia sp. At 36 wk postmenstrual age, 14 patients had died, 68 (57%) had BPD. Detection of Ureaplasma sp. was associated with BPD or death (p < 0.001); adenovirus (p = 0.52) and Chlamydia sp. (p = 0.33) were not. Controlling confounding factors, the odds ratio for Ureaplasma sp. and BPD or death was 4.2 (95% CI 1.03, 17). In our population, detection of Ureaplasma sp., but not adenovirus or Chlamydia sp. was associated with BPD or death due to lung disease.

AB  - In this review, the authors assess major outcomes resulting from head-to-head comparison trials of animal-derived surfactants with previous and newer synthetic surfactants and among them. They also pay special attention to issues of study design and quality of the trials reviewed. Animal-derived surfactants that contain surfactant proteins (Survanta, Infasurf, and Curosurf) perform clinically better than Exosurf, a synthetic surfactant containing only phospholipids, primarily in outcomes related to acute management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; faster weaning and pneumothorax) but not in overall mortality or incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Trials comparing various animal-derived surfactants that provide different amounts of surface protein B (SP-B) or phospholipids have shown minor differences in outcomes related to the management of RDS or none at all. The exception is the suggestion of better survival using a high initial dose of Curosurf when compared with Survanta. This observation is based on analysis of trials of relatively lesser quality that have included a smaller number of infants than other surfactant comparisons, however. Data from recent trials comparing a new-generation synthetic surfactant that contains a peptide mimicking the action of SP-B, Surfaxin, have shown that it performs better than Exosurf (faster weaning and less BPD) and at least as well as the animal-derived surfactants Survanta and Curosurf. The ideal surfactant comparison trial to demonstrate which surfactant is better has yet to be conducted. Future surfactant comparison trials should pay particular attention to study design, be appropriately sized, and include long-term follow-up.

AB  - In this era of rapidly advancing vascular biology research, a vast array of growth factors and signaling molecules have been recognized as key players in the mechanisms that control lung vascular development. In the lung, vascular development is a complex, multistep process that includes specialization of primitive cells to vascular progenitors; formation of primitive vascular networks; remodeling with local regression and branching; specialization toward arteries, veins, and lymphatics; stabilization of vessels by matrix production and recruitment of supporting cells; and maintenance of the vascular structure. This complex, highly organized process requires exquisite orchestration of the regulatory activity of multiple molecules in a specific temporospatial order. Most of these molecules are members of 3 major growth factor families that have been recently identified. They are the vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin, and ephrin families. Understanding the functional reach of several members of these growth factor families is integral to an appreciation of the etiology and pathogenesis of developmental lung vascular disorders affecting newborns. This review summarizes recent advances in the molecular bases of lung vascular development and some of the pulmonary diseases resulting from aberrant vascular growth, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, alveolar capillary dysplasia, congenital cystic pulmonary disorders, congenital pulmonary hemangiomatosis, and lung hypoplasia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are significant global health problems at the extreme stages of life. Both are characterized by arrested alveolar development or loss of alveoli, respectively. Both lack effective treatment strategies. Knowledge about the genetic control of branching morphogenesis in mammals derives from investigations of the respiratory system in Drosophila, but mechanisms that regulate alveolar development remain poorly understood. Even less is known about regulation of the growth and development of the pulmonary vasculature. Understanding how alveoli and the underlying capillary network develop, and how these mechanisms are disrupted in disease states, are critical for developing effective therapies for lung diseases characterized by impaired alveolar structure. Recent observations have challenged old notions that the development of the blood vessels in the lung passively follows that of the airways. Rather, increasing evidence suggests that lung blood vessels actively promote alveolar growth during development and contribute to the maintenance of alveolar structures throughout postnatal life. Our working hypothesis is that disruption of angiogenesis impairs alveolarization, and that preservation of vascular growth and endothelial survival promotes growth and sustains the architecture of the distal airspace. Furthermore, the explosion of interest in stem cell biology suggests potential roles for endothelial progenitor cells in the pathogenesis or treatment of lung vascular disease. In this Pulmonary Perspective, we review recent data on the importance of the lung circulation, specifically examining the relationship between dysmorphic vascular growth and impaired alveolarization, and speculate on how these new insights may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - In vitro studies have suggested that members of the GATA and Nkx transcription factor families physically interact, and synergistically activate pulmonary epithelial- and cardiac-gene promoters. However, the relevance of this synergy has not been demonstrated in vivo. We show that Gata6-Titf1 (Gata6-Nkx2.1) double heterozygous (G6-Nkx DH) embryos and mice have severe defects in pulmonary epithelial differentiation and distal airway development, as well as reduced phospholipid production. The defects in G6-Nkx DH embryos and mice are similar to those observed in human neonates with respiratory distress syndromes, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and differential gene expression analysis reveals essential developmental pathways requiring synergistic regulation by both Gata6 and Titf1 (Nkx2.1). These studies indicate that Gata6 and Nkx2.1 act in a synergistic manner to direct pulmonary epithelial differentiation and development in vivo, providing direct evidence that interactions between these two transcription factor families are crucial for the development of the tissues in which they are co-expressed.

AB  - Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a multifactorial developmental disease caused by lung immaturity and presenting as high-permeability lung edema ("hyaline membrane disease"). It is characterized by a transient deficiency of alveolar surfactant during the first week of life. During the first few days of life, the alveolar surfactant pool size increases up to that in the controls. The allelic variants of the genes encoding the surfactant proteins (SP) SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B, and SP-C have been associated with RDS. The main SP-A haplotype, interactively with the SP-B Ile131Thr polymorphism and with constitutional and environmental factors, influence the risk. Case reports on mutations with partially functional SP-B have been published. The genetic susceptibility factors depend on the degree of prematurity at birth, consistent with sequential differentiation of the lung and gestation-dependent differences in clinical presentation. The preferentially type 2 cell expressed genes involved in critical functions (such as ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCA3), those involved in susceptibility to acute lung damage, and those with known susceptibility to other severe lung diseases (such as G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility, GPR154 alias GPRA) will possibly serve as candidate genes in future studies. RDS associated with near-term and term births may have a different genetic predisposition and pathogenesis compared to RDS after very preterm birth. As we learn more about the molecular consequences of allelic variation, new therapies based on a new generation of surfactant diagnostics and individualized therapies may follow.

AB  - Over the last 15 years neonatal morbidity and mortality have changed little for very low birth weight (VLBW) babies despite significant technological and therapeutic advances. While clinical trials and animal models have until recently improved outcomes in this gestational age group, further productivity from these traditional sources are not likely. A recent study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins shows that the main determinants of neonatal morbidity and mortality in VLBW babies--bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage--have significant genetic components. Incremental improvements in the future, therefore, will likely depend on identification of these genetic components for targeting specific therapies. Cost-effective methods and resources, fueled by the Human Genome and HapMap Projects and recent successes in identifying genes for a small number of complex genetic diseases, are available now and through creative planning and timely implementation would likely yield useful results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surviving preterm born children, postnatally exposed to high doses of dexamethasone, show an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairments. Regarding treatment with low doses of dexamethasone, no data exist on outcomes at school age., AIM: To assess the functional outcome at school age of preterm-born children treated with low-dose dexamethasone., STUDY DESIGN: In this cohort study, twenty-seven very preterm-born infants treated with dexamethasone from eight days after birth, underwent neuropsychological assessments at age 6-13years. Their scores were compared with those of the norm population, and scores on total IQ and motor functioning also with those of a preterm reference group, using one-sample-chi-square and student's t-tests., RESULTS: Compared with the norm population, performance of dexamethasone-treated children was poorer, particularly in the motor domain (mean z-score-1.81). Dexamethasone-treated children also had lower scores on IQ (-0.29 to -1.12), verbal memory (-0.41 to -0.56), attention (-0.90 to -1.28), and word generation (-0.75). Their parents reported behavioral problems more often. Compared with preterm peers, motor skills remained poor, but total IQs were similar. Adjustment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia did not change our results, because all surviving children had bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSIONS: At school age, the prevalence of adverse motor, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes of preterm-born children treated with low-dose dexamethasone is increased. This could be the consequence of either dexamethasone or BPD. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past year, a series of papers have reviewed the literature concerning assessment and interpretation of lung function in infants and young children with chronic lung disease of infancy. This manuscript, which represents the final paper in that series, summarizes the findings to date and highlights key areas for future research. Despite the huge literature in this field, interpretation of results and their use in guiding clinical management are still limited by difficulties in 'normalizing data' according to body size and maturation and selection of appropriate control groups. Furthermore, sensitive tests that more closely reflect the underlying pathophysiology of 'new' bronchopulmonary dysplasia, together with simple and reliable methods of assessing lung maturity at birth and true oxygen requirements at specified time points are urgently required. Research in this field is also challenged by the need to separate the independent effects of genetic predisposition, gene-environment interactions, preterm delivery, neonatal respiratory disorders and various treatment strategies on the growing lung. The extent to which disruption of lung growth following premature exposure to the extra-uterine environment leads to an earlier or more aggravated decline in respiratory function in later adult life remains to be elucidated. Whatever its origin, given the increasing survival of smaller and more immature infants, the long term sequelae of neonatal lung disease, are likely to continue to change, requiring ongoing, carefully designed longitudinal studies. Future research strategies need to encompass a multicenter, multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach with closer links between clinicians and basic scientists, to ensure that the most relevant research questions are addressed using appropriate methodology and that findings are implemented into clinical practice in a more timely fashion.

AB  - Here, we describe the approach of defining the genetic contribution to disease and discuss the polymorphisms of some genes that are associated with respiratory disease. The common allelic variants of SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D genes are associated with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. The main SP-A haplotype, interactively with SP-B Ile131Thr polymorphism and with constitutional and environmental factors, influences the risk of RDS. The polymorphisms of SP-A2 and SP-D are associated with the risk of severe RSV. The polymorphism may turn out to be important in susceptibility to influenza virus. The SP-B intron 4 deletion variant is the risk factor of BPD. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the hereditary risk may lead to new focused treatment strategies.

AB  - Due to a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) still remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the premature infant and there is no effective preventive and/or therapeutic intervention. We have taken a basic biologic approach to elucidate the pathophysiology of BPD and have discovered that disruption of the alveolar Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP) signaling is centrally involved in this process. Further, stabilization of this signaling pathway by using exogenous PTHrP agonists can prevent and/or rescue the molecular injuries caused by insults that lead to BPD. Based upon years of work in this field, here I provide a novel and innovative molecular approach, i.e, exogenous treatment with PTHrP pathway agonists to prevent and/or treat BPD. However, to avoid any later surprises, it is important to emphasize that before translating it into human trials, this approach needs further testing and refinement in animal models.

AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and cost considerations of exogenous lung surfactants are reviewed., SUMMARY: Exogenous pulmonary surfactants, along with advancements in ventilatory care, have significantly reduced the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and its related complications in infants. The following exogenous surfactants are approved for the prophylaxis and treatment (rescue) of neonatal RDS: beractant, a modified natural surfactant; calfactant and poractant, both natural surfactants; and colfosceril, a synthetic surfactant that is not currently available in the United States. Lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant, is under investigation and received approvable status from the Food and Drug Administration in February 2005. The surfactants are delivered directly to their site of action, and only small amounts reach the systemic circulation. Bioavailability to the distal airways and alveoli depends on the method of delivery, the stage and severity of pulmonary disease, and the properties of the particular surfactant. According to data from clinical trials, the use of exogenous surfactant therapy for rescue within the first two hours of life appears to be as efficacious as prophylaxis in most premature infants., CONCLUSION: Comparative trials of surfactants have proven the efficacy of both synthetic and natural surfactants in the prevention and treatment of RDS. However, these trials have universally demonstrated greater reduction in the immediate need for ventilator support in infants who receive natural surfactants. Natural preparations cause less pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and mortality compared with synthetic preparations. Synthetic agents offer the potential advantages of an unlimited supply with consistent pharmaceutical quality and no risk of transmitting infectious disease or causing immunologic sensitization.

AB  - Nutrition plays a critical role in the prevention and management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Growth failure in infants with BPD is predominantly due to malnutrition. Malnutrition can worsen BPD by compromising lung growth. Feeding difficulties in these infants can further affect nutrition. Dexamethasone, used to facilitate extubation and treat severe BPD, is known to have adverse effects on growth. Nutritional management of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants should be addressed from the first day of life to enhance growth and minimize respiratory morbidity. Fluid restriction, parenteral nutrition with protein and lipids, and early enteral feeding may help decrease the incidence of BPD. High calorie concentrated formula can be used in infants to achieve adequate growth if total daily fluid intake is restricted. Vitamin A supplementation may help to prevent further damage to lungs. The role of such therapies as inositol, vitamin E, and selenium in management of these infants remains speculative. Close post discharge follow up of infants with BPD is necessary to monitor growth and to ensure intake of sufficient protein and calories.

AB  - Over the last 15 years, neonatal morbidity and mortality has changed little for very low birth weight babies despite significant technological and therapeutic advances. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a major problem despite antenatal steroid use, surfactant replacement therapy, gentle noninvasive ventilation techniques, permissive hypercarbia, and judicious use of oxygen. Current evidence supports multiple contributing factors. Prematurity is the cardinal factor; others include pulmonary baro/volutrauma, hyperoxia, and inflammation. BPD is an end product of pulmonary inflammatory response and lung repair with impaired alveolarization and vascularization in response to lung injury. These sequences involve multiple morphoregulatory molecules, which have a range of activities largely determined by genetic variability. A clearer understanding of genetic susceptibility for BPD has recently emerged. Twin studies have shown that the BPD status of one twin, even after correcting for contributing factors, is a highly significant predictor of BPD in the second twin. After controlling for covariates, genetic factors account for 53% (P = 0.004, 95% CI = 16%-89%) of the variance in liability for BPD. Incremental improvements will likely depend on identification of these genetic components for targeting specific therapies.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), initially described 40 years ago, is a dynamic clinical entity that continues to affect tens of thousands of premature infants each year. BPD was first characterized as a fibrotic pulmonary endpoint following severe Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). It was the result of pulmonary healing after RDS, high oxygen exposure, positive pressure ventilation, and poor bronchial drainage secondary to endotracheal intubation in premature infants. With improved treatment for RDS, including surfactant replacement, oxygen saturation monitoring, improved modes of mechanical ventilation, antibiotic therapies, nutritional support, and infants surviving at younger gestations, the clinical picture of BPD has changed. In the following pages, we will summarize the multifaceted pathophysiologic factors leading to the pulmonary changes in "new" BPD, which is primarily characterized by disordered or delayed development. The contribution of hyperoxia and hypoxia, mechanical forces, vascular maldevelopment, inflammation, fluid management, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), nutrition, and genetics will be discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease have nutritional deficits that may contribute to short and long term morbidity and mortality. Increasing the daily energy intake for these infants may improve their respiratory, growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of increased energy intake on mortality and respiratory, growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes for preterm infants with (or developing) CLD/BPD. Secondarily, the review examines any adverse effects associated with increased energy intake., SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006) , MEDLINE (accessed via Ovid), references cited in previous relevant Cochrane reviews and in other relevant studies, review articles, standard textbooks, and manuals of neonatal medicine. Hand search results of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were also assessed., SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing the outcomes of preterm infants with (or developing) CLD/BPD who had either increased (> 135 kcal/kg/day) or standard energy intake (98 to 135 kcal/kg/day). Increasing energy intake might be achieved enterally and/or parenterally, enterally by increasing the energy content of the milk, increasing feed volume, or by nutrient supplementation with protein, carbohydrate or fat. The primary outcomes were the development of CLD and neonatal mortality; secondary outcomes included respiratory morbidities, growth, neurodevelopmental status and possible complications with increased energy intake., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We planned to extract data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Relevant trials would be scrutinized for methodological quality independently by the reviewers to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Data of the included trials would be expressed as relative risk, risk difference, NNT and weighted mean difference where appropriate, using a fixed effect model., MAIN RESULTS: No eligible trials were identified. Twelve studies that appeared to be relevant were excluded, as no study directly compared increased versus standard energy intakes in infants with CLD/BPD. However, two excluded trials provided some insights into the topic. One study showed that infants with CLD/BPD who were fed formula enriched with protein and minerals had improved growth parameters up until the cessation of the intervention at three months of corrected age. The other study compared different energy density of formula but identical energy intake by setting different feed volumes for both groups. It showed that both groups were unable to achieve the pre-designated feed volumes, and that there were no differences in growth, respiratory outcomes, oedema and the diuretic requirements., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To date, no randomized controlled trials are available that examine the effects of increased versus standard energy intake for preterm infants with (or developing) CLD/BPD. Research should be directed at evaluating the effects of various levels of energy intake on this group of infants on clinically important outcomes like mortality, respiratory status, growth and neurodevelopment. The benefits and harms of various ways of increasing energy intake, including higher energy density of milk feed and/or fluid volume (clinically realistic target volume should be set), parenteral nutrition, and the use of various constituents of energy like carbohydrate, protein and fat for this purpose also need to be assessed.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Conventional wisdom holds that complications of immature organ systems such as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are the primary causes of the high neonatal morbidity and mortality attendant preterm delivery. However, recent evidence suggests that a major cause of prematurity-associated neonatal pathology is the fetal and neonatal response to inflammation/infection. Although functional genomics offered the promise of providing answers to many of these questions, the identification of the genes intrinsic to human parturition proved to be a difficult task. Proteomic profiling of the amniotic fluid (AF) provides a precise means for detection of inflammation by revealing the presence of 4 biomarkers (defensins-2 and -1, calgranulin-C, and calgranulin-A) that are highly predictive of intrauterine inflammation (MR score). The MR score is especially useful as it presents a gradient of disease activity progressing from "absent" to "mild" to "severe" inflammation. Thus, it provides the ability to identify patients who may benefit from interventions in utero in a modern diagnostic-therapeutic framework., TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians., LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to explain that the cause or causes of preterm delivery are still unknown, recall that functional genomics has not given the answer to these causes, and state that proteomic profiling of amniotic fluid, through mass-restricted (MR) scoring, may be predictive of intrauterine inflammation and allow for potential diagnosis and potential therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary inflammation, increased production of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and vitamin A deficiency are risk factors for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. To determine the mechanisms by which IL-1beta influences lung development, we have generated transgenic mice in which human IL-1beta is expressed in the lung epithelium with a doxycycline-inducible system controlled by the Clara cell secretory protein promoter. Perinatal IL-1beta production in these mice causes a phenotype that is strikingly similar to BPD. Pulmonary pathology in the mice shows inflammation, lack of alveolar septation, and impaired vascular development of the lung, similar to the histological characteristics of BPD. Retinoic acid (RA), one of the most biologically active derivatives of vitamin A, increases septation. Proteins involved in mediating the cellular responses to RA include the cellular retinoic acid binding proteins CRABP-I and CRABP-II and the nuclear retinoic acid receptors RAR-alpha, RAR-beta, and RAR-gamma., OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that IL-1beta inhibits the expression of proteins involved in mediating the cellular response to RA., METHODS: The mRNA expression of CRABP-I, CRABP-II, RAR-alpha1, RAR-beta2, RAR-beta4, and RAR-gamma2 was studied with real-time RT-PCR on gestational day 18, and postnatal days 0, 1, 5, and 7 in IL-1beta-expressing mice and their control littermates. In addition, immunohistochemistry for CRABP-I was performed., RESULTS: IL-1beta decreased the mRNA expression and protein production of CRABP-I as well as the mRNA expression of RAR-gamma2. In contrast, no differences between IL-1beta-expressing and control mice were detected in the expression of CRABP-II, RAR-alpha1, RAR-beta2, or RAR-beta4., CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates for the first time a link between inflammation and the retinoic acid pathway. Inhibition of CRABP-I and RAR-gamma2 expression may be one mechanism by which inflammation prevents alveolar septation. The therapeutic potential of RA in promoting septation in the setting of perinatal lung inflammation deserves further investigation.

Although endothelial cells (ECs) have metabolic flexibility to maintain cell function under stress, it is unknown whether hyperoxia causes metabolic dysregulation in ECs, leading to lung injury. We hypothesized that hyperoxia alters EC metabolism, which causes EC dysfunction and lung injury. To test this hypothesis, we exposed lung ECs to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) followed by air recovery (O2/rec). We found that O2/rec reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation without affecting mitochondrial DNA copy number or mitochondrial mass and that it specifically decreased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in ECs. This was associated with increased ceramide synthesis and apoptosis. Genetic deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), a rate-limiting enzyme for carnitine shuttle, further augmented O2/rec-induced apoptosis. O2/rec-induced ceramide synthesis and apoptosis were attenuated when the FAO was enhanced by l-carnitine. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) between Postnatal Days 1 and 4 and were administered l-carnitine (150 and 300 mg/kg, i.p.) or etomoxir, a specific Cpt1 inhibitor (30 mg/kg, i.p.), daily between Postnatal Days 10 and 14. Etomoxir aggravated O2/rec-induced apoptosis and simplified alveolarization and vascularization in mouse lungs. Similarly, arrested alveolarization and reduced vessel numbers were further augmented in EC-specific Cpt1a-knockout mice compared with wild-type littermates in response to O2/rec. Treatment with l-carnitine (300 mg/kg) attenuated O2/rec-induced lung injury, including simplified alveolarization and decreased vessel numbers. Altogether, enhancing FAO protects against hyperoxia-induced EC apoptosis and lung injury in neonates.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Site-specific variables that contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) can be identified., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the demographic, nutrition and growth characteristics of infants at risk for developing BPD at two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs: sites A and O)., STUDY DESIGN: Records of 306 infants of < or = [corrected] 30 weeks gestational age (GA) who survived to at least 36 weeks postmenstrual age were retrospectively reviewed. Data were obtained for maternal and neonatal demographics, weights, total fluids, calories, carbohydrate, protein and fat intake at birth, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of life., RESULTS: BPD rates were not different at the two sites. No statistical differences were noted in the incidence of maternal chorioamnionitis, pregnancy-induced hypertension or use of antenatal steroids among infants who developed BPD (n = 169) and those who did not (n = 137). White race, birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome requiring surfactant, sepsis and patent ductus arteriosus were significantly associated (all P < or =0.03) with BPD. After controlling for significant confounding variables, infants who developed BPD had significantly (P < 0.001) less weight gain, received less calories and fat in the first postnatal month. In the 26 to 28 weeks GA group, the odds of getting BPD were 5.4 (95%CI: 1.4 to 21.3) times greater for site A than site O (P = 0.017)., CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that while some decrease in BPD can be achieved by focusing on ventilation/oxygen use, this approach is unlikely to impact on the youngest infants.

AB  - Various pre- and postnatal risk factors, which act additively or synergistically induce an injurious inflammatory response in the airways and the pulmonary interstitium of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This inflammatory response is characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages as well as an arsenal of proinflammatory mediators that affect the endothelium and alveolar-capillary integrity. Besides proinflammatory cytokines and toxic oxygen radicals, lipid mediators as well as potent proteases may be responsible for acute lung injury. There is increasing evidence that an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, which should protect the alveoli and lung tissue, are key features in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In addition, a subnormal generation of growth factors may affect alveolarization and vascular development in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this condensed review article, the current concepts on the possible role of inflammation in the evolution of bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be summarized.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and extracellular matrix remodeling are key processes of embryonic lung development. Lung smooth muscle cells, which are derived from the mesenchyme, form a sheath around bronchi and blood vessels. During lung organogenesis, smooth muscle differentiation coincides with epithelial branching morphogenesis and closely follows developing airways spatially and temporally. The precise function of parabronchial smooth muscle (PBSM) cells in healthy adult lung remains unclear. However, PBSM may regulate epithelial branching morphogenesis during lung development by the induction of mechanical stress or through regulation of paracrine signaling pathways. Alveolar myofibroblasts are interstitial contractile cells that share features and may share an origin with smooth muscle cells. Alveolar myofibroblasts are essential for secondary septation, a process critical for the development of the gas-exchange region of the lung. Dysregulation of PBSM or alveolar myofibroblast development is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of many lung diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, and interstitial fibrosis. We review the current understanding of the regulation of PBSM and alveolar myofibroblast development, and discuss the role of PBSM in lung development. We specifically focus on the role of these cells in the context of fibroblast growth factor-10, sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein-4, retinoic acid, and Wnt signaling pathways in the regulation of lung branching morphogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a complex chronic lung disease in premature children in which oxidative stress and surfactant deficiency play a crucial role, is characterized by arrested alveolar and vascular development of the immature lung. The spatial and temporal patterns of expression of surfactant proteins are not yet fully established in newborn infants and animal models suffering from BPD., METHODS: We studied the mRNA expression of surfactant proteins (SP) A, -B, -C and -D and Clara cell secretory protein (CC10) with RT-PCR and in situ hybridization and protein expression of CC10, SP-A and -D with immunohistochemistry in the lungs of a preterm rat model, in which experimental BPD was induced by prolonged oxidative stress., RESULTS: Gene expression of all surfactant proteins (SP-A, -B, -C and -D) was high at birth and initially declined during neonatal development, but SP-A, -B, and -D mRNA levels increased during exposure to hyperoxia compared to room-air controls. Peak levels were observed in adult lungs for SP-A, SP-C and CC10. Except for SP-A, the cellular distribution of SP-B, -C, -D and CC10, studied with in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry, did not change in room air nor in hyperoxia. Exposure to normoxia was associated with high levels of SP-A mRNA and protein in alveolar type 2 cells and low levels in bronchial Clara cells, whereas hyperoxia induced high levels of SP-A expression in bronchial Clara cells., CONCLUSION: The increased expression of SP-A mRNA under hyperoxia can be attributed, at least in part, to an induction of mRNA and protein expression in bronchial Clara cells. The expanded role of Clara cells in the defence against hyperoxic injury suggests that they support alveolar type 2 cell function and may play an important role in the supply of surfactant proteins to the lower airways.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are two common serious chronic respiratory disorders without specific treatments affecting children. BPD is characterized by an arrest in alveolar growth in premature infants requiring respiratory support. CF is the most common fatal inherited genetic disorder characterized by abnormally thick mucus secretions, recurrent infection and ultimately lung destruction. One commonality between these two diseases is the promise of utilizing stem cells therapeutically. Indeed, the use of exogenous cells to supplement the natural repair mechanisms or the possibility of genetic manipulation in vitro before administration are appealing therapeutic options for these diseases. Increasing attention has been focused on the use of adult bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSC) to regenerate damaged organs such as the heart, the brain, and the liver. However, due to the lung's complexity as well as the low rate of cellular turnover within the lung, progress has been slower in this area compared with the skin or liver. Initial work suggests that BMSC can engraft and differentiate into a variety of lung cells, but these findings have been challenged recently. This article critically reviews the current advances on the therapeutic use of stem cells for lung regeneration.

AB  - Inflammation interferes with lung development in model systems and is present chronically in the lungs of preterm infants who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Antenatal inflammation is very commonly associated with preterm deliveries, but there is generally minimal information about the duration, intensity, or organisms associated with chorioamnionitis. In preterm lamb models, chorioamnionitis causes a lung injury similar to BPD and also causes clinical lung maturation. Continuous exposure of the developing lung before and after delivery to inflammation may be central to the development of BPD.

AB  - While the 'original' bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was attributed to the iatrogenic effects of oxygen and barotrauma on the preterm lung, analyses of the 'new' BPD suggests that these environmental effects may contribute to arrested pulmonary development, and that there may also be genetic foundations for the susceptibility to BPD. Twinning, family and population studies implicate heritable factors in the evolution of BPD. The candidate genes examined for their potential role in BPD include surfactant apoprotein and inflammatory genes. With the identification and mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), an explosion of testing for these genetic components that may contribute to a number of complex, multigenic disease conditions-including BPD-have been initiated. Sophisticated multiplex analyses are now available to link candidate SNPs to conditions such as BPD. However, there continues to be wide variation in the expression of BPD throughout neonatal units. Differentiating the effects caused by environmental and environmental-genetic interactions from isolated genetic etiologies is still problematic and will require carefully designed genetic analyses of preterm infant groups and their families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that there may be infant gender differences in cytokine expression associated with differences in neonatal morbidity., OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that umbilical cord interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) correlates with infant gender and neonatal outcome in preterm infants., STUDY DESIGN: IL-1ra was measured in cord blood taken from 58 preterm infants (33 males, 25 females) with gestational age less than 32 weeks. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were used for identifying IL-1ra values with high sensitivity and specificity for neonatal morbidity and adverse outcome, i.e., death or survival with severe intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia., RESULTS: In the female infants, but not the male infants, cord IL-1ra values correlated with postnatal depression, expressed as Apgar scores at 1 min (correlation coefficient, r(s); p value: -0.542; 0.005), 5 min (-0.571; 0.018), and 10 min (-0.442; 0.035); and postnatal age at intubation (-0.799; 0.001). The ROC area under the curve (AUC) was 0.735 for adverse outcome (p=0.013), and 0.683 for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p=0.021) when all infants were included. However, there was a significant gender difference in the ROC curve for adverse outcome (p=0.026), with AUC 0.640 (p=0.240) in males and AUC 0.929 (p=0.008) in females. Above a chosen cutoff at 13,500 ng/l for IL-1ra cord the sensitivity and specificity for predicting adverse outcome was 100 and 81%, respectively in females versus 50 and 84% in males., CONCLUSION: Increased levels of cord IL-1ra levels are associated with neonatal morbidity and adverse outcome in preterm infants. Comparable levels of IL-1ra have different predictive value depending on infant gender. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To generate base-line data on neonatal mortality in Gondar College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital before the establishment of a neonatal unit in order to assess its impact in reducing neonatal mortality., DESIGN: A retrospective record review was conducted in the Paediatrics Ward of the Gondar College of Medical Sciences. The review included all records of neonates admitted to the Pediatrics Ward from 1 September 1994 to 31 August 1999., SETTING: Paediatrics Ward of the Gondar College of Medical Sciences Hospital., PATIENTS: A total of 330 neonates were admitted during the given period., RESULTS: Data was analyzed for 304 neonates whose records were complete. Out of these 141 (44.4%) were discharged having improved; 126 (41.4%) died and the rest, 37 (12.2%), were discharged against medical advice or disappeared. Sepsis was diagnosed clinically in 228 (75%) neonates, while pneumonia was the diagnosis in 84 (28%) of the neonates. The highest case related mortality was seen in hyaline membrane disease where 10 out of 11 (91%) neonates died. The next highest case related mortality was seen in very low birth weight as 24 out of 30 (80%) neonates died., CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The neonatal mortality seen in this study is unacceptably high. In this regard, it has drawn the attention of the college and hospital management of the need to open a neonatal care unit to improve the quality of neonatal care. Another study has to be done after about five years to assess the impact of the new Neonatal Care unit in reducing neonatal mortality in the Gondar College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital. The result of this study, though facility based, would give an important indication of the magnitude of the problem of neonatal mortality in the country. The global community is committed to addressing the health of the newborn together with maternal and child health by merging the global Safe Motherhood and Healthy Newborn, Saving Newborn Lives and Child Survival Partnerships into one Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Partnership (MNCHP).

AB  - Organized and coordinated lung development follows transcriptional regulation of a complex set of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions resulting in a blood-gas interface ready for physiologic gas exchange at birth. Transcription factors, growth factors, and various other signaling molecules regulate epithelial-mesenchymal interactions by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Transcriptional control at the earliest stages of lung development results in cell differentiation and cell commitment in the primitive lung bud, in essence setting up a framework for pattern formation and branching morphogenesis. Branching morphogenesis results in the formation of the conductive airway system, which is critical for alveolization. Lung development is influenced at all stages by spatial and temporal distribution of various signaling molecules and their receptors and also by the positive and negative control of signaling by paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine mechanisms. Lung bud formation, cell differentiation, and its interaction with the splanchnic mesoderm are regulated by HNF-3beta, Shh, Nkx2.1, HNF-3/Forkhead homolog-8 (HFH-8), Gli, and GATA transcription factors. HNF-3beta regulates Nkx2.1, a transcription factor critical to the formation of distal pulmonary structures. Nkx2.1 regulates surfactant protein genes that are important for the development of alveolar stability at birth. Shh, produced by the foregut endoderm, regulates lung morphogenesis signaling through Gli genes expressed in the mesenchyme. FGF10, produced by the mesoderm, regulates branching morphogenesis via its receptors on the lung epithelium. Alveolization and formation of the capillary network are influenced by various factors that include PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and retinoic acid. Epithelial-endothelial interactions during lung development are important in establishing a functional blood-gas interface. The effects of various growth factors on lung development have been demonstrated by gain- or loss-of-function studies in null mutant and transgenic mice models. Understanding the role of growth factors and various other signaling molecules and their cellular interactions in lung development will provide us with new insights into the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and disorders of lung morphogenesis.

AB  - Exogenous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) ameliorate experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Moreover, data from term-born animal models and human tracheal aspirate-derived cells suggest altered mesenchymal signaling in the pathophysiology of neonatal lung disease. We hypothesized that hyperoxia, a factor contributing to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, perturbs human lung-resident MSC function. Mesenchymal cells were isolated from human fetal lung tissue (16-18 wk of gestation), characterized and cultured in conditions resembling either intrauterine (5% O2) or extrauterine (21% and 60% O2) atmospheres. Secretome data were compared with MSCs obtained from term umbilical cord tissues. The human fetal lung mesenchyme almost exclusively contains CD146pos. MSCs expressing SOX-2 and OCT-4, which secrete elastin, fibroblast growth factors 7 and 10, vascular endothelial growth factor, angiogenin, and other lung cell-protecting/-maturing proteins. Exposure to extrauterine atmospheres in vitro leads to excessive proliferation, reduced colony-forming ability, alterations in the cell's surface marker profile, decreased elastin deposition, and impaired secretion of factors important for lung growth. Conversely, umbilical cord-derived MSCs abundantly secreted factors that impaired lung MSCs are unable to produce. Oxygen-impaired human fetal lung MSC function may contribute to disrupted repair capacity and arrested lung growth. Exogenous MSCs may act by triggering the signaling pathways lost by impaired endogenous lung mesenchymal cells.

AB  - Premature infants<1500 g were randomly assigned to study and control groups. In the study group, 42 premature infants received recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO) 750 U/kg per week subcutaneously from day 5 to 40 and enteral iron supplementation of 2 to 6 mg/kg/d beginning on day 14 provided that they were receiving at least 50% energy intake orally. In the control group, 51 infants received the same dose of enteral iron supplementation beginning at the end of the fourth week. At the end of a 12-week monitoring period, r-Hu EPO combined with early enteral iron reduced transfusion needs only in the subgroup<1000 g. r-Hu EPO and early iron treatment had no effect on the development of severe retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We suggest that r-Hu EPO combined with early enteral iron is both effective and safe in infants<1000 g.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use stable isotopically labeled precursors of pulmonary surfactant phospholipids to measure precursor utilization and surfactant turnover in premature infants who required mechanical ventilation at birth, 2 weeks, and >4 weeks of age., STUDY DESIGN: Infants of  or =4 weeks of life. Disaturated phospholipids were extracted from sequential tracheal aspirate samples obtained over a period of 2 weeks. Fractional catabolic rate (a measure of total turnover) and the fractional synthetic rates from plasma palmitate and de novo synthesis (acetate) were measured., RESULTS: The fractional catabolic rate increased from 25.3% +/- 7.0% per day at birth to 53.8% +/- 14.4% per day at 4 weeks (P=.001). The combined contribution from plasma palmitate and de novo synthesis to total synthesis increased from 44.2% +/- 19.8% at birth to 85.2% +/- 32.8% at 4 weeks (P=.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Total surfactant turnover increased in premature infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The increasing contributions from acetate and plasma palmitate suggest a decrease in surfactant phospholipid recycling.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus infection continues to be one of the most important health problems in infancy. Active prophylaxis against this infection (i.e., vaccination) is not available. Therefore, protection of high-risk infants is possible only by passive prophylaxis with specific antibodies. Palivizumab (Synagis) and respiratory syncytial virus intravenous immune globulin are licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of severe lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infants with a history of premature birth (< or =35 weeks gestational age) and children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, directed to an epitope in the A antigenic side of the F-protein of the respiratory syncytial virus. This review discusses the characteristics of this drug in detail.

AB  - Pulmonary disease is the most important cause of morbidity in preterm neonates, whose lungs are often physiologically and morphologically immature. Surfactant deficiency in immature lungs triggers a cascade of alveolar instability and collapse, capillary leak edema, and hyaline membrane formation. The term respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has come to represent the clinical expression of surfactant deficiency and its nonspecific histologic counterpart, hyaline membrane disease. Historically, chest radiographs of infants with RDS predictably demonstrated decreased pulmonary expansion, symmetric generalized reticulogranular lung opacities, and air bronchograms. Refinements in perinatal medicine, including antenatal glucocorticoid administration, surfactant replacement therapy, and increasingly sophisticated ventilatory strategies have decreased the prevalence of RDS and air leak, altered familiar radiographic features, and lowered the threshold of potential viability to a gestational age of approximately 23 weeks. Alveolar paucity and pulmonary interstitial thickness in these profoundly premature neonates impair normal gas exchange and may necessitate prolonged mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of lung injury. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), alternatively termed chronic lung disease of infancy, is a disorder of lung injury and repair originally ascribed to positive-pressure mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity. Before the advent of surfactant replacement therapy, chest radiographs of infants with classic BPD demonstrated coarse reticular lung opacities, cystic lucencies, and markedly disordered lung aeration that reflected alternating regions of alveolar septal fibrosis and hyperinflated normal lung parenchyma. In the current era of surfactant replacement, BPD is increasingly a disorder of very low-birth-weight neonates with arrested alveolar and pulmonary vascular development, minimal alveolar septal fibrosis and inflammation, and more subtle radiographic abnormalities.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The antioxidant glutathione is found in low levels in diseases in which increasing evidence implicate oxidative stress in the development of the disease, for example retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus and asthma. Glutathione is metabolized in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which involves six different enzymes. The synthesis of glutathione is a two-step process in which the first step is catalysed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and the second step by glutathione synthetase. Glutathione synthetase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease and the most common inborn error of the gamma-glutamyl cycle. Approximately 25% of patients with hereditary glutathione synthetase deficiency die during childhood. Patients present with a clinical picture ranging from compensated haemolytic anaemia to a complex disorder with additional symptoms like 5-oxoprolinuria, metabolic acidosis and central nervous system impairment. Even though the correlation between phenotype and genotype in these patients is complex, an indication of the phenotype can be based on the type of mutation involved. Also, there is a correlation between the glutathione synthetase activity and the level of glutathione in cultured fibroblasts. Inborn errors have also been described in three additional steps of the y-glutamyl cycle, namely gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, 5-oxoprolinase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase., CONCLUSION: The range of disorders in patients with inborn errors in the metabolism of glutathione illustrates the intricate metabolism of glutathione and its involvement in numerous essential processes in the cell. By studying these patients, further insight into the functions and metabolism of glutathione can be achieved.

AB  - The lungs of small premature babies are at a developmental stage of finalizing their airway tree by a process called branching morphogenesis, and of creating terminal gas exchange units by a mechanism called septation. If the branching process is disturbed, the lung has a propensity to be hypoplastic. If septation is impaired, the terminal gas exchange units, the alveoli, tend to be enlarged and reduced in number, an entity known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Here, we review current knowledge of key molecules influencing branching and septation. In particular, we discuss the molecular similarities and dissimilarities between the two processes of airspace enlargement. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating branching and septation may provide perinatologists with targets for improving lung growth and maturation. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This chapter reviews some of the genetic predispositions that may govern the presence or severity of neonatal respiratory disorders. Respiratory disease is common in the neonatal period, and genetic factors have been implicated in some rare and common respiratory diseases. Among the most common respiratory diseases are respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn and transient tachypnoea of the newborn, whereas less common ones are cystic fibrosis, congenital alveolar proteinosis and primary ciliary dyskinesias. A common complication of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is bronchopulmonary dysplasia or neonatal chronic lung disease. This review examines the evidence linking known genetic contributions to these diseases. The value and success of neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis is reviewed, and the recently characterised contribution of polymorphisms and mutations in the surfactant protein genes to neonatal respiratory disease is evaluated. The evidence that known variability in the expression of surfactant protein genes may contribute to the risk of development of neonatal chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia is examined.

AB  - Chronic lung disease (CLD) in children represents a heterogeneous group of many distinct clinicopathological entities. The prevalence of CLD has increased in the past decade because of the more advanced and intensive respiratory support provided for compromised children and additionally the overall improved survival of preterm babies. The disorders which constitute CLD generally have a slow tempo of progression over many months or even years. The most common causes of CLD in children are cystic fibrosis (CF), and other causes of bronchiectasis (such as immunodeficiency, and in the third world, post-infective bronchiectasis, for example, measles), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (or lung disease of prematurity), asthma, chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux/aspiration pneumonitis, and constrictive obliterative bronchiolitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated protein 6 (TSG-6) is a glycoprotein that modulates inflammation. Here we tested the hypothesis that intra-tracheal (IT) administration of an adenovirus overexpressing TSG-6 (AdTSG-6) would decrease inflammation and restore lung structure in experimental BPD., METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to normoxia (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 1-P14 were randomly assigned to receive IT AdTSG-6 or placebo (PL) on P3. The effect of IT AdTSG-6 on lung inflammation, alveolarization, angiogenesis, apoptosis, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and pulmonary hypertension were evaluated on P14. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA., RESULTS: TSG-6 mRNA was significantly increased in pups who received IT AdTSG-6. Compared to RA, hyperoxia PL-treated pups had increased NF-kbeta activation and lung inflammation. In contrast, IT AdTSG-6 hyperoxia-treated pups had decreased lung phosphorylated NF-kbeta expression and markers of inflammation. This was accompanied by an improvement in alveolarization, angiogenesis, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and pulmonary hypertension., CONCLUSIONS: IT AdTSG-6 decreases lung inflammation and improves lung structure in neonatal rats with experimental BPD. These findings suggest that therapies that increase lung TSG-6 expression may have beneficial effects in preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - VEGF signaling inhibition decreases alveolar and vessel growth in the developing lung, suggesting that impaired VEGF signaling may contribute to decreased lung growth in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Whether VEGF treatment improves lung structure in experimental models of BPD is unknown. The objective was to determine whether VEGF treatment enhances alveolarization in infant rats after hyperoxia. Two-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were placed into hyperoxia or room air (RA) for 12 days. At 14 days, rats received daily treatment with rhVEGF-165 or saline. On day 22, rats were killed. Tissue was collected. Morphometrics was assessed by radial alveolar counts (RAC), mean linear intercepts (MLI), and skeletonization. Compared with RA controls, hyperoxia decreased RAC (6.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.3 +/- 0.4, P < 0.0001), increased MLI (59.2 +/- 1.8 vs. 44.0 +/- 0.8, P < 0.0001), decreased nodal point density (447 +/- 14 vs. 503 +/- 12, P < 0.0004), and decreased vessel density (11.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 18.9 +/- 0.3, P < 0.001), which persisted despite RA recovery. Compared with hyperoxic controls, rhVEGF treatment after hyperoxia increased RAC (11.8 +/- 0.5, P < 0.0001), decreased MLI (42.2 +/- 1.2, P < 0.0001), increased nodal point density (502 +/- 7, P < 0.0005), and increased vessel density (23.2 +/- 0.4, P < 0.001). Exposure of neonatal rats to hyperoxia impairs alveolarization and vessel density, which persists despite RA recovery. rhVEGF treatment during recovery enhanced vessel growth and alveolarization. We speculate that lung structure abnormalities after hyperoxia may be partly due to impaired VEGF signaling.

AB  - Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is believed to play a prominent role in the lung injury that leads to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To determine whether human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) treatment reduces the risk of developing BPD, we investigated the effect of rhEPO treatment on the histopathologic changes seen in hyperoxia-induced lung injury of BPD. Twenty-five rat pups were divided into four groups: air-exposed control group (n = 5), hyperoxia-exposed placebo group (n = 7), hyperoxia-exposed rhEPO-treated group (n = 6), and air-exposed rhEPO-treated group (n = 7). Measurement of alveolar surface area, quantification of secondary crest formation, microvessel count, evaluation of alveolar septal fibrosis, and smooth muscle actin immunostaining were performed to assess hyperoxia-induced changes in lung morphology. Treatment of hyperoxia-exposed animals with rhEPO resulted in a significant increase in the mean alveolar area, number of secondary crests formed, and the microvessel count in comparison with hyperoxia-exposed placebo-treated animals. There was significantly less fibrosis in rhEPO-treated animals. However, treatment of hyperoxia-exposed animals with rhEPO did not result in a significant change in smooth muscle content compared with hyperoxia-exposed placebo treated animals. Our results suggest treatment with rhEPO during hyperoxia exposure is associated with improved alveolar structure, enhanced vascularity, and decreased fibrosis. Therefore, we conclude that treatment of preterm infants with EPO might reduce the risk of developing BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common morbidity among surviving premature infants. Injury to the developing lung is the result of the interaction between a susceptible host and a number of contributing factors such as mechanical ventilation and infection. The resulting persistent impairment of pulmonary function and need for ongoing therapy are the underlying characteristics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Important insights into the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have led to numerous therapies and preventive approaches. Although significant progress has been made, in order to further affect the incidence and severity of the disease, we need to further study (a) the genetically determined predisposing factors, (b) the relative contribution of the various pathogenetic pathways, and, most important, (c) how to best translate the knowledge gained from these studies into effective clinical approaches.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that occurs in very premature infants and is characterized by impaired alveologenesis. This ultimate phase of lung development is mostly postnatal and allows growth of gas-exchange surface area to meet the needs of the organism. Alveologenesis is a highly integrated process that implies cooperative interactions between interstitial, epithelial, and vascular compartments of the lung. Understanding of its underlying mechanisms has considerably progressed recently with identification of structural, signaling, or remodeling molecules that are crucial in the process. Thus, the pivotal role of elastin deposition in lung walls has been demonstrated, and many key control-molecules have been identified, including various transcription factors, growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factors, and vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix-remodeling enzymes, and retinoids. BPD-associated changes in lung expression/content have been evidenced for most of these molecules, especially for signaling pathways, through both clinical investigations in premature infants and the use of animal models, including the premature baboon or lamb, neonatal exposure to hyperoxia in rodents, and maternal-fetal infection. These findings open therapeutic perspectives to correct imbalanced signaling. Unraveling the intimate molecular mechanisms of alveolar building appears as a prerequisite to define new strategies for the prevention and care of BPD.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neonatologists and pulmonary biologists have long sought preventive treatments for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The purpose of this review is to highlight recent reports of a number of potential treatments intended to prevent BPD and to discuss the controversies surrounding preventive strategies., RECENT FINDINGS: The evolution of BPD from a disorder of pulmonary injury affecting moderately preterm infants, to one characterized by a developmental pulmonary arrest among survivors of extreme prematurity has important implications for BPD prevention. Recent recognition that the pathogenesis of BPD might have prenatal origins raises new challenges and opportunities for studies of BPD prevention; however, most current preventive strategies for BPD focus on respiratory management. Neither past nor current clinical trials have shown a conclusive benefit of a single preventive treatment strategy. Promising but still largely unproven preventive respiratory treatments include: high frequency oscillatory ventilation, permissive hypercapnea, and inhaled nitric oxide. Observational and recent laboratory data support the need for randomized clinical trials of continuous positive airway pressure versus mechanical ventilation. Additionally, clinical trials are needed to address the deficit in our knowledge of the potential benefits and risks of postnatal low dose corticosteroid treatment. Further study of superoxide dismutase, inositol, and alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor also are warranted on the basis of recent clinical trials or meta-analyses., SUMMARY: Only Vitamin A has proven a safe and effective preventive treatment for BPD. Additional studies of respiratory technologies, management strategies, and protective molecules are needed. Directed cytokine and genetic therapies are on the horizon.

AB  - Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] from Gram-negative bacteria is found in amniotic fluid in intrauterine infections that associate with the risk for spontaneous premature birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and respiratory distress syndrome. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the signaling receptor for LPS. The aim was to investigate the primary inflammatory response in mice shortly after administration of LPS to the dam (14 and 17 d of pregnancy), to the newborn, or into the amniotic fluid. The expression levels of TLR4, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and IL-1 receptor 1 were studied with ribonuclease protection assay. In addition, TLR4 protein was analyzed with Western blotting. The fetal membranes expressed TLR4 mRNA and protein and showed an acute cytokine response to LPS when LPS was administrated into the amniotic fluid. There was distinct ontogeny in the responsiveness of fetal lung to LPS: on fetal day 14 (term 20 d), both the expression of TLR4 and the acute cytokine response were undetectable 5 h after LPS; they became detectable by fetal day 17. TLR4 and the cytokine response further increased after birth. In maternal lung, the TLR4 expression was strongest and up-regulated in parallel with the induction of the cytokines. We propose that TLR4 controls the magnitude of the LPS-induced cytokine response during the perinatal period.

AB  - Pulmonary antioxidants and their therapeutic implications have been extensively studied during past decades. The purpose of this review is to briefly summarize the key findings of these studies as well as to elaborate on some novel approaches with respect to potential preventive treatments for neonatal chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Such new ideas include, for example, modification of transcription factors governing the hypoxic response pathways, important in angiogenesis, cell survival, and glycolytic responses. The fundamental strategy behind that approach is that fetal lung normally develops under hypoxic conditions and that this hypoxic, growth-favoring environment is interrupted by a premature birth. Importantly, during fetal lung development, alveolar development appears to be dependent on vascular development. Therefore, enhancement of signaling factors that occur during hypoxic fetal life ('continued fetal life ex utero'), including angiogenic responses, could potentially lead to improved lung growth and thereby alleviate the alveolar and vascular hypoplasia characteristic of BPD.

AB  - Past studies have primarily focused on how altered lung vascular growth and development contribute to pulmonary hypertension. Recently, basic studies of vascular growth have led to novel insights into mechanisms underlying development of the normal pulmonary circulation and the essential relationship of vascular growth to lung alveolar development. These observations have led to new concepts underlying the pathobiology of developmental lung disease, especially the inhibition of lung growth that characterizes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We speculate that understanding basic mechanisms that regulate and determine vascular growth will lead to new clinical strategies to improve the long-term outcome of premature babies with BPD.

AB  - Our understanding of lung development in the past two decades has moved from an anatomical to a histological basis and, most recently, to a molecular basis. Tissue interactions specify tracheal and lung primordia formation, program branching morphogenesis of the airway epithelium and regulate epithelial differentiation. In addition, lung development is influenced by mechanical and humoral factors. The regulatory molecules involved in morphogenetic signaling include growth and transcription factors and extracellular matrix molecules. These morphogenetic signals are responsible for lung patterning and differentiation. We will provide a brief overview of molecular signaling during early respiratory formation, airway branching, pulmonary vascularization and epithelial differentiation. We will then review aberrant morphogenetic signaling in human lung abnormalities, such as tracheoesophageal fistula, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hyperplasia, alveolar capillary dysplasia, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - The increasing number of successfully treated newborns with disturbances of the adaptive period can measure effectiveness of neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The authors summarized some health problems of the former NICU patients. Central nervous system (CNS) of the premature, especially low (LBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW) infant, is in serious danger of improper development. The lack of neurological disturbances in early infancy does not exclude further pathological events and such patients require long-term observation and follow-up. High-risk newborns are of great need of precise imaging and diagnosis of CNS, which should be performed before discharge. Early stimulation and developmental care program are the crucial points in the management of newborns with neurological abnormalities. Sensorial problems, especially the rate of vision and hearing impairments, can be significantly reduced when prophylactic schedule is applied. Both, etiological factors leading to respiratory insufficiency and some iatrogenic effects of the therapy, can influence respiratory system. Symptoms of different intensity--from sneezing caused by nasal mucous membrane edema to the severe forms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)--may last for a long time and influence the child's general condition. The surgical closure of Botall's duct (persistent ductus arteriosus--PDA) usually normalizes the circulatory system. In serious heart defects or isolated shunt-type defects, the compensation of the circulatory system can easily be disturbed. Digestive tract problems belong to the two main groups: first--connected with the prematurity and immature interstitial functioning (necrotizing enterocolitis, digestive and absorption abnormalities, hepatic cholestasis), and second--caused by congenital defects requiring immediate surgical intervention. Despite different types of the diseases, the treatment and care have to be focused on necessary for the growing organism, optimal nutrients and calories uptake. Disturbances of social development, improper behavior, adaptation and emotional problems are mainly presented in VLBW patients and those with organic defects of the central nervous system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common pulmonary injury among premature infants, which is often caused by hyperoxia exposure. Irisin is a novel hormone-like myokine derived mainly from skeletal muscles as well as adipose tissues. Many studies have indicated that Irisin exert a variety of properties against hyperoxia-induced inflammation and oxidative stress (OS). We aimed to evaluate the effects of irisin on hyperoxia-induced lung injury explore the underlying mechanisms., METHODS: BPD model was established after exposing newborn mouse to 85% oxygen. BPD mouse received continuous intraperitoneal injection of irisin at a dose of 25 mug/kg/day. Lung tissues were collected for histological examination at 7 and 14 days after birth. The alveolarization and alveolar vascularization of each animal was assessed. Levels of oxidative stress indicators, and the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in lung tissues were detected at 14 days after birth., RESULTS: Hyperoxia exposure induced a markedly alveolar simplification and a disrupted alveolar angiogenesis, which was ameliorated by irisin treatment. The hyperoxia-induced increase in these oxidative stress indicators was significantly reversed by irisin treatment. The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is inducted in the hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model, which is further activated by irisin treatment., CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the beneficial effects of irisin in reducing the OS, enhancing alveolarization, and promoting vascular development through activation of Nrf2/HO-1 axis in a hyperoxia-induced experimental model of BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an orphan disease and advances in prevention and treatment are lacking. The clinical efficacy of systemic corticosteroid therapy to reduce the severity of lung disease and BPD is highly variable. Our objective was to assess whether candidate SNPs in corticosteroid metabolism and response genes are associated with short-term phenotypic response to systemic corticosteroids in infants at high risk for BPD., METHODS: Pharmacogenetic analysis of data from a large randomized controlled trial (TOLSURF) in infants treated with dexamethasone or hydrocortisone using multivariate linear regression. The primary outcome was a change in respiratory severity score (RSS, mean airway pressure x FiO2) at day 7 of corticosteroid treatment., RESULTS: rs7225082 in the intron of CRHR1 is significantly associated with the magnitude of decrease in RSS 7 days after starting treatment with systemic corticosteroid (meta-analysis P = 2.8 x 10-4). Each T allele at rs7225082 is associated with a smaller absolute change in RSS at day 7, i.e., less response to systemic corticosteroids., CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variability is associated with corticosteroid responsiveness with regard to respiratory status in preterm infants. Identification of genetic markers of corticosteroid responsiveness may allow for therapeutic individualization, with the goal of optimizing the risk-to-benefit ratio for an individual child.

AB  - Preterm babies born before the 33rd week of gestation often exhibit primary surfactant deficiency responsible for the respiratory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease. In that situation, there is a limited and insufficient production of surfactant by type II alveolar cells of the lung due to immaturity. Secondary surfactant deficiencies occur in patients with prior normal surfactant synthesis and can be related to sepsis, hypoxia, ventilator induced lung injury or surfactant inhibition by a variety of substances reaching the alveolar spaces. They occur in full-term newborns with meconium aspiration syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In children and adults, acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis can be responsible. In prematures they occur after the initial primary deficiency during pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumonia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Treatment with exogenous surfactant may be beneficial. There is a need for randomized controlled studies for evaluation of this treatment. Next generation of surfactants containing recombinant surfactant protein or synthetic peptides appear as promising agents in these situations of secondary surfactant deficiencies.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has classically been described as including inflammation, architectural disruption, fibrosis, and disordered/delayed development of the infant lung. As infants born at progressively earlier gestations have begun to survive the neonatal period, a 'new' BPD, consisting primarily of disordered/delayed development, has emerged. BPD causes not only significant complications in the newborn period, but is associated with continuing mortality, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, re-hospitalization, growth failure, and poor neurodevelopmental outcome after hospital discharge. Four major risk factors for BPD include premature birth, respiratory failure, oxygen supplementation, and mechanical ventilation, although it is unclear whether any of these factors is absolutely necessary for development of the condition. Genetic susceptibility, infection, and patent ductus arteriosus have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. The strategies with the strongest evidence for effectiveness in preventing or lessening the severity of BPD include prevention of prematurity and closure of a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus. Some evidence of effectiveness also exists for single-course therapy with antenatal glucocorticoids in women at risk for delivering premature infants, surfactant replacement therapy in intubated infants with respiratory distress syndrome, retinol (vitamin A) therapy, and modes of respiratory support designed to minimize 'volutrauma' and oxygen toxicity. The most effective treatments for ameliorating symptoms or preventing exacerbation in established BPD include oxygen therapy, inhaled glucocorticoid therapy, and vaccination against respiratory pathogens.Many other strategies for the prevention or treatment of BPD have been proposed, but have weaker or conflicting evidence of effectiveness. In addition, many therapies have significant side effects, including the possibility of worsening the disease despite symptom improvement. For instance, supraphysiologic systemic doses of glucocorticoids lessen the incidence of BPD in infants at risk for the disease, and promote weaning of oxygen and mechanical ventilation in infants with established BPD. However, the side effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, most notably the recently recognized adverse effects on neurodevelopment, preclude their routine use for the prevention or treatment of BPD. Future research in BPD will most probably focus on continued incremental improvements in outcome, which are likely to be achieved through the combined effects of many therapeutic modalities.

AB  - The pathology of BPD has changed over time, with the old BPD characterized by airway injury, inflammation, and parenchymal fibrosis giving way to the new BPD manifesting less fibrosis but with decreased alveolar and vascular development. The pathogenesis of BPD involves factors affecting the severity and management of RDS, alterations in lung development and maturation, alveolar-vascular interactions, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These factors in pathogenesis are mediated and modulated by hyperoxic lung injury, antioxidants, NO, the pulmonary neuroendocrine system and peptide growth factors, the immune system, and various genetic polymorphisms and predispositions. Future therapeutic interventions are likely to target one or more of these abnormalities in lung development, maturation, and response to injury.

AB  - Vitamin A is a crucial antioxidant for preterm infants because it protects the lungs from oxidative damage induced by the administration of supplemental oxygen. Although all preterm infants are born with smaller vitamin A stores than full-term infants, the store of vitamin A in preterm infants at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is often especially deficient. Despite the increases in plasma vitamin A concentrations that have been achieved with vitamin A supplementation, only modest improvements in clinical outcomes and incidence of BPD have been noted in this population. This article reviews the research on vitamin A supplementation for preterm infants, as well as the issues and clinical implications associated with this intervention.

AB  - Although genetic factors are assumed to have a role in the etiology of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), specific genes underlying this susceptibility are incompletely known. The most promising candidates are the genes coding for the lung-specific protein components of the surfactant. In congenital absence of surfactant protein A in mice, lung mechanics or surfactant homeostasis is normal. However, there is an increased susceptibility to infections. The major surfactant protein A alleles, 6A(2) and 1A(0), are the general high-risk RDS alleles, while the allele 6A(3) carries a decreased risk of RDS. The allele 6A(6) is also over-represented in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To date, no human infants who lack surfactant protein A have been identified, and the human respiratory phenotype associated with the 1A(0) allele has been demonstrated to be variable, therefore, surfactant protein A polymorphisms are not currently useful for estimation of individual risk of having an affected infant. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) plays an essential role in the structure of tubular myelin. Mutations resulting in an absence of surfactant protein B have been identified. They cause a recessively inherited, progressive respiratory disease. More than 27 loss of function mutations have been identified in the surfactant protein B gene that result in lethal neonatal respiratory failure. Of the several known common variants of the surfactant protein B gene, the most common mutation is 121ins22 that accounts for 60-70% of the mutant cases. Although the frequency of the 121ins2 mutation is rare, the consistent phenotype is exhibited by infants with a homozygous genotype. The clinical presentation in infants homozygous for the 121ins2 mutation is full-term infants who develop respiratory distress within the first 12-24 hours of life. Surfactant replacement therapy fails to reverse this outcome, and without lung transplantation, they expire within the first 1-6 months of life. Surfactant protein B gene mutations may also result in milder phenotypes. These mutations resulting in reduced synthesis of SP-B appear to be family-specific and result in respiratory distress, but sometimes with more gradually progressive or chronic respiratory failure. Surfactant protein C plays a role in the stabilization of surfactant and may also have a role in the intracellular processing of the surfactant complex. Surfactant protein B is important in the intracellular processing and production of surfactant protein C. Although surfactant protein C-deficient mice are viable and survive to adulthood without obvious pulmonary abnormalities, their lung have reduced viscoelasticty. Human respiratory disease in the neonatal period caused by loss-of-function mutations in the surfactant protein C gene has not been identified. However, an autosomal dominant inherited mutation at the surfactant protein C gene causes chronic interstitial lung disease. Surfactant protein D is a member of the collectin family like surfactant protein A, therefore it opsonizes pathogens and enhances their phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Unlike surfactant protein A, it does not contribute to lowering surface tension. Surfactant protein D-deficient mice have no respiratory abnormalities at birth, but it causes development of emphysema and predisposition to specific infections. No human infant or child with respiratory distress and mutation in the surfactant protein D gene has been identified.

AB  - Palivizumab (Synagi) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that provides immunoprophylaxis against serious lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for LRTIs in infants, causing winter- or wet-season epidemics. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, intramuscular palivizumab 15 mg/kg every 30 days for 5 months significantly reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by 55% in 1502 infants with prematurity and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease (BPD/CLD) and by 45% in 1287 infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (HSCHD). Reductions were statistically significant versus placebo in infants with BPD/CLD, with all degrees of prematurity, and with acyanotic/other heart disease. Palivizumab was generally well tolerated, with < or =1.9% of recipients discontinuing treatment for tolerability reasons. In placebo-controlled trials, the most common potentially drug-related adverse events were fever, nervousness, injection-site reactions, and diarrhea. Drug-related events occurred in 7.2-11% of palivizumab recipients in controlled trials (vs 6.9-10% with placebo) and 0-7.9% in open-label trials. Very few serious potentially drug-related adverse events occurred in clinical trials; four occurred in 2 of 285 patients in one open-label trial. No significant anti-palivizumab antibodies developed during palivizumab use. Palivizumab trough serum concentrations were below the recommended 40 microg/mL in about 33% and up to 14% of children prior to their second and third palivizumab injections. In pharmacoeconomic studies, the cost of palivizumab per hospitalization averted was generally lowest in the highest-risk infants. Drug cost was generally the most influential factor in sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, prophylaxis with palivizumab significantly reduces the incidence of RSV-related hospitalization relative to placebo and is generally well tolerated in high-risk infants aged <2 years, including those with prematurity and BPD/CLD or HSCHD, which are risk factors for early or serious RSV infection. Palivizumab is approved for use in these patients. Other high-risk infants in whom palivizumab has not been formally assessed, such as those with immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, or location-specific risk factors (including extended hospital stays) might potentially benefit from palivizumab. The use of palivizumab in these other high-risk populations is likely to be determined as much by pharmacoeconomic considerations as by efficacy outcomes.

AB  - Histologic inflammation of placenta has been associated with increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and periventricular leukomalacia among preterm infants. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in the regulation of inflammation. Some alleles of TNF (LT-alpha+250, TNF-alpha-308, and TNF-alpha-238) have been associated with susceptibility and/or severity of many diseases characterized by inflammation and/or involving the immune system. To determine whether alleles of TNF-alpha affect the risk and/or the severity of chorioamnionitis, we examined the placentas of 101 preterm births (birth weight <or=1250 g) for the presence of inflammation. Maternal and fetal chorioamnionitis (MCA and FCA, respectively) were graded for severity and staged for location of inflammatory infiltrate. Analysis for TNF-alpha alleles was done using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique on DNA extracted from infants' whole blood. MCA and FCA were seen in 45 and 38 placentas, respectively (p = 0.64). Genotypes of TNF-alpha-308 did not affect the development or the severity of placental inflammation. However, the AA genotype of LT-alpha+250 occurred more often when MCA and FCA were present compared with placentas without inflammation (p = 0.016 and p = 0.007, respectively). The GA genotype of TNF-alpha-238 was more common in placentas with severe MCA than with mild MCA (p = 0.015). The number of A alleles of LT-alpha+250 (GG = 0, GA = 1, AA = 2) correlated directly and significantly with grades and stages of MCA and FCA (p < 0.05). The AA genotype of LT-alpha+250 is associated with the development of chorioamnionitis among preterm births. The A allele of LT-alpha+250 seems to worsen the degree of placental inflammation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an elevated placenta growth factor (PlGF) level in cord blood is associated with increased risk for preterm infants to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Sixty-three preterm infants who were born at 34 weeks' gestation or earlier were enrolled. Two infants who died before 28 days' postnatal age could not be assigned a BPD status and were excluded. PlGF levels in cord blood were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mann-Whitney rank sum test, Spearman correlation coefficients, and multivariable linear or logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: The BPD group had a higher PlGF level, lower gestational age, lower birth weight (BW), higher incidence of endotracheal tube intubation, and longer duration of intubation. The PlGF levels in cord blood correlated negatively with gestational age and BW. However, multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that only elevated cord blood PlGF levels and BW were associated with BPD after adjusting for all contributing factors. Furthermore, an increased PlGF level in cord blood was significantly correlated with the clinical severity of BPD, as measured by duration of intubation. At 17 mg/dL, the specificity of cord blood PlGF level in predicting BPD was 95%, the sensitivity was 53%, the positive predictive value was 83%, and the negative predictive value was 82%., CONCLUSIONS: Measuring cord blood PlGF level at birth might be a biological marker for predicting the occurrence of BPD and allowing early therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a frequent complication of extreme prematurity. In preterm neonates catch-up and pulmonary alveolar growth occur during the first two years of life. However 10 to 25% of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia are under-nourished after two years of age, and 30 to 60% of them also suffer from persistent airway obstruction, hyperinflation and bronchial hyperreactivity. Recommendations on nutritional requirements in this population are not yet clearly defined, but an adequate nutritional status in prenatal and early postnatal period can have long-term consequences on brain and lung development. There are a few randomised trial of nutrition for preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia after discharge. Caloric and protein requirements in this population are probably higher than in full-term infants. Moreover there are potential benefits in using specific nutrients: supplementation with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids could decrease lung inflammation injuries, glutamine is the main source of energy of pneumocyte, vitamin A is essential for lung development, inositol is necessary for surfactant synthesis, vitamin E and selenium have anti-oxidant effects. Controlled nutritional trial are needed with a long term follow-up in late childhood in order to test their effects on growth and pulmonary status.

AB  - Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a rapidly growing field of research in respiratory medicine. Airway inflammation is a central feature of chronic lung diseases, like asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and primary ciliary dyskinesia. EBC may be a useful technique for non-invasive assessment of markers of airway inflammation. The non-invasive character of EBC "inflammometry" and the general lack of appropriate techniques makes it particularly interesting for paediatrics. We provide a detailed update on the methods currently used for EBC collection and measurement of mediators. We emphasize on paediatric data. The apparent simplicity of the EBC method must not be overstated, as numerous methodological pitfalls have yet to overcome. Comparison and interpretation of data on this rapidly growing field of research is mainly hampered by the lack of standardization and the lack of specific high-sensitivity immunochemical or colorimetric assays. The initiative of the European Respiratory Society to institute a task force on this topic is a first step towards a uniform technique of EBC. Meanwhile, when using this technique or when interpreting research data, one should be fully aware of the possible methodological pitfalls.

AB  - Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is an evolutionarily well-conserved neuropeptide that was originally recognized for its ability to mediate gastric acid secretion in the gut. More recently, however, GRP has been implicated in pulmonary lung inflammatory diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and others. Antagonizing GRP or its receptor mitigated lethality associated with the onset of viral pneumonia in a well-characterized mouse model of influenza. In mice treated therapeutically with the small-molecule GRP inhibitor, NSC77427, increased survival was accompanied by decreased numbers of GRP-producing pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, improved lung histopathology, and suppressed cytokine gene expression. In addition, in vitro studies in macrophages indicate that GRP synergizes with the prototype TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide, to induce cytokine gene expression. Thus, these findings reveal that GRP is a previously unidentified mediator of influenza-induced inflammatory disease that is a potentially novel target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Formation and orderly development of the mammalian lung results from a complex set of cell to cell and cell to matrix interactions following transcriptional regulation during pulmonary organogenesis. Transcriptional control of differentiation genes early on and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions mediated by growth factors later on, resulting in the formation of conducting airways and an extensive alveolar capillary interface, is critical for normal lung development. HNF-3beta and TTF-1 are transcription factors that are involved in gene regulation and formation and differentiation of respiratory epithelium. Studies done in early mouse embryonic lung demonstrate that a variety of peptide growth factors and their receptors are expressed early on in lung development. Signalling through the FGFR2 is critical to normal development of the distal epithelium and mesenchyme. The inductive and permissive influences of growth factors on lung development has been demonstrated by gain or loss of function experiments in early embryonic mouse lung organ culture, in transgenic and in null mutant mice. VEGF present in airway epithelial cells is involved in the maturation as well as proliferation of capillary endothelial cells. Epithelial-endothelial interactions during lung development are important in establishing a functional blood gas interface. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions mediated by growth factors are also important in the restoration of normal alveolar architecture after lung injury. Further understanding of the role of these growth factors and their cellular interactions in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in tissue repair following lung injury, may lead to development of better therapeutic modalities in treating these disorders.

AB  - Preterm neonates with respiratory distress are exposed not only to the relative hyperoxia ex utero, but also to life-saving mechanical ventilation with high inspired oxygen (O2) concentrations, which is considered a major risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, also referred to as chronic lung disease of infancy. O2 toxicity is mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are constantly generated as byproducts of normal cellular metabolism, but their production is increased in various pathological states, and also upon exposure to exogenous oxidants, such as hyperoxia. Antioxidants, either enzymatic or nonenzymatic, protect the lung against the deleterious effects of ROS. Expression of various pulmonary antioxidants is developmentally regulated in many species so that the expression is increased toward term gestation, as if in anticipation of birth into an O2-rich extrauterine environment. Therefore, the lungs of prematurely born infants may be ill-adapted for protection against ROS. While premature birth interrupts normal lung development, the clinical condition necessitating the administration of high inhaled O2 concentrations may lead to permanent impairment of alveolar development. An understanding of the processes involved in lung growth, especially in alveolarization and vascularization, as well as in repair of injured lung tissue, may facilitate development of strategies to enhance these processes.

AB  - Apart from higher rates of mortality and adverse neurosensory outcome, extremely low birth weight (ELBW, birth weight 500-999 g) children have more hospital readmissions and other health problems in the early years after discharge than do normal birth weight (NBW, birth weight >2499 g) children. Respiratory illnesses, including lower respiratory infections, are the dominant cause for hospital readmission. ELBW survivors with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have even more ill-health and hospital readmissions than do ELBW survivors without BPD. ELBW survivors require closer surveillance after discharge, not only for adverse neurosensory outcome, but also for other general health problems in early childhood.

AB  - Estrogens have profound effects on bone- and lipid homeostasis, modulate immune functions and play a major role in the regulation of the development and function of central nervous system, cardiovascular system and respiratory system. They induce hepatic protein production. There is a strong connection between estrogens and several hormone systems including growth hormone--IGF axis and renin-angiotensin system. The extragenital effects of estrogens are probably more evident in the fetus than in fertile women. However, direct data are not available because of the lack of estrogen-deficient pregnancy models. Theoretically, in immature infants the premature cessation of in utero high estrogen levels is associated with the progression of perinatal acute complications. The volume of uterus in female premature infants is lower than in term newborns, the plasma levels of atherogen lipids are high, osteopenia due to inadequate bone acquisition is frequent. Inflammatory complications are common. Recently, the physiological effects of estrogen- and progesterone supplementation of premature infants have been evaluated in a pilot study. The preliminary results indicate, that the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, osteopenia might be decreased in treated infants. Further studies are needed to confirm the effectivity and long term safety of estrogen supplementation of preterm neonates.

AB  - Increased airway smooth muscle mass has been demonstrated in patients with asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and most recently, cystic fibrosis. These observations emphasize the need for further knowledge of the events involved in airway smooth muscle mitogenesis and hypertrophy. Workers in the field have developed cell culture systems involving tracheal and bronchial myocytes from different species. An emergent body of literature indicates that mutual signal transduction pathways control airway smooth muscle cell cycle entry across species lines. This article reviews what is known about mitogen-activated signal transduction in airway myocytes. The extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathways appear to be key positive regulators of airway smooth muscle mitogenesis; recent studies have also demonstrated specific roles for reactive oxygen and the JAK/STAT pathway. It is also possible that growth factor stimulation of airway smooth muscle concurrently elicits signaling through negative regulatory intermediates such as p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) delta, conceivably as a defense against extreme growth.

AB  - In spite of the adequate therapy serious inflammatory complications affect the majority of preterm neonates. Recently, the role of fetal inflammatory response syndrome has been emerged as a possible mechanism. This new clinical entity is characterised by the generalised activation of fetal immune system which is often the result of chorioamnionitis. The level of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6) often elevates in fetuses affected by this syndrome. Elevated cytokine levels induce the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the amnion and activate matrix metalloproteases in the fetus. As a result, preterm birth occurs. The high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the fetus are associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and periventricular leukomalacia in the newborn. Except the elevation of fetal interleukin-6 levels there is still no specific clinical or laboratory sign of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Further investigation is needed to understand the importance of this syndrome in the development of perinatal complications and to develop specific laboratory tests for the early recognition.

AB  - Pulmonary inflammation is a key feature in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This inflammatory process, induced by multiple risk factors, is characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells, cytokines and an arsenal of additional humoral mediators in the airways and pulmonary tissue of preterm infants with the condition. Several mediators have a direct detrimental effect on pulmonary structures by affecting cell integrity and inducing apoptosis. An imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors can generally be considered to be a hallmark of lung injury. Intrauterine exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines or antenatal infection may prime the fetal lung such that minimally injurious postnatal events provoke an excessive pulmonary inflammatory response that most certainly affects normal alveolization and pulmonary vascular development in preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - Neonatal lung diseases may have a genetic background. The available studies mainly concentrate on surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B) and respiratory distress syndrome. Specific alleles of the SP-A and SP-B genes associate interactively with susceptibility to respiratory distress syndrome. This genetic impact on the condition is influenced by environmental, acquired and inherited factors. Other alleles and genotypes of SP-A and SP-D associate with severe respiratory infections in early infancy. Rare mutations causing an absence of the SP-B protein result in progressive respiratory failure. Dominant mutations of SP-C associate with chronic lung disease, with variable manifestations. The first steps towards unraveling the genetic network influencing the susceptibility to neonatal lung diseases are now being taken. Genes encoding multifunctional proteins in the distal lung are prime candidates for causing susceptibility to neonatal lung disease, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - The preterm infant has functionally immature monocytes. The effects of common clinical interventions and exposures that might modulate inflammation were evaluated using monocytes isolated from blood of preterm lambs [130 d gestational age (GA)], near-term lambs (141 d GA), and adult sheep. Endotoxin stimulated hydrogen peroxide production by adult monocytes, but monocytes from 130-d and 141-d GA lambs had a reduced and delayed hydrogen peroxide production. Endotoxin did not decrease apoptosis of monocytes from 130-d and 141-d GA lambs but decreased apoptosis of adult monocytes. Dexamethasone increased the phagocytosis of bacteria and apoptotic cells by adult monocytes by 35% but not by monocytes from 130-d and 141-d GA lambs. Synthetic and natural surfactants and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine increased phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by monocytes from preterm, term, and adult sheep. Monocytes from preterm and term lambs differ from adult monocytes in tests of both the initiation and the resolution of inflammation. The reduced phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by monocytes from the preterm may contribute to prolonged inflammation in diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Surfactant therapy has revolutionized neonatal care and is used routinely for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Recent investigation has further elucidated the function of surfactant-associated proteins and their contribution toward surfactant and lung immune defense functions. As the field of neonatology moves away from intubation and mechanical ventilation of preterm infants at birth toward more aggressive use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, the optimal timing of exogenous surfactant therapy remains unclear. Evidence suggests that preterm neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and prolonged mechanical ventilation also experience surfactant dysfunction; however, exogenous surfactant therapy beyond the first week of life has not been well studied. Surfactant replacement therapy has been studied for use in other respiratory disorders, including meconium aspiration syndrome and pneumonia. Commercial surfactant preparations currently available are not optimal, given the variability of surfactant protein content and their susceptibility to inhibition. Further progress in the treatment of neonatal respiratory disorders may include the development of "designer" surfactant preparations.

AB  - RATIONALE: Premature infants subjected to mechanical ventilation (MV) are prone to lung injury that may result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. MV causes epithelial cell death and halts alveolar development. The exact mechanism of MV-induced epithelial cell death is unknown., OBJECTIVES: To determine the contribution of autophagy to MV-induced epithelial cell death in newborn rat lungs., METHODS: Newborn rat lungs and fetal rat lung epithelial (FRLE) cells were exposed to MV and cyclic stretch, respectively, and were then analyzed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry for autophagy, apoptosis, and bioactive sphingolipids., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Both MV and stretch first induce autophagy (ATG 5-12 [autophagy related 5-12] and LC3B-II [microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B-II] formation) followed by extrinsic apoptosis (cleaved CASP8/3 [caspase-8/3] and PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] formation). Stretch-induced apoptosis was attenuated by inhibiting autophagy. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that stretch promoted an interaction between LC3B and the FAS (first apoptosis signal) cell death receptor in FRLE cells. Ceramide levels, in particular C16 ceramide, were rapidly elevated in response to ventilation and stretch, and C16 ceramide treatment of FRLE cells induced autophagy and apoptosis in a temporal pattern similar to that seen with MV and stretch. SMPD1 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1) was activated by ventilation and stretch, and its inhibition prevented ceramide production, LC3B-II formation, LC3B/first apoptosis signal interaction, caspase-3 activation, and, ultimately, FLRE cell death. SMPD1 inhibition also attenuated ventilation-induced autophagy and apoptosis in newborn rats., CONCLUSIONS: Ventilation-induced ceramides promote autophagy-mediated cell death, and identifies SMPD1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ventilation-induced lung injury in newborns.

AB  - Multicellular organisms have evolved in adaptation to the Earth's gravitational and oxygen environment. This epigenetic process is dependent on the capacity of mesodermal cells to act as mechanosensors that can conform, deform, and reform in adaptation to the organism's physical environment. Mechanical forces, such as hydrostatic pressure and gravity, play important roles in the embryonic development, homeostasis, and repair of lung and bone. We discuss the role of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) as a mechanotransducer for stretch in these organs during normal development, particularly as it lends itself to homeostasis; we further demonstrate that "uncoupling" of such mechanisms may play a central role in injury repair, particularly as it relates to chronic diseases of lung and bone. Endothermal PTHrP signaling through its G-protein coupled receptor promotes normal cell-cell signaling that maintains the homeostatic phenotypes of lung and bone. Molecular disruption of the PTHrP/PTHrP receptor pathway from endoderm to mesoderm, because of such factors as volutrauma, hyperoxia, inflammation, and microgravity, alters intracellular signaling, causing maladaptive cellular changes, resulting in myofibroblast proliferation and granulation. Examples of such pathologic changes specifically related to this cellular/molecular mechanism of maladaptation are chronic lung disease and osteoporosis. We suggest a new paradigm that may help in the future creation of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for a wide range of developmental and chronic diseases ranging from bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and osteoporosis as a result of aging or microgravity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether treatment of premature infants with intratracheal recombinant human CuZn superoxide dismutase (r-h CuZnSOD) reduces bronchopulmonary dysplasia and improves pulmonary outcome at 1 year corrected age., DESIGN: Three hundred two premature infants (600-1200 g birth weight) treated with exogenous surfactant at birth for respiratory distress syndrome were randomized to receive either intratracheal r-h CuZnSOD (5 mg/kg in 2 mL/kg saline) or placebo every 48 hours (as long as intubation was required) for up to 1 month of age. Short-term, as well as longer-term pulmonary outcome was assessed., RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in the incidence of death or the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (oxygen requirement with an Edwards chest radiograph score of >or=3) at 28 days of life or 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. r-h CuZnSOD was well-tolerated and not associated with significant increases in any adverse event. At a median of 1 year corrected age, health assessments and physical examinations were performed on 209 (80%) surviving infants, with complete data available on 189 infants. Thirty-seven percent of placebo-treated infants had repeated episodes of wheezing or other respiratory illness severe enough to require treatment with asthma medications such as bronchodilators and/or corticosteroids compared with 24% of r-h CuZnSOD-treated infants, a 36% reduction. In infants <27 weeks' gestation, 42% treated with placebo received asthma medications compared with 19% of r-h CuZnSOD-treated infants, a 55% decrease. Infants <27 weeks' gestation who received r-h CuZnSOD also had a 55% decrease in emergency department visits and a 44% decrease in subsequent hospitalizations. Growth measurements and the results of physical examinations were comparable between groups., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that treatment at birth with r-h CuZnSOD may reduce early pulmonary injury, resulting in improved clinical status when measured at 1 year corrected age. r-h CuZnSOD appears to be a safe and effective therapy that improves pulmonary outcome in high-risk premature infants.

AB  - Despite widespread use of drugs to arrest preterm labor, there has been no decrease in the numbers of low-birth-weight or preterm infants in the last 20 years. Evidence from many sources links preterm birth to symptomatic and subclinical infections. Recently, an increasing body of evidence has suggested that not only is subclinical infection responsible for preterm birth but also for many serious neonatal sequelae, including periventricular leukomalacia, cerebral palsy, respiratory distress and even bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis. Proxies of intrauterine infection include clinical chorioamnionitis, histological chorioamnionitis and intraamniotic increase in cytokines, which have been found to be associated with acute neonatal morbidity and mortality and, at least to some degree, with neurological impairment, chronic lung disease and thymus involution in the preterm infant. The infectious/inflammatory mechanisms involved are not fully understood, and the types of microbes and genetic features of host adaptive and innate immune responses need to be better characterized.

AB  - Infection with respiratory syncytial virus is frequent but most often benign. The serious forms of the illness, which make necessary hospitalisation or care in an intensive Care Unit, appear in infants of less than 6 weeks and especially in those with underlying pathologies, prematurity, congenital cardiopathies or chronic respiratory illnesses. Palivizumab (SYNAGIS) is mouse humanized monoclonal antibody which is used for prevention by monthly injections before and during the epidemic period. In a pivotal study performed on 1502 infants aged less than 6 months and former prematures of less than 36 weeks gestational age (GA) or aged less than 2 years and preventing a bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 1002 infants received 5 monthly injections, compared with 500 infants treated with placebo. There was a significant reduction of 55% risk of hospitalisation with VRS infections in the treated group, but no significant reduction in the number of stays in intensive care or deaths. The recommendation in France now is to use SYNAGIS in children aged less than 6 months, born with or GA of less then 32 weeks or aged less than 2 years and presenting a bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Questions remain on the cost-benefit ratio of this treatment and the favourable effects of this treatment in children who carry other chronic pulmonary or cardiac pathologies.

AB  - An intact and well-functioning pulmonary surfactant system is critical for normal respiration and protection from lung infection. Surfactant is comprised of phospholipids that reduce surface tension and greatly reduce the work of breathing. The other major component consists of surfactant-associated proteins, which optimise the biophysical function of phospholipids and/or play an important role in host defence by acting as collectins. Alteration of surfactant composition and function occurs with various inflammatory disorders that affect the airways or the lung parenchyma including asthma, infant respiratory distress syndrome/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and interstitial lung disease. Although surfactant replacement therapy is indicated for infant respiratory distress syndrome, there is no well-proven role for exogenous surfactant in the treatment of inflammatory lung disorders at the present time.

AB  - Connatal infection with human adenovirus (HAdV) has been recently proposed as a cofactor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants [Couroucli et al. 2000 Pediatr Res 47:225-232]. In another study, BPD was associated with an increased incidence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection [Sawyer et al. 1987 Am J Dis Child 141:303-305]. During a 18-mo study period, we investigated tracheal aspirates or pharyngeal aspirates and urine samples collected during the first month of life from 66 preterm newborns with very low birth weight (< or =1.500 g) for replication-potent HAdV as well as for adenoviral and HCMV DNA by virus culture and qualitative DNA PCR. Thus, our study included not only prenatal but also peri- and postnatal infections. Thirty-seven percent (24/66) of infants developed BPD(1), as defined by persistent oxygen dependency at day 28 of life. Replication-potent HAdV and/or adenoviral DNA could be detected repeatedly in tracheal aspirates/pharyngeal aspirates and/or urine from 20% (13/66) of preterm infants. Seventeen percent (4/24) of infants in the BPD(1) group and 21% (9/42) of infants in the non-BPD group had an HAdV infection, indicating that in our study the very recently proposed association between HAdV infection of the lung and BPD could not be confirmed. For comparison, active HCMV infection was diagnosed in 18% (12/66) of infants, 3 of which developed HCMV disease. 29% (7/24) in the BPD(1) group and 12% (5/42) in the non-BPD group were positive for HCMV. Again, there was no statistically significant association between HCMV infection and BPD. In summary, our findings indicate that HAdV and HCMV infection are frequent in preterm newborns with very low birth weight; however, a causal association with the development of BPD seems unlikely.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors associated to bronchiolitis in infants less than two years of age., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective case-control study was performed in a hospital of second level of attention. The sample size was calculated for a level of confidence of 95%, a power of 90%, and a difference of exposure of 15% between cases and controls. For each case, there was one control matched for age and sex. The cases were obtained in the pediatric emergency room and the controls were healthy infants who came to the preventive medicine service of the same hospital. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis was established by direct observation in accordance to clinical criteria and chest X-ray. All the patients were weighed to the moment to be included in the study, and through structured interview the following variables were investigated: family history of bronchial asthma and atopy in immediate family members, prematurity, mechanical ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, present-day breast-feeding, length of time of breast feeding, early weaning, passive tobacco smoke exposure, maternal smoking, housing and living with domestic animals. The global significance of the study was probed by multiple logistic regression., RESULTS: Were studied 110 pairs with a range of age of 10 days to 23 months (average of 7.1 +/- 4.7 months), 49 pairs were female and 61 male (ratio 1:1.2) The variables significantly associated (P < or = 0.05) to bronchiolitis were family history of bronchial asthma in immediate family members (OR: 2.9, IC 95% 1.29-6.34) and prematurity (OR: 3.0, IC 95% 1.04-8.87). The early weaning(OR: 0.44, IC 95% 0.24-0.79) and present-day breast-feeding (OR: 0.53, IC 95% 0.30-0.95) revealed a significant negative association. The other studied variables didn't show statistically significant association with bronchiolitis., CONCLUSIONS: Factors that increase the risk of bronchiolitis are a history of prematurity, and family history of bronchial asthma. Factors that have a protective effect are early weaning, and present-day breast-feeding.

AB  - Premature lungs are highly susceptible to lung injuries, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is produced by the developing lung and may reduce the risk of BPD by preventing injury to the lung epithelium and enhancing its repair. To determine whether KGF concentrations in the airways during the initial phase of hyaline membrane disease are correlated with subsequent development of BPD defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at a postconceptional age of 36 weeks, we obtained tracheal aspirates within 3 hours of birth (Day 0) from 91 intubated neonates with a gestational age of 30 weeks or less. Repeat samples were obtained from 42 neonates within 5 days after birth. KGF in aspirate supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. On Day 0, KGF was detected in all but six neonates. A significant increase in KGF concentration was found from the first to the second samples. The highest KGF concentration within 5 days after birth (KGF(max)) was significantly higher in survivors without BPD than in those with BPD. A KGF(max) value higher than 110 pg/ml had a positive predictive value of 95% for absence of BPD. KGF may hold promise for the treatment of very premature neonates.

AB  - The classic entity of neonatal distress syndrome, as a lung disease expressing predominant surfactant deficiency, is currently changing to a more complex disease of the developing lung as a result of the number of extremely immature preterm infants. Prenatal factors, such as the fetal inflammatory response syndrome influence short- and long-term outcome in these premature infants presenting with respiratory distress syndrome at birth. Therefore, various previously dismissed treatment strategies, such as surfactant prophylaxis or newer anti-inflammatory approaches have to be reinvestigated in this emerging population. Despite the resurrection of a new picture of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation remains a major issue in neonatal intensive care. With the advance in understanding of mechanical ventilation, it is becoming evident, that improvement in outcome can not be achieved by restoring normal lung physiology in the diseased lung using sophisticated ventilators and ventilation modes. A more disease specific ventilator strategy that will target as early as possible homogenous lung opening while at the same time avoiding overdistention of the lung, has the potential to affect outcome. The possible antiinflammatory properties of surfactant-proteins, nitric oxide and corticosteroids, despite some drawbacks, may show to have a synergistic effect. However, this needs further exploration.

In this report, we characterize the lung pathology and expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) associated with U. urealyticum pneumonia in very low-birth weight infants (VLBW; < or =1500 g). Lung pathology of archived autopsy specimens was retrospectively reviewed in three groups of VLBW infants: 5 gestational controls who died from nonpulmonary causes, 13 infants with pneumonia who were culture and/or PCR negative for U. urealyticum, and 5 infants with pulmonary disease and positive for U. urealyticum by tracheal aspirate and/or lung tissue culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Presence and extent of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, as well as interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis were evaluated. PCR was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections. Additional sections were immunostained for TNF-alpha. The peripheral total white blood cell counts and absolute neutrophil counts were three-fold higher in infants with U. urealyticum pneumonia than cell counts in infants infected with other organisms. There was a trend toward a predominance of neutrophils in alveoli of non- Ureaplasma pneumonia infants, but a trend toward a predominance of alveolar macrophages in U. urealyticum-infected infants. The most striking finding was the presence of increased interstitial fibrosis in all Ureaplasma-infected infants. TNF-alpha immunoreactive cell density was very low in the gestational controls, but increased in both pneumonia groups. We conclude that persistent lung U. urealyticum infection may contribute to chronic inflammation and early fibrosis in the preterm lung.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced injury to the developing lung, impaired alveolarization, and dysregulated vascularization are critical factors in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); however, mechanisms for hyperoxia-induced development of BPD are not fully known. In this study, we show that TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1) is upregulated in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal murine lungs as well as in tracheal aspirates and lungs of human neonates with respiratory distress syndrome and BPD as an adaptive response to survival in hyperoxia. Inhibition of TREM-1 function using an siRNA approach or deletion of the Trem1 gene in mice showed enhanced lung inflammation, alveolar damage, and mortality of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice. The treatment of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice with agonistic TREM-1 antibody decreased lung inflammation, improved alveolarization, and was associated with diminished necroptosis-regulating protein RIPK3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3). Mechanistically, we show that TREM-1 activation alleviates lung inflammation and improves alveolarization through downregulating RIPK3-mediated necroptosis and NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3) inflammasome activation in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice. These data show that activating TREM-1, enhancing angiopoietin 1 signaling, or blocking the RIPK3-mediated necroptosis pathway may be used in new therapeutic interventions to control adverse effects of hyperoxia in the development of BPD.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus remains a significant cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in children. The risk of serious RSV illness is highest among children with prematurity, chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease. No effective vaccine and anti-viral agents have been obtained even now. Therefore, conservative therapy including respiratory aid has been a principal therapy for serious RSV disease. Recently, monthly intramuscular administration of humanized anti-RSV monoclonal antibody(palivizumab) was introduced in clinical fields in USA and Europe. Palivizumab prophylaxis has appeared to be safe and effective for prevention of serious RSV illness in premature children and those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Preterm birth with its subsequent morbidity and mortality is the leading perinatal problem in the United States. Infants born before the thirty-seventh week of gestation account for approximately 6% to 9% of all births, but 70% of all perinatal deaths and half of all long-term neurologic morbidity. Current approaches focus on symptomatic treatment. Despite widespread use of drugs to arrest preterm labor (tocolytics), there has been no decrease in low birth weight or preterm infants in the last 20 years. It is likely that therapy directed at preventing or treating underlying causes would be more successful. Evidence from many sources links preterm birth to symptomatic infections, for example, of the urinary or respiratory tracts. In the last decade, great interest has been generated to support the hypothesis that subclinical infection is an important cause of preterm labor. Evidence to support this may be categorized as follows: histological chorioamnionitis is increased in preterm births; clinical infection is increased after preterm birth; there is significant association of some lower genital tract organisms and infections with preterm birth or preterm premature rupture of the membranes; there are positive cultures of amniotic fluid or membranes from some patients with preterm labor and preterm birth; there are markers of infections in preterm birth; bacteria or their products induce preterm birth in animal models; and some antibiotic trials have shown a lower rate of preterm birth or have deferred preterm birth. In the last 5 years, additional exciting information has suggested that not only is subclinical infection responsible for preterm birth but also many serious neonatal sequelae including periventricular leukomalacia, cerebral palsy, respiratory distress, and even bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis. In sum, a large body of clinical and laboratory information suggests that subclinical infection is a major cause of preterm birth, especially those occurring before 30 weeks. This concept holds promise that new approaches can be developed to prevent prematurity.

AB  - UNLABELLED: We studied the nutritional requirements of 53 neonates with a birth-weight of 1250 g or less and analysed the parenteral and enteral nutrition provided, the weight-gain curves, the incidence of prior pathology and complications. We compared those weighing under 1000 g at birth (n=25) with those weighing 1001-1250 g (n=28). All neonates received central parenteral nutrition at an average age of 42.3 h. The liquid requirements of the lower birth-weight group were significantly greater. No differences were found in the supply of glucose, proteins, lipids and calories until after the first 15 days of life, when the <1000 g group required a greater liquid and caloric intake. Parenteral nutrition was suspended earlier for the >1000 g group (32.6 vs. 48.1 days). Maximum weight loss (12.56%) for the two groups occurred at 5.23 days. No differences in weight gain (g/kg/day) between the groups were observed. The >1000 g group began enteral nutrition significantly earlier and presented greater tolerance. The incidence of complications (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis, Candidas A sepsis, osteopenia) was greater in the lower birth-weight group, as was that of hyaline membrane disease and mechanically assisted respiration. There were no differences in the incidence of intracraneal haemorrhage, ductus arteriosus, early sepsis, delayed intrauterine growth or hypoglucemia., CONCLUSIONS: The severity of the initial pathology and the greater incidence of complications among the lower birth-weight neonates (<1000 g) influenced both the need for parenteral nutrition and the reduced tolerance to enteral nutrition. Although the rate of weight gain was similar for the two groups, the <1000 g group required a longer period of parenteral nutrition.

AB  - Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are characterized by endothelial cell damage. Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a disorder that alters the pulmonary microvasculature. Immunohistochemistry for VEGFA(165), an endothelial cell mitogen, and its receptor Flt-1, was performed on lung tissues from autopsies from four fetuses, three preterm infants, four term infants without primary lung disease, four infants with BPD, and four infants with PPHN. VEGF was measured in tracheal aspirates from 31 preterm infants, 5 intubated term infants without primary lung injury, and 12 infants with PPHN during the first 10 postnatal days, and from 8 infants with BPD. Immunohistochemistry for VEGF and Flt-1 was similar in fetuses, preterm infants, and term infants: for VEGF mostly in bronchial epithelium and alveolar macrophages, and for Flt-1 mostly in vascular endothelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells. In patients with BPD, and PPHN, staining for VEGF and Flt-1 appeared also in Type II pneumocytes. Preterm infants with more severe RDS had lower VEGF than those who recovered. The persistent expression of VEGF and Flt-1 during the fetal and neonatal period supports a physiological role for VEGF in human lung development. The lower pulmonary VEGF in preterm infants with more severe RDS may contribute to the pathophysiology of the acute lung injury. In BPD, the expression of VEGF in alveolar epithelium may represent a compensatory increase after the acute phase of the lung disease. In PPHN, that more cell types express VEGF and Flt-1, and the tendency toward a higher concentration of pulmonary VEGF may represent enhanced production of VEGF in response to impaired endothelial function.

AB  - Respiratory insufficiency due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is partly due to the abundance of thickened mucus and the inability to clear it from the airways. Mucus in RSV bronchiolitis contains necrotic inflammatory and epithelial cells. The viscoelastic properties of purulent airway secretions are largely due to the presence of highly polymerized deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) is known to liquefy such mucus in patients with cystic fibrosis, whereas case reports described a beneficial effect in other respiratory disorders. The authors hypothesized that rhDNase would diminish atelectasis and mucus plugging in infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis. Two infants with RSV bronchiolitis with massive unilateral atelectasis in whom mechanical ventilation was imminent due to exhaustion, and three mechanically ventilated infants (two neonates, one with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) with RSV bronchiolitis with pneumonia received treatment with 2.5 mg nebulized rhDNase twice daily. Following administration of nebulized recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, clinical and radiological parameters improved quickly. Mechanical ventilation could be avoided in two infants while in three infants on artificial ventilation, clinical recovery started following the first dose of the drug. A therapeutic trial of recombinant human deoxyribonuclease may be an option in the treatment for atelectasis in severe or complicated respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if the presence of a neonatal surgical facility on site has any effect on mortality and morbidity of very premature infants with necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)., DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of infants of less than 29 weeks gestation cared for in the seven perinatal centres in New South Wales., PATIENTS: Between 1992 and 1997, 605 infants were cared for in two centres with in house surgical facilities (group 1) and 1195 in five centres where transfers were required for surgical management (group 2)., RESULTS: Although use of antenatal steroids was significantly lower in group 1 centres than group 2 centres (74% v. 85% respectively), and the incidence of hyaline membrane disease, pneumothorax, and NEC was higher, mortality was identical (27%). Fifty two (9%) infants in group 1 and 72 (6%) in group 2 of comparable perinatal characteristics and CRIB (Clinical Risk Index for Babies) scores developed radiologically or pathologically proven NEC. The overall mortality of infants with NEC in group 1 was lower but this was not statistically significant (27% v. 35%). Significantly more infants with NEC in group 1 had surgery (69% v. 39%). There were fewer postoperative deaths in group 1 and more deaths without surgery in group 2. The duration of respiratory and nutritional support and hospital stay for the survivors were similar in the two groups. In a multivariate analysis, shorter gestation was the only factor associated with mortality in infants with NEC; the presence of in house surgical facilities was not., CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in outcome of premature infants with NEC managed in perinatal centres with or without on site surgical facilities. Early transfers should be encouraged. This finding may have implications for future planning of facilities for neonatal care.

AB  - Inflammation may contribute to lung injury and impaired alveolar development in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We treated hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats with antibodies to the neutrophil chemokine cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) during 95% O2 exposure to reduce adverse effects of hyperoxia-induced inflammation on lung development. Rats were exposed at birth to air, 95% O2, or 95% O2 + anti-CINC-1 (injected on days 3 and 4). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected 6 h before death. Anti-CINC-1 treatment improved weight gain but not survival at day 8. Anti-CINC-1 reduced bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils at day 8 to levels equal to air controls. Total detectable lung CINC-1 was reduced to air control levels. Lung compliance was improved by anti-CINC-1, achieving air control levels in the 10-microg anti-CINC-1 group. Anti-CINC-1 preserved proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in airway epithelium despite 95% O2 exposure. BrdU incorporation was depressed by hyperoxia but preserved by anti-CINC-1 to levels similar to air control. Alveolar volume and surface density were decreased by hyperoxia but preserved by anti-CINC-1 to levels equal to air control. Blockade of neutrophil influx in newborns may avert early lung injury and avoid alveolar developmental arrest that contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfactant preparations are now widely used and have been credited with recent improvements in overall infant mortality (Horbar 1993b, Schwartz 1994). A wide variety of surfactant preparations have been developed and tested. These include synthetic surfactants and surfactants derived from animal sources. Although clinical trials have demonstrated that both synthetic surfactants and natural surfactant preparations are effective, comparison in animal models has suggested that there may be greater efficacy of natural surfactant products, perhaps due to the protein content of natural surfactant (Tooley 1987)., OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of synthetic surfactant to natural surfactant in premature infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome., SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Medline 1975 through December 2000 (MeSH terms: pulmonary surfactant; limits: age groups, newborn infant; publication type, clinical trial), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants, and journal hand searching in the English language., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing administration of synthetic surfactants to administration of natural surfactant extracts in premature infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome were considered for this review., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data regarding clinical outcomes including pneumothorax, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage (all intraventricular hemorrhage and severe intraventricular hemorrhage), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity, and mortality were excerpted by both reviewers. Data analysis was conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group., MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials met inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis shows that the use of natural surfactant rather than synthetic surfactant results in a significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax (typical relative risk 0.63, 95% CI 0.53, 0.75; typical risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.06, -0.03) and the risk of mortality (typical relative risk 0.87, 95% CI 0.76, 0.98; typical risk difference -0.02, 95% CI -0.05, 0.00). Natural surfactant extract is associated with a marginal increase in the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (typical relative risk 1.09, 95% CI 1.00, 1.19; typical risk difference 0.03, 95% CI 0.00, 0.06), but no increase in grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (typical relative risk 1.08, 95% CI 0.92, 1.28; typical risk difference 0.01, 95% CI -0.01, 0.03). The meta-analyses support a marginal decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality associated with the use of natural surfactant preparations (typical relative risk 0.95, 95% CI 0.90, 1.01; typical risk difference -0.03, 95% CI -0.06, 0.00). No other relevant differences in outcome are noted., REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Both natural surfactant extracts and synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with natural surfactant extract treatment. Natural surfactant may be associated with an increase in intraventricular hemorrhage, though the more serious hemorrhages (Grade 3 and 4) are not increased. Despite these concerns, natural surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available synthetic surfactants.

AB  - Pulmonary surfactant is a multimolecular complex located at the air-water interface within the alveolus to which a range of physical (surface-active properties) and immune functions has been assigned. This complex consists of a surface-active lipid layer (consisting mainly of phospholipids), and of an aqueous subphase. From discrete surfactant sub-fractions one can isolate strongly hydrophobic surfactant proteins B (SP-B) and C (SP-C) as well as collectins SP-A and SP-D, which were shown to have specific structural, metabolic, or immune properties. Inborn or acquired abnormalities of the surfactant, qualitative or quantitative in nature, account for a number of human diseases. Beside hyaline membrane disease of the preterm neonate, a cluster of hereditary or acquired lung diseases has been characterized by periodic acid-Schiff-positive material filling the alveoli. From this heterogeneous nosologic group, at least two discrete entities presently emerge. The first is the SP-B deficiency, in which an essentially proteinaceous material is stored within the alveoli, and which represents an autosomal recessive Mendelian entity linked to the SFTPB gene (MIM 1786640). The disease usually generally entails neonatal respiratory distress with rapid fatal outcome, although partial or transient deficiencies have also been observed. The second is alveolar proteinosis, characterized by the storage of a mixed protein and lipid material, which constitutes a relatively heterogeneous clinical and biological syndrome, especially with regard to age at onset (from the neonate through to adulthood) as well as the severity of associated signs. Murine models, with a targeted mutation of the gene encoding granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Csfgm) or the beta subunit of its receptor (II3rb1) support the hypothesis of an abnormality of surfactant turnover in which the alveolar macrophage is a key player. Apart from SP-B deficiency, in which a near-consensus diagnostic chart can be designed, the ascertainment of other abnormalities of surfactant metabolism is not straightforward. The disentanglement of this disease cluster is however essential to propose specific therapeutic procedures: repeated broncho-alveolar lavages, GM-CSF replacement, bone marrow grafting or lung transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many premature infants with respiratory failure are deficient in surfactant, but the relationship to occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is uncertain., METHODS: Tracheal aspirates were collected from 209 treated and control infants enrolled at 7-14 days in the Trial of Late Surfactant. The content of phospholipid, surfactant protein B, and total protein were determined in large aggregate (active) surfactant., RESULTS: At 24 h, surfactant treatment transiently increased surfactant protein B content (70%, p < 0.01), but did not affect recovered airway surfactant or total protein/phospholipid. The level of recovered surfactant during dosing was directly associated with content of surfactant protein B (r = 0.50, p < 0.00001) and inversely related to total protein (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). For all infants, occurrence of BPD was associated with lower levels of recovered large aggregate surfactant, higher protein content, and lower SP-B levels. Tracheal aspirates with lower amounts of recovered surfactant had an increased proportion of small vesicle (inactive) surfactant., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that many intubated premature infants are deficient in active surfactant, in part due to increased intra-alveolar metabolism, low SP-B content, and protein inhibition, and that the severity of this deficit is predictive of BPD. Late surfactant treatment at the frequency used did not provide a sustained increase in airway surfactant.

This complex consists of a surface active lipid layer (mainly phospholipids), and of an aqueous subphase. From discrete surfactant sub-fractions, one can isolate very hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C as well as the collectins SP-A and SP-D, which were shown to have structural, metabolic, or defensive properties.

From this heterogeneous nosologic bulk, at least two discrete entities presently seem to emerge: 1) SP-B deficiency, in which an essentially proteinaceous material is stored within the alveoli, and which is a bona fide autosomal recessive Mendelian entity linked to the SFTPB gene (MIM 1786640), generally entailing neonatal respiratory distress with rapid fatal outcome, although partial or transient deficiencies have also been observed; 2) alveolar proteinosis, characterized by the storage of a mixed, protein and lipid material, and which constitutes a relatively heterogeneous clinical biological syndrome, with regards to age at onset (from the neonate through to adulthood) as well as the severity of associated signs.

AB  - Cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 are the key enzymes in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) takes part both in inflammation and in control of cell growth. COX-2 immunohistochemistry was performed on lung tissues from autopsies, with four groups included: fetuses (n = 4, GA = 16.0 to 32.0 wk), preterm infants (n = 10, GA = 23.0 to 29.9 wk), term infants (n = 6, GA = 38.7 to 42.0 wk), and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (n = 4, GA = 28.9 to 30.7 wk). COX-2 staining occurred exclusively in the epithelial cells resembling type II pneumocytes in the alveolae, and in ciliated epithelial cells in the bronchi. In fetuses, moderate intensity alveolar staining was seen in 90-100% cells lining the alveolar epithelium. In preterm infants, high intensity alveolar staining was seen in a scattered pattern. In term infants, the alveolar staining was also scattered, but with a lower proportion of positive cells. In BPD no staining appeared in alveolar epithelial cells. The most intense bronchial staining was found in fetuses and the least intense in term infants; staining was also seen in BPD. COX-2 is present in human perinatal lung from the gestational age of 16 wk, in a changing pattern. We suggest that COX-2 may, in addition to participating in inflammation, also play a developmental role in the perinatal lung.

AB  - Bronchiolitis is the most common disease of the respiratory tract during the first year of life, and occurs in annual epidemics in winter. The etiology is viral, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the commonest agent. Respiratory symptoms remain generally mild, and treatment just supportive and at home. Certain infants are at high risk of severe illness (age less than 3 months, preterm birth, neonatal respiratory disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, underlying chronic diseases), and require hospitalisation. Most treatments are of unproved (corticosteroids), or limited benefit (inhaled bronchodilators, antibiotics). Chest physiotherapy is indicated in case of bronchial secretion. Vaccine are not now available, but prophylaxis with human RSV immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies has to be considered for children at increased risk for severe disease.

AB  - Increased airway smooth muscle mass has been demonstrated in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma. These data highlight the need for a precise understanding of the events involved in airway smooth muscle mitogenesis. To that end, investigators have developed cell culture systems adopting tracheal and bronchial myocytes from different species. A growing body of literature suggests that common signal transduction pathways regulate airway smooth muscle cell cycle entry across species lines. This review summarizes what is known about mitogen-activated signal transduction in airway smooth muscle cells. The extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathways appear to be major positive regulators of airway smooth muscle proliferation. It is also conceivable that growth factor stimulation of airway smooth muscle simultaneously elicits signaling through negative regulatory pathways such as the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, perhaps as a safeguard against excessive growth.

AB  - Since the 1960s there has been a continual improvement in the survival of premature infants of birthweight less than 1500 g. This has resulted in an increase in the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or its milder form, chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity. In children with BPD; the initial air trapping improves in the first 3-4 years of life, but small airway obstruction is often slow to improve, suggesting dysanaptic lung growth. Despite this, the majority of older children and adolescents with BPD/CLD do not have significant respiratory symptoms. Children born prematurely with or without hyaline membrane disease may also have a reduction in expiratory flows during childhood, albeit less severe. The clinical significance of this in the longer term is unclear. Although significant associations between decrements in expiratory flows, neonatal oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation have been demonstrated. Airway function has also been reported to be largely unrelated with perinatal events but strongly associated with birthweight. The latter suggests that intra-uterine factors such as under-nutrition may be more important than hitherto recognized. Because of a lack of longitudinal studies, it is unclear how lung function will track during adolescence and adult life. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness is significantly increased in children with BPD and to a lesser extent in those born prematurely with or without hyaline membrane disease. It is unclear whether this is due to a genetic predisposition, neonatal lung injury or anatomically smaller airways. Given the morbidity and fiscal cost of a premature birth, effective strategies to reduce the premature birth rate are needed.

AB  - RSV is a major cause of respiratory illness in infants under 2 years of age. Evidence is accumulating that it is also underestimated as a cause of respiratory infection in adults, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Active interventions to control the impact of RSV infection have been hampered by a lack of understanding of the immune response to RSV in different age groups. A number of different strategies for developing RSV vaccines have been pursued, including live attenuated vaccines, genetically engineered live and subunit vaccines and peptide vaccines with varying degrees of success. The target populations for RSV vaccines include infants, the elderly and women of childbearing age, but the efficacy of different vaccines may differ according to age. Desirable immune responses and immune correlates of protection to RSV in humans remain uncertain and determining these is critical for introduction of any vaccines. Prophylaxis and treatment of RSV in infants using human immunoglobulin containing high titres of RSV specific neutralising antibody (RSV-Ig) has shown limited success in different infant populations. Prophylaxis of premature infants with RSV-Ig, particularly those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, has demonstrated limited clinical efficacy against RSV. In contrast, there are significant safety concerns for use of this preparation for prophylaxis in infants with congenital heart disease and no demonstrable efficacy in treatment of RSV disease in healthy infants. The cost of the preparation will limit use to highly selected infant groups. Production of humanized monoclonal antibodies to RSV offers another potential passive immunotherapy intervention for RSV, with increased specific activity and reduced side effects, although its use remains experimental.

AB  - Pulmonary surfactant is a complex and highly surface active material composed of lipids and proteins which is found in the fluid lining the alveolar surface of the lungs. Surfactant prevents alveolar collapse at low lung volume, and preserves bronchiolar patency during normal and forced respiration (biophysical functions). In addition, it is involved in the protection of the lungs from injuries and infections caused by inhaled particles and micro-organisms (immunological, non-biophysical functions). Pulmonary surfactant can only be harvested by lavage procedures, which may disrupt its pre-existing biophysical and biochemical micro-organization. These limitations must always be considered when interpreting ex vivo studies of pulmonary surfactant. A pathophysiological role for surfactant was first appreciated in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome and hyaline membrane disease, a condition which is nowadays routinely treated with exogenous surfactant replacement. Biochemical surfactant abnormalities of varying degrees have been described in obstructive lung diseases (asthma, bronchiolitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and following lung transplantation), infectious and suppurative lung diseases (cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, and human immunodeficiency virus), adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, other diseases specific to infants (chronic lung disease of prematurity, and surfactant protein-B deficiency), interstitial lung diseases (sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, following cardiopulmonary bypass, and in smokers. For some pulmonary conditions surfactant replacement therapy is on the horizon, but for the majority much more needs to be learnt about the pathophysiological role the observed surfactant abnormalities may have.

AB  - Systematic recording of cardiorespirographic events has been recommended by some authors in premature and/or very low birth weight infants before or shortly after hospital's discharge. Their objective is the recognition of babies at risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and prevention by home monitoring. After an extensive review of the recent literature, prematurity itself does not appear as a risk factor of SIDS. Late apneas are common, but their prognostic significance remains uncertain. Although it is clear that bronchopulmonary dysplasia carries a greater risk of acute life threatening events and infantile death, their prevention mainly relies upon an adequate oxygen supplementation. As a consequence no more than the general infant population, premature infants require neither polysomnographic recording nor home monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the neonatal outcome (survival, intraventricular hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) of inborn and outborn very-low-birth-weight infants accounting for sociodemographic, obstetric and perinatal variables., STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-one premature infants with birth weights of 750-1250 g delivered between 1990 and 1994 in a hospital providing neonatal intensive care were compared with 76 premature babies delivered in a referring hospital. In the statistical analysis, variables with a statistically significant association with the outcome variables and dissimilar distributions in the two hospitals were identified and entered together with the hospital of birth as explanatory variables in a logistic regression., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences between the outcome variables of the two populations examined were observed, whether before or after accounting for the covariates. The odds ratios (outborns relative to inborns) were 1.18 for mortality, 1.25 for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 1.53 for severe intraventricular hemorrhage. In the multivariate analyses, respiratory distress syndrome was significantly associated with mortality; both low birth weight and the presence of respiratory distress syndrome were associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia; the evolvement of severe intraventricular hemorrhage was associated with respiratory distress syndrome, initial low Apgar score, advanced multiparity and delivery at the 28-29th week compared to the 23rd-27th week. Antenatal steroid administration had a protective effect., CONCLUSION: Our results concur with the notion that a tertiary center is the optimal location for delivery of the high risk neonate. Improvement in medical and nursing care prenatally and at delivery and transportation, including frequent administration of antenatal steroids and earlier administration of surfactant prior to transportation, may minimize the disadvantage of delivery in a referring hospital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extreme prematurity has been associated with exercise intolerance and reduced physical activity. We hypothesized that children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) would be especially affected based on long-term lung function impairments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare exercise capacity and habitual physical activity between children born very and extremely preterm with and without BPD and term-born children., METHODS: Twenty-two school-aged children (aged 8 to 12 years) born with a gestational age < 32 weeks and a birthweight < 1500 g (9 with moderate or severe BPD (=BPD), 13 without BPD (=No-BPD)) and 15 healthy term-born children (=CONTROL) were included in the study. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry, lung function by spirometry and exercise capacity by an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test., RESULTS: Peak oxygen uptake was reduced in the BPD-group (83 +/- 11%predicted) compared to the No-BPD group (91 +/- 8%predicted) and the CONTROL group (94 +/- 9%predicted). In a general linear model, variance of peak oxygen uptake was significantly explained by BPD status and height but not by prematurity (p < 0.001). Compared to CONTROL, all children born preterm spent significantly more time in sedentary behaviour (BPD 478 +/- 50 min, No-BPD 450 +/- 52 min, CONTROL 398 +/- 56 min, p < 0.05) and less time in moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity (BPD 13 +/- 8 min, No-BPD 16 +/- 8 min, CONTROL 33 +/- 16 min, p < 0.001). Prematurity but not BPD contributed significantly to explained variance in a general linear model of sedentary behaviour and likewise moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively)., CONCLUSION: In our cohort, BPD but not prematurity was associated with a reduced exercise capacity at school-age. However, prematurity regardless of BPD was related to less engagement in physical activity and more time spent in sedentary behaviour. Thus, our findings suggest diverging effects of prematurity and BPD on exercise capacity and physical activity.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that develops in preterm infants treated with oxygen and positive-pressure ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome. Despite the introduction of new treatment modalities (surfactant therapy, high-frequency oscillation) and improvements in the outcome of critically ill preterm infants, BPD has become an extremely important complication of neonatal intensive care and the most common form of chronic lung disease in infants. Specific pathogenesis, treatment modalities, prognosis, and multidisciplinary approaches to the prevention of BPD are described in detail. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis ("hypersensitivity pneumonitis") is a rare pulmonary disease in childhood due to inhaled organic dust, containing fungal antigens, thermophilic actinomycetes, or avian proteins. Diagnosis is often difficult, but it should be considered in every child with persistent and otherwise unexplained respiratory symptoms.

AB  - Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are at risk for childhood wheezing and asthma, as are children with a family history of asthma. Family history of asthma may also be associated with premature labor and, among VLBW infants, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity. This study targeted all neonates with birth weight <1,501 g who were admitted to seven perinatal centers in Wisconsin and Iowa between August 1, 1988 and June 30, 1991. Comprehensive information was collected for 723 of the 1,007 30-day survivors, and for 106 full-term controls. A representative subgroup of 257 VLBW children was contacted at age 5 years to ascertain bronchodilator and/or steroid use and diagnosis of asthma. Some evidence of an association between family history of asthma and premature birth was found, but it was not associated with neonatal BPD/CLD or BPD/CLD severity. Among BPD/CLD indicators, radiographic evidence of BPD at age 25-35 days was most strongly associated with bronchodilator use up to age 2 years (odds ratio (OR) = 10.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.07-25.2) and with asthma between ages 2 years and 5 years (OR = 4.83, 95% CI 2.18-10.7). Among children without radiographic evidence of BPD, family history of asthma was associated with childhood asthma and bronchodilator use.

AB  - Recent technological advance in both molecular biology and morphology contributes to develop a research of alveolar formation in pre- and postnatal period. Retinoid, which has been known more than 2,000 compounds, has a key role for newly alveolar synthesis through various metabolic pathways related Hox gene, vitamin A laden fibroblast and collagen-elastin network. It has been shown that retinoid is a possible therapeutic regimen not only diffuse lung injury, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but also a hopeful new-drug for newly alveolar synthesis in severe emphysema.

AB  - We report sibs (a brother and a sister) who presented prenatally with ultrasound findings of meconium peritonitis and postnatally were found to have perforation of the terminal ileum. The sister presented with fetal ultrasound findings of severe ascites and peritoneal calcifications. She had no prenatal intervention and was born at 38 weeks' gestation. Laparatomy revealed perforation of the terminal ileum with meconium peritonitis. Her post-surgical course was uncomplicated and at 30 months of age her growth and development are normal. Her brother presented prenatally with signs of meconium peritonitis including severe ascites and peritoneal calcifications. Prenatal aspiration of the ascitic fluid was performed and unlike his sister he was born prematurely, was operated on at 8 days, and developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. He is currently 1 year old and has normal growth and development. The aetiology of the ileal perforation is not known. There were no findings suggesting connective tissue disorder and the aetiology of the intestinal perforation is not known. The occurrence of the same rare abnormality in sibs of different sexes points towards an autosomal recessive disorder.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) is perhaps the best studied member of tyrosine kinase receptors. Its inactivation by homologous recombination results in three different phenotypes ranging from peri-implantation lethality to postnatal lethality. The mildest form of EGF-R inactivation leads to epithelial immaturity and postnatal death due to respiratory failure and necrotizing enterocolitis-like lesions in the intestine. The defects seen in this 'postnatal lethality phenotype' manifest in the classical EGF-responsive organs (skin, intestine) and organs undergoing branching morphogenesis during development (lung, kidney, mammary gland, pancreas and prostate), and thus accord with the concept of EGF family members being important epithelial mitogens. The respiratory failure of the EGF-R (-/-) mice results from impaired branching of the alveolar tree and leads to decreased surface for gas exchange. Overall, the lung phenotype bears similarity to respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia--the most common complications of prematurity in humans. Intestinal changes seen in the EGF-R (-/-) mice vary in severity, the end-point being severe mucosal lesions and necroses. These findings resemble those seen in necrotizing enterocolitis of premature babies, a serious intestinal problem in the neonate. Although deficient EGF-R function is not the reason for these prematurity-associated diseases it may nevertheless exacerbate them. Potential usage of EGF transforming growth factor-alpha in clinical work is discussed.

AD  - Norway
AB  - In recent years a body of data has accumulated, linking the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to increased oxidative stress in the first few days after birth, since high concentrations of metabolites reflecting increased peroxidation products such as pentane, ethane, protein carbonyl, o-tyrosine, allantoin and F2-isoprostanes, as well as low levels of glutathione and sulfhydryl/total protein ratio, also reflecting increased oxidative load, have been found in the premature infants at risk of or developing BPD. Oxidative stress seems to increase lung antioxidants in some experimental models of BPD and hyperoxia affects foetal lung growth. There are similarities between inflammation and hypoxia/reoxygenation, since both activate a number of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and adhesion molecules, some of which are found in high concentrations in tracheal aspirate fluid of infants developing BPD. Surfactant production and function are also altered by both hyperoxia and reactive oxygen species per se, making the lungs more vulnerable to injury. This new knowledge may result in new and more efficient therapeutic approaches, hopefully leading to the eradication of BPD in the near future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inconsistent effects of vitamin A supplementation on prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have been reported. Meta-analysis of these reports resulted in a relative risk of 0.69-1.02 for death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia associated with vitamin A supplementation. Effective dosage regimens or serum retinol concentrations have not been determined in previous reports. The purpose of this pilot study was to define a vitamin A regimen that produces serum retinol concentrations of 25-55 micrograms/dl., STUDY DESIGN: In this three-phase study, 91 infants (mean birth weight 799-864 g) were enrolled. Vitamin A was administered three times/week for 4 weeks at an average daily dose of 986-2143 IU/day. Physical examinations were performed and serum retinol specimens were collected weekly to assess clinical signs of toxicity., RESULTS: The majority of serum retinol concentrations remained < 25 micrograms/dl until an intramuscular vitamin A dose of 5000 IU/dose three times/week was used. No clinical signs of toxicity were associated with the higher dosage and higher serum concentrations of vitamin A., CONCLUSION: A large clinical trial of vitamin A supplementation with 5000 IU/dose three times/week (25-114% more than the dose used in the three published clinical trials) is needed to assess whether vitamin A supplementation safely reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very-low-birth-weight infants.

AB  - Elastin is a critical component of the lung interstitium, providing the property of recoil to the vascular, conducting airway, and terminal airspace compartments of the lung. Elastic fibers, consisting of soluble tropoelastin monomers cross-linked on a preexisting scaffold of microfibrils, are produced primarily during late fetal and neonatal stages of development. The factors and molecular mechanisms regulating the cell type-specific and tightly temporally regulated expression of tropoelastin are currently under investigation. The onset and inductive phase of tropoelastin expression are characterized by increased transcription of the tropoelastin gene. Glucocorticoids accelerate this induction in fetal rats during the canalicular stage of lung development. Many additional factors regulate tropoelastin expression in cultured lung fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells, but the in vivo roles of such mediators are still under investigation. Cell-cell interactions may also promote elastogenesis during lung development, as localization of tropoelastin mRNA in pseudo-glandular and canalicular lungs demonstrates a close spatial relationship between epithelium and adjacent elastogenic mesenchyme. Elastin metabolism is altered in several experimental models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by abnormal lung morphological development, suggesting that normal elastin production and deposition is necessary for proper development of alveoli. Studies employing reverse genetics may prove useful in further defining the role of elastin in lung development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood C-reactive protein levels have been frequently found to be increased after Curosurf instillation. These variations have been compared to the values after Surfexo therapy and after absence of surfactant therapy., POPULATION AND METHODS: The files of not infected premature babies, aged 25 to 36 weeks of gestational age, under mechanical ventilation for a hyaline membrane disease (HMD), admitted in our unit between January 1990 to June 1995, have been retrospectively studied. They were separated into three groups: A: 67 infants ventilated for more than 5 days for HMD without surfactant therapy; B: 23 infants treated by Surfexo; C: 60 infants treated by Curosurf. CRP was measured daily between day 0 (DO) and D5. Means and standard deviations were calculated for each day and each group. The mean values of CRP at D1 to D5 in group C were compared to DO. The daily CRP values were compared in the three groups. For group C, the results were studied daily according to the gestational age, dosage and age of the neonate at the first instillation. The statistical results have been given according to the Student t test., RESULTS: After Curosurf, the mean CRP value rose significantly from D1 to D4 compared to D0. There was no difference of CRP between groups A and B from D0 to D5, Group C had higher values in comparison to group A (between D1 to D5) and to group B (between D1 and D3). There was no significant difference of the CRP values in group C according to the number of instillations or the amount instilled, but CRP was lower in early treated infants (< H6)., DISCUSSION: Curosurf instillation is followed by a significant increase in CRP, maximum at D2. This is not seen after Surfexo. This increase seems less important at D2-D3 when Curosurf is administered early. The CRP increase after Curosurf therapy could be due to an inflammatory reaction to the heterologous proteins it contains.

AB  - Short-term outcome in very low birthweight babies has never been closely examined in Papua New Guinea. A cohort of neonates born over a year at Port Moresby General Hospital was followed from birth to death or discharge. Intrauterine growth retardation was an important contributor to low birthweight. Simple, inexpensive care resulted in respectable survival figures. Improving antenatal surveillance will have much more impact in reducing mortality in this group in the future than trying to emulate sophisticated and costly western neonatal care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolar simplification and disordered angiogenesis. Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine which modulates cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Here we tested the hypothesis that intra-tracheal (IT) administration of a naked plasmid DNA expressing SDF-1 would attenuate neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury in an experimental model of BPD, by promoting angiogenesis., DESIGN/METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley rat pups (n = 18-20/group) exposed to room air (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 1 to 14 were randomly assigned to receive IT a naked plasmid expressing SDF-1, JVS-100 (Juventas Therapeutics, Cleveland, Ohio) or placebo (PL) on P3. Lung alveolarization, angiogenesis, inflammation, vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension (PH) were assessed on P14. PH was determined by measuring right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and the weight ratio of the right to left ventricle + septum (RV/LV + S). Capillary tube formation in SDF-1 treated hyperoxia-exposed human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) was determined by matrigel assay. Data is expressed as mean +/- SD and analyzed by two-way ANOVA., RESULTS: Exposure of neonatal pups to 14 days of hyperoxia decreased lung SDF-1 gene expression. Moreover, whilst hyperoxia exposure inhibited capillary tube formation in HPMEC, SDF-1 treatment increased tube length and branching in HPMEC. PL-treated hyperoxia-exposed pups had decreased alveolarization and lung vascular density. This was accompanied by an increase in RVSP, RV/LV + S, pulmonary vascular remodeling and inflammation. In contrast, IT JVS-100 improved lung structure, reduced inflammation, PH and vascular remodeling., CONCLUSIONS: Intratracheal administration of a naked plasmid expressing SDF-1 improves alveolar and vascular structure in an experimental model of BPD. These findings suggest that therapies which modulate lung SDF-1 expression may have beneficial effects in preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - Surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is not new, the first trials having been performed over 30 years ago. These early trials used synthetic protein-free surfactants administered as aerosols and were unsuccessful. Since 1980 a variety of natural and synthetic surfactant preparations have been used to treat or prevent RDS, and both demonstrate clinical effects. I have used evidence derived from 3 areas to demonstrate the superiority of natural surfactants: in vitro physical properties, in vivo physiological effects and the results of comparative clinical trials. using the pulsating bubble surfactometer, the surface tension at maximum and minimum bubble size are significantly lower for natural compared to synthetic surfactants (31 and 0 mN/m versus 53 and 29 mN/m respectively). Physiological effects of surfactants have been compared in immature rabbits and lambs and both models demonstrate the superiority of natural surfactants. For example in immature rabbits lung compliance values after 60 minutes of ventilation are 0.60 ml/cmH2O in natural surfactant treated animals, 0.44 ml/cmH2O in synthetic surfactant treated animals and 0.34 ml/cmH2O in controls (p < 0.01). The technique of meta-analysis was used to analyse the outcome of 6 comparative clinical trials of natural and synthetic surfactants. These 6 studies included 3536 babies and 5 of them compared Survanta (a bovine natural surfactant) and Exosurf (a synthetic protein-free surfactant). One study compared Infasurf (another bovine natural surfactant with Exosurf). Meta-analysis shows a 19% reduction in the odds of neonatal death for natural compared to synthetic surfactant treated babies (OR, 0.81; 95% CI 0.66-0.98). For bronchopulmonary dysplasia there was a non-significant reduction in risk for Survanta-treated babies (OR, 0.93; 95% CO 0.78-1.10). In summary, there is now clear evidence of physiological and clinical superiority of natural compared to synthetic surfactants. Surfactant proteins B and C are needed to facilitate rapid adsorption and spreading of phospholipids. They also account for the more rapid clinical action allowing oxygen and ventilator pressures to be lowered soon after administration. The odds of neonatal mortality are reduced by about 20% if natural surfactants are preferred to their synthetic protein-free counterparts. Long-term follow-up studies of babies treated with both types of surfactant should be a top priority.

AB  - Vitamin A is widely used in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) to prevent and reduce lung injury in premature infants who require mechanical ventilation. As part of a project to assess the management in NICU, this study was designed to establish whether vitamin A supplementation in neonates at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) increased and maintained their plasma levels to at least 20 micrograms/dl. Twenty-five preterm babies, 24-34 weeks gestation, 600-1,770 g birth weight, received 1,000 IU/day of vitamin A intravenously for the first 28 days of life. At birth the majority had plasma vitamin A lower than 20 micrograms/dl which rapidly rose during supplementation. Even though expected therapeutic plasma concentrations were reached in the majority of infants without exceeding the toxic level, no association was found between vitamin A plasma concentrations and maternal or newborns characteristics at delivery and clinical status or outcome of infants. Thus, even if dosage schedule may be furtherly optimized to reach and maintain wanted therapeutic ranges, the efficacy of routine therapeutic vitamin A supplementation has to be adequately proved.

AB  - Noninvasive mechanical ventilatory techniques include the use of negative and positive pressure ventilators. Negative pressure ventilators, such as the "iron lung", support ventilation by exposing the surface of the chest wall to subatmospheric pressure during inspiration; whereas, expiration occurs when the pressure around the chest wall increases and becomes atmospheric or greater than atmospheric. In this review, after a description of the more advanced models of tank ventilators and the physiological effects of negative pressure ventilation (NPV), we summarize the recent application of this old technique in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (ARF). Several uncontrolled studies suggest that NPV may have a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of acute on chronic respiratory failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and restrictive thoracic disorders, reducing the need for endotracheal intubation. In the paediatric field, after substantial technical improvement, NPV has been successfully reintroduced for the treatment of ARF due to neonatal distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and for the weaning from positive pressure ventilation in intubated patients. The positive results of these reports need to be formally confirmed by further prospective and controlled studies before recommending the generalized use of negative pressure ventilation in acute respiratory failure as a standard of care.

AB  - Since the late 1950s it has been known that the cause of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is surfactant deficiency, especially in preterm infants. But surfactant protein B deficiency may cause RDS in term infants as well. Administration of natural surfactant produce is well known to a rapid improvement in oxygenation within 15 to 20 minutes. The effect of synthetic surfactant is less dramatic. Although randomized controlled trials have been done, the majority have been relatively small. Studies on the role of natural surfactant given to infants with established RDS (rescue therapy) have shown a reduction in the incidence of neonatal death and pneumothorax of 40% and 65%, respectively, compared to untreated infants. However, natural surfactant provides no apparent benefits in terms of the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The results of synthetic surfactant given as rescue therapy have shown a similar effect with a 40% reduction in mortality and a 48% reduction in pneumothorax. However, synthetic surfactant also led to a 23% reduction in IVH, 27% in PDA, and 32% in BPD. When natural surfactant is given as prophylaxis (i.e. at or soon after birth, before the development of RDS), the reduction in mortality is 45% and the reduction in pneumothorax is 69%, but as with rescue therapy, there is no effect on the incidence of IVH or BPD. The effect on the incidence of PDA is an increase of 27%. When synthetic surfactants are given prophylactically, there is a similar reduction in mortality of 44% and a reduction in pneumothorax of 36%. The incidence of IVH and BPD is unchanged, but as with the natural surfactant, there is a small increase in the incidence of PDA of 27%. The main side effect is pulmonary hemorrhage that has been reported to occur in 4-7% of infants given surfactant. Although the administration of surfactant has had a dramatic effect on neonatal practice, it is likely that further studies will lead to more appropriate use of surfactant.

AB  - The use of exogenous surfactant (ES) is an essential component for prevention and treatment of hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The ES available for clinical use are of two therapeutic classes: natural surfactants prepared from mammalian lung and artificial surfactants. The choice between these two classes of ES is controversial. In this overview, we present the arguments in favour of the preferential use of natural ES. The presence of hydrophobic specific proteins (SP-B and SP-C) provides to natural ES better surface tension properties than artificial ES. The in vitro greater efficacy of natural ES has been confirmed in vivo in experimental models of surfactant deficiency, human pharmacodynamic studies, and comparative clinical trials. Furthermore, the excellent clinical tolerance and harmlessness of natural ES has been firmly established. A meta-analysis of the comparative clinical trials between natural ES and one artificial ES (enrolling as many as 4400 babies treated for HMD) suggests that the use of natural ES compared to this artificial ES significantly reduces the neonatal mortality by 20%. In conclusion, all these arguments are in favor of the preferential use of natural ES for prevention and treatment of HMD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) reduces transfusion requirements in premature neonates at risk of having bronchopulmonary dysplasia and requiring multiple transfusions., STUDY DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial., SUBJECTS: Fifty-five infants appropriate in weight for gestational age (less than 1250 gm birth weight) who, at 10 days of age, were predicted to have a greater than 75% probability of having bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This criterion had previously been shown to identify infants requiring multiple transfusions. Twenty-seven infants were randomly assigned to receive r-HuEPO therapy and 28 to a control group. r-HuEPO was administered in a dosage of 20 U/kg body weight, subcutaneously, three times a week for 6 weeks. Control infants received sham treatment., RESULTS: Infants treated with r-HuEPO required significantly fewer transfusions than control infants during their entire hospital stay (mean 3.48 +/- 1.58 vs 5.68 +/- 2.30; p = 0.0001) and had a higher mean reticulocyte count (p < or = 0.0005) and a higher mean hemoglobin concentration (p < or = 0.005) during the treatment period. At follow-up, 4 months after term, there were no significant differences between the groups in mean reticulocyte count (p = 0.86) or mean hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.56). However, two infants in each group had low serum ferritin values indicative of depleted iron stores., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with r-HuEPO effectively stimulated erythropoiesis in premature infants at high risk of having bronchopulmonary dysplasia and requiring multiple transfusions; the result was a reduction in transfusion requirements. This treatment, together with other strategies to reduce the need for transfusions, is appropriate in this population. Unrelated to r-HuEPO treatment, these infants may be at risk of having iron deficiency later in infancy.

AB  - Increased activities of inflammatory mediators unopposed by their inhibitors contribute to chronic lung injury and impaired healing in BPD. The deleterious effects of IL-1 beta, a cytokine involved in inflammation and host defense, are blocked by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). We proposed that an imbalance of IL-1 beta and its inhibitors may contribute to the development of BPD. To determine the relative antigen concentrations of IL-1 beta and IL-1Ra and functional IL-1 activity in lung lavage of infants at risk for BPD, lung lavage was serially obtained from 1 to 28 days from 17 infants with evolving BPD, 13 infants with self-limited RDS, and 6 controls ventilated for nonpulmonary reasons. Overall, there was a high correlation between IL-1 beta antigen concentration and IL-1 activity (r = 0.82, p = 0.0001). There were no significant differences among the groups for lung lavage variables on day 1. However, in infants who developed BPD, IL-1 beta antigen concentration and IL-1 activity increased 16- and 61-fold, respectively, during the first week. IL-1Ra remained relatively unchanged during the first month. IL-1 beta/IL-1Ra antigen ratio was significantly higher on days 5 (median 0.024) and 7 (median 0.025) compared with day 1 (median 0.004), p < 0.05. These results suggest that a relative imbalance of IL-1 beta and IL-1Ra may contribute to prolonged inflammation in BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is defined as prolonged respiratory failure resulting from sequellae after neonatal intensive care in premature infants. Functional impairment continues into adult life. There are two main causal factors: the initial respiratory disease and pulmonary immaturity. Up through the nineties, bronchopulmonary dysplasia was a major problem in neonatal intensive care units; mortality reached 20% of infants requiring artificial ventilation for 1 or 2 months. Despite the rising rate of premature births (currently 2%) considerable progress has been made in the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The question is whether the infants in the current generation with still suffer into adult life. Advances in preventive therapy have included antenatal corticosteroid therapy, use of exogenous surfactants and progressive improvement in ventilatory assistance techniques. Improved neonatal care to relieve pain and maintain nutrition have also had an important effect. Specific treatments include the use of salbutamol spray to reduce bronchospasme and improve respiratory compliance. The initial hopes placed in inhaled corticosteroids were unfortunately recently shown to be unfounded. Due to the large number of premature infants it appears difficult to predict the future situation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but current data show a clear tendancy towards regression of the disease. Three preventive measures could further reduce the incidence: better coordination between obstetricians and pediatricians, extension of antenatal corticosteroid therapy and the development and improvement of continuous positive pressure ventilation.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many pulmonary diseases including adult respiratory distress syndrome, emphysema, asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. The morbidity and mortality of these diseases remain high even with optimal medical management. In our attempts to devise new therapies for these disorders, it is crucial to improve our understanding of the basic mechanism(s) of oxidant-induced lung injury. A major line of investigation seeks to characterize the cellular and molecular responses of the lung to oxidant insults. Much progress has been made in our understanding of the role of the "classic" antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) in mediating the lung's resistance against oxidant lung injury. However, it is becoming clear that other oxidant-induced gene products may also play vital roles in the lung's adaptive and/or protective response to oxidative stress. One such stress-response protein is heme oxygenase-1, HO-1. Since the identification of HO-1 in 1968, many of the studies involving this enzyme were understandably focused on the regulation and function of HO-1 in heme metabolism. This emphasis is self-evident as HO-1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in heme degradation. Interestingly, however, evidence accumulated over the past 25 years demonstrates that HO-1 is induced not only by the substrate heme but also by a variety of non-heme inducers such as heavy metals, endotoxin, heat shock, inflammatory cytokines, and prostaglandins. The chemical diversity of HO-1 inducers led to the speculation that HO-1, besides its role in heme degradation, may also play a vital function in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Further support for this hypothesis was provided by Tyrrell and colleagues who showed in 1989 that HO-1 is also highly induced by a variety of agents causing oxidative stress. Subsequently, many investigators have focused their attention on the function and regulation of HO-1 in various in vitro and in vivo models of oxidant-mediated cellular and tissue injury. The magnitude of HO-1 induction after oxidative stress and the wide distribution of this enzyme in systemic tissues coupled with the intriguing biological activities of the catalytic byproducts, carbon monoxide, iron, and bilirubin, makes HO-1 a highly attractive and interesting candidate stress-response protein which may play key role(s) in mediating protection against oxidant-mediated lung injury. This review will focus on the current understanding of the physiological significance of HO-1 induction and the molecular regulation of HO-1 gene expression in response to oxidative stress. We hope that this discussion will stimulate interest and investigations into a field which is still largely uncharted in the pulmonary research community.

AB  - From the fragmentary studies performed to date of both functional obstruction and the ontogeny of intestinal motility, several conclusions can be drawn. The development of motor activity that is primarily dependent on neuronal activity, such as sucking, swallow-induced peristalsis of the esophagus, and cyclic fasting small intestinal motor activity, occurs according to a timetable that is similar in all species studies is gestationally dependent, but its timing during gestation is species specific. Postprandial events, including gastric emptying and continuous postprandial motor activity in the small intestine, in contrast seem to be dependent on the nature of the humoral response to food, provided that the musculature of the gut and enteric nerves are able to respond to it. Although these activities are primarily determined by neuronal development, there is a limited amount of information to suggest that their appearance may be pharmacologically manipulated to advance the timing and rate of development. It is commonplace now for cortisol to be used to induce the production of surfactant in mothers of babies who are at risk of hyaline membrane disease. A limited amount of information suggests that cortisol may have similar effects in inducing duodenal motor activity, and, thus, it may be possible to advance the timing and rate of development of intestinal motility in the very preterm infant by its use. There are, however, no studies to date to prove this. It is now clear that intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a heterogeneous disorder associated with various pathologies, some of which are intrinsic to the gut, whereas others are multisystem diseases affecting the intestine. In addition, although intestinal pseudo-obstruction was originally thought to involve the small intestine, it is now realized that it may not affect only one region, as in achalasia or Hirschsprung's disease, but also it may present diffusely throughout the gut. The motility changes caused by the disease processes are nonspecific, although neuropathic and myopathic changes are distinct and due to the destruction of the particular motor control system involved. The mechanisms of the ontogenic and disease changes described in this article are, however, almost totally unexplored. The recent upsurge of interest in the area with the development of advances in cellular and molecular biology, at least the early events, is now beginning to unravel. At the present time, the stage is being set for probably the most exciting phase of understanding of the nature of the ontogeny of intestinal motor activity, which the author expects will enable us to manipulate motor activity in normal preterm infants and, it is hoped, congenital dysmotile states.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of extremely preterm (EP) infants have survived worldwide. However, few data have been reported from China. This study was designed to investigate the short-term outcomes of EP infants at discharge in Guangdong province., METHODS: A total of 2051 EP infants discharged from 26 neonatal intensive care units during 2008-2017 were enrolled. The data from 2008 to 2012 were collected retrospectively, and from 2013 to 2017 were collected prospectively. Their hospitalization records were reviewed., RESULTS: During 2008-2017, the mean gestational age (GA) was 26.68 +/- 1.00 weeks and the mean birth weight (BW) was 935 +/- 179 g. The overall survival rate at discharge was 52.5%. There were 321 infants (15.7%) died despite active treatment, and 654 infants (31.9%) died after medical care withdrawal. The survival rates increased with advancing GA and BW (p < 0.001). The annual survival rate improved from 36.2% in 2008 to 59.3% in 2017 (p < 0.001). EP infants discharged from hospitals in Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities had a higher survival rate than in others (p < 0.001). The survival rate of EP infants discharged from general hospitals was lower than in specialist hospitals (p < 0.001). The major complications were neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, 88.0% (1804 of 2051), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 32.3% (374 of 1158), retinopathy of prematurity (any grade), 45.1% (504 of 1117), necrotizing enterocolitis (any stage), 10.1% (160 of 1588), intraventricular hemorrhages (any grade), 37.4% (535 of 1431), and blood culture-positive nosocomial sepsis, 15.7% (250 of 1588). The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that improved survival of EP infants was associated with discharged from specialist hospitals, hospitals located in high-level economic development region, increasing gestational age, increasing birth weight, antenatal steroids use and a history of premature rupture of membranes. However, twins or multiple births, Apgar <=7 at 5 min, cervical incompetence, and decision to withdraw care were associated with decreased survival., CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the short-term outcomes of EP infants at discharge in China. The overall survival rate was lower than the developed countries, and medical care withdrawal was a serious problem. Nonetheless, improvements in care and outcomes have been made annually.

AB  - OBJECTIVE : Oxygen free radicals are extremely reactive species and they can lead to injury and cell death. The aim of this review is to study the main biochemical aspects of free radical formation and their role as an intermediate mechanism of injury in several neonatal diseases. METHODS: A brief history of oxygen therapy in neonatology and its relationship with complications associated with the production of free radicals. Definition, mechanism of action and antioxidant systems were described. Next, the neonatal factors of increased risk of free radical oxidative injury and the diseases associated with oxygen free radical toxicity were reviewed. RESULTS: Oxygen free radicals are reactive species that although crucial to normal biological processes, can lead to injury and cell death. They are implicated in the pathogenesis of many neonatal diseases such as perinatal asphyxia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension and persistence of ductus arteriosus. Birth is associated with transition to a hyperoxic environment in comparison with uterine environment, which leads to increased generation free radicals. The newborn has undeveloped antioxidant systems and, therefore, may be at increased risk of free radical oxidative injury. CONCLUSIONS: The understanding of neonatal factors involved in the pathogenesis of "oxygen free radical diseases" will lead to the development of new therapies for prevention and treatment of these neonatal diseases.

AB  - We describe the first case of a baby with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 2. Growth failure, hypothyroidism, and hyaline membrane disease were present at birth, and the first year of life was complicated by bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At age 14 months, motor and intellectual development were normal, but growth remained below the 10th centile. The baby was investigated for uniparental disomy because trisomy 2 mosaicism had been detected in a second trimester amniocentesis. This is the first reported case in which amniotic fluid chromosome mosaicism has been associated with uniparental disomy. Implications for prenatal diagnosis are considered.

AB  - The recent National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on ANS was strongly supportive of the use of ANS, even for 24 hours but, if possible, for 48 hours, in all fetuses between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation and at risk of preterm delivery regardless of race, gender, or the availability of surfactant replacement. For preterm rupture of membranes at less than 30 to 32 weeks, the use of ANS was also recommended in the absence of amnionitis, and patients eligible for tocolytic therapy were also deemed eligible for ANS. Thus the currently available literature indicates that pediatricians should encourage obstetricians to provide ANS in high-risk pregnancies, as outlined in the proposed National Institutes of Health guidelines. Even if a full 48-hour course of ANS cannot be achieved, ANS given less than 24 hours before delivery is associated with a decreased incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. In addition, we propose that investigators, reviewers, and editors ensure uniformly high maternal ANS exposure, consistent with the realities of clinical practice, when designing, evaluating, and publishing clinical trials with outcomes (e.g., RDS, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and death) that can be significantly affected by ANS. Otherwise, studies will continue to be performed on infants who, as fetuses, were deprived of treatment that may have prevented or ameliorated the disorder being assessed. Studies with an infrequent use of ANS may not be applicable or generalizable to an era when the use of ANS is an essential part of perinatal practice. Future trials should document both ANS use and the reasons for failure to achieve an acceptable level of such treatment.

AB  - There is good rationale for presuming a role for vitamin A in lung development. In situ studies have demonstrated that certain retinoic acid (RA) receptor proteins are localized in a specific fashion during fetal lung branching and airway growth. Vitamin A stores are high in fetal lung and decrease toward term, possibly being utilized for changes in lung morphogenic remodeling. The binding activity, levels and expression of the cytosolic and nuclear receptor proteins for vitamin A undergo changes before and after birth in rat lung. RA slows fetal Type II cell proliferation in culture but stimulates choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. RA can regulate several other factors involved in lung development such as homeobox genes, matrix molecules and certain growth factors. Further study is needed on this potential functional role of RA in lung. Retinol deficiency results in lung histopathology that is similar to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which occurs frequently in human premature neonates. Clinical trials are attempting to define the role of supplementation of vitamin A in the prevention and treatment of that condition.

AB  - Past studies concerning postoperative apnoea in infants were identified and reviewed. A total of only 200 former preterm infants having minor surgery under general anaesthesia have been prospectively studied. The incidence of apnoea after general anaesthesia is approximately 30%, and is inversely related to postconceptual age. A large number of term infants have been studied, and the incidence of postoperative apnoea is very low. The initial apnoea is always within 12 hours of surgery, though only one study has collected data beyond this length of time. Past history of apnoea episodes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, anaemia or neurological disease may be associated with an increased risk, though current evidence is not strong. No patient characteristic apart from postconceptual age has enough sensitivity and specificity to identify a high-risk group. The use of spinal anaesthesia or methylxanthines may reduce the incidence of postoperative apnoea, but again the evidence is not strong. Recommendations concerning the timing of elective surgery and the use of postoperative respiratory monitoring in the former preterm infant can only be made cautiously in view of the paucity of data on which to base them.

AB  - Preterm infants were randomly assigned to receive routine vitamin A supplementation (Regular A) or additional vitamin A in intravenous lipids (High A). Because infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have poorer vitamin A status than infants who do not develop BPD, High A and Regular A infants were divided by BPD (no or yes) before determining the effects of treatment on intake and plasma concentration of retinol in the first month. Compared with infants without BPD, those with BPD received less retinol (RE.kg-1.d-1) if assigned to Regular A and more if assigned to High A (BPD by vitamin A interaction, P < 0.002). High A-BPD infants compared with Regular A-BPD infants had significantly higher plasma retinol concentrations in the first month. Retinyl palmitate appears to be an effective adjunct to routine vitamin A administration. Infants most likely to benefit from receiving vitamin A in intravenous lipids are those advanced more slowly to full enteral feeding.

AB  - To avoid red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was given to an infant born at a gestation of 26 weeks and a birthweight of 830 g to parents who were Jehovah's Witnesses. The infant had hyaline membrane disease and required 52 days of assisted ventilation and 19 days of oxygen therapy. He received theophylline therapy for 61 days for recurrent apnoea and bradycardia. He developed bilateral intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and left-sided periventricular leucomalacia (PVL). Intravenous rHuEPO was started on day 1 at 200 U/kg per day for 1 month followed by subcutaneous rHuEPO 400 U/kg three times a week for 6 more weeks, supplemented with Vitamin E, folic acid and iron. Blood sampling was kept to a minimum and non-invasive blood-gas monitoring was used consistently. Consequently, the estimated cumulative volume of blood loss from sampling was only 21 mL during his hospital stay. His haemoglobin (Hb) was 150 g/L at birth and this fell to below 100 g/L from day 25 onwards. His lowest leucocyte count was 3.6 x 10(9)/L. He was discharged on day 83 with a Hb of 95 g/L, Hct of 29%, reticulocyte count of 2.8% and weight of 2400 g. At a postnatal age of 3 months, he had a Hb of 113 g/L. At 6 months, investigations showed: Hb 121 g/L, haematocrit 33%, reticulocyte 1% and a weight of 4.4 kg. He was readmitted to hospital once for an episode of vomiting and follow up to date showed developmental delay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - A case of calcification of the umbilical vein in a premature infant with nephrocalcinosis and cholelithiasis is described. Such an association might have resulted from prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, umbilical vein catheterization, total parenteral nutrition, and furosemide therapy. Follow-up ultrasound examination at 9 months of age revealed spontaneous resolution of calcification of both the gallbladder and the umbilical vein but not of the kidneys.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the individual and collective contribution of biological and socioenvironmental factors associated with language function at 2, 5, 7, and 13 years in children born preterm (<30 weeks' gestation or <1250 g birth weight)., METHODS: Language function was assessed as part of a prospective longitudinal study of 224 children born preterm at 2, 5, 7, and 13 years using age-appropriate tools. Language Z-scores were generated based on a contemporaneous term-born control group. A selection of biological factors (sex, small for gestational age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infection, and qualitatively defined brain injury) and early socioenvironmental factors at age 2 years (primary income earner employment status and type, primary caregiver education level, English as a second language, parental mental health history, parent sensitivity and facilitation, and parent-child synchrony) was chosen a priori. Associations were assessed using univariable and multivariable linear regression models applied to outcomes at each time point., RESULTS: Higher primary caregiver education level, greater parent-child synchrony, and parent sensitivity were independently associated with better language function across childhood. Socioenvironmental factors together explained an increasing percentage of the variance (9%-18%) in language function from 2 to 13 years of age. In comparison, there was little evidence for associations between biological factors and language function, even during early childhood years., CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of socioenvironmental factors over biological factors for language development throughout childhood. Some of these socioenvironmental factors are potentially modifiable, and parent-based interventions addressing parenting practices and education may benefit preterm children's language development.

AB  - Porcine-derived lung surfactant (PLS; Curosurf) has shown efficacy in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. PLS consists of phospholipids, mainly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, the primary surface-active agent of natural lung surfactant, and pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins which facilitate spreading and adsorption of the surface-active agent at the air-alveolar interface. Intratracheal administration of a single dose of PLS 200 mg/kg significantly improves the survival rate and reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days in premature infants (birthweight 700 to 2000g) with severe respiratory distress syndrome (fraction of inspired oxygen > or = 0.60). PLS also reduces the incidence of air leak events such as pulmonary interstitial emphysema and pneumothorax. The response rate may be further improved by administration of additional 100 mg/kg doses at 12-hour intervals to infants showing a poor response or relapse after a single dose. PLS prophylaxis reduces the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants at high risk of developing the disease; however, it remains unclear whether the eventual clinical outcome is similar or superior to that observed in infants who receive rescue treatment. PLS is well tolerated and does not appear to increase the incidence of complications of prematurity or respiratory distress syndrome, including patent ductus arteriosus and intraventricular haemorrhage. Although its effect on long term development require further investigation, early indications are that PLS is not associated with any long term adverse sequelae. Comparative trials are clearly warranted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of PLS relative to that of other available surfactant preparations, particularly to explore preliminary indications that a more rapid effect of natural surfactants such as PLS (compared with synthetic products) may correlate with improved clinical outcomes, and that PLS may result in fewer complications than synthetic preparations. Thus, available data show PLS to be a very effective agent for the treatment and prophylaxis of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and that it may have some advantages over synthetic preparations.

AB  - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia, a highly lethal condition, displays at term the pulmonary biochemical and morphologic immaturity characteristic of premature delivery. We hypothesized that antenatal glucocorticoid, now the standard treatment to prevent hyaline membrane disease in premature human beings, might correct the parameters of the pulmonary biochemical and morphologic immaturity in severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia. A total of 112 fetal rats with or without nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernias from 34 pregnancies were treated antenatally with either saline or dexamethasone. Antenatal dexamethasone increased the lung disaturated phosphatidylcholine content, reduced the lung glycogen concentration, reduced the saccular septal thickness, and increased the mean saccular size and volume fraction of saccules in the lungs of rats with large congenital diaphragmatic hernia in comparison with similar rats not so treated. All differences were statistically significant. Antenatal glucocorticoid therapy was efficacious in treating rats with nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia. This encouraging finding warrants further investigation in a large animal model with surgically created congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

AB  - The role of CT in the diagnosis of pediatric lung disease is still evolving, but certain indications are already well established. In immunocompromised or other high-risk children who have fevers or respiratory symptoms but normal or nonspecific chest radiographs, HRCT can detect and localize disease, thus allowing earlier therapy. It also has been shown that HRCT can assess the severity of disease in bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis and that it may provide a more sensitive means of evaluating therapy in these conditions. Areas for research include the effects of infection on the developing lung, quantification of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the prevalence of complications in asthma, and the use of HRCT in pulmonary edema of all types. As CT scan times decrease, the use of CT will expand to younger, sicker, and less cooperative children. Dynamic scanning probably will develop to provide a more accurate assessment of the focal and generalized air trapping that accompanies many common pediatric diseases.

AB  - 1. Vitamin A: There are very few reports on vitamin A deficiency in Japan because of the rising national status of nutrition, while vitamin A deficiency is still an important nutritional problem in developing and poorly developed countries. In the pediatric field, relationship between vitamin A nutrition and the mechanism for development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have been discussed, since vitamin A acts as a protector from the keratinization of epithelial cells in the mucosal layer and the skin. The changes in the lung tissues with inadequately supplied vitamin A, probably cause the chronic lung disease resulting from mechanical ventilation in neonates, in whom the plasma vitamin A and retinol binding protein levels are usually low. 2. Vitamin E: In keeping with the view that newborn infants and especially premature infants suffer from vitamin E deficiency. On the basis of recent findings of the vitamin E content in the neonatal cells, the previous concept would agree, as an existing marginal deficiency in neonates. The neurologic deficits manifested in a beta-lipoproteinemia is confirmed to be vitamin deficiency in humans. It has also become clear that similar neurologic impairment occurs in other chronic fat malabsorptive states, such as cholestatic liver diseases, extensive resection of the gut. More recently several patients with spinocerebellar degeneration from vitamin E deficiency without other evidence of malabsorption in whom progression of the diseases is terminated by the vitamin E therapy (isolated vitamin E deficiency) have been reported. The above items are discussed.

AB  - Ureaplasma urealyticum, a species of mycoplasma organisms, is a sexually transmitted organism which can cause a pneumonia in premature neonates. Ureaplasma urealyticum infection in the neonate occurs secondary to maternal transmission of the organism to the neonate. Recent studies show very low birth weight neonates with Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia are approximately two times more likely to develop chronic lung disease. Clinically Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia presents in a premature neonate and is often coexistent with hyaline membrane disease, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and continued respiratory distress without identification of a causative organism. Diagnosis is generally by tracheal aspirate or spinal fluid culture. Ureaplasma urealyticum requires specific culture media to grow, and recovery of the organism can take several weeks. Clinical management of the infant includes administration of erythromycin and meticulous pulmonary toilet. A case study which represents the typical presentation of Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia is included.

AB  - Surfactant administration for respiratory distress syndrome continues to make an impact on neonatal care as large controlled trials are published. Although considered safe, synthetic surfactant administration has been associated with a rare complication in the form of pulmonary hemorrhage. Despite this, significant benefits have been shown. With the approval by the FDA of two surfactant preparations, this treatment is now in widespread use. Although the mortality rate from respiratory distress syndrome and the number of ventilator days are generally decreased, surfactant effect on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has been disappointing. Studies of steroid administration for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and steroid side effects have been published in the past year. Steroid use has become widespread for this condition, although many details of its administration and side effects have yet to be worked out. A new area of promise is the use of erythropoietin for anemia of prematurity. Natural historic data on the retinopathy of prematurity have added to our understanding of this condition and have raised new questions on its pathogenesis. Review articles and studies in the area of neonatal encephalopathy stress the need for a more accurate definition of asphyxia and discuss possible prenatal causes of this condition. An extensive review of neonatal jaundice and new recommendations for its treatment in healthy term newborns has been published but remains controversial.

AB  - Preliminary report of our experience with the therapeutic use of pulmonary surfactant in newborn infants of less than 30 weeks gestation with hyaline membrane disease. The use of pulmonary surfactant was held under the "rescue" modality, with up to 36 hours of postnatal life. The blood gas changes are described and the assisted ventilation progress, as well as the general response on the clinical condition of each case. Discussion in centered in the risk of use and in the criteria for prescribing the therapeutic pulmonary surfactant. It is concluded that meeting the recommended requirements for its use, the pulmonary surfactant is a therapeutic alternative in the treatment of hyaline membrane disease in newborn infants of less than 33 weeks gestation, being different the immediate ventilatory response in terms of therapeutic control, with one or other forms of pulmonary exogenous surfactant, without differences in the final result.

AB  - A recent multicenter study of preterm infants concluded that high-frequency ventilation (HFV) applied at 15 Hz, in comparison with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), did not lead to reduced incidence of barotrauma, contrary to previous expectations. The primary goal of the present theoretical study was to determine whether computed estimates of lung pressures during HFV and CMV are consistent with these findings. An existing theoretical model of lung mechanics and gas transport in HFV was modified for applicability to neonates. New features, such as expiratory flow limitation and pulmonary air leak, were also incorporated. Simulations with the model were conducted assuming combinations of frequency and tidal volume that maintained a constant level of eucapnia. We found that peak alveolar pressures and the magnitude of alveolar pressure swings resulting from HFV at 15 Hz were in general comparable to those produced by CMV in healthy neonates and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia; peak alveolar pressures in the latter group tended to be higher with HFV than in CMV. Application of HFV at 15 Hz was even less advantageous than CMV when pulmonary air leak was also present in the infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, the model predicted the existence of an optimal range of frequencies between 2 and 4 Hz in which alveolar pressure swings and peak alveolar pressures could be minimized, and in some cases, reduced below the levels produced by CMV.

AB  - Because anemia in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentrations of erythropoietin but increased in vitro sensitivity of erythroid progenitors to erythropoietin, we speculated that administration of human recombinant erythropoietin would correct this anemia. Fifteen infants with the anemia of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were randomly assigned to receive erythropoietin or placebo subcutaneously for 10 days. Changes in reticulocyte count, hematocrit, blood lactate concentration, neutrophil count, platelet count, heart rate, oxygen requirement, weight gain, and number of transfusions were assessed. In the 10 erythropoietin recipients (99 +/- 12 days of age), hematocrit values increased from 0.325 +/- 0.006 to 0.381 +/- 0.013 (mean +/- SEM; p < 0.005) and reticulocyte counts from 122 +/- 20 to 446 +/- 48 x 10(3)/microliters (p < 0.005); lactate values remained unchanged. In the five placebo recipients (91 +/- 12 days of age), hematocrits and reticulocyte counts remained unchanged, and lactate values increased from 0.73 +/- 0.14 to 1.34 +/- 0.25 mumol/gm (p < 0.05). During the 30 days after the treatment period, one erythropoietin recipient and four placebo recipients were given transfusions. Other measured variables remained unchanged in both groups. We conclude that erythropoietin is effective in treatment of the anemia of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with airway hyperreactivity is a long-term pulmonary complication of prematurity. The endogenous nonadrenergic, noncholinergic signaling molecule, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and its catabolism by GSNO reductase (GSNOR) modulate airway reactivity. Tracheomalacia is a major, underinvestigated complication of BPD. We studied trachealis, left main bronchus (LB), and intrapulmonary bronchiolar (IPB) relaxant responses to GSNO in a murine hyperoxic BPD model., METHODS: Wild-type (WT) or GSNOR knockout (KO) newborn mice were raised in 60% (BPD) or 21% (control) oxygen during the first 3 weeks of life. After room air recovery, adult trachealis, LB, and IPB smooth muscle relaxant responses to GSNO (after methacholine preconstriction) were studied using wire myographs. Studies were repeated after GSNOR inhibitor (GSNORi) pretreatment and in KO mice., RESULTS: GSNO relaxed all airway preparations. GSNO relaxed WT BPD trachealis substantially more than WT controls (P < .05). Pharmacologic or genetic ablation of GSNOR abolished the exaggerated BPD tracheal relaxation to GSNO and also augmented BPD IPB relaxation to GSNO. LB ring contractility was not significantly different between groups or conditions. Additionally, GSNORi treatment induced relaxation of WT IPBs but not trachealis or LB., CONCLUSION: GSNO dramatically relaxed the trachealis in our BPD model, an effect paradoxically reversed by loss of GSNOR. Conversely, GSNOR inhibition augmented IBP relaxation. These data suggest that GSNOR inhibition could benefit both the BPD trachealis and distal airways, restoring relaxant responses to those of room air controls. Because therapeutic options are limited in this high-risk population, future studies of GSNOR inhibition are needed. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the ventilatory response to inspired carbon dioxide in infants considered to be at risk for sudden infant death syndrome or apnea., DESIGN: Clinical data measurement., SETTING: Infant apnea evaluation program of a university division of neonatology., PATIENTS: Fifty nine infants were full term characterized by the following diagnoses; siblings of infants who had died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (n = 7), apparent life threatening event (ALTE) (n = 24), apnea/cyanosis in the newborn nursery (n = 21), and controls. Sixty-nine infants were preterm and consisted of patients suffering from idiopathic apnea (n = 61), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 8)., MEASUREMENTS: The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was measured with a computerized waveform analyzer., MAIN RESULTS: Among full term infants no significant differences in the ventilatory slope in response to CO2 was seen. The range of mean slope was 19.4 +/- 7.6 in siblings of SIDS and 36 +/- 17 in control infants. Greater number of sibling of SIDS had slopes less than 20 ml/kg/min/mmHg in comparison to control infants. Sibling of SIDS had less increase in minute ventilation and inspiratory flow in response to CO2 administration in comparison to control infants. Preterm infants had similar slopes with a mean of 33 ml/kg/min/mmHg in infants with idiopathic apnea and 28 ml/kg/min/mmHg in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSIONS: The large intragroup variability in the ventilatory response to inspired CO2, confirming previously reported data, comprises the benefit of this test. Thus, ventilatory response to CO2 administration is not useful in unselected patients at risk of SIDS or apnea.

AB  - The pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical features, sequelae, and treatment of bronchiolitis are reviewed. Acute bronchiolitis is the most common severe lower-respiratory-tract infection of infancy. During epidemics, more than 80% of cases may be caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Although signs and symptoms may become severe, most infections are self-limited and improvement occurs within several days. Approximately 1-2% of infants less than one year of age require hospitalization. Generally, patients who develop severe, life-threatening RSV bronchiolitis are those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, immunosuppression, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or a history of premature birth. In severe bronchiolitis, necrosis of the respiratory epithelium, excessive mucus production, and lymphocytic infiltration result in edema, dense plugs of debris, and subsequent bronchiolar obstruction. IgE-mediated reactions and release of inflammatory mediators may result in exacerbation of acute obstruction and may contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary dysfunction, a common sequela of bronchiolitis. Patients hospitalized with bronchiolitis usually require supportive therapy and may require mechanical ventilation. Based on recent data, a trial of aerosolized beta 2 agonists is warranted in all patients. Systemic corticosteroids have not proved efficacious and have a limited role in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. Inhaled corticosteroids may be useful in reducing the severity of chronic wheezing that may follow acute bronchiolitis. Ribavirin may be considered in patients with severe illness or in those at high risk for severe RSV disease. Intravenous immune globulin may have a role in the treatment of lower-respiratory-tract infections involving RSV; however, since few studies have been performed in humans, it is not possible to determine its place in the treatment of bronchiolitis. A trial of aerosolized beta 2 agonists is warranted in patients with bronchiolitis. Ribavirin may be considered in patients with severe disease or those at high risk for severe disease.

AB  - In understanding the various electrolyte disorders associated with respiratory failure, one has to appreciate how the otherwise healthy premature infant maintains extracellular fluid homeostasis. The same physiologic processes that regulate body fluids are affected to varying degrees in the infant with respiratory failure. Maintenance of sodium conservation by the kidney is of critical importance for survival and growth. The immature kidney tends to exhibit excessive sodium wasting especially early on, but appropriate positive sodium balance is achieved generally within the first week. Appropriate reduction in extracellular fluid occurring during the first week or so of life is expected and if it is not allowed to occur may result in dilutional hyponatremia and an increase in pulmonary interstitial water. Diuretics, when used to promote an increase in lung compliance, can themselves generate significant morbidity. Sodium depletion, hypokalemia, alkalosis, and calcium wasting all can either be caused by or exaggerated by the loop diuretics. Thus, one must consider the maturational state of the infant, the infant's response to pulmonary failure, and iatrogenic factors influencing the outcome.

AB  - In seven patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and anemia, we evaluated the mechanisms causing the anemia. All had a normocytic, normochromic, hyporegenerative anemia (mean hematocrit 26%; range 21% to 30%). The low hematocrit values seemed physiologically significant because mean (+/- SD), heart rates fell after transfusion (162 +/- 7 to 149 +/- 9 beats/min; p less than 0.005), as did blood lactate concentrations (1.2 +/- 0.3 mumol/gm blood before vs 0.5 +/- 0.3 after transfusion; p less than 0.05). Anemia could not be explained by blood withdrawal or deficiency of vitamin E, folate, or iron. No dyserthropoietic or megaloblastic changes were observed. No erythroid regenerative response was seen in the marrow; however, when recombinant erythropoietic growth factors were added to marrow cells in tissue culture, erythroid cell growth in vitro was normal. In contrast to patients with the "anemia of chronic disorders," these patients had a normal or increased number of marrow sideroblasts and increased serum transferrin saturation. Serum concentrations of erythropoietin were low for patients with anemia (range 11.4 to 47.1 mU/ml); yet the in vitro sensitivity of bone marrow erythroid progenitors (colony-forming units--erythroid) to recombinant erythropoietin was increased (p less than 0.001). We conclude that the anemia in these patients was the result of deficient production of erythropoietin, and we speculate that administration of recombinant erythropoietin would correct the anemia.

AB  - In summary, little progress has been made in the past several years with respect to the treatment of the baby with BPD. The conduct of convincing clinical research seems to be a casualty of budget cuts and a rush to learn the tools of molecular biology. To date, there are no clinical trials that have convincingly demonstrated that long-term diuretic, bronchodilator, vasodilator, or antioxidant therapy is effective in the treatment of chronic BPD. Short-term corticosteroid therapy hastens extubation, but long-term outcome is unaffected and serious questions remain about its safety. Multicenter clinical trials should be carefully designed and implemented to address the values of these therapies. In the design of these trials, care should be taken to stratify treatment groups for known risk factors for BPD. What are the future directions for the treatment of BPD? It is hoped that new BPD treatment strategies will be based on an improved understanding of mechanisms of lung repair and inflammation. Enzyme, gene, cytokine, antioxidant, and antiprotease therapies are being developed in animal models of lung injury. In addition, the use of lung transplantation has begun to be explored for severe cases of BPD. It is also possible, as has occurred in many chronic idiopathic diseases, that nonspecific treatment may prove beneficial. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or "biological response modifiers" will be administered to infants with severe BPD. For example, there is anecdotal evidence that recombinant human growth hormone may improve respiratory muscle function in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. In the absence of convincing clinical trials, the clinician should reserve existing therapies for the ventilator-dependent infant or infants whose high oxygen requirement is prohibiting discharge or resulting in complex home care or frequent rehospitalizations. It should be emphasized that continuous oxygen therapy combined with avoidance of environmental inhalant and infectious hazards have the strongest rationale and widest margin of safety for treatment of the infant with BPD. Ironically, oxygen therapy is frequently underutilized and discontinued too rapidly. Early discontinuation of oxygen therapy with alveolar hypoxia results in feeding difficulty, slow growth, nutrient malabsorption, bronchoconstriction, and pulmonary hypertension. Oxygen therapy, although more cumbersome and certainly less glamorous than other pharmacologic agents, remains the essential element of BPD care.

AB  - The extensive data from animal models of BPD and specific aspects of lung injury have helped to expand and refine the concept of pathogenesis introduced by Northway et al. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the human illness, it is unreasonable to presume that any single model or research group could elucidate all of the features and interactions of this complex disease. Therefore, we have combined data from animal homologues of BPD with that available on specific injury mechanisms to construct a more comprehensive model of pathogenesis (Fig. 5). Of particular interest is the recent data suggesting that the accelerated maturation of the prematurely born infant is associated with specific defects in gene expression that might increase vulnerability to lung injury. Additional animal research is needed both to further refine this model of pathogenesis and to develop the basis for a more rationale approach to the prevention and treatment of BPD. Based on the research progress to date, we feel the priorities for the future should at the least include continued definition of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying various types of lung injuries; evaluation of those mechanisms (and the consequences of their interruption) in a developmentally relevant setting; and further elaboration of the currently available BPD models to include factors (such as ante- and postpartum infections) that have not previously been part of these animal model systems. This approach, we feel, will complement human studies and ultimately lead to the prevention and better clinical management of this major health care problem.

AB  - The case of a 3-day-old infant with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome who required anesthetic care during closure of an abdominal wall defect is presented. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome comprises a constellation of clinical features, including macroglossia, macrosomia, omphalocele, visceromegaly, mild microcephaly, facial nevus flammeus, horizontal earlobe creases, and renal medullary dysplasia. Due to the high rate of omphalocele in this syndrome, anesthetic care is frequently required during the neonatal period. Many of these infants (greater than 50%) are born prematurely. Therefore, their anesthetic care may be further complicated by associated diseases of prematurity, such as hyaline membrane disease. Additional anesthetic implications of this syndrome relate to the occurrence and management of hypoglycemia and polycythemia. Careful intraoperative management of glucose homeostasis is particularly important, since eventual neurologic outcome and intelligence will be normal provided prolonged neonatal hypoglycemia is avoided. Preoperative evaluation of the cardiac and genitourinary system, including echocardiography and renal ultrasound, are recommended because of the frequent occurrence of associated anomalies with omphalocele.

AB  - It appears that the survivor of BPD is at risk for neurodevelopmental compromise but not necessarily to any greater extent than are prematurely born infants in general. What appears to be true is that as the neonatal course becomes more complicated, and the birth weight drops, the risk increases. If a BPD survivor sustains a moderate to severe IVH, particularly if accompanied by periventricular leukomalacia, the risk of significant handicap increases substantially. Effects of socioeconomic status (SES) are also important, and become more evident over time with a direct correlation between SES and outcome. Maximizing the environmental conditions while in the special care nursery, and reducing stress on the infant during the illness, may help to reduce risk of a compromised developmental outcome in the survivors. Careful monitoring of oxygen saturation postdischarge may similarly have a positive effect on outcome. Although direct comparability among studies is not possible, it appears that most reports suggest about half the survivors are free of any handicapping condition at follow-up, and about half are either moderately or severely impaired. Cerebral palsy is the most frequently reported handicapping condition. Since the presence or absence of significant IVH is not consistently reported across studies, it is not possible to know if infants who subsequently develop CP sustained a bleed, in addition to BPD, in the neonatal period. In studies in which this is more carefully delineated, that appears to be the case. In studies in which infants with significant hemorrhage were either excluded or dropped out, no survivors with cerebral palsy are reported. Approximately 4% of survivors across all studies reviewed were blind as a result of severe retinopathy of prematurity. Several studies excluded infants who developed significant ROP from their follow-up, so this percentage may be an underestimate of the actual incidence across all BPD survivors. With a greater number of gestationally younger infants surviving, this is one area of handicap that may increase in the years to come. Not all studies report on the presence of sensorineural hearing loss in survivors, but there is the suggestion this may occur perhaps in up to 4% of survivors. This is an area that future research should address. For infants who fall in the moderately handicapped category, typically defined as more than one standard deviation below the mean on a standardized developmental examination, that rating may change over time in either direction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Evidence is reviewed supporting the view that vitamin A (retinol) and its metabolite, retinoic acid, called natural retinoids, are major factors involved in differentiation and in maturation of the lungs. This conclusion is based on morphological observation that lack of this dietary micronutrient causes keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the bronchopulmonary tree that can be reversed by refeeding the animal with retinol. In addition to these observations suggesting an indirect participation of retinol and/or retinoic acid in the differentiation of this organ, more direct evidence is presented that this vitamin is involved in pulmonary gene expression. Adult as well as fetal lungs accumulate retinyl esters, the storage form of vitamin A, contain specific retinol- and retinoic acid-binding proteins and, more importantly, express several isoforms of nuclear retinoic acid receptors. These proteins are involved in activation and repression of specific genes regulated by retinoic acid. That retinol and/or retinoic acid may be involved in lung maturation is suggested by experimental results showing depletion of lung retinyl esters at birth, by significant alterations in the levels of the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein during lung maturation and, more importantly, by reduction in the morbidity of prematurely born human neonates who are given vitamin A because they are susceptible to bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - The toxic consequences of oxygen therapy may be development some neonatal diseases, for example: retrolental fibroplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It's now generally believed that oxygen induced cell toxicity is the result of formation of highly reactive free radicals. The greater incidence of these disorders in preterm infants suggest that some aspect of prematurity increases susceptibility of effects of toxic oxygen species. It's proposed the term for these disorders: "oxygen radical diseases of prematurity". Verification of the hypothesis about role of the antioxidant defense mechanisms of neonate may have important implications in the pursuit of the etiology these diseases and in identification of agents that may minimize toxicity associated with oxygen therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sick neonates and associated with poor pulmonary outcomes, however, the mechanisms responsible remain unknown. We present two novel neonatal rodent models of AKI to investigate the pulmonary effects of AKI., METHODS: In rat pups, AKI was induced surgically via bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (bIRI) or pharmacologically using aristolochic acid (AA). AKI was confirmed with plasma blood urea nitrogen and creatinine measurements and kidney injury molecule-1 staining on renal immunohistochemistry. Lung morphometrics were quantified with radial alveolar count and mean linear intercept, and angiogenesis investigated by pulmonary vessel density (PVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression. For the surgical model, bIRI, sham, and non-surgical pups were compared. For the pharmacologic model, AA pups were compared to vehicle controls., RESULTS: AKI occurred in bIRI and AA pups, and they demonstrated decreased alveolarization, PVD, and VEGF protein expression compared controls. Sham pups did not experience AKI, however, demonstrated decreased alveolarization, PVD, and VEGF protein expression compared to controls., CONCLUSION: Pharmacologic AKI and surgery in neonatal rat pups, with or without AKI, decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis, producing a bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype. These models provide a framework for elucidating the relationship between AKI and adverse pulmonary outcomes., IMPACT: There are no published neonatal rodent models investigating the pulmonary effects after neonatal acute kidney injury, despite known clinical associations. We present two novel neonatal rodent models of acute kidney injury to study the impact of acute kidney injury on the developing lung. We demonstrate the pulmonary effects of both ischemia-reperfusion injury and nephrotoxin-induced AKI on the developing lung, with decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis, mimicking the lung phenotype of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Neonatal rodent models of acute kidney injury provide opportunities to study mechanisms of kidney-lung crosstalk and novel therapeutics in the context of acute kidney injury in a premature infant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common cause of abrupted lung development after preterm birth. BPD may lead to increased rehospitalization, more severe and frequent respiratory infections, and life-long reduced lung function. The gene regulation in lungs with BPD is complex, with various genetic and epigenetic factors involved., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the regulatory relation between gene expression and the epigenome (DNA methylation) relevant for the immune system after hyperoxia followed by a recovery period in air using a mouse model of BPD., METHODS: Newborn mice pups were subjected to an immediate hyperoxic condition from birth and kept at 85% O2 levels for 14 days followed by a 14-day period in room air. Next, mice lung tissue was used for RNA and DNA extraction with subsequent microarray-based assessment of lung transcriptome and supplementary methylome analysis., RESULTS: The immune system-related transcriptomeregulation was affected in mouse lungs after hyperoxia. A high proportion of genes relevant in the immune system exhibited significant expression alterations, e.g., B cell-specific genes central to the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the PI3K-AKT, and the B cell receptor signaling pathways. The findings were accompanied by significant DNA hypermethylation observed in the PI3K-AKT pathway and immune system-relevant genes., CONCLUSIONS: Oxygen damage could be partly responsible for the increased susceptibility and abnormal response to respiratory viruses and infections seen in premature babies with BPD through dysregulated genes.

AB  - Natural surfactant (Surfactant TA, Survanta, CLSE, SF-RI 1, Curosurf and human surfactant obtained from amniotic fluid) therapy for RDS in very premature infants has been evaluated in 17 controlled clinical trials. Uniformly intratracheal surfactant administration caused a decreased intensity of mechanical ventilation during the first hours (reduced inspiratory pressure, reduced oxygen requirements) as an immediate effect of surfactant administration. Metanalysis reveals barotraumatic pulmonary complications mainly, pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema to occur less frequently in surfactant-treated infants in virtually all trials; an increased incidence of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia following surfactant treatment was observed in 10 controlled clinical trials. The incidence of other complications of prematurity (intracranial hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis) was unchanged following natural surfactant treatment. Dosing of natural surfactant is still under investigation, however recent data indicate that the initial dose should not be less than 100 mg/kg b.w. and retreatment should be given to infants with unsatisfactory response (i.e. fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) > 40%). Timing of surfactant treatment still remains controversial. Prophylactic treatment shortly following birth has been compared with rescue-treatment, i.e. surfactant administration to infants suffering from manifest RDS in most studies 4-8 h after birth. Conflicting data from 5 controlled trials may be interpreted as follows: prophylactic treatment seems to be favourable for extremely premature infants (GA  40%). Various factors may be operative including congenital bacterial infections (sepsis or pneumonia), lung hypoplasia and cardiac failure. Inactivation of surface properties of natural surfactant caused by a leakage of proteins across the alveolar-capillary membrane was observed in experimental and clinical studies. Current investigations focus on a combination of postnatal steroids and surfactant treatment to improve lung function and outcome in "non-responders". As long as any controlled clinical studies are being published, this approach remains experimental. Up to now, any controlled clinical trials have been performed to assess different modes of artificial ventilation (e.g. high frequency oscillating ventilation versus conventional ventilation) combined with surfactant therapy. Data obtained from premature animals given natural surfactant indicate any advantage with respect to gas exchange and lung histology to result from high frequency ventilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Infants, children, and adolescents with chronic respiratory failure are surviving in increasing numbers and, thereby, producing a significant population of ventilator-dependent pediatric patients. Chronic respiratory failure can occur as a complication of a wide variety of disease states; in pathophysiologic terms, it generally results from either decreased central nervous system output or inadequate force generated by the respiratory pump. Its laboratory hallmark is hypercapnia with or without hypoxemia. Stabilization of the patient with mechanical ventilatory support may permit long-term survival. Management of the ventilator-dependent pediatric patient is a complex task that must begin with an accurate prognostication of each patient's survival and quality of life. Once a decision is made concerning the practicality and appropriateness of long-term ventilatory support, informed choices must be made with respect to need for an artificial airway, mode of ventilation, and location of care. Many younger patients, especially those with intrinsic lung disease (like bronchopulmonary dysplasia), may require a hospital setting for long-term care, whereas others with neuromuscular or central disorders may benefit from being discharged to home. The patient's family must be thoroughly educated in the child's care, and they must be involved in decision-making. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, therapists, nurses, and other professionals is required to deliver optimal care. Outcome is good for most patients who are carefully selected.

AB  - Switzerland has one of the lowest neonatal mortalities in the world (5%) which has barely decreased during the last 10 years. The aim of care for newborn infants has therefore shifted from reducing mortality to reducing morbidity and increasing quality of life. Diseases which were frequent and severe some twenty years ago, such as rubella embryopathy and rhesus incompatibility, have almost disappeared today due to general prophylaxis. On the other hand, new, partly iatrogenic diseases, such as retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, considerably affect present morbidity of newborn infants. Due to newly developed imaging techniques and genetic, biochemical and immunological methods for screening of risk groups or all pregnant women or newborns, more and more diseases are detected earlier. Therefore the optimal procedure has to be settled early and on an interdisciplinary basis, and include prenatal investigation and possibly treatment, planning of delivery, and early and late postnatal diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The consequence of this development is close cooperation between obstetricians, neonatologists, and pediatric specialists, and a rapidly increasing need for neonatal beds, especially for intensive care. In spite of identification and centralization of women with high risk pregnancy before delivery, every newborn may develop sudden, unpredictable problems of adaptation which need immediate action. Therefore, at every delivery in a clinic or at home the necessary equipment and skilled staff must be available in order to cope with acute problems during adaptation from intrauterine to extrauterine life.

AB  - Oxygen is toxic because it produces oxygen radicals. One important oxygen radical generating system is hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase. Hypoxic newborn babies who have elevated concentrations of hypoxanthine in tissues and body fluids and simultaneously are treated with supplementary oxygen, may therefore produce oxygen radicals in excess overwhelming the body's natural defence systems against free radicals. Further, the capacity of many of these defence systems are probably reduced in the preterm baby. A series of conditions in neonates may, at least partly, be caused by oxygen radicals, e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis and patent ductus arteriosus. These conditions may be different facets of one disease; the "Oxygen radical disease in neonatology". It is speculated that oxygen radicals play a role in regulating the perinatal circulation. This new insight concerning the role of oxygen radicals may have fundamental consequences for treatment and handling of sick newborn babies.

AB  - The outcome of 60 premature infants weighing less than 1,000 g at birth and consecutively born during the years 1986 to 1988 is reported. Forty-two (70%) of them were inborn. The overall mortality rate was 42%, but only 26% in the inborn group instead of 78% in the outborn group (P less than 0.001). The mortality rate was higher for the appropriate for gestational age infants (56%) than for the growth retarded infants (14%, P less than 0.01). The main neonatal problems were the following: hyaline membrane disease (63%), patent ductus arteriosus (7%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (8%), necrotizing enterocolitis (15%), intraventricular hemorrhages (45%) and periventricular leukomalacia (12%). Twenty percent (7/35) of the surviving infants showed abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome, with only one (3%) having major handicap. No correlation was found between gestational age and neuro-developmental outcome.

AB  - A review of the pathogenesis of Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (ADV) infection based on recent knowledge gained by the author and collaborators is given. The review focuses mainly on the following topics. 1) Development of an easy, sensitive and fast assay for detection of ADV antigens and antibodies directed against these antigens. A highly sensitive rocket line immunoelectrophoretic assay (RLIE) was developed. This assay turned out to be 32 times more sensitive than the counter current electrophoresis assay routinely used to detect anti-ADV antibodies in ADV eradication programs, and moreover, ADV associated antigens could simultaneously be quantitatively detected in the same electrophoretic run. Later, the assay was improved to make it more economical and easy to use and finally the assay, now termed the counter current line absorption immunoelectrophoresis (CCLAIE) assay, was slightly modified to adapt the test to screening programs. 2) Examination of surface properties of the virus and the antigens expressed during in vivo infection. In this chapter studies on the surface charge properties of ADV are described. Using charge-shift crossed immunoelectrophoresis the occurrence of amphiphilic proteins associated with ADV is shown and the significance of these findings in regard to biological properties are discussed. The first demonstration of intact ADV structural and nonstructural proteins in mink tissues is described and it is shown that the structural proteins of the cell culture adapted strain of ADV (ADV-G) also in vivo is 2-3000 dalton smaller than those of other ADVs, i.e. 75,000 and 85,000 dalton in ADV-G as opposed to 78,000 and 88,000 dalton in the other ADVs. 3) Studies on the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia caused by ADV in newborn mink kits. The features of ADV-induced interstitial pneumonia are described. Using Southern blot and in situ hybridization techniques it is shown that ADV replicates to high levels in alveolar type II cells and it is suggested that the permissive replication of the virus in these cells causes direct cytopathology, followed by decreased surfactant production and development of the characteristic clinical and pathological features of respiratory distress and hyaline membrane disease. 4) Comparison of the pathogenesis of acute versus chronic disease caused by ADV infection. The data obtained by in situ hybridization analysis of ADV infected adult mink, mink kits, and mink kits treated with anti-ADV antibodies are compared. The accumulated data suggested that the development of severe acute ADV-induced disease is linked to low or absent antibody titers paired with high levels of viral replication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - In the period between 1983-1987, there were 101,056 births at Rajvithi hospital. Out of these, 6,158 sick newborn were transferred to Children's hospital for further care. The incidence of low birth-weight infants was 9.42 per cent. Average perinatal mortality was 14.49 per 1,000 births, ranging from 13.44 to 15.52 per 1,000 births. The major causes of early neonatal death were perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), immaturity (less than 1,000 g), congenital anomalies, and infection. Beyond this period (7-28 days of age) the causes of death were infection, congenital anomalies, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea and others. Asphyxia and RDS are still the major causes of death that could be further reduced.

AB  - Pulmonary surfactant contains lipids and less than 10% proteins. A number of bio-physical properties such as surface-tension lowering and spreading properties are thought to be important for function. Natural surfactants from animal lungs or human amniotic fluid have been used either for prophylaxis or therapy of RDS in very low birthweight infants. Carefully controlled clinical studies demonstrated beneficial effects in infants with RDS after natural surfactants. The main benefits were an improvement in oxygenation, a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and a reduction in mortality. The results of 5 studies using artificial surfactants clearly are in conflict with respect to short and long term benefits. As no adverse side effects after treatment with natural surfactants were observed until now, these preparations should be considered for prophylaxis or treatment of RDS.

AB  - Exogenous surfactant therapy has been recognised as an approach to alleviating the surfactant-deficine state for 3 decades. Natural and lipid-extracted surfactants derived from amniotic fluid, lung lavage, or lung homogenates are being used in worldwide clinical trials in premature infants. These studies are demonstrating a generally favourable influence on lung function by improving oxygenation and reducing the risk for pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema. In some studies, reduction in death and the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have been found. Numerous questions are unresolved and pharmacokinetic data are limited in preterm infants. Artificial surfactants are similarly under evaluation but current data demonstrate less overall effect. Adult respiratory distress syndrome has also been treated with exogenous surfactants. Although complex in terms of multiple initiating factors and in terms of high permeability of surfactant inhibitors, further studies are under way to determine the ideal methods of administration to enhance distribution and to monitor surfactant function in vivo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to analyze differences in plasma protein abundances between infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), to add new insights into a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease., METHODS: Cord and peripheral blood of neonates (<= 30 weeks gestational age) was drawn at birth and at the 36th postmenstrual week (36 PMA), respectively. Blood samples were retrospectively subdivided into BPD(+) and BPD(-) groups, according to the development of BPD., RESULTS: Children with BPD were characterized by decreased afamin, gelsolin and carboxypeptidase N subunit 2 levels in cord blood, and decreased galectin-3 binding protein and hemoglobin subunit gamma-1 levels, as well as an increased serotransferrin abundance in plasma at the 36 PMA., CONCLUSIONS: BPD development is associated with the plasma proteome changes in preterm infants, adding further evidence for the possible involvement of disturbances in vitamin E availability and impaired immunological processes in the progression of prematurity pulmonary complications. Moreover, it also points to the differences in proteins related to infection resistance and maintaining an adequate level of hematocrit in infants diagnosed with BPD.

AB  - The rationale for surfactant therapy in premature infants is presented, along with a discussion of the characteristics of surfactant and a review of clinical trials of surfactant for the prevention and treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a major complication of prematurity, affecting up to 40,000 infants in the United States and Canada annually. Poor lung compliance due to a functional or quantitative deficiency of surfactant causes progressive collapse of the lungs. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids, neutral lipids, and proteins synthesized by pneumocytes during gestation, reduces surface tension and stabilizes alveoli, which increases lung compliance and decreases the work of breathing. Mammalian, human, and artificial surfactants are being investigated for use in premature infants. Several controlled trials of exogenous surfactant therapy have demonstrated reductions in mortality and pulmonary air-leak phenomena and improved gas exchange, but these results are not seen consistently, and no significant reductions in bronchopulmonary dysplasia have been observed. Surfactant has no appreciable toxicity, although the potential for immunogenicity exists. Typical doses range from 60 mg to 200 mg/kg administered endotracheally either before the first breath or after development of RDS. Surfactant is a safe investigational agent that appears promising for the prevention and treatment of neonatal RDS, although additional clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine its true efficacy.

AB  - Lipoprotein secretion and vitamin E transport depend on an adequate supply of inositol which functions synergistically with choline. Feeding rats a choline deficient diet was associated with decreased linoleic and arachidonic acids and increased docosapentenoic and docosahexenoic acids in liver phosphatidylethanolamine. Lipoprotein secretion by the liver is impaired by long chain omega 3 fatty acids and by the high carbohydrate diet of Kwashiorkor. Pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein which functions in preventing alveolar collapse in the lung. Inositol supplements to premature infants altered the composition of surfactant phospholipids and reduced the need for oxygen therapy. Oxygen free radicals, generated in oxygen therapy, convert low density lipoproteins (LDL) into potent toxins, without adequate antioxidants and free radical scavengers to block free radical generation. Vitamin E deficiency predisposes humans to increased susceptability to oxygen toxicity leading to Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic pulmonary insufficiency.

AB  - Of 18 pregnancies in 11 renal transplant recipients, three were terminated and in the remaining 15 (in 8 women) there were 10 live births (including one set of twins), five intrauterine deaths, and one spontaneous abortion. Graft function deteriorated in six women, from obstruction of the transplanted ureter in two, recurrent glomerulonephritis in two, rejection in one, and pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in one. Hypertension worsened or developed in all but one of the pregnancies and proteinuria appeared in eight. Of the 10 live births only one reached 38 weeks gestation (mean 35 weeks) and four neonates were small for gestational age. One infant died early from intraventricular hemorrhage and hyaline membrane disease, one fetus had hydrocephalus, and the others were normal. Factors associated with a poor fetal outcome were deterioration in graft function during pregnancy, pre-existing hypertension, or the development of hypertension before the third trimester.

AB  - Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNEC) are granulated epithelial cells distributed throughout conducting airways. Among the bioactive products identified within the secretory granules of these cells are potent mitogens and bronchoactive and vasoactive agents. The secretory status of these cells, which are in greatest number in the fetus and newborn, is modulated by neural reflexes and by changes in airway gas composition. The aggregate data suggest roles for PNEC in airway "chemoception" and/or regulation of airway epithelial differentiation. Marked increases in PNEC are observed in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, where airway and alveolar fibrosis, epithelial metaplasia, and airway and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy contribute to marked pathophysiologic changes in lung function. Considering the biologic effects of PNEC secretory products, particularly gastrin-releasing peptide on airway epithelial cell and fibroblast proliferation, we propose that an increase in PNEC secretory products in the regenerating airway epithelium may contribute to the development of the pathologic alterations in lung structure seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this proposed scheme, secretion of abnormally large amounts of bronchoactive and vasoactive agents from PNEC (e.g., serotonin, gastrin-releasing peptide) in response to airway hypoxia and hypercapnia may be partially responsible in the genesis of reactive airway disease and pulmonary hypertension seen in this disease.

AB  - The new data concerning the structure and dynamics of the alveolar surfactant, its phospholipid and apoprotein components and their synthesis, storage and secretion by the large granular alveolocytes, the formation and disconnection of lipoprotein complexes, their disorders and pathological relationships were analysed in order to discern the possibility of a more or less important pathogenetic role in the onset and development of lung diseases. Sometimes, surfactant disorders appeared as epiphenomena, like in pulmonary edemas; at other times, they behaved as a turn plate enhancing and centering the development of alveolar lipoproteinosis, microlithiasis alveolaris, hyaline membrane disease of newborns and the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Focusing the pathogenesis on the surfactant disorders and on their causes, a unification of mechanisms became possible with the increase in complexity of processes by the intervention of other complicating factors, mainly the self-perpetuating ones.

AB  - Pediatric pneumology is a new subspecialty within the field of pediatrics. There is a large overlap with general pediatrics, so that it is essential for pediatric pneumology to be fully integrated into the wider field of general pediatrics. The main topics treated within this subspecialty are: neonatology (artificial ventilation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia); childhood asthma (long-term treatment and epidemiology); immunology (local immune system, recurrent infections in children); and cystic fibrosis. Research should be concentrated on methods of studying lung function in preschool children. The missing link between pediatric pneumology and pneumology in adults must be found, especially in the interests of patients with such chronic conditions as asthma and cystic fibrosis.

AB  - The protean effects of undernutrition on lung defenses and repair capabilities suggest that less than adequate nutritional support is a key pathogenetic factor in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Very-low-birthweight (VLBW, less than or equal to 1,000 g) premature infants who require intensive respiratory support have a distressingly high incidence of chronic lung disease or BPD. Many VLBW infants are currently undernourished during the most acute phase of their respiratory illness. Because VLBW newborns have only meager caloric reserves (fat, glycogen), and have only marginally sufficient stores of nutrients needed for effective lung defenses and repair capacity (vitamins A and E, copper, zinc, iron, selenium, essential fatty acids, etc.), the adequacy of nutritional support provided them will almost certainly influence their ability to tolerate early stress, and it may play a critical role in their clinical outcome. Experimental studies, combined with a limited number of clinical studies, clearly demonstrate that undernutrition can interact with each of the other well-accepted etiologic factors involved in the pathogenesis of BPD. Nutritional status affects the lung's ability to resist hyperoxic damage, to replace damaged/sloughed lung cells caused by barotrauma, to promote continued lung growth, to resist infection, and to tolerate prolonged and potentially toxic stresses in general. By providing more ideal nutritional support, clinicians may be able to apply preventive treatment to influence the outcome of intensive respiratory therapy in the VLBW newborn.

AB  - A preterm newborn with complete triploidy and serious hyaline membrane disease is reported. Characteristic pattern of malformations (large, posterior fontanelle, low-set malformed ears, hypertelorism, exophthalmos, micrognathia, syndactylies of the third and fourth digits of all extremities, micropenis and cryptorchism), and abnormal hematologic features (decreased number of red blood cells and increased RBC indices) suggested diagnosis which was confirmed by a 69,XXY karyotype. As factors with possible causal responsibility authors remark first-month abdominal radiation and chronic exposure to industrial toxic during pregnancy in the mother and no specific trend toward chromosome rupture in the father, and second trimester pre-eclampsia. No familial previous cases of chromosome anomalies nor congenital malformations were referred. From the review of 56 published reports they conclude that triploidy syndrome has a characteristic and recognizable array of phenotype abnormalities.

AB  - Surfactant-associated protein of Mr 28,000 to 35,000 (SAP-35) is an abundant glycoprotein present in the alveolus of the lung, which imparts both structural organization to surfactant phospholipids and provides regulatory information controlling surfactant phospholipid secretion and metabolism. SAP-35 expression is enhanced by 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and epidermal growth factor during perinatal differentiation of type II epithelial cells. Its synthesis and RNA are also controlled by a variety of inhibitory factors, which include transforming growth factor and insulin. Glucocorticoids both enhance and inhibit SAP-35 expression in fetal lung explants. There is evidence that fetal hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia, or both, inhibit the morphologic differentiation of the type II epithelial cell in association with decreased phospholipid surfactant synthesis or secretion. Insulin is also a potent inhibitor of SAP-35 expression in fetal lung tissue, and decreased SAP-35 was previously noted in amniotic fluid of patients with diabetes during pregnancy. Recent progress in the management of diabetes in pregnancy, characterized by more rigorous metabolic control, has decreased the risk of hyaline membrane disease for the infant of the diabetic mother and is associated with normal levels of SAP-35 in amniotic fluid. Hyaline membrane disease remains a major cause of morbidity in infants of diabetic mothers but may also reflect a higher incidence of premature delivery, cesarean section, and asphyxia at delivery as well as inhibition of pulmonary surfactant phospholipid synthesis or expression of the surfactant protein SAP-35.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) is characterized by increased permeability and infiltration of inflammatory cells, impairment of alveolar development, and compromised lung function. Recent evidence has determined that microRNAs (miRs) are implicated in hyperoxia-induced lung injury, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the expression profile and functional role of miR199a-5p in developing lungs have not been reported., METHODS: The present study was undertaken to explore the role of miR199a-5p in developing mice lungs and human neonates. We exposed neonatal mice for 7 days, mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE12), mouse lung endothelial cells (MLECs), and macrophages (RAW246.7), to hyperoxia at different time points., RESULTS: Our results demonstrated enhanced miR199a-5p expression in hyperoxia-exposed mice lungs and cells, as well as in tracheal aspirates of infants developing BPD, with significant reduction in the expression of its target, caveolin-1. Next, we observed that miR199a-5p-mimic worsens HALI as evidenced by increased inflammatory cells, cytokines, and lung vascular markers. Conversely, miR199a-5p-inhibitor treatment attenuated HALI., CONCLUSION: Thus, our findings suggest that miR199a-5p is a potential target for attenuating HALI pathophysiology in the developing lung. Moreover, miR199a-5p-inhibitor could be part of a novel therapeutic strategy for improving BPD in preterm neonates.

AB  - In summary, the isolation and characterization of three surfactant proteins have considerably changed our understanding of the nature of pulmonary surfactant and its metabolism. The isolation of the cDNAs and genes encoding the proteins and the elucidation of their structure now makes possible the generation of surfactant proteins for further study and for therapy of surfactant deficient states. Artificial surfactant consisting of appropriately modified human proteins can be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Mixed with appropriate synthetic phospholipids, these proteins may be useful for the treatment of infants with hyaline membrane disease. Significant progress has been made in identifying and characterizing these three more abundant proteins; however, many questions regarding the functions of numerous other proteins present in surfactant (whether produced by Type II cells, Type I cell, Clara cell, or others) remain unanswered. Knowledge of the factors controlling developmental expression of surfactant phospholipids and protein as well as the molecular basis of the interactions among the surfactant proteins and phospholipids may lead to new strategies for therapy of hyaline membrane disease. Major questions regarding the site and nature of posttranslational modification of the surfactant proteins, their sites of assembly with lipids, and their precise roles in the metabolism of surfactant in vitro remain to be clarified. It is hoped that answers to these questions will facilitate the identification and design of appropriate therapy of infants and adults with pulmonary disease associated with surfactant deficiency.

Numerous organisms may be seen in the alveoli, but few polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are found in the areas of bacterial invasion. Aggregated PMNs are often found, however, in the pulmonary capillaries. This study was designed to explore the effect of the group B streptococcal (GBS) type III antigen on PMN chemotaxis and PMN-endothelial cell interactions. Human PMNs were isolated and pretreated with 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml of GBS type III antigen prior to determining their chemotactic response to the chemoattractants formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, zymosan-activated serum, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B4. The GBS antigen caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, zymosan-activated serum, and platelet-activating factor-mediated chemotaxis (% inhibition of 38.1 +/- 4.0, 55.5 +/- 3.3, 46.7 +/- 9.7%, respectively; p less than 0.01). Leukotriene B4-mediated chemotaxis was not significantly depressed (21.2% +/- 7.7 inhibition; NSD). Group B streptococcal antigen also inhibited formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced PMN adherence to endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent fashion when incubations were performed in the absence of serum. In contrast, incubation of GBS type III antigen with serum deficient in antibody to GBS resulted in a marked enhancement of PMN attachment to human endothelial cells. No significant enhancement of adherence was sen with the antigen in the presence of serum containing GBS type III antibody. These data suggest that the GBS type III antigen by itself may inhibit the influx of PMNs into the local site of infection in the alveoli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Technical aspects and indications for the use of digital subtraction angiography of thorax in 109 children are discussed, and the interest of this exploratory method emphasized in chronic respiratory disease in children. Results obtained are compared with other investigations for screening of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Although generally reliable for exploration of thoracic aorta anomalies (coarctation and abnormal vascular arch) it is considered to be incompletely effective for investigation of congenital heart disease.

AB  - Thirty-three premature infants receiving parenteral nutrition during the first 5 days of life were divided into three groups. Infants in group I (n = 13) received no ventilatory therapy. Those in groups II (n = 10) and III (n = 10) were intubated and artificially ventilated because of hyaline membrane disease, apnea, or other illness. All infants received glucose, amino acids, fat emulsion, and electrolytes in their total parenteral nutrition regimen. Groups I and II were administered a transfer-adapted amino acid solution (Aminoplasmal paed 5%) for their protein supplementation, and group III, a so-called human milk-adapted solution (Aminovenos 6%). The three groups were compared with respect to amino acid blood level, amino acid excretion, and nitrogen balance. Taurine levels decreased significantly during parenteral nutrition in all three groups. The other amino acids, with a few exceptions, remained within acceptable range. Elevations of serine, proline, and methionine were found in group III after the third day. All three groups exhibited good nitrogen retention. Excretion of amino acids was only about 1%.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prophylaxis of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) with prenatal steroids from the viewpoint of neonatology. In 397 preterm infants of 27-35 week gestation the prenatal prophylaxis of HMD with prednisolone (200-300 mg over 48-72 h) significantly reduced the HMD morbidity and mortality rate (0-7th day of life), especially in newborns under 33-week gestation. HMD was not detected if a 48-h interval lay between the end of prednisolone application and birth. There was no influence on the severity and the lethality of HMD. The 29-day mortality rate in the prednisolone group (14.6%) corresponded more or less to that of the control group (16%). In the prednisolone group the increase in late mortality rate was due to a significantly higher number of late serious infections. The time interval between the rupture of the membranes and birth did not influence the infection rate and HMD frequency. At this time we cannot recommend a general prenatal glucocorticoid prophylaxis of HMD in cases of threatened preterm labor.

AB  - Dexamethasone was compared with placebo in a double-blind, crossover, randomised study of infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia who had required mechanical ventilation for at least four weeks, despite treatment with diuretics, methylxanthines, bronchodilators, fluid restriction, nutritional supplementation, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus when indicated. Gestational age ranged from 27 to 33 weeks and birth weight from 800 to 1730 g. Patients received dexamethasone (0 . 5 mg/kg/day) or normal saline for the first 3 days, then treatment was crossed over for the next 3 days. The study was terminated when sequential analysis showed that all six patients had improved during dexamethasone therapy. Significant improvements were seen in ventilator-determined respiratory rate, peak inspiratory pressure, fractional inspired oxygen concentration, and alveolar arterial oxygen gradients (p less than 0 . 05). Although dexamethasone hastened weaning from mechanical ventilation, infection occurred in a substantial proportion of patients.

AB  - Infant, neonatal and perinatal mortality rates are reliable indices of the health status and delivery of health care in a country. These rates have been declining in Singapore since World War II, and presently have become comparable to those of many developing countries. The pattern has also changed; postneonatal mortality has fallen markedly, resulting in neonatal mortality accounting for 75% of infant mortality, and first week mortality for 85% of neonatal mortality. Perinatal mortality rates have also declined over the years, due mainly to a decline in the first week mortality rates though a slight fall in stillbirth rates has also occurred. Further improvements can be expected in the perinatal and neonatal mortality rates. As neonatal intensive care improves, the prognosis of the very small and feeble infants will be brighter even though the efforts required might be very much greater. Such a challenge will prove to be very exciting and stimulating, and be an impetus to the raising of neonatal intensive care to a much higher level.

AB  - Pulmonary edema is an important cause of respiratory distress in newborn infants. It occurs with severe perinatal asphyxia, heart failure, hyaline membrane disease, persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus, pneumonitis from group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Neonatal pulmonary edema often develops from increased pressure in the microcirculation of the lungs. This may occur in conjunction with sustained hypoxia; left ventricular failure associated with congenital heart disease or myocardial dysfunction; following excessive intravascular infusions of blood, colloid, fat, or electrolyte solution and in conditions that increase pulmonary blood flow. Low intravascular protein osmotic pressure from hypoproteinemia may predispose infants to pulmonary edema. Hypoproteinemia is common in infants who are born prematurely. Large intravascular infusions of protein-free fluid further decrease the concentration of protein in plasma and thereby facilitate edema formation. Lymphatic obstruction by air (pulmonary interstitial emphysema of fibrosis (chronic lung disease) also may contribute to the development of edema. Bacteremia, endotoxemia, and prolonged oxygen-breathing injure the pulmonary microvascular endothelium and cause protein-rich fluid to accumulate in the lungs. Epithelial protein leaks may develop when the transpulmonary pressure needed to inflate the lungs increases because of high surface tension at the air-liquid interface. Fibrin clots from in some of the air spaces, which in combination with atelectasis and edema constitute the pathologic features of hyaline membrane disease. The risk of neonatal pulmonary edema can be reduced by several therapeutic measures designed to lessen fluid filtration pressure, increase plasma protein osmotic pressure, and prevent or reduce the severity of lung injury.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of the neonate characterized by impaired alveolarization and vascular growth. BPD is more common in premature male infants, but the reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes are not known. It is thought that alterations in fibroblast phenotype in response to environmental stress such as hyperoxia contribute to BPD. Notch signaling creates a profibrotic environment in the lung. However, the role of hyperoxia on differential Notch pathway activation in male vs. female neonatal lung fibroblasts is not known. Primary murine lung fibroblasts from 10-day-old male and female mice were exposed to room air (21% O2, 5% CO2) or hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2), and changes in cell proliferation, viability and expression of fibrosis-related genes and Notch pathway mediators were measured. Upon exposure to hyperoxia, cell proliferation was arrested in male and female fibroblasts, but cell viability was preserved. Increased Notch pathway activation was noted in male fibroblasts along with differential sex-specific modulation of key Notch pathway mediators in response to hyperoxia. alpha-Smooth muscle actin expression was increased in both male and female fibroblasts upon exposure to hyperoxia. Male and female fibroblasts further demonstrated distinct changes in expression of key fibrosis-related genes upon exposure to hyperoxia. Differential Notch pathway activation and distinct differences in the expression of key fibrosis-related genes might contribute to the sex-specific differences seen in hyperoxia-induced fibrosis and inhibition of lung development in BPD, with more severe implications in male neonates.

AB  - Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) has been credited with a variety of beneficial effects in the premature newborn infant. It has been thought that deficiency of vitamin E is at least partly responsible for the anemia which often occurs 4 to 6 wk after premature birth, and routine dietary supplementation with vitamin E is frequently recommended. However, critical analysis reveals that published controlled studies of vitamin E supplementation do not agree on the magnitude or even the existence of this protective effect against anemia. Analysis of commonly used feeding practices suggests that the dietary ratio of alpha-tocopherol to polyunsaturated fatty acids is generally sufficient to prevent manifestations of vitamin E deficiency without supplementation. Large parenteral doses of vitamin E have been purported to protect premature infants exposed to oxygen-enriched environments and mechanical ventilation from the complications of retrolental fibroplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Subsequent studies, however, have not yet substantiated encouraging early reports of these protective effects. At present, there seems to be no clearly established need for supplementing the premature infant's usual dietary intake of vitamin E.

AB  - In attempting to differentiate early-onset Group B streptococcal infection from hyaline-membrane disease we found features of severe Group B infection to be rupture of the membranes for more than 12 hours before delivery (four or eight versus one of nine), gram-positive cocci in the gastric aspirate (four or four versus none of one), apnea and shock in the first 24 hours of life (seven of eight versus none of nine), and the generation of lower peak inspiratory pressures on avolume-cycled respirator (mean of 36.5 +/- 2.8 versus 63.9 +/- 6.2 cm of water; P = 0.005). In eight fatal cases of Group B infection, four patients had radiographic features indistinguishable from hyaline-membrane disease whereas the other cases were consistent with neonatal pneumonia. Seven of the eight infected infants had no histologic evidence of coexisting hyaline-membrane disease. Microscopical features of Group B infection included cocci in unevenly distributed hyaline membranes and minimal atelectasis. Group B streptococcal infection differs clinically and pathologically from hyaline-membrane disease. Differentiating clinical features include early apnea and shock and lower inspiratory pressures on mechanical ventilation.

AB  - The level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose may be lowered after subarachnoid hemorrhage. This was observed in each of 18 cases of proven posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in infants (study group). In one of these children with a hemorrhagic spinal fluid and hypoglycorrhachia unaccompanied by clinical signs of intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus, the axial tomography showed a significant although asymptomatic hydrocephalus. To further evaluate the significance of this finding (hypoglycorrhachia), we compared the incidence of hypoglycorrhachia (CSF glucose less than 40 mg) and lowered CSF glucose/blood glucose ratio (ratio less than 0.4) at three similar time intervals from the presumed time of the intracranial hemorrhage in the study group with that of a control group of 40 neonates with similar neonatal associated pathology (mainly premature infants with hyaline membrane disease) but who did not later develop posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus or cerebral palsy. There was a statistically greater frequency of these anomalies in the hydrocephalic group. Only 3 of the 40 control patients had hypoglycorrhachia and low ratio. Hypoglycorrhachia in the absence of other known causes for decreased CSF glucose is a good index of a probably significant meningeal hemorrhage with a high risk of secondary hydrocephalus which may or may not be symptomatic. Hypoglycorrhachia may be used as an indication of the frequency of clinically inapparent subarachnoid hemorrhage in these high risk newborns.

AB  - Pneumonia is one of the most serious infections in the neonate and is responsible for a large percentage of neonatal mortality. Pneumonia in a premature or term infant who is debilitated by an underlying problem such as hyaline membrane disease carries an extremely high morbidity and mortality. Since most of the bacterial pneumonias are treatable, early recognition and diagnosis and vigorous treatment are essential. X-ray findings, though helpful, serve only as a guideline. Prognosis is adversely affected if pneumonia results in generalized sepsis, leading to meningitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and osteomyelitis. Prompt antibiotic treatment should be begun before the etiologic agent or drug susceptibility is known.

AB  - We reviewed 294 pairs of twins born from January, 1966 to December, 1972. In 19 pairs one or both members developed hyaline membrane disease (HMD). Of these, both twins were affected in 12 pairs, twin B alone in six pairs, and twin A alone in one pair. The group affected (19 pairs) had lower gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, increased incidence of monozygotic (MZ) twins, and higher mortality rate than the group without HMD (275 pairs). MZ twins were more immature than dizygotic (DZ) twins (p less than 0.02). When both twins were affected they had lower gestational age, birth weight, and increased monozygosity than when B alone was affected (p less than 0.05). When twin B alone was affected, he had lower Apgar score than twin A (p less than 0.05). We suggested that (1) HMD occurs in twins because of lung immaturity, as it does in singletons; (2) monozygosity may be a predisposing factor to HMD because of the associated prematurity; and (3) the greater risk of twin B is probably related to birth asphyxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperoxia is a frequently employed therapy for prematurely born infants, induces lung injury and contributes to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is characterized by decreased cellular proliferation, cellular migration, and failure of injury repair systems. Actin binding proteins (ABPs) such as VASP, cofilin1, and profilin1 regulate cell proliferation and migration via modulation of actin dynamics. Lung mesenchymal stem cells (L-MSCs) initiate repair processes by proliferating, migrating, and localizing to sites of injury. These processes have not been extensively explored in hyperoxia induced lung injury and repair., METHODS: ABPs and CD146+ L-MSCs were analyzed by immunofluorescence in human lung autopsy tissues from infants with and without BPD and by western blot in lung tissue homogenates obtained from our murine model of newborn hyperoxic lung injury., RESULTS: Decreased F-actin content, ratio of VASPpS157/VASPpS239, and profilin 1 expression were observed in human lung tissues but this same pattern was not observed in lungs from hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. Increases in cofilin1 expression were observed in both human and mouse tissues at 7d indicating a dysregulation in actin dynamics which may be related to altered growth. CD146 levels were elevated in human and newborn mice tissues (7d)., CONCLUSION: Altered phosphorylation of VASP and expression of profilin 1 and cofilin 1 in human tissues indicate that the pathophysiology of BPD involves dysregulation of actin binding proteins. Lack of similar changes in a mouse model of hyperoxia exposure imply that disruption in actin binding protein expression may be linked to interventions or morbidities other than hyperoxia alone.

AB  - Background: Epigenetic scores (EpiScores), reflecting DNA methylation (DNAm)-based surrogates for complex traits, have been developed for multiple circulating proteins. EpiScores for pro-inflammatory proteins, such as C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP), are associated with brain health and cognition in adults and with inflammatory comorbidities of preterm birth in neonates. Social disadvantage can become embedded in child development through inflammation, and deprivation is over-represented in preterm infants. We tested the hypotheses that preterm birth and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with alterations in a set of EpiScores enriched for inflammation-associated proteins. Result(s): 104 protein EpiScores were derived from saliva samples of 332 neonates born at gestational age (GA) 22.14 to 42.14 weeks. Saliva sampling was between 36.57 and 47.14 weeks. Forty-three (41%) EpiScores were associated with low GA at birth (standardised estimates 0.14 to 0.88, Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <8.3x10-3). These included EpiScores for chemokines, growth factors, proteins involved in neurogenesis and vascular development, cell membrane proteins and receptors, and other immune proteins. Three EpiScores were associated with SES, or the interaction between birth GA and SES: afamin, intercellular adhesion molecule 5 and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (standardised estimates 0.06 to 0.13, Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <8.3x10-3). In a preterm sub-group (n=217, median [range] GA 29.29 weeks [22.14 to 33.0 weeks]), SES-EpiScore associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, and histological chorioamnionitis. Conclusion(s): Low birth GA is substantially associated with a set of EpiScores. The set was enriched for inflammatory proteins, providing new insights into immune dysregulation in preterm infants. SES had fewer associations with EpiScores; these tended to have small effect sizes and were not statistically significant after adjusting for inflammatory comorbidities. This suggests that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary axis through which SES becomes embedded in the development of preterm infants in the neonatal period.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Objective We aimed to study the involvement of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) by conducting bioinformatics analyses and identifying and validating the associated ferroptosis-related genes to explore new directions for treating BPD. Methods The dataset GSE32472 on BPD was downloaded from the public genome database. Using R language, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the BPD and normal group were screened. In the present study, we adopted weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) for identifying BPD-related gene modules and ferroptosis-related genes were extracted from FerrDb. Their results were intersected to obtain the hub genes. After that, to explore the hub gene-related signaling pathways, the hub genes were exposed to gene ontology enrichment analysis. With the purpose of verifying the mRNA expression of the hub genes, a single-gene gene set enrichment analysis and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were conducted. Immune cell infiltration in BPD was analyzed using the CIBERSORT inverse fold product algorithm. Results A total of 606 DEGs were screened. WGCNA provided the BPD-related gene module darkgreen4. The intersection of DEGs, intramodular genes, and ferroptosis-related genes revealed six ferroptosis-associated hub genes (ACSL1, GALNT14, WIPI1, MAPK14, PROK2, and CREB5). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the hub genes screened for BPD were of good diagnostic significance. According to the results of immune infiltration analysis, the proportions of a cluster of differentiation (CD)8, CD4 naive, and memory resting T cells and M2 macrophage were elevated in the normal group, and the proportions of M0 macrophage, resting mast cell, and neutrophils were increased in the BPD group. Conclusions A total of six ferroptosis-associated hub genes in BPD were identified in this study, and they may be potential new therapeutic targets for BPD.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in perinatal care, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely premature infants has not decreased. Postnatal surfactant therapy provides symptomatic relief from respiratory distress syndrome, but does not translate into a reduction in BPD. Therefore, the search for effective interventions to prevent BPD continues., OBJECTIVES: Since PPAR-gamma agonists have been demonstrated to promote neonatal lung maturation and injury repair, we hypothesized that a formulation of a PPAR-gamma agonist, pioglitazone (PGZ) and a synthetic lung surfactant (a surfactant protein B peptide mimic, B-YL) combined would stimulate lung maturation and block hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury more effectively than either modality alone., METHODS: One-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were administered PGZ + B-YL via nebulization every 24 h for up to 72 h. The pups were exposed to either 21 or 95% O2, and then sacrificed. Their lungs were examined for markers of lung maturation (levels of PPAR-gamma, SP-C and choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase [CCT-alpha] and [3H]triolein uptake) and injury repair (bronchoalveolar lavage cell count and protein content, and levels of LEF-1, fibronectin, ALK5, and beta-catenin) by Western blot analysis., RESULTS: Markers of alveolar epithelial/mesenchymal maturation (PPAR-gamma, SP-C, CCT-alpha, and triolein uptake) increased significantly in the PGZ + B-YL group, more than with either drug alone. Similarly, markers of hyperoxia-induced lung injury were blocked effectively with PGZ + B-YL treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized PPAR-gamma agonist PGZ with a synthetic lung surfactant accelerates lung maturation and prevents neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury more than either modality alone, with the potential to provide more effective prevention of BPD.

AB  - Lung mesenchymal cells play an essential role in development and at birth, as the lung moves from a fluid-filled to an oxygen-rich environment with a stable gas-liquid interface. The molecular details and cellular changes accompanying this highly coordinated process remain incompletely understood. Therefore, we performed single cell transcriptomics and in-situ imaging of the developing lung in both health and disease to characterize the spectrum of mesenchymal cell states prior to the onset of air-breathing life through late alveolarization to gain insight into their role in orchestrating tissue maturation. We found that cell type diversity in the mesenchymal compartment increases rapidly during normal development but is delayed during neonatal exposure to 80% O2 hyperoxia, a model for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This study identifies the molecular transitions between populations of mesenchymal cells at discrete developmental time points across fibroblast, smooth muscle, and mural compartments and elucidates the global and cell type-specific effects of neonatal hyperoxia, including the emergence of Acta1+ cells which are absent in normoxic neonatal lungs. These granular insights hold the promise of targeted treatment for neonatal lung disease, which remains a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality across the world.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Rationale: Pulmonary hypertension associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a severe complication of preterm birth resulting in high mortality of up to 50% within the first 2 years of life. There is a direct relationship between bronchopulmonary dysplasia severity and incidence of associated pulmonary hypertension. However, it is challenging to clinically characterize severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia with and without pulmonary hypertension and there is need for better understanding of the two entities. Objective(s): To identify markers to help understand biological processes and endotype characterization of infants with pulmonary hypertension associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in tracheal aspirates. Method(s): We conducted multi-omic analysis of tracheal aspirates via miRNA PCR arrays, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics in preterm infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia with (n=21) and without (n=25) pulmonary hypertension. Result(s): Our study analysis revealed 12 miRNAs (hsa-miR-29a, has-miR-542-3p, hasmiR-624, has-miR-183, hsa-miR-501-3p, hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-3131, hsa-miR-3683, hsa-miR-3193, hsa-miR-3672, hsa-miR-3128, and hsa-miR-1287); 6 transcripts (IL6, RPL35P5, HSD3B7, RNA5SP215, OR2A1-AS1, and RNVU1-19), and 5 proteins (CAPS, AAT, KRT5, SFTPB, and LGALS3BP) with significant differential expression in preterm infants with severe lung disease with pulmonary hypertension when compared to infants with severe lung disease but no pulmonary hypertension. Pathway analysis of the integrated multi-omic expression signatures revealed NFkB, VEGF, SERPINA1, IL6 and ERK12 as target molecules for miRNAs, and angiogenesis and hyperoxia stress as recurrent pathways of individual markers. Conclusion(s): Our multi-omic analysis of tracheal aspirates revealed a comprehensive thumbprint of miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins that could help endotype infants with severe lung disease and pulmonary hypertension.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth is closely associated with a phenotype that includes brain dysmaturation and neurocognitive impairment, commonly termed Encephalopathy of Prematurity (EoP), of which systemic inflammation is considered a key driver. DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of inflammation from peripheral blood associate with poor brain imaging outcomes in adult cohorts. However, the robustness of DNAm inflammatory scores in infancy, their relation to comorbidities of preterm birth characterised by inflammation, neonatal neuroimaging metrics of EoP, and saliva cross-tissue applicability are unknown. Method(s): Using salivary DNAm from 258 neonates (n = 155 preterm, gestational age at birth 23.28 - 34.84 weeks, n = 103 term, gestational age at birth 37.00 - 42.14 weeks), we investigated the impact of a DNAm surrogate for C-reactive protein (DNAm CRP) on brain structure and other clinically defined inflammatory exposures. We assessed i) if DNAm CRP estimates varied between preterm infants at term equivalent age and term infants, ii) how DNAm CRP related to different types of inflammatory exposure (maternal, fetal and postnatal) and iii) whether elevated DNAm CRP associated with poorer measures of neonatal brain volume and white matter connectivity. Result(s): Higher DNAm CRP was linked to preterm status (-0.0107 +/- 0.0008, compared with - 0.0118 +/- 0.0006 among term infants; p < 0.001), as well as perinatal inflammatory diseases, including histologic chorioamnionitis, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotising enterocolitis (OR range 2.00  to 4.71, p < 0.01). Preterm infants with higher DNAm CRP scores had lower brain volume in deep grey matter, white matter, and hippocampi and amygdalae (beta range 0.185 to 0.218). No such associations were observed for term infants. Association magnitudes were largest for measures of white matter microstructure among preterms, where elevated epigenetic inflammation associated with poorer global measures of white matter integrity (beta range 0.206 to 0.371), independent of other confounding exposures. Conclusion(s): Epigenetic biomarkers of inflammation provide an index of innate immunity in relation to neonatal health. Such DNAm measures complement biological and clinical metrics when investigating the determinants of neurodevelopmental differences.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) predisposes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterized by abnormal alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development, in preterm neonates. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure is used to recapitulate the phenotype of human BPD in murine models. Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD, but the main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes are unknown. Our objective was to investigate sex-specific and cell-type specific transcriptional changes that drive injury in the neonatal lung exposed to hyperoxia at single-cell resolution and delineate the changes in cell-cell communication networks in the developing lung. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to generate transcriptional profiles of >35000 cells isolated from the lungs of neonatal male and female C57BL/6 mice exposed to 95% FiO2 between PND1-5 (saccular stage of lung development) or normoxia and euthanized at PND7 (alveolar stage of lung development). ScRNAseq identified 22 cell clusters with distinct populations of endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. Our data identified that the distal lung vascular endothelium (composed of aerocytes and general capillary endothelial cells) is exquisitely sensitive to hyperoxia exposure with the emergence of an intermediate capillary endothelial population with both aCaP and gCaP markers. We also identified a myeloid derived suppressor cell population from the lung neutrophils. Sexual dimorphism was evident in all lung cell subpopulations but was striking among the lung immune cells. Finally, we identified that the specific intercellular communication networks and the ligand-receptor pairs that are impacted by neonatal hyperoxia exposure.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Lung development is precisely controlled by underlying Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN). Disruption of genes in the network can interrupt normal development and cause diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-a chronic lung disease in preterm infants with morbid and sometimes lethal consequences characterized by lung immaturity and reduced alveolarization. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse exhibiting a moderate severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) at the onset of alveologenesis. Using approaches mirroring the construction of the model GRN in sea urchin's development, we constructed the IGF1 signaling network underlying alveologenesis using this mouse model that phenocopies BPD. The constructed GRN, consisting of 43 genes, provides a bird's-eye view of how the genes downstream of IGF1 are regulatorily connected. The GRN also reveals a mechanistic interpretation of how the effects of IGF1 signaling are transduced within SCMF from its specification genes to its effector genes and then from SCMF to its neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with WNT5A and FGF10 signaling as the bridge. Consistently, blocking WNT5A signaling in mice phenocopies BPD as inferred by the network. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD. Our network view of alveologenesis is transforming our perspective to understand and treat BPD. This new perspective calls for the construction of the full signaling GRN underlying alveologenesis, upon which targeted therapies for this neonatal chronic lung disease can be viably developed.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Hyperoxia (HOX) disrupts lung development in mice and causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in neonates. To investigate sex-dependent molecular and cellular programming involved in HOX, we surveyed the mouse lung using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and validated our findings in human neonatal lung cells in vitro. HOX-induced inflammation in alveolar type (AT) 2 cells gave rise to damage associated transient progenitors (DATP). It also induced a new subpopulation of AT1 cells with reduced expression of growth factors normally secreted by AT1 cells, but increased mitochondrial gene expression. Female alveolar epithelial cells had less EMT and pulmonary fibrosis signaling in HOX. In the endothelium, expansion of Car4+ EC (Cap2) was seen in HOX along with an emergent subpopulation of Cap2 with repressed VEGF signaling. This regenerative response was increased in females exposed to HOX. Mesenchymal cells had inflammatory signatures in HOX, with a new distal interstitial fibroblast subcluster characterized by repressed lipid biosynthesis and a transcriptomic signature resembling myofibroblasts. HOX-induced gene expression signatures in human neonatal fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells in vitro resembled mouse scRNA-seq data. These findings suggest that neonatal exposure to HOX programs distinct sex-specific stem cell progenitor and cellular reparative responses that underpin lung remodeling in BPD.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - The diagnosis of neonatal respiratory diseases is currently based on clinical criteria. However, lung structural information is generally lacking due to the unavailability of routinely applicable, radiation-free imaging tools as well as the time-consuming, often non-standardized manual analysis of imaging data. Increased efficiency, comparability and accuracy in image quantification is needed in this patient cohort as pulmonary complications determine immediate and long-term survival. We therefore developed an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks to perform lung segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences obtained in premature infants near term (n=107), with subsequent reconstruction of the 3-dimensional neonatal lung and estimation of MRI lung descriptors for volume, shape, surface, and signal intensity distribution. Annotation of lung segments in quiet-breathing MRI for infants with and without Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) was achieved by development of a deep learning model reaching a volumetric dice score (VDC) of 0.908 and validated in an independent cohort (VDC 0.880), thereby matching expert-level performance while demonstrating transferability, robustness towards technical (low spatial resolution, movement artifacts) and lung disease grades. MRI lung descriptors presented relevant correlations with lung lesion scores and enabled the separation of neonates with and without BPD (AUC 0.92+/-0.016), mild vs severe BPD (AUC 0.84+/-0.027), and single level prediction of BPD severity (AUC 0.75+/-0.013). Our work demonstrates the potential of AI-supported MRI markers as a diagnostic tool, characterizing changes in lung structure in neonatal respiratory disease while avoiding radiation exposure.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Background: Children living with chronic comorbid conditions are at increased risk for severe COVID-19, though there is limited evidence regarding the risks associated with specific conditions and which children may benefit from targeted COVID-19 therapies. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with severe disease among hospitalized children with COVID-19 in Canada. Method(s): We conducted a national prospective study on hospitalized children with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection via the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program from April 2020-May 2021. Cases were reported voluntarily by a network of >2800 paediatricians. Hospitalizations were classified as COVID-19-related, incidental infection, or infection control/social admissions. Severe disease (among COVID-19-related hospitalizations only) was defined as disease requiring intensive care, ventilatory or hemodynamic support, select organ system complications, or death. Risk factors for severe disease were identified using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for age, sex, concomitant infections, and timing of hospitalization. Finding(s): We identified 544 children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 60.7% with COVID-19-related disease and 39.3% with incidental infection or infection control/social admissions. Among COVID-19-related hospitalizations (n=330), the median age was 1.9 years (IQR 0.1-13.3) and 43.0% had chronic comorbid conditions. Severe disease occurred in 29.7% of COVID-19-related hospitalizations (n=98/330), most frequently among children aged 2-4 years (48.7%) and 12-17 years (41.3%). Comorbid conditions associated with severe disease included technology dependence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-2.95), neurologic conditions (e.g. epilepsy and select chromosomal/genetic conditions) (aRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.32-2.57), and pulmonary conditions (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia and uncontrolled asthma) (aRR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12-2.39). Interpretation(s): While severe outcomes were detected at all ages and among patients with and without comorbidities, neurologic and pulmonary conditions as well as technology dependence were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. These findings may help guide vaccination programs and prioritize targeted COVID-19 therapies for children.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal lung disease developing in premature babies characterized by arrested alveologenesis and associated with decreased Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression. One-week hyperoxia (HYX) exposure of newborn mice leads to a permanent arrest in alveologenesis. To test the role of Fgf10 signaling to promote de novo alveologenesis following hyperoxia, we used transgenic mice allowing inducible expression of Fgf10 and recombinant FGF10 (rFGF10) protein delivered intraperitoneally. We carried out morphometry analysis, and IF on day 45. Alveolospheres assays were performed co-culturing AT2s from normoxia (NOX) with FACS-isolated Sca1Pos resident mesenchymal cells (rMC) from animals exposed to NOX, HYX+PBS, or HYX+FGF10. scRNAseq between rMC-Sca1Pos isolated from NOX and HYX+PBS were also carried out. Transgenic overexpression of Fgf10 and rFGF10 administration rescued the alveologenesis defects following HYX. Alveolosphere assays indicate that the activity of rMC-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by HYX and partially rescued by rFGF10 treatment. Analysis by IF demonstrates a significant impact of rFGF10 on the activity of resident mesenchymal cells. scRNAseq results identified clusters expressing Fgf10, Fgf7, Pdgfra, and Axin2, which could represent the rMC niche cells for the AT2 stem cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that rFGF10 administration is able to induce de-novo alveologenesis in a BPD mouse model and identified subpopulations of rMC-Sca1Pos niche cells potentially representing its cellular target.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells represent a small population in the airway epithelium, but despite this, hyperplasia of NE cells is associated with several lung diseases, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The molecular mechanisms causing the development of NE cell hyperplasia remains poorly understood. Previously, we showed that the SOX21 modulates the SOX2-initiated differentiation of epithelial cells in the airways (Eenjes, 2021). Here, we show that precursor NE cells start to develop in the SOX2+SOX21+ airway region and that SOX21 suppresses the differentiation of airway progenitors to precursor NE cells. During development, clusters of NE cells start to form and NE cells mature by expressing neuropeptide proteins, such as CGRP. Deficiency in SOX2 resulted in decreased clustering, while deficiency in SOX21 increased both the numbers of NE ASCL1+ precursor cells early in development, and the number of cell clusters at E18.5. In addition, at the end of gestation (E18.5), a number of NE cells in Sox2 heterozygous mice, did not yet express CGRP suggesting a delay in maturation. In conclusion, SOX2 and SOX21 function in the initiation, migration and maturation of NE cells.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most common pulmonary morbidities in preterm neonates, which is more prevalent in males than females. Beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) is protective against hyperoxic lung injury in adult and neonatal wild type (WT) mice and in and mice lacking Cyp1a1gene. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that BNF treatment will attenuate neonatal hyperoxic lung injury in WT and Cyp1a2-/- mice, and elucidated the effect of sex-specific differences. Newborn WT or Cyp1a2-/- mice were treated with BNF (10mg/kg) or the vehicle corn oil (CO) i.p., from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 8 once every other day, while being maintained in room air or hyperoxia (85% O2) for 14days. Hyperoxia exposure lead to alveolar simplification and arrest in angiogenesis in WT as well as Cyp1a2-/- mice No significant differences were seen between WT and Cyp1a2-/- mice. Cyp1a2-/- female mice had better preservation of pulmonary angiogenesis at PND15 compared to similarly exposed males. BNF treatment attenuated lung injury and inflammation in both genotypes, and this was accompanied by a significant induction of hepatic and pulmonary CYP1A1 in WT but not in Cyp1a2-/- mice. BNF treatment increased NADPH quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) mRNA levels in Cyp1a2-/- mouse livers compared to WT mice. These results suggest that BNF is protective in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia independent of CYP1A2 and this may entail the protective effect of phase II enzymes like NQO1. Copyright © 2017.

AB  - Introduction: Caffeine is one of the most used drugs in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). It is widely regarded as beneficial in preventing many morbidities by reducing apnea of prematurity and improving respiratory functions. Method(s): Premature infants with gestational ages >25 and <32 weeks who were hospitalized in the NICU between 2008 and 2013 and survived up to discharge were retrospectively analyzed. Infants treated with prophylactic caffeine were compared with historical controls born in 2008 and did not receive caffeine treatment. Maternal and neonatal characteristics and common neonatal morbidities were recorded. Result(s): A total of 475 patients were analyzed. The patients receiving caffeine were classified as Group 1 (n = 355), and the patients not receiving caffeine were classified as Group 2 (n = 120). Despite the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome requiring surfactant therapy and a longer duration of respiratory support in Group 2, the rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and most other common morbidities were quite comparable. The frequency of apnea was statistically lower in the group that received caffeine prophylaxis (p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): In this retrospective cohort analysis, we found that caffeine prophylaxis significantly decreased apnea attacks however does not prevent respiratory morbidity such as BPD.Copyright 2023 Yavanoglu Atay, Kanmaz Kutman, Bidev, Bozkurt Kalyoncu and Oguz.

AB  - Background & Aim: BACKGROUND and AIM: The regenerative and anti-inflammatory potential of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) is well established. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a lung pathology developed by premature babies. In a rat model of BPD, our study found that MSC-EVs could prevent oxidative stress and fibrosis, the two distinct signs of the disease. To clarify the mechanism of action of MSC-EVs, in vitro experiments were assessed to test the efficacy of Good Manufacturing Practice-grade (GMP-grade) MSC-EVs against oxidative stress and fibrosis. Methods, Results & Conclusion(s): Methods: The fibrosis assay considered the use of primary macrophages isolated from rat bone marrow. After 7 days of TGFbeta1 treatment, alphaSMA and CD90 expressions were analysed by flow cytometry to test the anti-fibrotic ability of MSC-EVs in comparison with a positive control represented by TGFbeta receptor I inhibitor. Cells were analysed for profibrotic markers by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Human alveolar epithelial cells collected from healthy donors were used for oxidative stress assay. Cells were damaged by hydrogen peroxide and rotenone. The efficacy of MSC-EVs in restoring oxidative damage was investigated in comparison with vitamin C over 10 days. Immunofluorescence was used to analyse DNA oxidation and cell proliferation. Result(s): MSC-EVs inhibited alphaSMA induction and collagen deposition in macrophages more strongly than TGFbeta receptor I inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MSC-EVs were able to protect alveolar epithelial cells from DNA oxidation in a dose-responsive manner. MSC-EV was a better scavenger than vitamin C. MSC-EVs functioned by downregulating cell proliferation and subsequently repairing DNA damage. Conclusion(s): MSC-EVs can counteract the development of fibrosis and oxidative stress in BPD possibly interfering in TGFbeta activation.Copyright © 2024

AB  - Background & Aim: Mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) prevent the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in animal models and preliminary clinical studies. It is known from the literature that in this pathology that affect premature babies, the organs most affected by BPD are the lungs and brain. In an animal model of hyperoxia-induced BPD we studied the effects of MSC-EVs on the development of lung and brain oxidative stress and fibrosis. Methods, Results & Conclusion(s): Methods: Good Manufacturing Practice-grade (GMP-grade) EVs were produced by human Wharton-Jelly and were characterised according to MISEV2018 guidelines. Rat pups were divided into 3 groups: normoxia + PBS vehicle, hyperoxia with PBS, and hyperoxia with MSC EVs resuspended in PBS. Both PBS and EVs were injected intratracheally (IT) on days 3, 7 and 10 and pups were sacrificed on day 14. The expression of the profibrotic genes and concentration of glycosaminoglycans and the balance between the two types of alveolar cells were assessed in the lungs. The amount of oxidative damage was estimated by protein carbonylation assay and by quantifying the DNA oxidation. The effects of the hyperoxia were also evaluated at a very low scale: by TEM microscopy the changes in the ultrastructure of the mitochondria and of the lamellar bodies were assessed. Result(s): Pups with hyperoxia showed increased collagen deposition and profibrotic gene expression in the lungs. Both parameters were reduced after MSC-EV treatment. Glycosaminoglycan and surfactant protein expression in the lung epithelial compartment of MSC-EV-injected pups was improved compared with untreated animals. MSC-EVs reduced the effects of oxidative stress. Furthermore, MSC-EVs significantly reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels. Both pulmonary glycosaminoglycan and alveolar cell balance were significantly restored in MSC EV-treated pups compared with untreated animals. Moreover, by applying EVs, the properties of the organelles were restored to those close to those of normoxic samples. Conclusion(s): Intratracheal administration of clinical-grade MSC-EV inhibited the development of fibrosis and improved lung epithelial function in a neonatal model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. This model was approved by EMA and AIFA for a phase I study in BPD-affected children.Copyright © 2024

AB  - Background Mechanical ventilation is a cornerstone of managing respiratory failure in preterm infants. Whilst its role to improve the survival rate has been proven, it can also result in unintended harm.1 2 It can increase the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, neurological injury, and retinopathy of prematurity. Because of that, clinicians aim to extubate preterm infants as early as possible. 3 4 Given that approximately two-thirds of infants born before 29 weeks' gestation require intubation, an extubation checklist was implemented at the neonatal intensive care unit at Leeds General Infirmary hospital and St James hospital trying to improve the successful extubation rate. Objectives To identify if using the extubation checklist has helped to reduce the rate of unsuccessful extubation in preterm infants in neonatal units at Leeds general infirmary hospital and St James hospital. Methods * A retrospective cohort study of extremely preterm infants (<27 weeks gestational age) or ELBW infants (birth weight <1000 g) requiring mechanical ventilation during the period 01/01 - 30/06 in 2013 and 2018 (pre and postimplementation of the extubation list). * Successful extubation is defined as not requiring reintubation for 72 hours post-extubation. * Badger system was used to search for all patients who were admitted to LGI & St James neonatal unites during the 2 periods of 01/01/2013 - 30/06/2013 and 01/01/2018 - 30/06/ 2018. * Notes for the identified patients were requested from the archive. * Dates of extubation and re-intubation attempts were obtained from the notes Inclusive criteria * <27 weeks gestational age and/or birthweight <1000 grams * Born between 01/01/2013 - 30/06/2013 and 01/01/2018-30/ 06/2018 * Required mechanical ventilation during the same period. * The use of the extubation checklist in 2018 group Results Amongst the pre-checklist cohort, 24 babies met the GA/BW criteria, with 3 sets of notes unavailable. Of these, 15 patients received mechanical ventilation. There were 27 extubation attempts, 19 of these were unsuccessful and 8 of them were successful (29.6%). In 2018, 31 babies met the GA/BW criteria, with 4 sets of notes unavailable, 17 patients needed ventilation, 30 extubation attempts using the extubation checklist, 16 of these were unsuccessful and 14 of them were successful (46.6%) Conclusions * It was noted that the proportion of unsuccessful extubation attempts dropped by 17% (from 70.4% to 53.4%) after implementing the extubation checklist. * Extubation of extreme preterms is 1.6 more likely to be successful when extubation checklist is used.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic pediatric lung disease characterized by high airway resistance that results from neonatal hyperoxia exposure. Mechanisms underlying this hyperoxia-induced airway resistance are unclear. The Renin-Angiotensin System is a hormonal system active in the lungs that is initiated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and comprised of two pathways: the pro-developmental pathway consisting of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2) and the pro-fibrotic pathway mediated by angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). The Renin- Angiotensin System is implicated in multiple pathologic pulmonary processes but its role in the pathophysiology of hyperoxia-induced airway resistance is unknown. METHOD(S): C57 mouse pups were randomized to normoxic (FiO2 = 0.21) or hyperoxic (FiO2=0.75) conditions for the first 15 days of life with data collection on days 15, 20, and 30. Airway resistance parameters measured via plethysmography included peak expiratory flow (PEF), expiratory flow at 50% tidal volume (EF50), expiratory time (Te), peak inspiratory flow (PIF). Polymerase chain reaction and Western blot respectively measured mRNA and protein expression of ACE, ACE2, AT1, and AT2. RESULT(S): On day 15, hyperoxia animals demonstrated lower PIF and prolonged Te and, by day 20, significantly lower EF50 and PEF, indicating increased airway resistance. Day 15 Renin-Angiotensin System evaluation revealed lower ACE, ACE2, and AT2 mRNA expression in hyperoxia animals, accompanied by less ACE and AT2 protein and more AT1 protein. Hyperoxia animals continued to demonstrate less ACE and ACE2 mRNA and ACE2 protein on day 20, but there were no differences between groups in respiratory parameters or of any Renin-Angiotensin System mRNA or protein expression by day 30, with the exception of persistently low ACE mRNA and protein. CONCLUSION(S): Hyperoxia exposure resulted in abnormal Renin-Angiotensin System mRNA and protein expression that favored its pro-fibrotic pathway in our mouse model of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia. This change was associated with increased airway resistance, suggesting the Renin- Angiotensin System may have a causative role in the pathologic airway resistance of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.

AB  - Aims: Cytomegalovirus infection (CMVI) is a common cause of congenital infections and accounts 0.5-2.2% [NiclouxM.Etal, 2020]. The clinical course of CMV hepatitis varies from asymptomatic to severe cholestatic forms characterized by cirrhotic liver lesion. Aim(s): to search for the outcomes of cytomegalovirus hepatitis in children caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): There were analyzed 67 medical histories from the Multidisciplinary city children's hospital No3 in 2022 with confirmed CMVI by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction. Children were admitted in severe (70%) and moderate (30%) forms, and 80% of infants in the first year of life had comorbidities. The liver lesion was observed in 17 (25%) of 67 patients, which was manifested in all the patients by hepatomegaly in 58% or hepatosplenomegaly in 17% of cases. Icteric syndrome was observed in 5 patients with total bilirubin 255.7 micromole/l, direct 197.4 micromole/l. Result(s): The course of acute CMV hepatitis was favorable in 70.6% of cases. In 3 infants (17.6%) with partial biliary tract atresia, hepatitis was complicated by the liver cirrhosis: an enlarged abdomen with flatulence, a pronounced venous plexus of the abdominal skin, hepatomegaly (+12cm) and splenomegaly (+5cm), with diffuse changes of the liver parenchyma and pancreas. There was one patient with multiple organ failure, ascites, and bilirubin-enzyme and bilirubin-protein dissociation, subsequently the child died due to hepatic encephalopathy and hemorrhagic syndrome. The COVID-19 pandemic complicated course of CMV hepatitis was characterized by process generalization involving all systems. Respiratory organs complications may lead to death. There was pulmonary embolism due to congenital heart defects and bronchopulmonary dysplasia; in the second case the child with pneumonia with the 3 types of respiratory failure and inflammation markers with further development of multiple organ failure against the background of multiple central nervous system defects was noted. Conclusion(s): Prognosis of the course of CMV hepatitis are variable and depend on the promptness of therapy. The SARS-CoV-2 leads to multiple organ failure syndrome with the progression of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

AB  - Diffuse cystic lung diseases (DCLDs) are a diverse group of lung disorders characterized by the presence of multiple air filled cysts within the lung tissue. These cysts are thin walled and surrounded by normal lung tissue. In adults, DCLD can be associated with various conditions such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), Langerhans cell histiocytosis, cancers, and more. In children, DCLD is often linked to lung developmental abnormalities, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia being a common cause. Patients with pulmonary cysts are typically asymptomatic, but some may experience mild symptoms or pneumothorax. While DCLD in children is rarely due to malignancy, metastatic lung disease can be a cause. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the possibility of metastatic lung disease when encountering DCLD.Copyright © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background Pneumocytis jirovecii infection in preterm newborns has recently been associated with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Changes in the bacterial microbiota of the airways have also been described in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, until now there has been no information on the airway mycobiota in newborns. The purpose of this study was to describe the airway mycobiota in term and preterm newborns and its possible association with respiratory distress syndrome. Methods Twenty-six matched preterm newborns with and without respiratory distress syndrome were studied, as well as 13 term babies. The identification of the fungal microbiota was carried out using molecular procedures in aspirated nasal samples at birth. Results The ascomycota phylum was identified in 89.7% of newborns, while the basidiomycota phylum was found in 33.3%. Cladosporium was the predominant genus in both term and preterm infants 38.4% vs. 73% without statistical differences. Candida sake and Pneumocystis jirovecii were only found in preterm infants, suggesting a potential relationship with the risk of prematurity. Conclusions This is the first report to describe the fungal microbiota of the airways in term and preterm infants with and without respiratory distress syndrome. Although no differences have been observed, the number of cases analyzed could be small to obtain conclusive results, and more studies are needed to understand the role of the fungal microbiota of the airways in neonatal respiratory pathology.Copyright © 2024 Friaza et al.

AB  - Outcomes: 1. Describe caregiver decision-making experiences regarding tracheostomy placement in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, including from families that have chosen not to proceed with tracheostomy and families that speak Spanish. 2. Practically integrate caregiver perspectives and advice to improve clinical care for other families facing this decision. Key Message: Through this convergent mixed-methods study, we explore caregiver decision-making and advice regarding tracheostomy in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Caregiver perspectives reveal an educational gap in long-term lived experience with tracheostomy. Communication with other families, support from Palliative Care, and interactions with knowledgeable providers are essential to support decision-making and alleviate fears surrounding tracheostomy. Introduction/Context: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic respiratory disease that commonly affects preterm infants due to interruptions in pulmonary development. In infants with severe BPD, families often face the decision of tracheostomy placement, which is difficult due to unclear long-term outcomes, quality of life impacts, and associated financial and emotional burden. Method(s): We developed this convergent mixed-methods study using a logic model based on an existing framework of shared decision-making for children with chronic illnesses. It is comprised of semi-structured interviews and surveys of caregivers of children with severe BPD who were offered tracheostomy. Caregivers must be English- or Spanish-speaking and >/=6 months from decision. Interview topics include resources/information, involvement of palliative care, emotional well-being, and advice. Surveys include sociodemographics, system support, decisional conflict, health literacy, and caregiver burden. Two independent coders will analyze interview transcripts using grounded theory and will conduct subgroup analyses based on survey measures. Result(s): We interviewed n=8 caregivers: median age 32 years, 86% female, 86% Caucasian, 29% Hispanic/Latino, median decisional conflict score 15. Caregivers highly valued lived experience in their decision-making process and in alleviating fears surrounding education gaps, such as tracheostomy cares and impact on quality of life. Caregivers perceived providers' familiarity with these concepts to significantly affect their advice, and perceived Palliative Care to be a helpful support and advocate. Caregivers that postponed tracheostomy attributed this to hope for clinical improvement and fear of tracheostomy. Overall, caregivers found tracheostomy to improve quality of life and advise other parents of children with severe BPD to get a tracheostomy. Conclusion(s): Current educational efforts focus on acute implications of the decision regarding tracheostomy rather than long-term lived experience. Education on this, ideally from other families, is essential to tracheostomy decision-making from caregivers' perspectives. Palliative Care may be a team that could address this gap.

AB  - Case Report: Background: Management of thrombocytopenia in neonates depends on the signs, symptoms, and severity. Platelet transfusions are often utilized for severe thrombocytopenia (<30 x 109/L) and prior to procedures. Autoimmune causes may need use of steroids and IVIG. Generally neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia presents with low platelets at birth. Literature on use and efficacy of Thrombopoietin receptor agonists, Romiplostim in neonates and infants is sparse. Case Presentation:We report a 22 1/7 weeks, appropriate for gestational age male infant born to a G1P0 mother via c-section due to fetal malpresentation in preterm labor. Pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated and maternal serologies were negative. Infant's platelet count was normal at birth and mild thrombocytopenia noted in the first week of life. The physical exam was negative for skeletal defects. Initial course was complicated by surfactant deficiency, E. coli bacteremia and grade II intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus. At three weeks of life, infant's platelets were trending down (34- 113 x 109/L). He required multiple platelet transfusions with no durability. Workup was negative including, smear review, sepsis screening, imaging/doppler studies for thrombus and platelet antibody. Bone marrow evaluation could not be performed for extreme prematurity. He had been on steroids for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. He did not respond to two doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions. Baby has otherwise been thriving with tolerance to feeds, no active infection and extubated. After thirteen platelet transfusions with no significant improvement, we discussed the trial of Romiplostim and parents' consent. Romiplostim was administered subcutaneously; dose 1 at 1 mcg/kg followed by dose 2 at 2 mcg/kg a week later. Medication was well tolerated with sustained improvement in platelet count without need for further transfusions. Discussion(s): Our case highlights the use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in refractory thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions in neonates. It remains to be seen if the baby will maintain a durable response. Romiplostim causes maturation of megakaryocytes and increased synthesis and release of platelets without inducing neutralizing antibody. Its off-label use is reported in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, and post-transplant status. Systematic research is warranted to address its use in infants, dosing strategies, extended indications, optimum timing of initiation, and cost evaluation. Conclusion(s): Subcutaneous thrombopoietin receptor agonist for management of refractory thrombocytopenia in infants <1 year old is one of the promising approaches. Further, understanding of the impact of Romiplostim on the biology of the disease would inform its use, for consideration of long-term side effects like bone marrow fibrosis, thrombocytosis and leukemogenesis.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that newborn transgenic mice carrying the human CYP1A1-Luc promoter will display transcriptional activation of the human CYP1A1 promoter in vivo upon exposure to hyperoxia, and that these mice will be less susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury and alveolar simplification than similarly exposed wild type (WT) mice. Newborn WT (CD-1) or transgenic mice carrying a 13.2 kb human CYP1A1 promoter and the luciferase (Luc) reporter gene (CYP1A1-luc) were maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) for 7-14 days. Hyperoxia exposure of CYP1A1-Luc mice for 7 and 14 days resulted in 4- and 30-fold increases, respectively, in hepatic Luc (CYP1A1) expression, compared to room air controls. In lung, hyperoxia caused a 2-fold induction of reporter Luc at 7 days, but the induction declined after 14 days. The newborn CYP1A1-Luc mice were less susceptible to lung injury and alveolar simplification than similarly exposed wild type (WT) CD-1 mice. Also, the CYP1A1-Luc mice showed increased levels of hepatic and pulmonary CYP1A1 expression and hepatic CYP1A2 activity after hyperoxia exposure. Hyperoxia also increased NADP(H) quinone reductase (NQO1) pulmonary gene expression in both CD-1 and CYP1A1-Luc mice at both time points, but this was more pronounced in the latter at 14 days. Our results support the hypothesis that hyperoxia activates the human CYP1A1 promoter in newborn mice, and that increased endogenous expression of CYP1A1 and NADP(H) quinone reductase (NQO1) contributes to the decreased susceptibilities to hyperoxic lung injury in the transgenic animals. This is the first report providing evidence of hyperoxia-mediated transcriptional activation of the human CYP1A1 promoter in newborn mice, and this in conjunction with decreased lung injury, suggests that these phenomena have important implications for BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common lung disease in extremely preterm newborns. To date, biomarkers used to predict BPD have not translated to clinical practice. Our goal was to leverage bioinformatics and machine learning to identify early transcripts that could predict neonates at risk for BPD. Methods Used: A retrospective analysis of 97 very low birth weight neonates from Poland. Whole micro array data was downloaded from a publicly available site, normalized, and differential gene expression was calculated. BPD was defined according to Jenson Et. Al.'s definition in 2019. Supervised machine learning models were created in a training data set (70%) and evaluated in the testing data set (30%). Performance metrics were assessed by the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC), all under R. Summary of Results: Neonates who develop BPD were younger (median, 25.5 weeks versus 28.0 weeks, p < 0.001) and had a lower birth weight (705 grams versus 1120 grams, p < 0.001). Random forest and support vector machine had a higher AUC then neural networks and generalized linear modeling. A stacked model was built using support vector machine and forest that was built solely using 6 genes (CD4, PNPO, UNK, IL1RN, ABHD6, KCNMB1). Performance of this model was reached at 95% (CI, 87.5%-100%). Conclusion(s): Herein, we described a set of genes at day of life 5 that accurately predict BPD. These genes are associated with T-cell immunity, inflammation, and smooth muscle tone. [Figure presented] [Table presented]Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Case Report: Background: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by inefficient oxidative burst during phagocytosis associated with recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Organ systems usually involved are the central nervous system, respiratory tract, lymphatic, hepatic, osseous and integumentary. CGD is rare, affecting ~1:250 000 individuals. Curative treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The duplication of chromosome Xp22.2 is rare, it is x-linked recessive. Information on this genetic mutation is limited but is correlated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, congenital abnormalities, hypotonia, and cardiac defects. Physically patients have dysmorphic features, scoliosis in men, females have normal intelligence. Case Description: A 13-month-old male with history of a rare chromosome Xp22.2 duplication and concomitant CGD. His medical history is notable for extreme prematurity (26 weeks), communicating hydrocephalus, ventricular striate vasculopathy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale. Over the span of eight months the patient was admitted monthly due to recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal tract illnesses, in which he received multiple antibiotic courses. Recurrent respiratory illnesses were attributed to chronic lung disease with superimposed pneumonia. He later developed an enlarged submental lymph node. At this point, due to recurrent infections primary immunodeficiency work up was sent that was significant for an abnormal neutrophil oxidative burst test. The patient completed an antibiotic course for lymphadenitis, but the submental mass persisted. A core needle biopsy of the submental node was obtained and showed granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates with budding fungal elements. Cultures were no growth. He was treated with liposomal amphotericin B followed by voriconazole. The submental node continued to grow and therefore he underwent resection of the node. Repeat pathology report noted necrotizing granulomata with negative bacterial, fungal and acid-fast bacilli stains. Further genetic testing revealed a missense change in the CYBB gene that has been associated with X-linked recessive CGD. Discussion(s): This is a rare case in which comorbid conditions led to missing early diagnostic clues of primary immunodeficiency. CGD commonly presents with pulmonary infections; early on his complicated respiratory infections were attributed to comorbidities of extreme prematurity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. His genetic mutation and history of extreme prematurity skewed our differential diagnosis until he developed granulomatous lymphadenitis.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Perinatal inflammation increases the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm neonates, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Given their anti-inflammatory and regenerative capacity, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) are a promising cell-based therapy to prevent and/or treat the negative pulmonary consequences of perinatal inflammation in the preterm neonate. Therefore, the pathophysiology underlying adverse preterm lung outcomes following perinatal inflammation and pulmonary benefits of MAPC treatment at the interface of prenatal inflammatory and postnatal ventilation exposures were elucidated. Method(s): Instrumented ovine fetuses were exposed to intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS 5 mg) at 125 days gestation to induce adverse systemic and peripheral organ outcomes. MAPC (10 x 106 cells) or saline were administered intravenously two days post LPS exposure. Fetuses were delivered preterm five days post MAPC treatment and either killed humanely immediately or mechanically ventilated for 72 h. Result(s): Antenatal LPS exposure resulted in inflammation and decreased alveolar maturation in the preterm lung. Additionally, LPS-exposed ventilated lambs showed continued pulmonary inflammation and cell junction loss accompanied by pulmonary edema, ultimately resulting in higher oxygen demand. MAPC therapy modulated lung inflammation, prevented loss of epithelial and endothelial barriers and improved lung maturation in utero. These MAPC-driven improvements remained evident postnatally, and prevented concomitant pulmonary edema and functional loss. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, prenatal inflammation sensitizes the underdeveloped preterm lung to subsequent postnatal inflammation, resulting in injury, disturbed development and functional impairment. MAPC therapy partially prevents these changes and is therefore a promising approach for preterm infants to prevent adverse pulmonary outcomes.Copyright © 2024 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine

AB  - Case Report: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) belongs to the herpes virus family. It is ubiquitous and causes varying presentations in different age groups. Infections result in mild disease in older, immunocompetent individuals, but can be devastating especially if acquired congenitally or postnatally in premature infants <1.5 kg or <35 weeks. In this report, we discuss a case of one of the rare manifestations of CMV infection in a premature infant of 25 weeks who continued to have worsening respiratory symptoms unresponsive to multiple therapies in the NICU, eventually resulting in death. Methods Used: We performed a retrospective chart reviewalong with a review of the literature within PUBMED using the search words "Cytomegalovirus, Children, NICU, and Premature". Summary of Results: The patient is a former 25-week-old premature infant delivered via cesarean section for PPROM and vaginal bleeding, to a G6P4014 mother who was positive for Hep C, Trichomonas, and methamphetamine use. The infant, born with extremely low BW, was appropriate for gestational age. She needed intubation after delivery and transfer to NICU where she required mechanical ventilation with high oxygen concentrations. There she received surfactant and was placed on antibiotics for PPROM. The baby was being fed mother's milk. By the first week, the respiratory condition had not improved. Patient started developing signs of sepsis: electrolyte abnormalities and low blood pressure. Chest Xray showed bronchopulmonary dysplasia-like changes. Blood cultures came back positive for Staph. epidermidis and she received antibiotics. A head ultrasound, done at one week showed minimal echogenic periventricular white matter and bilateral IVH but no evidence of calcifications. By the third week of life, the respiratory condition continued to worsen despite multiple therapy trials including corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia was noted. Repeat sepsis workup was negative for bacterial and fungal pathogens in blood and tracheal secretions. Empirical antifungals had been started. The infant continued to deteriorate - ultimately requiring resuscitation. She was later placed on comfort measures and permitted a natural death after discussions with the parents. Autopsy showed signs of cytomegalovirus affection in lung tissue. CMV pneumonitis was diagnosed post-mortem. Conclusion(s): Congenital CMV infection is recognized as the leading cause of non-genetic sensorineural hearing loss in the US, and a cause of lasting growth and neurodevelopmental effects. Postnatally infected term infants are usually asymptomatic while perinatally infected preterm infants may develop end-organ disease such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, and thrombocytopenia. Differentiating congenital and postnatally acquired CMV beyond 2-4 weeks of life is difficult unless specific signs of congenital CMV exist such as chorioretinitis and brain calcifications, thus it is important to have a low threshold for urine CMV testing prior to 21 days of life. $F$Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a lung disease seen in premature infants who continue to require prolonged respiratory support at 36 weeks post menstrual age. Infants with BPD often have increased work of breathing (WOB) which leads to a prolonged hospital course. The measurement of WOB is difficult to measure in neonates, however it can be estimated. In neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA), a modified nasogastric tube with electrodes monitors the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). Swing Edi has been used to estimate WOB in neonates and is the difference between the resting tonic activity of the diaphragm (Edi min) and the peak activity of the diaphragm (Edi max). Swing Edi values in preterm and term infants have been described as average values ranging from 10 to 20 mV, but clinically at times we see that BPD infants may generate higher Edi levels. Our objective is to describe Edi values in preterm infants with BPD on NAVA since reference values have not been established yet. Methods Used: In this ongoing prospective observational study, Edi data is collected from preterm infants born <32 weeks gestational age with grades II and III BPD corrected to >36 weeks post menstrual age on NIV-NAVA or NAVA. Edi data are collected by downloading ventilator trends every 48-72 hours for 7 days. The chart datawas analyzed to describe respiratory trends and Edi values of infants who required respiratory support of NIV-NAVA or NAVA. This study was approved by the IRB at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Summary of Results: We report data collected from one infant in this ongoing study. This infant was born at a gestational age of 25 weeks 5 days corrected to 45 weeks 0 days post menstrual age breathing comfortably on invasive NAVA level of 3.2 cmH2O/mV and a PEEP of 12 cmH2O. During the 7 days of observation, the infant consistently remained in NAVA and required minimal time in back up pressure control ventilation. The mean (+/- SD) Edi peak was 18.2 (+/-10.3) mV and the mean Edi minimum was 5.1 (+/-4.1) mV. The mean swing Edi was 13.1 (+/-7.63) mV. Figure 1 demonstrates the mean Edi values. The infants Edi max values ranged from 0.37 mV to 66.8 mV and Edi min values ranged from 0 to 29.3 mV. There is high variability in Edi values seen in BPD infants consistent with variations in WOB seen at the bedside. The infant's capillary blood gas analysis was stable during the study period with an initial pH of 7.25, PaO2 of 65, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3) of 23 mEq/L, and a base excess of 1.3. Conclusion(s): Reference Edi values of preterm infants with BPD have not previously been reported. Here we report on an infant's Edi values as part of an ongoing prospective study to describe clinical Edi values seen in this population. This case will be used to help establish reference values for preterm infants with BPD receiving NAVA or NIV-NAVA. We hope these reference values can be used to as a guide to help direct clinical decisions when monitoring Edi values in BPD infants. $F$Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Incidence of hyperglycemia is reported to be as high as 80% amongst extremely low birth weight (EBLW) infants and is associated adverse outcomes of prematurity, including mortality. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a potentially debilitating lung disease with high prevalence amongst ELBW infants and is a major source of morbidity. This retrospective case-control study aimed to investigate the role of early hyperglycemia as an independent risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death in ELBW infants. Methods Used: We conducted a retrospective chart review of ELBW infants in a level IV NICU from January 2014 to December 2021. Data collected included patient demographics, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of BPD (defined as positive pressure or oxygen requirement at 36 weeks) or death before discharge. Factors differentiating the groups on univariate analysis were identified, and used to build a predictive model via logistic regression. Data was split for training (80%) and testing (20%). Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Summary of Results: A total of 137 ELBW infants were included in our clinical cohort. Median gestational age was 25.7 weeks (IQR 24.9, 26.6) and median birth weight was 790 g (670, 880). The range of serum glucose during the first 72 hours of life (HOL) was 20 to 262 mg/dL, with a median of 75.90 mg/dL. Those who met the primary outcome of BPD or death [n = 80 (58.4%)] had lower birth weight (BW), higher average glucose during the first 72 HOL, higher male gender prevalence, and lower incidence of infant of a diabetic mother (IDM) diagnosis (refer to Figure). Logistic regression demonstrated that average glucose over the first 72 HOL was higher amongst those who met the primary outcome (p = 0.01). After controlling for BW, IDM, and gender with multiple logistic regression, average glucose remained an independent risk factor (p = 0.04). The final model incorporating BW, gender, IDM diagnosi, and average glucose for prediction of BPD or death demonstrated an AUROC of 0.777, outperforming birth weight (AUROC 0.615) or gestational age (0.665) as predictive factors. Conclusion(s): Early hyperglycemia in ELBW infants is associated with an increased risk of BPD or death. Prospective research is warranted to further elucidate the role of hyperglycemia in BPD pathogenesis. [Table presented]Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Study: To evaluate the association between early eosinophilic inflammation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Methods Used: A search of observational cohort studies comparing eosinophilic inflammatory markers between preterm neonates with and without BPD was done by searching PubMed, Ovid, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles containing the key words "Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia" or "BPD" or "Chronic Lung Disease" and "Eosinophilia" or "TH-2 Cytokine Polarization" and "premature" or "neonate" or "VLBW" published with no data restrictions. Two independent reviewers conducted all stages of the review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Pooled odds ratio or mean differences were calculated using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Primary outcomes included rates of BPD (defined as the need for PPV or oxygen at 28 days of age) and eosinophilia (determined by peripheral eosinophil levels, eosinophil cationic proteins, and Th2 chemokines). Summary of Results: In total nine articles met inclusion criteria (n = 899 preterm neonates). 36% of neonates (n = 325) were diagnosed with BPD. The average gestational age and birthweight across the studies were 27.5 weeks and 1012 grams, respectively. Seven of the nine articles (77.8%) demonstrated a positive correlation between BPD and eosinophilia. As demonstrated in Figure 1, a significantly positive association between BPD andmean peripheral eosinophil countwas reported in three of the seven studies. Meta-analysis is currently ongoing. Conclusion(s): This systematic review suggests an association between early eosinophilia and the development of BPD. These findings may provide an early and targeted approach toward BPD mitigation/prevention. $F$Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Identify a set of genes that predict BPD from publicly-available whole microarray and RNASeq data. Methods Used: A secondary analysis of GEO DataSets that include whole microarray and RNASeq from human BPD studies. Studies of preterm neonates with a birthweight <=1,500 grams and who had transcriptomic data within the first week of life were included. Datasets were downloaded, normalized, and split into a training (70%) set and testing set (30%). After differential gene expression analysis, a random forest approach was used for feature selection. A neural network and gradient boosting model were built to determine the optimal combination of genes to predict the primary outcome of BPD. Genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) <5% were included for pathway analysis. Summary of Results: In summary, six datasets met criteria (n = 274 neonates). Five of the datasets (83.3%) generated data using cord blood or peripheral blood. Neonates whowere diagnosed with BPD (n = 115, 41.9%) had a lower median gestational age (26.0 weeks vs. 29.07 weeks p < 0.01) and birthweight (830 grams vs 1,269 grams, p < 0.01) compared to non-BPD neonates. After identifying 3,833 genes that were statistically significant, five were used in the machine learning models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting BPD were 72.7% and 75.0%. Gene ontologic processes associated with BPD included those involved with immunity, epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and programmed cell death. Conclusion(s): Two machine learning models were built in the first week of life of preterm neonates that moderately predicted those at risk for developing BPD.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a prevalent lung disease in extremely premature infants. Despite its prevalence, the clinical definition of BPD lacks consensus, which has hindered our understanding of its genetic underpinnings. To delve into the genetic aspects of BPD, we have harnessed high throughput sequencing techniques to pinpoint genes and biochemical pathways contributing to this disease. Methods Used: Our study involved analyzing RNA sequencing data extracted from the lung tissue of 13 baboons, equivalent to extremely premature neonates at 25 weeks of gestation. These baboons were divided into two groups: 6 healthy controls and 7 baboons with hyperglycemia-induced BPD. The RNA-sequences were initially aligned using STAR, followed by differential gene expression analysis performed with edgeR. Subsequently, we applied a filter to select genes expressed in every sample. These data were then normalized to counts per million and further filtered for counts less than one. Genes were considered differentially expressed if they exhibited an absolute log fold change of 0.5 or greater, a p-value less than 0.05, and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. Summary of Results: The average weight of the baboons was 376 +/-8 grams for the control compared to 390 +/-31 grams for the BPD cohort (p = 0.4). The gestational age was 127 versus 125 days for the the control and BPD groups, respectively (p = 0.07). Our DGE analysis revealed 26 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), all of whichwere upregulated in BPD. Notably, the top upregulated genes included COX1, SFTPC, MACF1, and EPAS1. COX1 is associated with cellular respiration, while SFTPC plays a crucial role in lung function by encoding a surfactant. MACF1 codes for a cytoskeletal crosslinking protein, and EPAS1 has been linked to vascular structure and oxygen transport. The DEGs were enriched for gene ontology processes, including regulation of cellular adhesion, developmental maturation, and cell-cell adhesion. Additionally, our gene set enrichment analysis indicated an upregulation of tight junctions and phagosome activity. Conclusion(s): Conclusion(s): Our study, utilizing highthroughput sequencing techniques in extremely premature baboons, revealed genetic underpinnings associated with BPD. Specifically, these genes are involved in cellular respiration, lung function, and cytoskeletal structure, contributing to our understanding of the complex molecular changes occurring in BPD-affected lung tissue and demonstrating biological and clinical plausibility.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common, chronic lung disease of infants. Presently, high oxygen exposure and mechanical ventilation considerably influence the development of BPD. To clarify the pathological mechanisms of this disease, we developed a hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model and investigated the role of CDKN1A in the pathogenesis of BPD. Newborn rats were randomly assigned to the hyperoxia (85% O2) and control (normoxia, 21% O2) groups. Lung tissues were collected on days 1, 3, 7, 14, or 21 after the start of hyperoxia or normoxia exposure. The expression of CDKN1A was detected by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and real-time PCR. Starting from day 3, CDKN1A mRNA expression was higher in the hyperoxia group. From day 7, the radial alveolar count was significantly different between the two groups, and on day 14, the hyperoxia group had high CDKN1A protein expression compared to the control group. These results suggest that increased CDKN1A expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD through alveolarization and lung retardation.

AB  - Background: Currently, there is a lack of effective treatments or preventive strategies for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pre-clinical studies with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have yielded encouraging results. The safety of administering repeated intravenous doses of umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) has not yet been tested in extremely-low-gestational-age newborns (ELGANs). Aim(s): to test the safety and feasibility of administering three sequential intravenous doses of UC-MSCs every 7 days to ELGANs at risk of developing BPD. Method(s): In this phase 1 clinical trial, we recruited ELGANs (birth weight <=1250 g and <=28 weeks in gestational age [GA]) who were on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with FiO2 >= 0.3 at postnatal days 7-14. Three doses of 5 x 106/kg of UC-MSCs were intravenously administered at weekly intervals. Adverse effects and prematurity-related morbidities were recorded. Result(s): From April 2019 to July 2020, 10 patients were recruited with a mean GA of 25.2 +/- 0.8 weeks and a mean birth weight of 659.8 +/- 153.8 g. All patients received three intravenous UC-MSC doses. The first dose was administered at a mean of 16.6 +/- 2.9 postnatal days. All patients were diagnosed with BPD. All patients were discharged from the hospital. No deaths or any serious adverse events related to the infusion of UC-MSCs were observed during administration, hospital stays or at 2-year follow-up. Conclusion(s): The administration of repeated intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs in ELGANs at a high risk of developing BPD was feasible and safe in the short- and mid-term follow-up.Copyright © 2024 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate neurological development of infants with transient premature hypothyroxinemia (THOP). Method(s): This prospective study included newborns who were born between 28-36 weeks of gestation (GW) and were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Newborns exposed to maternal thyroid disease, or with severe intracranial problems, and congenital anomalies were excluded. Infants with THOP were the study group and those without THOP formed the control group. The study group was subdivided into those receiving levothyroxine replacement (5 mug/kg/day) and those who were untreated. Neonatal demographics, and morbidities, including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were evaluated. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and ASQ:Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE) developmental screening tests were administered to the entire study population at the corrected age of two years. Result(s): Seventy infants were included in this study, 40 of whom had THOP. The mean GW was 34.4+/-3.8 weeks in the study group and 37.2+/-2.3 weeks in controls (p=0.69). Mean overall birth weight was 1640+/-428 g. Levothyroxine replacement was started in 12/40 infants (30%). The groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics. Rates of BPD and ROP were higher in the treated group (p=0.01). ASQ and ASQ:SE results did not differ between groups (p=0.75), nor did these scores differ between infants with THOP who did or did not receive levothyroxine (p=0.14). Conclusion(s): Although levothyroxine replacement therapy was associated with increased rates of BPD and ROP, this treatment did not appear to improve long-term neurological outcomes in this small group of infants with THOP. Prospective controlled studies with much larger sample sizes are needed to clarify the role of levothyroxine replacement in THOP.Copyright © 2024 by Turkish Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes / The Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology published by Galenos Publishing House.

AB  - Background: Premature birth is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The global incidence of prematurity ranges from 5% to 11% of all births. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of extremely preterm infants born below 29 weeks in our institution, with regard to survival and major short-term outcomes, and compare our results with national and international centers. This study is the first to be conducted in a private tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a retrospective descriptive cohort study that reviewed the medical records of preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at the International Medical Center, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between January 2014 and January 2020. We compared our results to the national data from King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center-Riyadh, King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC)-Jeddah and KAMC Riyadh, King Abdulaziz Medical City-Alhasa, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network, and the Canadian Neonatal Network. Result(s): A total of 92 preterm infants were included: 3, 8, 17, 17, 29, and 18 infants with a gestational age of 23 weeks, 24 weeks, 25 weeks, 26 weeks, 27 weeks, and 28 weeks, respectively. The mean gestational age was 25 weeks and 5 days. Fifty-four infants (58.7%) survived to hospital discharge. In terms of short-term outcomes, 13% had bronchopulmonary dysplasia, hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus was present in 27%, and retinopathy of prematurity was found in 13%, necrotizing enterocolitis was diagnosed in 5.4%, while late-onset sepsis was reported in 23.9% of infants. Conclusion(s): Our study represents outcomes of Extremely Preterm Infants in a single Private tertiary Care Center from Saudi Arabia with a comparison to national and international data. Though it cannot be generalized our data can be used as an add-value cohort toward establishing countrywide neonatal network to better plan regional resource allocation and utilization and facilitate ongoing audit, benchmarking, and overall quality improvement initiatives.Copyright © 2024 Journal of Clinical Neonatology  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Background The cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen may be used to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. Whether selective early treatment of large PDAs with ibuprofen would improve short-Term outcomes is not known. Methods We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating early treatment (<=72 hours after birth) with ibuprofen for a large PDA (diameter of >=1.5 mm with pulsatile flow) in extremely preterm infants (born between 23 weeks 0 days' and 28 weeks 6 days' gestation). The primary outcome was a composite of death or moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia evaluated at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. Results A total of 326 infants were assigned to receive ibuprofen and 327 to receive placebo; 324 and 322, respectively, had data available for outcome analyses. A primary-outcome event occurred in 220 of 318 infants (69.2%) in the ibuprofen group and 202 of 318 infants (63.5%) in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 1.20; P=0.10). A total of 44 of 323 infants (13.6%) in the ibuprofen group and 33 of 321 infants (10.3%) in the placebo group died (adjusted risk ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.90). Among the infants who survived to 36 weeks of postmenstrual age, moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurred in 176 of 274 (64.2%) in the ibuprofen group and 169 of 285 (59.3%) in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.23). Two unforeseeable serious adverse events occurred that were possibly related to ibuprofen. Conclusions The risk of death or moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age was not significantly lower among infants who received early treatment with ibuprofen than among those who received placebo.

AB  - Background: Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) therapies have shown prospects in preclinical models of pathologies relevant to neonatal medicine, such as bron-chopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been recognized as one of the most promising stem cell sources. Autophagy plays a key role in regulating intracellu-lar conditions, maintaining cell growth and development, and participating in the pathogenesis of BPD. Objective(s): To investigate the potential therapeutic role of ADSC-Exos on BPD and to illustrate the role of autophagy in this process. Method(s): ADSC-Exos was isolated from media conditioned of ADSCs by ultracentrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blotting (WB). Newborn rats were exposed to hyperoxia (90% O2) from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P7, and returned to room air until P14 to mimic BPD. ADSC-Exos was treated by in-tratracheal or intravenous administration on P4. Treated animals and appropriate controls were harvested on P7 and P14 for assessment of pulmonary parameters. Result(s): Hyperoxia-exposed rats were presented with pronounced alveolar simplification with decreased radial alveolar count (RAC) and increased mean linear intercept (MLI), impaired vascular development with low vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD31 expression, and stim-ulated inflammation with increased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6, and decreased expression of IL-10. Meanwhile, the rats with hyperoxia exposure blocked autophagic flux with lower levels of Beclin1, LC3B, LC3BII/I ratio and higher levels of p62. ADSC-Exos administration pro-tected the neonatal lung tissues from the hyperoxia-induced arrest of alveolar and vascular devel-opment, reduced inflammation, and facilitated autophagy. Intratracheal administration was more efficacious than intravenous administration. Conclusion(s): The intratracheal administration of ADSC-Exos significantly improved alveolariza-tion and pulmonary vascularization arrest in hyperoxia-induced BPD, which was associated with facilitating autophagy in part.Copyright © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Introduction: Cytopenias typically self-resolve, but can be recurrent, chronic, or refractory warranting further evaluation1. Case Description: A 30-year-old male with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension was evaluated for a 7-year history of pancytopenia and lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 410 cells/mL). Historical findings were white hair, Fitzpatrick type I/II skin, splenomegaly, asymptomatic malrotation of the small intestine and colon and heavy alcohol consumption. There was no history of recurrent infections. An older brother with improper lung development and oligohydramnios and a younger sister, with likely pulmonary hypertension requiring prostacyclin and Hirschsprung disease, died as infants. He has one healthy older brother, and healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. Discussion(s): Low absolute CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, NK (CD3 361, CD4 316, CD8 41, CD19 and 41 NK 8 cells/mL) cell counts with normal absolute naive and memory T cells was observed. Tetanus, diphtheria and pneumococcus titers were non-protective despite previous vaccination. Hair analysis was unrevealing, and the immune and clinical phenotype were not consistent with silver-hair syndromes. Telomere lengths and bone marrow biopsy were unrevealing. Whole genomic sequencing demonstrated a mutation in the forkhead box f1 (FOXF1) transcription factor which causes alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins and is usually fatal during infancy or childhood. A previously reported patient survived 56 months and only 2 other children survived longer than 2 years of age without lung transplantation2. There are no documented reports of FOXF1 associated cytopenias, but this case presents the possibility that immune dysregulation is a late finding.Copyright © 2023

AB  - OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Premature birth and its complications are among the largest contributions to infant death within the US. The rates of premature birth and infant death are significantly higher among African Americans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the biological and social drivers of this health disparities to improve birth outcomes. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: This is a retrospective cohort study of premature infants (< 28 weeks estimated gestational age, birth weight < 1500g) born within 2018 and 2021 to mothers who identify as either African American, or White/Caucasian Non-Hispanic and are cared for at Saint Louis Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. EPIC collected data will include maternal and fetal factors and social determinants of health (SDOH). ICD-9, ICD-10 codes for primary outcomes include grade 3-4 Interventricular Hemorrhage, moderate-severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, Stage 2+ Necrotizing Enterocolitis, and moderate-severe Retinopathy of Prematurity. Will develop a composite variable score using the SDOH for risk/no risk using that for each disease outcome and mortality. Will use Chi-square test or T-test to compare groups. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We are currently in the data collection phase of the study, but we anticipate seeing an increase in risk of all-cause morbidity as well as all-cause mortality for infants born to Black mothers compared to infants born to White mothers. We anticipate higher levels of disadvantage (increased area deprivation scores) and lower access to the goods and services deemed necessary for appropriate care of Black mothers and subsequent relation to outcomes for their infants. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Following analysis and assessment of that analysis we will discuss these findings and the impact on the general population and the needs for improvement and implementation of interventions upstream in the care of the vulnerable and special mother-baby-dyad population.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate the perinatal risk factors and correlation between bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 173 preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation with BPD who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Women and Children's Hospital of Qingdao University from June 2017 to July 2022. According to the diagnostic criteria for ROP, these preterm infants were divided into the ROP group (n=64) and the non-ROP group (n=109). Chi-square test, two independent samples t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the general data, treatment, and the incidence of complications between the two groups. Multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis was used to analyze the independent risk factors of ROP in preterm infants with BPD and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to analyze the predictive value of independent risk factors on ROP. The correlation between the severity of BPD and the incidence of ROP was analyzed. Results The gestational age at birth [(28.0+/-1.1) vs. (28.8+/-1.2) weeks, t=4.01], the birth weight [(1 075.9+/-141.4) vs. (1 143.2+/-168.6) g, t=2.68], the partial pressure of carbon dioxide [42.5 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) (34.0-51.0 mmHg) vs. 47.0 mmHg (39.0-54.0 mmHg), Z=-2.31], and the total fluid intake on the first day of birth [80.0 ml (72.3-88.7 ml) vs. 83.6 ml (76.6-92.8 ml), Z=-2.28] in the ROP group were all lower than those in the non-ROP group (all P<0.05). While the prothrombin time [15.7 s (14.1-17.7 s) vs. 14.6 s (13.1-16.7 s), Z=-2.17], activated partial thromboplastin time [64.7 s (52.9-77.9 s) vs. 55.8 s (48.4-68.9 s), Z=-2.12], the proportion of patients treated with pulmonary surfactant [71.9% (46/64) vs. 49.5% (54/109), chi2=8.25], the total duration of oxygen supplementation [50.5 d (40.0-64.0 d) vs. 45.0 d (37.0-52.0 d), Z=-2.77], the duration of invasive ventilation [5.0 d (1.0-11.0 d) vs. 1.0 d (0.0-5.0 d), Z=-4.03], the duration of noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy [(31.7+/-12.7) vs. (26.4+/-13.1) d, t=-2.59], and the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [76.6% (49/64) vs. 57.8% (63/109), chi2=6.22] were increased in the ROP group (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the proportion of BPD treated with corticosteroids between the ROP and non-ROP groups [60.3% (38/63) vs. 74.3% (81/109), chi2=3.67, P=0.055]. Multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that smaller gestational age (OR=1.599, 95%CI: 1.126-2.272, P=0.009), less fluid intake on the first day (OR=1.033, 95%CI: 1.004-1.062, P=0.024), and longer duration of invasive ventilation (OR=1.076, 95%CI:1.017-1.138, P=0.011) were independent risk factors for ROP in BPD infants, while glucocorticoid treatment was an independent protective factor (OR=0.378, 95%CI:0.173-0.827, P=0.015). Most patients with mild or moderate BPD did not develop ROP [64.6% (73/113) and 66.7% (34/51)], while those with severe BPD were more likely to be complicated by ROP (7/9) (chi2=6.84, P=0.033). Conclusions BPD infants with smaller gestational age, longer duration of invasive ventilation, and less fluid intake on the first day of birth are more likely to develop ROP, while glucocorticoid therapy can reduce the incidence of ROP in this population. Severe BPD may increase the risk of ROP in infants.Copyright © 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. We proposed a hypothesis that prognosis in preterm infants may be affected by concentration of the administered surfactant preparation able to determine its viscosity and, therefore, even distribution throughout the lungs. Aim(s): to assess an effect of poractant alfa (PA) administered at low (40 mg/mL) vs. standard (80 mg/mL) concentration without changing recommended dosage (200 mg/kg) on outcomes of preterm infants at gestational age (GA) under 32 weeks receiving various respiratory support. Materials and Methods. A prospective randomized controlled multicenter study was conducted. A total of 325 infants under 32 weeks of GA in five perinatal centers were randomized. The inclusion criteria were met by 264 patients: required respiratory therapy, had indications for surfactant administration at birth/within the first 30 minutes of life, and informed parental consent. Patients were excluded if they had no indications for surfactant preparations at the age of the first 30 minutes of life, had chromosomal and genetic abnormalities, congenital malformations, early neonatal sepsis, or gross deviations from the study protocol. Two groups were formed and compared: Low concentration (LC) group - PA concentration was 40 mg/mL (n = 111) and Standard concentration (SC) group (control) - PA concentration was 80 mg/mL (n = 153). Additionally, we compared two subgroups with surfactant preparation administered by minimally invasive methods in spontaneously breathing infants (using LISA - a less invasive method of introducing surfactant through a thin catheter or endotracheal tube): subgroup LC - PA concentration was 40 mg/mL (n = 27) and subgroup SC (control) - PA concentration was 80 mg/mL (n = 34). Results. It was found that development of pulmonary hemorrhages in LC and SC groups was significantly less common in infants who received PA at concentration of 40 mg/mL vs. 80 mg/mL: 3.6 (4/111) % vs. 13.1 (20/153) % (p = 0.008). While comparing subgroups with minimally invasive PA administration (LISA or endotracheal tube), we found that treatment with 40 mg/mL significantly decreased total respiratory therapy duration - 142 [70.0; 219.0] hours vs. 250 [141.0; 690.0] hours (p = 0.008), incidents of bronchopulmonary dysplasia - 4.0 (1/27) % vs. 29.0 (10/34) % (p = 0.009), length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit and hospital - 8.0 [7.5; 13.0] days vs. 14.0 [8.0; 33.75] days (p = 0.014) and 38.0 [26.5; 48.5] days vs. 50.5 [36.25; 62.5] days (p = 0.014), respectively. Conclusion. PA administered at concentration of 40 mg/mL without changing the recommended dose did not aggravate nursing of preterm infants at GA under 32 weeks. Minimally invasive PA administration at concentration of 40 mg/mL, lowered risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and when used in infants on mechanical lung ventilation, it lowered a risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. All the discussed findings require to be further assessed in large prospective, multicenter, randomized studies in large patient cohort.Copyright © 2023 IRBIS LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective: Evidence-based research has shown that golden hour quality improvement (QI) measures can improve the quality of care and reduce serious complications of premature infants. Herein, we sought to review golden hour QI studies to evaluate the impact on the outcome of preterm infants. Method(s): A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and SinoMed databases from inception to April 03, 2023. Only studies describing QI interventions in the golden hour of preterm infants were included. Outcomes were summarized and qualitative synthesis was performed. Result(s): Ten studies were eligible for inclusion. All studies were from single centers, of which nine were conducted in the USA and one in Israel. Seven were pre-post comparative studies and three were observational studies. Most included studies were of medium quality (80%). The most common primary outcome was admission temperatures and glucose. Five studies (n = 2308) reported improvements in the admission temperature and three studies (n = 2052) reported improvements in hypoglycemia after QI. Four studies (n = 907) showed that the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was lower in preterm infants after QI: 106/408 (26.0%) vs. 122/424(29.5%) [OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.97, p = 0.04]. Conclusion(s): Our study showed that the golden hour QI bundle can improve the short-term and long-term outcomes for extremely preterm infants. There was considerable heterogeneity and deficiencies in the included studies, and the variation in impact on outcomes suggests the need to use standardized and validated measures. Future studies are needed to develop locally appropriate, high-quality, and replicable QI projects.Copyright © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Neonates are highly susceptible to microbial infections which is partially attributable to fundamental phenotypic and functional differences between effector cells of the adult and neonatal immune system. The resolution of the inflammation is essential to return to tissue homeostasis, but given that various neonatal diseases, such as periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are characterized by sustained inflammation, newborns seem predisposed to a dysregulation of the inflammatory response. Targeted apoptosis of effector cells is generally known to control the length and extent of the inflammation, and previous studies have demonstrated that phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD), a special type of apoptosis in phagocytic immune cells, is less frequently triggered in neonatal monocytes than in adult monocytes. We concluded that a rescue of monocyte PICD could be a potential therapeutic approach to target sustained inflammation in neonates. The EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG) is shed in response to bacterial infection and was shown to mediate cellular apoptosis resistance. We hypothesized that AREG might contribute to the reduced PICD of neonatal monocytes by affecting apoptosis signaling. In this study, we have examined a cascade of signaling events involved in extrinsic apoptosis by using a well-established in vitro E. coli infection model in monocytes from human peripheral blood (PBMO) and cord blood (CBMO). We found that CBMO shows remarkably higher pro-AREG surface expression as well as soluble AREG levels in response to infection as compared to PBMO. AREG increases intracellular MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and induces cleavage of membrane-bound FasL through engagement with the EGF receptor. Our results demonstrate that loss of AREG rescues PICD in CBMO to the level comparable to adult monocytes. These findings identify AREG as a potential target for the prevention of prolonged inflammation in neonates.

AB  - Introduction: Various cytokines have been associated to the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm neonates. AIM: To establish an association between cord blood cytokines and BPD, so that they could be used, in clinical practice, as early markers of BPD. Material(s) and Method(s): Preterms less than 30 weeks gestational age, were analysed by ELISA microassay for venous cord blood IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and IL-10, and compared between the BPD and non-BPD groups. Result(s): One hundred and fifty neonates completed the study; 31 (21%) small for gestational age (SGA); 16 were deceased before 28 days of life; 36 developed mild BPD and 20 developed moderate/severe BPD. Elevated cord blood IL-8 was associated with death or moderate/severe BPD. SGA patients with moderate/severe BPD presented higher cord blood values of IL-8, lower IL-6 and IL-10 when compared with SGA without moderate/severe BPD; and higher IL-8 levels when compared with patients without moderate/severe BPD. Conclusion(s): These results support an association between cord blood IL-8 and moderate/severe BPD, independently of the intra-uterine growth; and the association of cord blood IL-6 and IL-10 and moderate/severe BPD in SGA preterm newborns. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Infants born very prematurely (<28 weeks gestation) have immature lungs and often require supplemental oxygen. However, long-term hyperoxia exposure can arrest lung development leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which increases acute and long-term respiratory morbidity and mortality. The neural mechanisms controlling breathing are highly plastic during development. Whether the ventilatory control system adapts to pulmonary disease associated with hyperoxia exposure in infancy remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that there would be age-dependent adaptations in the control of breathing in an established rat model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. Hyperoxia exposure (FIO2: 0.9 from 0-10 days of life) led to a BPD-like lung phenotype, including sustained reductions in alveolar surface area and counts, and modest increases in airway resistance. Hyperoxia exposure also led to chronic increases in room air and acute hypoxic minute ventilation (VE) and agedependent changes in breath-to-breath tidal volume and breathing frequency variability. Hyperoxia-exposed rats had normal hypoxic ventilatory responses, oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air, but greater reductions in SpO2 during acute hypoxia (12% O2) indicating reduced hypoxic sensitivity and/or hypoventilation due to diseased lungs. However, VE was increased indicating an increase in respiratory drive. Perinatal hyperoxia led to greater glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and an increase in neuron counts within 6 of 8 and 1 of 8 key brainstem regions controlling breathing, respectively, suggesting astrocytic expansion. In conclusion, perinatal hyperoxia in rats induced a BPD-like phenotype and age-dependent adaptations in VE that may be mediated through changes to the neural architecture of the ventilatory control system. Our results suggest chronically altered ventilatory control in BPD.

AB  - Objective To investigate the clinical application of multi-oil fat emulsion (SMOF) in preterm infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Methods Preterm infants with NEC admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in our hospital between January 2017 and December 2022 were retrospectively included. According to the type of fat emulsion used, they were divided into SMOF group and medium and long chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) group. The data of two groups were compared and analyzed. Results A total of 69 preterm infants were included, 34 in the SMOF group and 35 in the MCT/LCT group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the levels of total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, direct bilirubin, bile acid and gamma -glutamyl transferase (P>0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and total cholesterol (P>0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the C reactive protein level, procalcitonin level, and the time to normal C reactive protein (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in incidence of complications between the two groups, including parenteral nutrition-related cholestasis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and brain injury (P>0.05). Conclusions Compared with MCT/LCT, the application of SMOF did not show significant effect on liver function, inflammation, or incidence of complications (parenteral nutrition-related cholestasis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity) in preterm infants with NEC. Multi-center studies with larger sample size are needed for further investigation.Copyright © 2023 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Clinical Nutrition. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: SET domain-containing 5 (SETD5) is an uncharacterized member of the protein lysine methyltransferase family, a group best known for its ability to methylate their substrate and, by that, regulate gene expression. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in SETD5 are known to cause neurodevelopmental delay. We present two children with pathogenic variants in SETD5 and vertebral fractures with low bone mass. Individual 1: This 15-year old male of Caucasian and Chinese origin first presented with delayed speech, irregular sleep, learning difficulties and aggression during the first years of life. After a fall at the playground at the age of 8 years he was referred to the pediatric bone clinic, where x-rays showed mild scoliosis and vertebral wedge fractures at T11, L2 and L3. Bone densitometry (DXA) revealed reduced lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) with a Z-score of -2,3, a subtotal BMD for height Z-score of -2,5 and subtotal BMC for height of -3,1. Notable skeletal features were hyperflexibility of elbows, thumbs and wrists alongside bilateral clubfoot and pes cavus. Whole exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic heterozygous SETD5 variant c.1498C>T (p.Gln500*het) in exon 13. Since he fulfilled the criteria for paediatric osteopororis, therapy with zoledronic acid was established. Individual 2: This 13-year old male of Latin American origin was born preterm at a gestational age of 25 weeks with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchomalacia, larnygomalacia, bilateral inguinal hernia and unilateral renal hypoplasia. Brain MRI identified bilateral cerebellar hypoplasia. Aged 5, he had a febrile seizure. At the age of 13 years, he presented with persisting sternal pain with no evidence of trauma. Radiographs showed fissures of the sternum. Aged 14, following trivial fall, radiographs showed multiple vertebral fractures and anterior wedging of T6-T7 and possible fractures of T6 and T9 with suspected microfractures affecting the upper platforms of T5, T6 and T10. The DXA scan showed a low lumbar spine BMD with a Z-score of -1,9. As the criteria for pediatric osteoporosis was fulfilled, therapy with zoledronic acid was established. Whole exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic heterozygous c.1082G>A (p.Arg361Gln) variant in exon 11 of SETD5. Conclusion(s): The combination of SETD5-associated neurodevelopmental delay and low bone mass has only recently been described. Our two cases corroborate this association. Neither of the patient had other risk factors for bone fragility nor was there a family history of fractures. We explore mechanism of action to ascertain how SETD5 affects bone metabolism and results in bone fragility.

AB  - Foetal alcohol syndrome is a term describing the set of conditions caused by maternal alcohol consumption in pregnancy. A complete evaluation includes an assessment of the three key diagnostic criteria - central nervous system damage, growth deficiency, and characteristic facial features (microcephaly, small palpebral fissures, low nasal bridge, smooth philtrum, thin upper lip). A premature one-day-old female infant with dysmorphic features, in severe general condition, was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit due to respiratory distress and suspected heart defect. Hypotrophy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and both ventricular and atrial septal defect were diagnosed. The authors of this paper aim to raise awareness about the lifelong and irreversible nature of foetal alcohol syndrome, which significantly impacts various aspects of a child's life. However, it is also highlighted that foetal alcohol syndrome belongs to a small group of conditions that can be entirely prevented.Copyright © 2023 Mormul et al.

AB  - Introduction and Objectives Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) affects 45% of infants born at <=29wks, when prematurity interrupts lung development causing simplified alveoli, interstitial fibrosis plus airway and vasculature remodelling. Mechanical ventilation of the neonate is an important risk factor for the development of BPD. TGFbeta signalling is implicated in normal lung development and BPD pathogenesis yet specific functions of individual TGFbeta isoforms is unclear. Clinically, caffeine is used to treat BPD, yet the mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesize that caffeine functions to shift the balance of TGFbeta isoforms from TGFbeta1 to TGFbeta2, to promote conditions of healing. Methods Mechanical ventilation was modelled using the Flexcell 5000T system to impose 15% CMS, 1Hz on immortalised human bronchial epithelial cells (iHBECs) for varying amounts of time. TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta3 levels were measured by ELISA, western blotting and qRT-PCR. Scratch wound assays were used to investigate the effect of caffeine and TGFbeta2 on iHBEC repair over 24 and 48 hours. Results CMS increased TGFbeta1 and decreased TGFbeta2 expression, whereas TGFbeta3 was below the ELISA sensitivity. Caffeine had no effect on baseline TGFB1 or TGFB3 but increased TGFB2 mRNA time-dependently (maximal at 24 hours, 5.63+/-2.88). Caffeine reversed the effect of CMSinduced changes in TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 measured by western blotting: CMS induced TGFbeta1 (1.55 fold change+/-0.07) which was reduced by caffeine (0.98 fold change+/-0.23) and reduced TGFbeta2 (0.77 fold change+/-0.16) which was reversed by caffeine (0.90 fold change+/-0.12), with similar effects seen when measured by ELISA. Caffeine enhanced epithelial wound closure after 48 hours (62.5+/-2.45% wound closure vs 20 +/-2.6%), as did exogenous TGFbeta2 stimulation (51.4+/-10.2% vs 20+/-9.1%), and caffeine-induced wound closure was abrogated by SB431542, an inhibitor of TGFbeta receptors (10.7 +/-2.4% vs 27+/-3.3%). Conclusion Mechanical ventilation in neonates is thought to contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Our data shows that CMS has differential effects on TGFbeta isoforms, which can be reversed by caffeine, leading to increased TGFbeta2. We have also shown that caffeine promotes epithelial wound healing via TGFbeta signalling. These findings shed light on the mechanism of action of caffeine in prevention and treatment of BPD.

AB  - Introduction: The T-box 4 (TBX4) transcription factor is recognized as a risk gene in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). TBX4 is expressed within the lung mesenchyme in the developing lung and is required for lung branching morphogenesis. Genetic studies report that PAH cases with TBX4 mutations display an earlier onset of the disease. In addition, studies have reported carriers of TBX4 mutations with diffused alveolar development and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Currently, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of TBX4 loss-of-function (LoF) on later stages of lung development and predisposition to lung disease. Hypothesis: Lung mesenchyme Tbx4 deletion within the developing lung disrupts essential gene regulatory networks leading to abnormal postnatal lung development and susceptibility to pulmonary hypertension. Method(s): We have generated Tbx4 conditional knockout (Tbx4-CKO) mice in which Crerecombinase removes the exon 5 of Tbx4 within the embryonic lung mesenchyme, creating a null allele. To examine alveolarization, we harvested postnatal day 14 (P14) and 36 (P36) lungs and calculated mean linear intercept (MLI). RNA-seq was performed at both stages to identify disrupted gene networks in Tbx4-CKO lungs. RVSP was measured by right heart catheterization in six-monthold mice to evaluate for PH. Result(s):Tbx4-CKO lungs show increasing alveolar simplification at P14 and P36, as confirmed by increases in MLI of 24.8% and 34.4%, respectively. Tbx4-CKO mice show a statistically significant increase of 10.4% in RVSP, and preliminary analysis of vessel wall thickness suggests mild vascular remodeling in their lungs. RNA-seq analysis shows enrichment of pathways (canonical WNT, VEGF, and BMP signaling) and genes (Lgr5, Tnc, Wnt3a, Areg, Gdf2, and Bmper) relevant to lung alveologenesis, angiogenesis, and PH. Conclusion(s): TBX4 LoF affects lung alveolar development, similar to observations made in human cases with TBX4 mutations. The clinical presentation of such cases is broad, but our mice show features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, including alveolar simplification and PH. Further analysis of our RNA-seq data and planned single-cell analyses should provide insight into the role of TBX4 in alveolarization and PH risk.

AB  - Introduction: Due to the extreme immaturity of many internal organs, including lungs, infants at the limit of viability are more predisposed to a pneumothorax (PTX). In some cases, PTX becomes persistent. Previously, only a few attempts of PTX treatment with fibrin glue were reported. However, its impact on further lung development is unknown. Case report: We present a case of an extremely preterm infant with persistent PTX who was successfully treated with fibrin glue. In addition, we present a two-and-a-half-year corrected age follow-up focusing on respiratory problems, motor development and sensory organs. Furthermore, we touch upon the related ethical issues. Conclusion(s): Fibrin glue should be used to treat persistent PTX even in an extremely preterm infant. No adverse effects were observed. At the two-and-a-half-year corrected age follow-up, despite severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia development, no serious pulmonary problems were observed. However, the child's development is uncertain. This situation raises important ethical issues concerning saving the lives of infants at the limit of viability.Copyright © 2023 Magdalena Rutkowska et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Background: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is implicated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis, but clinical evidence is lacking. This study aimed to investigate LPA levels in preterm infants with and without BPD and explore LPA as a biomarker for predicting BPD occurrence. Method(s): Premature infants with a gestational age of <28 weeks or a birth weight of <1000 g were enrolled. Blood samples were collected at postnatal day (PD) 7, 28, and postmenstrual age (PMA) 36 weeks, and plasma LPA levels were measured using a commercial ELISA kit. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve analysis determined the PD 28 cutoff for LPA, and multivariable regression analyzed LPA's independent contribution to BPD and exploratory outcomes. Result(s): Among the 91 infants enrolled in this study, 35 were classified into the non-BPD group and 56 into the BPD group. Infants with BPD had higher plasma LPA levels at PD 28 (6.467 vs. 4.226 mug/mL, p = 0.034) and PMA 36 weeks (2.330 vs. 1.636 mug/mL, p = 0.001). PD 28 LPA level of 6.132 mug/mL was the cutoff for predicting BPD development. Higher PD 28 LPA levels (>=6.132 mug/mL) independently associated with BPD occurrence (OR 3.307, 95% CI 1.032-10.597, p = 0.044). Higher LPA levels correlated with longer oxygen therapy durations [regression coefficients (beta) 0.147, 95% CI 0.643-16.133, p =.034]. Conclusion(s): Infants with BPD had higher plasma LPA levels at PD 28 and PMA 36 weeks. Higher PD 28 LPA levels independently associated with an increased BPD risk.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Oxygen supplementation is life saving for premature infants and for COVID-19 patients but can induce long-term pulmonary injury by triggering inflammation, with xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP enzymes playing a critical role. Murine studies showed that CYP1B1 enhances, while CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 protect from, hyperoxic lung injury. In this study we tested the hypothesis that Cyp1b1-null mice would revert hyperoxia-induced transcriptomic changes observed in WT mice at the transcript and pathway level. Wild type (WT) C57BL/6J and Cyp1b1-null mice aged 8-10 weeks were maintained in room air (21% O2) or exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 48h. Transcriptomic profiling was conducted using the Illumina microarray platform. Hyperoxia exposure led to robust changes in gene expression and in the same direction in WT, Cyp1a1-, Cyp1a2-, and Cyp1b1-null mice, but to different extents for each mouse genotype. At the transcriptome level, all Cyp1-null murine models reversed hyperoxia effects. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified 118 hyperoxia-affected pathways mitigated only in Cyp1b1-null mice, including lipid, glutamate, and amino acid metabolism. Cell cycle genes Cdkn1a and Ccnd1 were induced by hyperoxia in both WT and Cyp1b1-null mice but mitigated in Cyp1b1-null O2 compared to WT O2 mice. Hyperoxia gene signatures associated positively with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which occurs in premature infants (with supplemental oxygen being one of the risk factors), but only in the Cyp1b1-null mice did the gene profile after hyperoxia exposure show a partial rescue of BPD-associated transcriptome. Our study suggests that CYP1B1 plays a pro-oxidant role in hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed lung function and respiratory health in an area-based prospective cohort of preschool children born very preterm., DESIGN: Lung function was measured by interrupter respiratory resistance (Rint) and forced oscillation technique (FOT) (respiratory resistance (Rrs8), reactance (Xrs8), and area under the reactance curve (AX)) at a median age of 5.2 years in a cohort of 194 children born at 22-31 weeks of gestational age (GA) in Tuscany, Italy. Respiratory symptoms and hospitalizations were also assessed., RESULTS: Mean (SD) lung function Z-scores were impaired in preterm children for Rint (0.72 (1.13)), Xrs8 (-0.28 (1.34)), and AX (0.29 (1.41)). However, only a relatively small proportion of children (14.5-17.4%) had values beyond the 95th centile or below the 5th. Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (n = 24) had slightly but not significantly impaired lung function indices in comparison with those without BPD (n = 170). In a multivariable analysis, lower GA was associated with worse lung function indices. Fifty-five percent of children had a history of wheezing ever and 21% had been hospitalized in their lifetime because of lower respiratory infections; 31% had wheezing in the last 12 months and this was associated with increased Rrs8 (P = 0.04) and AX (P = 0.08), and with decreased Xrs8 (P = 0.04) Z-scores., CONCLUSIONS: Irrespectively of BPD preschool children born very preterm had impaired lung function indices, as measured by Rint and FOT, and a slightly higher burden of respiratory problems than the general population. GA seems to be crucial for lung development. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that miR-155-5p can induce senescence of bone marrow stem cells by affecting mitochondrial fission, but whether it can affect the senescence of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and its mechanism are still unclear. To investigate its effect and mechanism, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from the umbilical cord tissue and passed to the P10 generation. The expression of miR-155-5p was found to be significantly increased in the P10 generation by RT-qPCR (P < 0. 001). The expression of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)and autophagy-related genes LC3 and Beclin-1 were decreased in P2 generation umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells when overexpressing miR-155-5p. Prediction by targetscan online database suggests that FOXO3's 3' UTR region has a specific binding site to miR-155-p. Dual luciferase reporter gene assays confirmed that FOXO3 is one of the target genes of miR-155-5p. Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of FOXO3, p-AMPK, LC3 II/ I and Beclin-1 proteins were significantly increased (P<0. 01 or 0. 001) and the senescence-related proteins p16, p21 and p53 were significantly decreased (P<0. 01 or 0. 001) when the miR-155-5p inhibitor was transfected into P10 generation umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. After staining for beta-galactosidase activity, we found that the expression of beta-galactosidase was significantly decreased in P10 generation umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transfected with miR-155-5p inhibitors (P < 0. 01). Gene expression and protein secretion levels of TGF-beta, HGF and VEGF were significantly increased in P10 generation umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transfected with miR-155-5p inhibitors and their cultured supernatants by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively (P<0. 05 or 0. 01). The bronchopulmonary dysplasia model of neonatal rat was treated with intravenous injection of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. We found that the P10 generation umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transfected with miR-155-5p inhibitors significantly enhanced the survival rate (P<0. 05) and significantly improved the pathological lung injury in neonatal rats. In conclusion, miR-155-5p affects umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell senescence through negative regulation of the FOXO3 gene, and miR-155-5p inhibitors reversed umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell senescence by increasing cellular autophagy through the FOXO3/ AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a common pathology of premature newborns caused by oxygen and mechanical ventilation, resulting in hypoalveolization and impaired angiogenesis [1]. It can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension (HTP-DBP) with excess mortality [2]. Celastrol has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and we addressed its potential therapeutic interest in HTP-DBP. Method(s): Different concentrations of celastrol (0.1-0.5-1 mg/kg/d) were tested in a murine model of hyperoxic HTP-DBP (14 days with 90% O2 - Hx). We evaluated hemodynamic parameters with echocardiography, lung remodeling with histological methods and pulmonary arterial (PA) reactivity with myograph. Cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2 + i) response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) was evaluated in human fetal PA smooth muscle cells (fPASMC) with spectrophotometry in normoxic (21% O2) and Hx conditions (48 h with 60% O2). Inflammation and oxidant stress were also addressed. Result(s): Celastrol reduces mortality at doses of 1 and 0.5 mg/kg/d compared to the Hx control group. At 1 mg/kg/d, it normalizes PAAT (PA acceleration time) and reduces vascular hyperreactivity to endothelin-1 (ET-1) inversely to phenylephrine and 5-HT, with no effect on the alteration of the response to acetylcholine induced by Hx. At all doses, it decreases right heart hypertrophy and vascular remodeling (wall thickness) but has no effect on media cells proliferation (pCNA staining) observed in Hx condition. It has also no impact on alveolization and vascular density (vWF staining). Although celastrol (0.1 and 0.3 muM) decreases the increased Ca2 + i response to ET-1 in hyperoxia in fPASMC, expression of ET-1 receptors (qPCR and Western blotting for ET-A and B) was unchanged. In fPASMC, celastrol 0.3 muM decreases the increased concentration of IL6 (ELISA) observed in Hx but has no effect on IL8 and MIF. It has no effect on the decrease of superoxide dismutase activity induced by Hx. In the murine model and fPASMC, Hx-induced oxidant stress remains mild with absence of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation. Conclusion(s): Celastrol has a preventive dose-dependent effect on some hallmarks of HTP induced by hyperoxia and could thus be considered as an interesting new potential therapeutic option for HTP-DBP.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most severe lung disease affecting preterm infants. Alterations in gut microbial communities can contribute to multiple lung diseases, but the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of BPD remains unknown. Despite previous research into the bacterial microbiome, a role for the gut fungal microbiome (mycobiome) in the development of BPD has not been previously reported. Method(s): To test if the composition of the mycobiome predicts the risk to develop BPD, we performed a prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate the fecal microbiota of very low birthweight infants (< 1500 g, n = 147). This study compared infants with BPD or the post-prematurity respiratory disease (PPRD), which encompasses none to mild BPD, by bacterial 16S and fungal ITS2 ribosomal RNA sequencing. To address the potential causative relationship between gut dysbiosis and BPD, we used fecal microbiota transplant in an antibiotic-pseudohumanized mouse model. Result(s): From the 100 infants from which gut microbiome samples were successfully sequenced, 65 eventually developed PPRD, 37 BPD, and 7 died prior to adjudication. Infants that developed BPD showed a clear fungal dysbiosis as compared to infants with PPRD (p = 0.032, R2 = 0.019, PERMANOVA, Fig. 1A. Differential fungal and bacterial genera with adjusted p < 0.05 by negative binomial regression are shown in Fig. 1B). Experimentally, on successful colonization in mice, the gut microbiota from infants with BPD augmented lung injury in the offspring of recipient animals; altering both lung structure (p < 0.0001, ANOVA mean linear intercept and p <0.001, ANOVA, radial alveolar counts) and function (p = 0.01, ANOVA, resistance; p = 0.008, ANOVA, compliance) as compared to PPRD-colonized mice. Conclusion(s): We present one of the first reports of the interkingdom microbiome in premature neonates. Our results from a human cohort and mouse model suggest differences in the intestinal mycobiome may proceed and anticipate the eventual development of BPD. Examining the interkingdom microbiome may be important to understand how the gut-lung axis impacts respiratory disease. Figure 1. Gut microbiota of premature infants.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of extremely premature infants. Airway injury, remodeling, and obstruction contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Modeling airway epithelial differentiation ex vivo is important, as samples from critically ill infants are difficult to obtain and airway disease remains an understudied yet physiologically relevant element therein. We previously reported that FACS-sorted tracheal epithelial cells from infants with evolving BPD have dysregulated expression of genes governing ciliogenesis and extracellular matrix molecule expression. Here we characterized growth and differentiation properties of BPD airway epithelia using an ex vivo organotypic airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture model. Method(s): AECs were isolated from tracheal aspirates from intubated premature infants (N=5, 22 4/7- 27 1/7 weeks gestational age) at the University of Washington NICU, and all patients enrolled later met criteria for BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Control AECs (N=5) were also obtained from healthy schoolage children (ages 6.5-10.5 years) intubated for elective surgery. Submerged AEC cultures were established using selective PneumaCult-EX media then differentiated at air-liquid-interface (ALI) for three weeks. Fully differentiated AEC cultures were stained with phalloidin and antibodies for anti- TubA4A (cilia), EPCAM (epithelial cells), and Vimentin (mesenchymal cells) before confocal imaging. Standardized quantifications of ALI thickness, cilia and cell counts, and % cilia on the apical surface were performed (Fiji, Prism). Result(s): Organotypic AEC cultures from patients with evolving BPD had an arrest in differentiation in our ex vivo model. The number of apical cilia was proportional to ALI thickness. Compared with control AECs, AECs from patients with evolving BPD had thin ALI layers, very few cilia, and disorganized actin staining (Figure 1). 89.5% evolving BPD AECs were positive for the epithelial stem cell marker TP63, compared with 48.5% of controls (p=0.0015). 18.4% of evolving BPD AECs were positive for vimentin, compared with 1.5% of controls (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): Organotypic AEC cultures from infants with evolving BPD have arrested differentiation including dysregulated ciliogenesis and increased expression of stem cell and mesenchymal markers. These findings suggest that abnormal AEC differentiation and/or regeneration after airway injury may play an important role in BPD pathogenesis. Future directions include longitudinal assessments of AEC phenotype and respiratory status in patients with established BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Oxygen supplementation is a common practice for patients presenting with hypoxemia. In premature infants, hyperoxia is harmful. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity are known complications. In adults, oxygen supplementation is presumed safe. Because hyperoxia can oxidize mucus and change its viscoelastic properties, we wanted to know if it would impair mucus transport. We were interested in this because of reports showing increased atelectasis in patients under general anesthesia who were given 100% oxygen compared to lower levels. METHOD(S): To measure the effects of hyperoxia on air trapping and atelectasis, we used an increasing dose of intravenous methacholine in pigs exposed to 21% or 100% oxygen for 30 min and acquired high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans. For each dose of methacholine, we obtained a total lung capacity scan acquired at 25 cm H2O and a functional residual capacity scan acquired at 0 cm H2O. We analyzed differences in lung densitometry in anatomically matched HRCT images using the free open-source software 3D Slicer. We mapped segments with air trapping and atelectasis by thresholding voxels with Hounsfield units less than -750 and between - 400 and 0, respectively. To measure the effects of hyperoxia on airway hyperreactivity, we exposed pairs of precision cut lung slices (PCLS) to either 95%O2/5%CO2 or room air overnight. We measured changes in airway surface area in response to increasing doses of methacholine. To measure mucus transport in vitro, we used human airway epithelial cultures grown at the air-liquid interface and exposed overnight to either 95%O2/5%CO2 or room air. We measured speed by tracking the movement of 2 mum fluorescent spheres and ciliary beat frequency. RESULT(S): In the presence of hyperoxia there is more air trapping and atelectasis. These findings can be explained by either increased airway hyperreactivity or mucus plugging of small airways. Increased mucus production or changes in mucus viscoelastic properties in the presence of hyperoxia may lead to mucus plugging. We found a blunted response to methacholine in airways of PCLS exposed to 95%O2/5%CO2 which indicates that the increased air trapping with hyperoxia may be secondary to mucus abnormalities. Hyperoxia does not increase ciliary beat frequency, but increases the speed of fluorescent spheres in airway epithelial cultures. CONCLUSION(S): Hyperoxia causes increased air trapping and atelectasis. Surprisingly, hyperoxia is protective against airway hyperreactivity. In future studies, we will investigate the effect of hyperoxia on mucus by measuring mucus transport in vivo and mucus viscoelastic properties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding lung alveolarization represents an opportunity to identify key factors for the development of new therapeutic strategies for structural lung diseases such as emphysema, fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. RATIONALE: The use of transgenic mice to analyze alveolarization in vivo is often limited due to a global lethal phenotype. Tools such as organoids or precision-cut lung sections miss key components, including breathing movementinduced stretch. These forces were incorporated to mimic the in vivo situation by developing an isolated, perfused, ventilated lung model in neonates to study alveolarization ex vivo. Tools such as gene editing and drug delivery can be also used in this model. METHOD(S): A setup for an ex vivo isolated ventilated and perfused lung model for neonates was established providing positive pressure ventilation. C57BL/6 mice aged between postnatal day (P) 4 to P 14 were ventilated through a microvent with tidal volume of 7mul/g body mass, a PEEP of 3 cmH2O and perfused through the pulmonary artery with cell culture media including growth factors and 4% albumin. Mice were ventilated and perfused continuously for up to 6 h in a temperature-controlled chamber, after which lungs were either fixed with formalin or frozen for histology and transcriptomic studies. A setup to provide negative pressure ventilation was also established, where mouse pups were ventilated with an inspiratory pressure of -7 cmH2O, end-expiratory pressure -3 cmH2O and perfused for up to 6h. RESULT(S): P14 mice resisted positive pressure ventilation better compared to P7 mice, and maintained lung structure without destruction. However, longer durations in the ex vivo setup lead to damage to lung structure at both ages. Optimization of PEEP and a reduced running time of 4 h resulted in less lung destruction and upregulation of P-selectin, Serpina3g,Serpina3f, downregulation of Zfp663, and deregulation of the TNF signaling pathway. Using negative pressure ventilation, lung structure was less damaged and generated a gene expression profile similar to positive pressure ventilation. CONCLUSION(S): An ex vivo ventilation setup for neonates was established, generating limited destruction of lung structure but with ventilation-related transcriptomic signature. Further comparison of in vivo to ex vivo ventilation and perfusion will reveal systemic factors missing and provide ways to improvise the model for future applications using longer ventilation and perfusion time-periods to analyze alveolarization ex vivo.

AB  - RATIONALE: Hox5 (Hoxa5, Hoxb5, Hoxc5) genes encode for a family of transcription factors that are critical for normal lung development. Loss of Hox5 genes in mice during embryogenesis or adulthood results in a bronchopulmonary dysplasia-like or emphysema-like phenotype, respectively. Altered expression of Hox5 genes may be related to the development of certain lung diseases, such as COPD, interstitial lung diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Changes in Hox5 gene expression may occur secondary to lung injury, a preceding factor of multiple lung diseases. METHOD(S): Hox5 gene expression in response to lung injury was analyzed in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, adult mice were administered a single dose of either saline or an inflammatory stimulus via oropharyngeal aspiration. Inflammatory agents used were porcine pancreatic elastase, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or bleomycin. Lungs were removed at time points associated with the peak (day 2-3) and resolution (day 7) of acute inflammation. In vitro, isolated lung fibroblasts from adult mice were stimulated for 6 or 24 hours with either saline or LPS. Expression of Hox5 genes was measured by RT-PCR of RNA from lung tissue or cell lysates. RESULT(S): We found that with each inflammatory stimulus administered in vivo, Hoxa5 expression was significantly decreased at days 2-3, with return to baseline expression at day 7. Expression of Hoxb5 and Hoxc5 was below detectable levels. In vitro, both the 6-hour and 24-hour LPS-stimulated fibroblasts showed decreased expression of all Hox5 genes. CONCLUSION(S): We found that multiple mediators of acute lung injury cause decreased Hoxa5 gene expression early after injury, which then returned to baseline expression by day 7 in mouse models. We recapitulated the findings in vitro using isolated lung fibroblasts. The downstream targets of Hoxa5 are unknown. The decreased Hox5 gene expression may be a protective or pathologic response to lung injury. Future studies will involve analyzing downstream signaling changes caused by decreased Hox5 gene expression in the lung.

AB  - Introduction: Pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe complication of preterm birth associated with high mortality and morbidity in the first 2 years of life. Incidence of PH is directly proportional to the severity of BPD. However, because the clinical signs and symptoms of BPD-PH overlap with that of BPD, a high level of suspicion needs to be employed to perform the tests to diagnose BPD-PH. Hence, the current clinical practice is to screen for BPD-PH via screening echocardiogram at 36 weeks in preterm infants with BPD. Early identification of high-risk preterm infants will help early diagnosis. In a hypothesis-generating study, we have identified a panel of 20 miRNAs in tracheal aspirate (TA) differentially expressed in BPD-PH compared to BPD. Objective(s): To analyze target miRNA panel's predictive value of in early salivary samples from 7 days old extreme preterm infants born < 28weeks gestation (ELGANS) Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study where we recruited 24 ELGANs. We collected saliva samples at 7 days of age and prospectively followed the clinical history of these infants. The samples were frozen at -80 C until analysis. The samples were them thawed, RNA extracted using Norgen miRNA purification kit and miRNA was analyzed using small RNA-sequencing libraries were prepared from 5-25 ng total RNA. The resulting high throughout sequencing data using QIAseq miRNA Library kit (QIAGEN). Of the original 20 miRNAs, only 16 were expressed in the 7-day old samples in our new cohort. Logistic regression was calculated for the 16miRNAs (Table 1) to calculate RUC area under the curve. We also investigated target molecules of these 16 miRNAs in an in-silico model (IPA Analysis). Result(s): Of the 26 infants, 12 of them were diagnosed with BPD-PH at term based on echocardiogram findings and 14 of them with Grade 2-3 BPD (2019 NICHD/NRN classification) but not BPD-PH. Logistic regression calculation (Table 2) of the 16 miRNAs comparing infants who went on to develop BPD-PH vs BPD at 36 weeks of PMA revealed area under ROC = 0.1 (Figure 1) with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100% respectively of predicting BPDPH in infants with BPD. The key molecules identified on IPA pathway are AR, MDM2, CDKN2A, ATM and TBRG1 (Figure 2) Conclusion(s): The panel 16 miRNAs in 7 days of salivary samples are potential clinical tools with have excellent predictive value for BPD-PH diagnosis at 36 weeks PMA (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common lung disease in premature infants. Inflammation during the early stages of lung development initiates BPD pathogenesis and damages alveolar Type 1 (AT1) cells, causing arrested alveolarization. The role of AT1 cells in inflammation is not understood. Moreover, current BPD therapies have adverse side effects, posing an unmet need for safe and effective treatments. L-citrulline is a naturally occurring amino acid that preserves alveolarization in various pre-clinical BPD models. Thus, we hypothesize that L-citrulline treatment will decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in neonatal AT1 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in vitro. Method(s): AT1 cells were isolated from neonatal rats on postnatal day 4 using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Cells were serum starved for 24h and exposed to LPS (5, 10, 25mug/mL), TNF-alpha (5, 10, 25ng/mL), or a combination of LPS and TNF-alpha (10 mug/mL and 5ng/mL) for 18h in vitro. L-citrulline (0.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.5, 10mM) treatment was added 1h prior to LPS and TNF-alpha exposure. Conditioned media was collected for cytokine and chemokine analysis by multiplex ELISA (Millipore RECYTMAG-65K). Result(s): AT1 cells exposed to both LPS and TNF-alpha produced a greater inflammatory response than those exposed to LPS or TNF-alpha alone. After 18h, AT1 cells from the LPS and TNF-alpha group increased the production of IL-6 by 243-fold, CCL2 by 34-fold, and CCL3 by 9-fold compared to control (all p<0.05, n=4). IL-1beta and IFN-gamma, and the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, were not detected in any experimental groups at this time point. In the presence of Lcitrulline, cytokine and chemokine production were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. At 10mM, IL-6 was decreased by 5-fold, CCL2 by 1.5-fold, and CCL3 by 9-fold compared to the LPS and TNF-alpha group (all p<0.05, n=4). Conclusion(s): This is the first study to characterize the response of neonatal AT1 cells to potent inflammatory stimuli in the presence and absence of L-citrulline. We show that LPS and TNF-alpha induce the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-6, CCL2, and CCL3 in primary neonatal AT1 cells, which is markedly improved by L-citrulline treatment. These inflammatory mediators are strongly associated with the development of BPD and are predictors of adverse pulmonary outcomes in neonates. If our findings can be translated to human infants, L-citrulline is a safe and well-tolerated therapeutic that may attenuate alveolar damage induced by inflammation during early development.

AB  - Rationale: Children with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are particularly sensitive to viral respiratory illnesses. Viral respiratory illnesses are often associated with bronchospasm that is miscast as asthma. However, compared to children without BPD, children with BPD are less atopic, have lower levels of peripheral eosinophils, and are less likely to be responsive to bronchodilators. Conversely, children with BPD secrete more macrophage and monocyte associated biomarkers. In children with BPD, the role of monocytes and macrophages in response to viral infection is poorly understood. Our aim was to improve our understanding of how monocyte and macrophage populations change in response to influenza infection in a mouse model and identify whether/how they correlate with disease severity. Method(s): Wild-type C57B6 mice were divided into a hyperoxia-exposed group and a normoxia group at post-natal day (PN) zero. The hyperoxia-exposed population was placed in 0.75 FiO2 chambers until PN 14 at which point they were removed from hyperoxia. Both populations remained in room air until PN 28 at which point they were intranasally infected with 80 plaque forming units of influenza A. Lungs were harvested before infection and seven days after infection. Flow cytometry identified tissue resident alveolar macrophages (CF64+, CD11+, Siglec F+), interstitial macrophages (CD11b+, CD11c+, CD64+, Siglec F-, Ly6c-), and infiltrating monocytes (Cd11b+,Ly6c+, CD64+/-). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was analyzed with ELISA and cell counter. Result(s): Prior to infection, hyperoxia-exposed mice had significantly fewer tissue resident alveolar macrophages and significantly fewer interstitial macrophages compared to normoxia mice. There was no difference in infiltrating monocytes. After infection, there was a decrease in tissue resident alveolar macrophages as well as interstitial macrophages in both the hyperoxia-exposed and normoxia populations. Hyperoxia-exposed mice had a relative increase in infiltrating monocytes compared to the normoxia population that reached statistical significance at seven days after infection (Fig A). Interestingly, this increase in inflammatory monocytes is associated with decreased morbidity. Hyperoxia-exposed mice had less weight loss compared to normoxia mice. They had fewer cells and fewer proinflammatory chemokines IL-18 and MCP-1 in their BAL fluid. Conclusion(s): We report an increase in infiltrating monocytes in previously hyperoxia-exposed mice when infected with influenza A. To our knowledge, no prior research has characterized macrophage and monocyte populations in hyperoxia-exposed mice after viral infection. This has the potential to advance our understanding of the inflammatory phenotype of children with established BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified genetic variants associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely preterm infants. However, findings with genome-wide significance have been rare, and not replicated. We hypothesized that whole exome sequencing (WES) of premature subjects with extremely divergent phenotypic outcomes could facilitate the identification of genetic variants or gene networks contributing disease risk., RESULTS: The Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) recruited a cohort of > 765 extremely preterm infants for the identification of markers of respiratory morbidity. We completed WES on 146 PROP subjects (85 affected, 61 unaffected) representing extreme phenotypes of early respiratory morbidity. We tested for association between disease status and individual common variants, screened for rare variants exclusive to either affected or unaffected subjects, and tested the combined association of variants across gene loci. Pathway analysis was performed and disease-related expression patterns were assessed. Marginal association with BPD was observed for numerous common and rare variants. We identified 345 genes with variants unique to BPD-affected preterm subjects, and 292 genes with variants unique to our unaffected preterm subjects. Of these unique variants, 28 (19 in the affected cohort and 9 in unaffected cohort) replicate a prior WES study of BPD-associated variants. Pathway analysis of sets of variants, informed by disease-related gene expression, implicated protein kinase A, MAPK and Neuregulin/epidermal growth factor receptor signaling., CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel genes and associated pathways that may play an important role in susceptibility/resilience for the development of lung disease in preterm infants.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants. Although mechanisms causing the abnormal lung structure found in BPD are poorly understood, prior work has shown that effecting either part of the Alveolar Type 2 (AT2) Epithelial Cell and Alveolar Fibroblast (AF) stem-cell niche produces alveolar simplification reminiscent of BPD. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-17~92 expression is severely attenuated in human patients who died from BPD and confirmed this in a murine disease model. Global deletion of miR-17-92 results in fatal neonatal respiratory failure from alveolar epithelial hypoplasia; however, the cell specific effects of miR-17-92 deletion on alveolar development are not known. Rationale: We hypothesize that miR-17~92 deletion in AT2 or AF will cause alveolar simplification reminiscent of a BPD-like phenotype. Method(s): We used an inducible, fluorescent, lox-cre system (miR-17~92flox/flox x ER-SPCCre x zs Green and miR-17~92flox/flox x ERPDGFR- alphaCre x zs Green) combined with flow cytometry, microscopy and bulk RNA-seq to characterize the impact of miR-17-92 in AT2 vs AF during postnatal alveologenesis. Tamoxifen administration on the day of birth allows for targeting cells prior to alveologenesis beginning on day 4. Result(s): Using a tamoxifen-inducible fate-mapping system, we achieved >98% of miR-17-92 deletion. With AT2-specific deletion, we demonstrated deficiencies in structural lung development evidenced by increased alveolar area that was not seen in AF-specific deletion. AT2-specific deletion caused upregulation in cell death and downregulation of lipid metabolism gene ontogeny processes. Conclusion(s): Our data supported the hypothesis that miR-17~92 deletion in AT2 cells produces alveolar simplification classically found in oxygen-induced BPD models. Likely related to metabolic failure and cell death, the AT2 cells' ability to trans differentiate into the alveolar type 1 epithelial cells, which comprise the alveoli walls, may have been compromised. However, the same effect on structural lung development was not found when the AF within the stem-cell niche was targeted. Pending transcriptomic data in AF-deletion will provide insight regarding developmental pathways differentially influenced by miR-17-92 based on cell type. This inducible, cell-specific model provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the biologic impact of miR-17~92 on alveolar development.

AB  - Background: Angiogenesis is a key driver of alveolarization, and disrupted angiogenesis and alveolarization is observed in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Aerocytes have been recently identified as specialized lung capillary EC that highly express the enzyme carbonic anhydrase-4 (Car4), and extend along the alveolus, intimately associated with alveolar type 1 cells. However, the temporal progression of aerocyte emergence and stimuli inducing aerocyte differentiation are not known. Further, how aerocyte phenotype is altered by injuries that disrupt alveolarization has not been explored. Method(s): Single lung cells were obtained from embryonic and neonatal mice at various timepoints under control conditions, and from mice exposed to chronic hyperoxia for 14 days and analyzed at P7 (acute injury) and P21(recovery). Flow cytometry to detect CAR4 and CD31 was utilized to analyze aerocyte abundance. Deep, platebased single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was performed via SmartSeq2. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to pathway analysis using Metascape. Result(s): In the embryonic lung, aerocytes represented only 1% of total lung EC. At birth, aerocyte abundance markedly increased, comprising 18% of lung EC at P1, and 27% by P7. Exposure to chronic hyperoxia increased aerocyte abundance from 22.5 to 36.3 at P7 and 25.3 to 38.8 at P14 via FACS (p value less than 0.001, n =3-4). Upon recovery, aerocytes remained elevated at 29% in P21 mice exposed to hyperoxia vs. 11% in control mice (P=0.04, n=3). In normoxia, most aerocytes were distinguished from general capillary EC (gCAP) by unique markers. However, in hyperoxia recovery, cells exhibiting an intermediate phenotype (iCAP) characterized by a combination of aCAP (e.g. Car4, Ednrb, and Igfbp7) and gCAP marker genes (e.g. Kit and Plvap), increased from 6% to 10%. Pathway analysis of DEGs in hyperoxia-exposed aerocytes identified an enrichment of up-regulated genes related to ATP synthesis and aerobic metabolism and down-regulation of caveola assembly, semaphorin signaling, and migration at P7. Upon recovery, these same metabolic pathways were down-regulated, and up-regulated pathways included positive regulation of angiogenesis and cell migration. Conclusion(s): Aerocyte abundance markedly increases after birth coinciding with the transition from the hypoxic fetal environment to the normoxic prenatal environment. Postnatal hyperoxia increases aerocyte abundance, and alters genes important for metabolism, migration, and cell guidance. Taken together, these preliminary data suggest that physiologic stimuli at birth (e.g. hyperoxia, cyclic stretch, blood flow) may be important drivers of aerocyte speciation and highlight the sensitivity of aerocytes to injury.

AB  - Rationale: Disease progression in BPD is characterized by decreased lactobacillus, increased proteobacteria, neutrophilic inflammation marked by matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) pathway activity and ECM breakdown resulting in tissue damage. We hypothesized that inhalation of live biotherapeutic AB1000 would attenuate neutrophilic inflammation in in vivo murine models of BPD lung injury. Method(s):1.Novel animal models: a) Gnotobiotic humanized mice model as published in AJRCMB (PMID:36287630) b) Hyperoxia/LPS double hit model as published in JCI Insight (PMID:29515035) c) miR129 KO mice by CRISPR/CAS.2.Animal experiments: a.All three animal models were exposed to normoxia (21% FiO2) or hyperoxia (85% FiO2) from PN3-PN14. Mice were treated with either a vehicle control or AB1000 intranasally. AB1000 composes three live Lactobacillus strains in a dry powder commercially manufactured with a fine particle fraction (FPF) that reaches deep lungs>73%. On PN14, pups were euthanized for BALF, lung tissue, blood, histology. Each group n=4-6. Neutrophil counts, MMP-9, CRP, NE, IL-6 and MPO, pulmonary function (Flexivent), RAC and MLI were measured.3.In vitro: a) Human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and A549 alveolar basal epithelial cell lines were exposed to Escherichia coli, LPS, or otherwise indicated and cultured in cell culture chamber with 85% O2 or 21% O2. b) Knock down or over expression of miR-129-5p: p-CMV-miR-129 (ectopically overexpressed) and miR-129 LNA inhibitor (knock down) were individually transfected at different concentrations into HBE cells by use of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. miR-129-5p and MMP-9 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR. 4.Human samples: In a cohort study, human tracheal aspirate (TA) samples were collected from patients with established severe BPD and from gestation-matched full term infants. MMP-9 and miR-129 expression in these samples were assayed by Duoset ELISA assay and qRT-PCR separately. Result(s): 1.Markers of neutrophilic inflammation were significantly reduced, lung structure and function significantly improved in AB1000-treated as compared to controls, in all models.2. Decreased miR-129 was associated with increased MMP-9 in BPD infants, in vitro cell lines, and BPD mouse model. 3.miR-129 over expression down regulated MMP-9 levels and miR-129 inhibition upregulated MMP-9 levels in a dose-dependent manner. Higher MMP-9 levels, worse lung function, and lower survival rates were observed in miR-129 knockout mice compared to wild type. Conclusion(s): Administration of live biotherapeutic AB1000 to the lungs of mouse pups reduced the neutrophilic inflammatory response in BPD through the mir129-MMP9 pathway. This suggests a role for LBPs as interventions for preterm infants with chronic lung injury.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a pattern of chronic lung disease in premature infants, is associated with increased mortality and respiratory morbidity. Currently, treatment for BPD is largely supportive. To find targeted therapies that specifically promote lung growth and reduce respiratory illness, a deeper understanding of in utero lung development and postnatal repair is required. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is essential for normal lung development, and aberrant Wnt signaling is linked to BPD in humans and murine hyperoxia models of BPD. Our group identified a Wnt inhibitory modulator, secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), as an important factor in early distal airway morphology. Genetic ablation of Sfrp1 in mice leads to dilated alveolar ducts and increased mean linear intercept, compared to wild type mice. We hypothesize that SFRP1 is important in normal lung development and that it is aberrantly expressed in a hyperoxic lung injury model of BPD. Method(s): Mouse lung tissue sections at 10.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5, 16.5, 17.5, and 18.5 days post coitum (dpc) were collected and stained with immunofluorescent SFRP1 antibody in order to localize SFRP1 at various timepoints in development. Publicly available single cell RNA sequencing data from embryonic mouse lung (12 and 15 dpc) were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench to detect Sfrp1 expression. Adult mice were exposed to 85% O2 for 3 and 5 days in a chamber (Coy Laboratory) and Sfrp1 expression in the lung was assessed via northern blot. Result(s): Immunolocalization studies reveal presence of SFRP1 in the distal airway epithelium and surrounding mesenchyme from 13.5 to 15.5 dpc. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed Sfrp1 expression is highest from 12-15 dpc, and almost entirely in mesenchymal cells. The majority of Sfrp1 expressing cells are Wnt2+ fibroblasts and adventitial fibroblasts. 3 and 5 days of exposure to 85% O2 led to upregulation of Sfrp1 compared to controls, and this was not seen in an acute inflammatory injury model or in a chronic smoke exposure model. Conclusion(s): Sfrp1 is expressed by mesenchymal cells, predominantly Wnt2+ fibroblasts and adventitial fibroblasts, between 13 and 15 dpc, corresponding to the pseudoglandular stage of lung development. Based on immunolocalization studies and sequencing data, SFRP1 may be involved in mesenchymal to epithelial signaling during development. In vivo studies reveal upregulation of Sfrp1 after hyperoxic injury in adult mice. Future studies will explore the expression pattern and function of Sfrp1 in a neonatal hyperoxic injury model of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a disease of prematurity related to the arrest of normal lung development. Whole lung proteomics was performed to identify individual proteins and pathways differentially regulated in BPD after the birth hospitalization. Method(s): Pediatric human donors aged 1.3 to 3 years were classified based on history of prematurity and histopathologic severity of BPD (N=3 "Recovered" BPD [rBPD] and N=3 "Established" BPD [eBPD]) with respective full term (N=6) age-matched controls. Lung tissues were biopsied (proteomics) and/or sectioned for imaging analyses. Proteins were identified by tandem mass spectroscopy requiring >2 unique peptide fragments for confirmation and validated using Western Blot. Highly multiplexed (18 antibody panel) immunofluorescence (MxIF) microscopy was performed on lung sections to enumerate cell types and validate proteomics results. Protein abundances and MxIF cell frequencies in the different donor groups were compared using ANOVA at a significance value of p<0.01. Cell type and ontology enrichment was performed using an in-house developed enrichment tool and/or EnrichR. Result(s): Proteomics detected 5746 unique proteins, 186 upregulated and 534 down regulated in eBPD vs. Control, with less proteins differentially expressed in rBPD. Cell type enrichment analyses (EnrichRcell type enrichment using the HubMAP Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers tables) suggested a loss of alveolar Type I (decreased SCEL, AQP4), alveolar Type II (decreased ABCA3, SFTPC), endothelial/capillary (decreased PECAM1, FCN3, FLT1, ACE, ERG, EDNRB), and lymphatics (decreased ADGRG3), and increase in smooth muscle (TAGLN, LDB3, PODN, ISLR) and fibroblasts (MFAP5) that were confirmed by MxIF. Immunohistochemistry also supported protein GO pathway analyses predictions of upregulated ferroptosis and coagulation in eBPD vs. Control. Finally, several extra cellular matrix proteins were increased (Col8A1, Col14A1, Col15A1 Col18A1,) in eBPD vs. Controls. Comparative MxIF analysis demonstrates variability in BPD. Conclusion(s): There are several dysregulated proteins and pathways consistent with abnormal lung development in eBPD. rBPD has simplified lung parenchyma but fewer differentially expressed proteins compared to full term. Highly multiplexed molecular analysis of human tissue provides critical contributions to elucidation of the factors after birth that define the trajectories of BPD that are important to preventing and treating their underlying causes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD) after preterm birth is associated with high late mortality and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Impaired alveolar and vascular growth with hypertensive remodeling are hallmarks of sBPD, which are features that overlap with the lethal developmental disorders, alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) that has been linked to loss of FOXF1 expression. As with sBPD, ACDMPV is causes severe respiratory failure and PH, and causes death despite aggressive cardiopulmonary therapies. Past studies of ACDMPV have shown that the "MPV" are prominent bronchial veins that reflect recruitment of intrapulmonary bronchopulmonary anastomoses (IBA), which connect the pulmonary vasculature with bronchial vessels. The presence of prominent IBAs have also been identified in fatal sBPD, but the potential role of impaired FOXF1 signaling in sBPD is unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: This 530-gm female newborn was delivered to a G1P0 female by an emergency cesarean-section due to eclampsia at 25 weeks' gestation. Her early course was characterized by profound hypoxemic respiratory failure with supra-systemic PH requiring invasive ventilation and PHtargeted therapies. Despite aggressive treatment, her course worsened, the family elected to redirect care and the infant died at 10 months. Clinical exome sequencing (ES) was performed before death that was negative for FOXF1 or related TMEM100 abnormalities. Autopsy showed histopathologic features consistent with both ACDMPV or sBPD (Figure A+B). Transcript levels of FOXF1 and TMEM100 was determined by real time-qPCR and compared to those of controls and previously diagnosed ACDMPV infants. FOXF1 and TMEM100 expression were dramatically reduced in the lungs of the proband, resembling levels in patients with genetic FOXF1 deficiency due to pathogenic CNV deletion. (FIGURE 1 C+D) DISCUSSION This case of an extremely preterm infant who died with sBPD and refractory PH had striking histologic features compatible with the diagnosis of sBPD or ACDMPV but had negative genetic findings for FOXF1. These findings suggest that impaired FOXF1 signaling in sBPD may contribute to the severity of disease in the absence of a genetic diagnosis of ACDMPV. Figure legend: Lung histopathology shows enlarged and simplified alveoli with double capillary layers (arrows)(Panel A) and severe arterial hypertensive remodeling with prominent thin walled vessels within the bronchoarterial bundles (Br: bronchiole, PA: pulmonary arteries) consistent with IBA and resembling MPV in ACD (arrows).(B). Dramatic decreased lung FOXF1 (C) and TMEM (D) expression in the proband to levels similar to that observed in ACDMPV patients with FOXF1 haploin sufficiency. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex mixtures of chemicals that are found in cigarette smoke, charcoal broiled stakes, automobile exhausts, industrial effluents, and superfund sites. Women exposed to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are at increased risk for premature delivery. Preterm infants often need supplemental oxygen, a known risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We earlier reported that CYP1A2 enzyme, which is liver-specific, has been specifically known to be protective against PAH-induced lung injury in adults. However, little is known about the effect of prenatal PAH exposure on the lung and intestinal microbiome and the role of the CYP1A2 enzyme in modulating these microbial communities. We hypothesize that the CYP1A2 enzyme protects against prenatal PAH exposure induced lung injury by maintaining eubiosis. Timed pregnant wild-type (WT) (C57BL/6J) and Cyp1a2 null mice were orally administered a PAH mixture of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) (7.5mg/kg each) or the vehicle corn oil (CO) once daily on gestational days 16-19. The offspring were exposed to room air or hyperoxia (80% O2) for 14 days after birth. Mice were sacrificed on postnatal day (PND) 15 and microbiome analysis was performed on the lung and intestinal contents using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Prenatal PAH exposure, followed by neonatal hyperoxia altered lung beta diversity and relative abundance of commensal bacteria in Cyp1a2-null mice but not in the WT mice. Interestingly, prenatal PAH exposure showed no significant change in the intestinal beta diversity and relative abundance of commensal bacteria in Cyp1a2-null and WT mice. Lung injury was also studied, and Cyp1a2-null mice showed greater alveolar simplification than WT mice exposed to PAH and hyperoxia. Our study suggests that prenatal PAH exposure may cause dysbiosis in the lung microbiome in the absence of the Cyp1a2 gene hinting towards a potential protective role.

AB  - Rationale: Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have impaired alveolar gas exchange due to alveolar simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. The major focus of our work is to unravel the mechanisms underlying secondary alveolar septation and how these processes are perturbed in BPD. Recent work has highlighted the role of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) in driving BPD pathogenesis. Here, we utilize a novel strategy to compare two different models of alveolar simplification by single-cell RNA sequencing to identify shared mechanisms of injury in BPD pathogenesis. Method(s): Here, we compare two models of alveolar simplification by histology, flow cytometry, flexiVent measurement of respiratory mechanics, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Model 1) Hyperoxia-induced murine model of BPD in which we treated newborn mice from P0-P10 with 75% oxygen. Model 2) Mice with loss of TGFb signaling in the lung epithelium, which were generated by crossing Tgfbr2 floxed mice to Nkx2.1-cre to delete Tgfbr2 in lung epithelium, and analyzed lungs at P40. Mice in each experimental system were analyzed by histology and lung physiology at P40, or during the first two weeks of life by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. Result(s): Both models of neonatal lung injury show significant alveolar simplification at P40 by lung histology, along with increased compliance and decreased elastance by lung physiology. Our single-cell RNA sequencing results demonstrate a profound loss of myofibroblasts in both models of BPD along with gene expression signatures of impaired proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased TGFb signaling in the lung mesenchyme. These results are further supported by impaired EdU uptake in fibroblast subsets during alveogenesis. Conclusion(s): These results support the hypothesis that TGFb signaling to the lung mesenchyme and impaired myofibroblast proliferation are critical features of alveolar simplification. We now seek to understand the temporal and spatial kinetics of cell proliferation in the developing lung, how impaired proliferation within the mesenchyme leads to alveolar simplification, and which molecular mechanisms and cellular crosstalk regulate these processes.

AB  - Background: Significant growth of the lung parenchyma and vasculature occurs after birth during alveolarization. Injury during alveolarization can impair lung growth and eventuate in pulmonary hypertension (PH), frequently observed in premature infants who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although the cellular response of the immature lung to acute injury has been wellcharacterized, the long-standing effects of injury on pulmonary vascular phenotype have not been previously delineated. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that single-cell RNA sequencing would elucidate distinct, durable alterations in the transcriptome and abundance of pulmonary vascular cells upon recovery from acute injury in an experimental murine model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. Method(s): Single lung cells were isolated from lungs of C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day 21 (late alveolarization) raised in either air (control; FiO2=0.21) or hyperoxia (FiO2=0.8 x 14d) followed by recovery in air (hyperoxia recovery-HR) and sequenced via SmartSeq2 at a depth of ~106 reads per cell. Cell type identities were assigned via Leiden clustering and known marker genes, differentially expressed genes identified, and cellular communication interrogated with receptorligand profiling via CellChat. Result(s): We identified 28 unique cell types from nearly 10,000 cells in both control and HR mice. Gene expression analysis found mural mesenchymal cells, and all endothelial cell (EC) subtypes except lymphatics, enriched for genes previously associated with BPD and PAH, such as Il1b, Postn, Cav2, Bmpr2. In HR, arterial EC abundance, assessed by bulk RNA-seq deconvolution, was increased along with an upregulation of genes that promote cell proliferation (e.g. Nono, Caprin1, Cep85), a downregulation of tight junction genes (e.g. Arcp1b, Actg1, Dynll1), and decreased Thbd, a gene encoding an anticoagulant protein decreased in patients with PAH. HR was characterized by alterations in intra- and inter-cellular communication. Specifically, interstitial macrophages (IM) altered signaling to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) and adventitial fibroblasts (AdF), including increased signaling between the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 and integrin alpha4beta, important for macrophage extravasation, and between Tnfsf12 and Tnfrsf12a, a pathway which promotes cell proliferation and migration. Venous EC exhibited increased cell autonomous signaling, including up-regulation of genes indicating enhancement of VEGF and endothelin signaling, key mitogenic and vasoconstrictive pathways. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that hyperoxia induces durable changes in pulmonary vascular phenotype that persist upon recovery, including alterations of pathways that may promote aberrant EC proliferation, muscularization, perivascular inflammation, and vasoconstriction, known hallmarks of BPD and PAH. We speculate that these data may identify novel mechanisms underlying the development of BPD-associated PH.

AB  - Rationale: Premature female neonates are less susceptible to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the underlying is unknown. We have shown remarkable sex-specific differences in the neonatal murine lung when subjected to hyperoxia. We hypothesized that distinct cell-cell communication patterns modulate the injury phenotype in the male and female lung. scRNA-seq was used to elucidate the sex-specific transcriptomic differences in different lung cell sub-populations and decipher the novel cell-cell interaction and receptor-ligand interactions in the male and female neonatal lung. Method(s): Neonatal WT (C57BL/6N) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-4: saccular stage) or room air and euthanized on PND7. Viable single cells were isolated by FACS at PND5 (n=3/gp). Library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Sequencing data were mapped to mm10 and quantified using GENCODE. Data normalization, doublet removal, cell type clustering, and marker gene identification, and hyperoxia response gene signatures were performed using Seurat. RNA velocity estimation was done using velocyto, then scVelo. Cell-cell communication was analyzed using Cellchat (version 1.4.0) on room air and hyperoxia samples. Result(s): scRNAseq identified 22 distinct cell clusters from 35,934 cells in both hyperoxia-exposed and control lungs consistent with distinct populations of endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. Upon exposure to hyperoxia, a distinct population of distal lung endothelial cells (reactive aCaps) predicted to be arising from the gCaP (general capillary) cells were identified. Between the immune and endothelial cells, in the hyperoxia-exposed lung, reactive aCaPs (sender)- interstitial macrophage (receiver) was identified as one of the main signaling networks (greater in females than males) with ligands involving Pros 1 (Protein S), Sema 6 (Semaphorin 6) and CD200, all of which are known to modulate the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages. Interestingly, (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Trail) and Cell adhesion molecule 1 (Cadm1) were identified as male-specific ligands upon exposure to hyperoxia from reactive aCaPs. Reactive aCaPs were also the main senders between the endothelial-epithelial cell interaction networks. Reactive aCaP (sender) and Lyz1+ AT2 (receiver) interaction were exclusive to the female lung and the number of interactions was greater in the female lung compared to the male lung. Semaphorin 3 was a female-specific ligand, while Tgf-beta was a male-specific ligand in this interaction. Conclusion(s): Cell-cell communication and ligand-receptor interactions are different in the hyperoxia-exposed male and female neonatal lung. Differences in cell-cell interaction may underlie the differences in disease phenotype with implications for human disease. (Figure Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bench and clinical data indicate that techniques for applying noninvasive respiratory support may vary in terms of effectiveness, application, and tolerability. We implemented a new nasal interface and flow-generation system for the delivery of noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) to replace previously used systems. Our goal was to determine whether there were significant differences in clinically relevant outcomes between our new method and conventional systems., METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of preterm infants requiring noninvasive respiratory support during our initial implementation of a new nasal interface (RAM), and compared these data with a historic control group. Demographic, baseline, and clinical outcome data were collected. Clinical outcomes and comorbid conditions were compared by using the chi-square test for categorical information and the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for quantitative data, depending on normality testing when using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to determine predictive factors for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia., RESULTS: There were no significant group differences in important comorbid conditions, invasive mechanical ventilation days (P = .16), or NRS failure within the first 7 d after birth (P = .10). Although there were no significant differences in the use of CPAP or noninvasive ventilation, settings with were significantly higher (P < .001) in the RAM group. There were more incidences of retinopathy of prematurity (P = .02) post RAM implementation, and the time to first reintubation was significantly shorter in the RAM group (P = .044). However, there were significant reductions post RAM in total days on any respiratory support (P = .009), total NRS days (P = .02), and supplemental O2 duration (P = .02). There was a trend toward reductions in bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates (P = .053), and the incidence of device-related tissue breakdown was significantly reduced (P < .001) post RAM. Multivariate logistic regression results showed the type of system (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.87; P = .032) and total invasive ventilation time (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99; P = .02) were predictors for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSIONS: The ability to apply continuous distending pressure through consistent application of NRS with the RAM cannula attached to a ventilator may improve clinical outcomes, including the duration of respiratory support and pressure-ulcer rates. The influence of this system on the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and the significantly increased retinopathy of prematurity requires further study.

AB  - Introduction:In 2017, the NIH recommended that obtaining a birth history be a routine part of care for patients of all age groups. Failure to do so may miss critical diagnostic considerations especially for patients with lung disease. In this case report, show the importance of screening for prematurity when completing diagnostic evaluation for pulmonary hypertension or interstitial lung disease. Case Summary:Ms. X, a 54 y/o female with Arnold-Chiari malformation, undifferentiated interstitial lung disease, undifferentiated pulmonary hypertension, and hypertension presented to our hospital from an outside facility after being diagnosed with PJP pneumonia. She was referred for lung transplant evaluation and additional work-up of pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease. She had previously seen a pulmonologist in 2017, and at the time her CT showed paraseptal emphysema with subpleural and basilar predominant reticulation. Her connective tissue disease serologies and alpha-1- antitrypsin levels were negative. Her only social risk factors were a 20 year smoking history and mold at her current place of work, but this exposure occurred after her initial diagnosis. Her echocardiograms from outside facilities were reviewed, and was significant for RVSP of 63, reduced right ventricular function, and reduced right ventricular size. As reduction in ventricular size is a common finding in patients born premature, this prompted further investigation of her birth history. She reported she was born 1 month premature and was diagnosed with "what baby Kennedy had", likely hyaline membrane disease. Further workup included a high-resolution CT chest and cardiac MRI which again demonstrated reduced biventricular size (Image 1). Based on her atypically late gestational age presentation of hyaline membrane disease, as well as later interstitial lung disease and PJP pneumonia, it was theorized that this patient had a surfactant metabolism gene mutation. Importance:Here we demonstrate the importance of a detailed birth history for patients with pulmonary hypertension or interstitial lung disease. Careful attention to abnormal findings in addition to evaluation of birth history can change the differential diagnosis drastically. Individuals born premature have shown distinct cardiac shape and volumetric differences when compared to term individuals. Additionally, prematurity alters pulmonary function, development, and exercise capacity when compared to term controls. As neonatal care practices improve, we expect to see a growing population of adults born premature who may have distinct anatomic and physiologic differences that put them at risk for developing lung disease.

AB  - Rationale: Lung function deficit has its origins in early life. There is limited understanding of the association between DNA methylation and lung function during childhood. Method(s): We measured whole blood DNAm using Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip from two childhood asthma cohorts: Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP; n=703, mean-age 12.9y) and the Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica Study (CRA; n=788, mean-age 9.3y) for discovery and replication of CpGs predictive of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), their ratio (FEV1/FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25-75/FVC)). Lung function trajectories were defined previously and examined in CAMP. We validated the findings in The Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) using cord blood DNAm (n=572) and investigated associations with asthma outcomes at ages 3 and 6y. Result(s): We identified several differentially methylated CpGs and regions (>=4-CpGs) for all lung function (FDR<0.05), trajectory and asthma (less stringent p-value<1e-03) outcomes. Of all, 990 CpGs and 9 regions for FEV1/FVC and 310 CpGs and 8 regions for FEF25-75/FVC overlapped between CAMP and CRA; majority were hypermethylated and showed consistent direction of effect (99.6%). Six CpG-associations with FEV1/FVC from CAMP and CRA also validated in VDAART predictive of asthma outcome at age 6 only mapping to MED25, NOLC1, SWAP70, GPI, RALA, ROR1 genes and implicated in allergic asthma and eosinophilia from EWAS catalogue. Top significantly enriched disease terms included vital capacity, inflammatory disorders, and smoking behaviors whereas Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia was unique to CRA. Top enriched pathways included Cholinergic synapse, Sphingolipid signaling, Phosphatidylinositol signaling, Tcell receptor and PI3K-Akt signaling for hyper-methylated CpGs and Rap1 signaling and adherens junction for hypomethylated CpGs. Conclusion(s): Patterns of lung function associated with DNA methylation at birth and during childhood provide mechanistic insights into fetal programming and potential targets for preventative interventions against lung function decline and asthma progression.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung condition in premature infants secondary to impaired lung development. Lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is an emerging technology for diagnosis and monitoring of neonatal lung diseases due to easy availability, portability, and lack of radiation. Several studies have described abnormalities in lung aeration patterns via lung ultrasound scores (LUS) for patients with BPD. However, there are no studies that assess LUS in BPD patients beyond the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization. OBJECTIVE(S): We aim to describe lung ultrasound findings in the outpatient setting for patients with and without a history of BPD, and to assess the impact of age and BPD severity on lung ultrasound scores. METHOD(S): We enrolled patients in a cross-sectional study to investigate how lung ultrasound scores vary for children with BPD after discharge. - Eligibility: Patients with a history of prematurity <32 weeks underwent lung ultrasound between ages of 36 weeks to 24 months old CGA (corrected gestational age). Ultrasounds were also performed on a control group of full-term patients without BPD. Infants with congenital malformations or genetic syndromes were excluded. - Study Design: Patients were grouped into 5 categories based on BPD severity (full-term, preterm no BPD, Grade 1 BPD, Grade 2 BPD, and Grade 3 BPD). We aim to scan a total of 120 patients, with 24 patients in each BPD severity group. We recruited patients from the NICU follow up clinic and pediatric pulmonology clinic, as well as the general pediatric clinics for healthy term infants. - Procedure: Lung ultrasound was performed using a handheld linear ultrasound probe to assess three lung zones in each lung (upper anterior, lower anterior, and lateral). Each patient was only scanned once during the study period. - Analysis: Lung ultrasound images were analyzed by two blinded investigators and graded from 0-3 based on lung patterns. The scores from all 6 zones were added for a total lung ultrasound score between 0 and 18. Data pertaining to patient demographics, perinatal period, and prior respiratory support were collected from retrospective chart review and analyzed. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: 60 subjects have been enrolled, to date. Our findings show that LUS is higher for children with Grade 2-3 BPD (avg LUS of 3.33), compared to healthy term children (avg LUS of 0.25). However, there was no significant difference in LUS between the various age groups. Further details from the analysis will be presented and discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a complication of preterm birth associated affecting 10,000-15,000 infants born preterm each year. Incidence and severity of BPD is inversely proportional to the gestational age at birth. However, the diagnosis of BPD is only made at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and while some clinical parameters such as respiratory support of invasive mechanical ventilation at 7 days of age have some predictive value, there is no biochemical markers shown to predict development of BPD at 36 weeks PMA. Early identification of high-risk preterm infants will help guidance clinicians and families. We have identified a panel of 20 miRNAs in tracheal aspirate (TA) differentially expressed in BPD when compared to term infants in a previous study. Objective(s): To analyze previously identified miRNA panel's predictive value of in early salivary samples obtained from 7 days old extreme preterm infants Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study where we recruited 24 infants born extremely premature (less than 28 weeks of gestation). We collected saliva samples at 7 days of age and prospectively followed the clinical history of these infants. The samples were frozen at -80 C until analysis. The samples were them thawed, RNA extracted using Norgen miRNA purification kit and miRNA was analyzed using small RNA-sequencing libraries were prepared from 5-25 ng total RNA. The resulting high throughout sequencing data using QIAseq miRNA Library kit (QIAGEN). Of the original 20 miRNAs, only 16 were expressed in the 7 day old samples in our new cohort. Logistic regression was calculated for the 16miRNAs (hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-542-3p, has-miR-624-5p, hsa-miR-183- 5p, hsa-miR-3131, hsa-miR-501-3p, hsa-miR-101-3p, has-miR-101-5p, hsa-miR-3128, hsa-miR- 128-3p, hsa-miR-628-3p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-1255b-5p, hsa-miR-205-5p, hsa-let-7i-3p, haslet- 7i-5p) to calculate RUC area under the curve. Result(s): Of the 24 infants, 14 of them were diagnosed with BPD at 36 weeks PMA (Grade 1,2 and 3 based on 2019 NICHD/NRN classification) and 10 of them did not develop BPD. Logistic regression calculation (Table 1) of the 16 miRNAs comparing infants who went on to develop BPD-PH vs BPD at 36 weeks of PMA revealed area under ROC = 0.1 (Figure 1) with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100% respectively of predicting BPD-PH in those with high risk of developing BPD. Conclusion(s): The panel 16 miRNAs in 7 days of salivary samples are potential clinical tools with have excellent predictive value for BPD diagnosis at 36 weeks PMA. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction MIRAGE syndrome refers to a multisystem disorder resulting from variants in SAMD9 gene involving Myelodysplasia, Infection, Restriction of growth, Adrenal hypoplasia, Genital phenotypes and Enteropathy. We present challenging case of MIRAGE syndrome focusing on the pulmonary perspective. Description of case report A 4-week-old female infant former 30-week premature with bronchopulmonary dysplasia admitted to the NICU for respiratory distress and dysmorphic features. Her birth history was significant for severe intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios. Patient required intubation for respiratory distress complicated by E. coli sepsis/meningitis and metabolic abnormalities. Physical exam revealed posteriorly rotated ears, down slanting palpebral fissures and arachnodactyly. Microarray was normal. Exome sequencing revealed de novo pathogenic variant in SAMD9 causing MIRAGE syndrome, as well as a maternally inherited pathogenic variant in MYH7 associated with autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy. She presented with recurrent urinary infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, restriction of growth, thinning of the corpus callosum, primary adrenal insufficiency, auditory neuropathy, enteropathy (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, chronic diarrhea, and severe diaper rash) but normal genitalia. Serial echocardiograms showed no signs of cardiomyopathy nor pulmonary hypertension. Patient was successfully extubated and transitioned to a high-flow nasal cannula and eventually weaning to wall oxygen at four months of life. Unfortunately, she had a cardiorespiratory event secondary to aspiration pneumonia requiring emergent intubation at 5 months of age. A sleep study revealed central and obstructive sleep apnea. Airway evaluation showed no abnormalities. Significant apneic events lead to a tracheostomy placement and mechanical ventilation for airway stabilization and apnea control. Patient required IVIG for bacterial infections as well as prophylactic antibiotic. As a result of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatic enzymes were administered. Brain MRI showed decreased white matter volume. Discussion MIRAGE syndrome is a multisystem disorder initially described by Narumi et al in 2016 with variety of phenotypes. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to diagnose MIRAGE syndrome based on a history and physical examination. However, the definitive diagnosis relies on whole exome sequencing. This case is unique due to the pulmonary manifestation such as prematurity, chronic lung disease, tracheostomy and ventilator dependency, central and obstructive sleep apnea along with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Respiratory management mainly focus on supportive interventions, airway clearance, early recognition and treatment of sleep apnea and prevention and management of respiratory infections. Even though, the prognosis is uncertain, it's vital to have a multidisciplinary team to provide adequate follow-up.

AB  - Background: Premature infants can develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of infancy characterized by an arrest of secondary septation, compromised angiogenesis, and, often, pulmonary hypertension (PH). Though pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (PVSMC) play a central role in neonatal PH, insight into the cell-specific transcriptomic alterations that might drive proliferation, migration, and contractility remains limited. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that single cell RNA-sequencing would identify a PVSMC-specific transcriptomic signature in a murine model of hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. Method(s): Pulmonary mesenchymal cells (MC; 5493 cells) were isolated from mice at early saccular (E18.5), late saccular (P1), early alveolar (P7) and late alveolar (P21) stages of development, and from P21 mice exposed to chronic hyperoxia (H;FiO2=0.8 x 7d), a preclinical model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Single MC were sequenced on Illumina Nova Seq at a depth of ~107 reads per cell. MC populations and genes of interest were validated with in situ hybridization. In separate experiments, lung histology, right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP) and vascular reactivity were measured at 6 weeks (echocardiogram) and 12 weeks (catheterization)Results: Unsupervised clustering identified 14 transcriptionally distinct MC clusters, with dynamic changes in diversity across development. PVSMC were identified by coexpression of smooth muscle (Tagln, Acta2) and mural (Pdgfrb) genes. In most lung MC, differential gene expression (DEG) from P21 H compared to normoxic (N) mice was relatively conserved, including upregulation of known antiproliferative genes Cdkn1a, Junb, and Btg2, a signature was absent in H PVSMC. The most DEG in H (n=73 cells) compared to N (n=81 cells) PVSMC were relatively unique with decreases in Btg2 (16-fold), Egr1 (8-fold), and increase in Cnn1 (8-fold), and Col18a1 (8-fold) molecules encoding proteins that are anti-proliferative, involved in injury repair, procontractile, and anti-angiogenic, respectively. Medial wall thickness, RVSP, and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) were greater in H, compared to N at 6 (p<0.01; n=9 N; n=10 H) mice and 12 (p<0.01; n=9 N; n=10 H) weeks Conclusion(s): In the lung, neonatal MC transcriptome demonstrates progressive increases in cellular diversity and dynamic changes in gene expression. Neonatal hyperoxia caused vascular remodeling, pulmonary hypertension and accentuated HPV. Hyperoxic PVSMC demonstrated a unique transcriptomic signature with dynamic changes in genes that play roles in cell proliferation, injury response, contraction, and angiogenesis. These results provide molecular insights and potential therapeutic targets to address the vascular remodeling that underlies neonatal PH.

AB  - Introduction The formation of extracellular traps (ETs) is a unique cell death process involving the release of decondensed chromatin fibres by macrophages into the extracellular space, termed METosis. While the release of macrophage ETs (METs) has been shown to be beneficial in pathogen clearance and infection control, METs can also contribute to the inflammatory process and lead to severe tissue damage. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in premature infants initiated by inflammation and oxidative stress. Since macrophages predominate in the neonatal lungs, we sought to explore whether the ability of alveolar macrophages (AMs) to undergo METosis is unique to the newborn period. Methods Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) from neonatal Sprague Dawley rat pups was collected to obtain AMs from rat pups at postnatal day 6, 8 and 22. In vitro: AMs were incubated with METosis agonists (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)) or control (media) for 4h. Cells were fixed and imaged for markers of METosis (myeloperoxidase (MPO) and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3)) and DNA using immunofluorescence. In vivo: rat pups between PND 6-9 were treated with LPS or saline intrapharyngeally and BALF was collected on PND10. Immunofluorescence was used to examine the presence of DNA, MPO and CitH3 in cells and picogreen was used to quantitate the level of free DNA in the supernatant. Results In vitro, immunofluorescence imaging of neonatal AMs showed increased presence of METosis markers MPO, CitH3, and DNA strands with in vitro exposure to METosis agonists PMA or LPS compared to control (n=3). Picogreen assay shows increased MET formation in neonatal (PND6) AMs in comparison to adult (PND22) AMs (n=4; p=0.004). In vivo, exposure to LPS significantly increased MET formation in the BALF of PND10 rats in comparison to control (n=3, both groups; p=0.003); increased expression of METosis markers was also observed in AMs. Conclusion Our findings show for the first time that rat AMs undergo METosis. Interestingly, neonatal AMs underwent METosis to a larger extent than adult AMs. If our preliminary data can be translated to human infants, METosis-induced lung damage may be a potential therapeutic target in reducing BPD pathogenesis in neonates.

AB  - Rationale:The Division of Pulmonary Medicine at Boston Children;s Hospital cares for thousands of national and international patients every year. In an effort to foster and facilitate translational research in pediatric pulmonology we created the Pulmonary Biobank Initiative (PBI) - a divisionwide patient registry and an accompanying biobank linked to medical record data, eligible to all patients with respiratory disease, that is accessible for use by researchers for analysis and to recontact potential participants for future studies. Method(s): The patient population consists of all patients seen by physicians in the BCH Division of Pulmonary and Respiratory Diseases, both inpatient and outpatient, as well as the patient's family members. All patients receive electronic invitations to participate in the weeks prior to scheduled outpatient visits. Interested parties can provide remote electronic consent or meet with a dedicated research assistant. At patient visits, the research assistant will review the initiative to confirm patients and guardians are fully informed. Participants complete The Pulmonary Genetics and the BCH Pulmonary Registry Questionnaires. All patients provide blood samples for DNA and RNA extraction, serum and plasma isolation, and PBMC collection for future generation of inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The protocol also allows for secondary use of discarded clinical samples, including residual sputum, bronchioalveolar lavage fluids, and tissue blocks. Result(s): As of October 2022, we have recruited 1,161 participants, including 469 with childhood interstitial lung disease, 231 with bronchiectasis, 133 with cystic fibrosis, 139 with asthma, 27 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The cohort is representative of the Boston Children;s Hospital patient population (13% non-white). DNA samples have been collected for 1001 subjects, from which exome sequencing has been completed for 55.4% and is being used in gene discovery studies and have already led to the identification of 6 novel childhood ILD candidate genes. iPSC have been generated from patients with severe asthma and differentiated to respiratory epithelium for functional studies of asthma susceptibility alleles. Lung tissue samples for 8 patients with macrophage-predominant ILD have been analyzed using in situ transcriptomic approaches for characterization of disease-specific cellular programs in macrophages and type II pneumocytes. Conclusion(s):The PBI is a unique catalyst for translational science in pediatric pulmonary disease. Data generated through this effort will be available through open-source databases.

AB  - Rationale: AERO-BPD is an ongoing observational study of school-age children with a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to assess the effect of indoor air quality at home on lung function and respiratory symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced new challenges for field-based spirometry with laptop-based pneumotach spirometers. Data on the use of remote spirometry are limited, especially for pediatric clinical research field work. We hypothesized that spirometry with the remote MIR Spirobank Smart (ZEPHRYx, inc) device, a digital turbine spirometer, could produce acceptable and accurate spirometry compared to pneumotach spirometer (Pneumotrac, Morgan Scientific) in a coached, in-home, clinical research setting. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study utilizing home spirometric data from the prospective clinical research cohort enrolled in the Air, Environment, and Respiratory Outcomes in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (AERO-BPD) study. Same day paired coached baseline spirometry measurements from the Pneumotrac and ZEPHYRx devices were completed by subjects aged 6-12 years. Session quality was graded per 2019 ATS/ERS guidelines and deemed successful if graded A-C. Proportion of successful tests was estimated for each device and compared using McNemar's test. Correlation between device FEV1 and FVC were analyzed by Lin's concordance correlation and Bland-Altman plots were generated. Result(s): Twenty-one participants with history of BPD completed home spirometry maneuvers on both the Pneumotrac and ZEPHYRx devices. The average age was 8.7 years (range 6-12), 48% female, 24% Black, 24% Hispanic, with median percent predicted FEV1 of 80% (IQR 68%, 95%) and 43% with diagnosis of asthma. The proportion of acceptable tests appeared higher using Pneumotrac (81%) compared with ZEPHYRx (67%), though this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.317). Among subjects with successful tests on both devices, Lin's concordance correlation demonstrated moderate agreement (FEV1 r=0.955, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98; FVC r=0.971, CI: 0.91- 0.99). The observed mean differences between Pneumotrac and ZEPHYR in FEV1 (0.079L, 95% CI: -0.141 - 0.298) and FVC (0.075L, 95% CI: -0.171 - 0.322) were relatively small and without evidence of systematic or volume-dependent bias (Figure 1). Conclusion(s): Within the confines of the relatively small sample, our data suggest high concordance between measured FEV1 and FVC measured by Pneumotrac and MIR spirometers when used for in-home clinical research visits. Utilizing MIR spirometers may be a viable and feasible way to perform pulmonary function testing for field research settings with children. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic pulmonary disease of premature infants, is characterized by hypoalveolarization, airway hyperresponsiveness, and increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Early-life cumulative oxygen exposure and pulmonary inflammation correlate with development of BPD and chronic respiratory symptoms, however the mechanisms driving respiratory morbidity in survivors of prematurity are ill-defined. We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice (a model of BPD) increases lung inflammation and airway responsiveness following infection with rhinovirus (RV). Hyperoxia also decreases type I interferon (IFN), including IFN-alpha and IFN-beta expression. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the primary producer of type I IFNs in pulmonary viral infections. AMs modulate inflammation and promote repair of tissue damage. We hypothesize that neonatal hyperoxia induces AM dysfunction and decreases expression of type I IFNs, and this mediates pulmonary inflammation and hypoalveolarization. Method(s): Two-day-old mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for up to 14 days. Subsequently, some mice were inoculated with intranasal RV or PBS. In selected experiments, neonatal mice were treated with recombinant IFN-beta. Lung immune cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunostaining, and qPCR. Alveolar growth was assessed by morphometry. Result(s): Unlike air-exposed mice, lungs of hyperoxia-exposed mice showed reduced IFN-alpha and IFN-beta mRNA expression and fewer IFN-alpha+ and IFN-beta+ AMs. Hyperoxic lung AMs had lower phagocytic receptor CD206 expression and reduced phagocytic capacity for FITC-ovalbumin antigen. Whole lung and sorted AMs mRNA expression of the interferon response genes Ifi35 and Oasl1 was decreased. Notably, Atf3 mRNA expression, transcriptional repressor of type I IFNs, was increased after hyperoxia. Recombinant IFN-beta treatment attenuated hyperoxia-induced Ccl2 mRNA expression following RV infection, blocked hyperoxia-induced chord length increase, a measure of hypoalveolarization, and partially restored the AM numbers. Based on previous findings that IFN-beta induces the expression of plateletderived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), a gene required for alveolarization, we tested the effects of type I IFNs on PDGFR expression in human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from infants developing BPD. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta induced PDGFRA and PDGFRB mRNA expression in BPD MSCs. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that neonatal hyperoxia induces AM dysfunction and reduced type I IFN responses. Recombinant IFN-beta partially rescued the hyperoxia-induced phenotype. Future studies will examine the molecular mechanisms underlying these events and their long-term impact on lung health in infants with BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Rare diseases are characterized by their low prevalence, often of genetic origin, degenerative and life threatening. Objective: To describe mortality by orphan diseases and to analyze its trends in Colombia from 2008 to 2013. Materials and methods: We conducted a descriptive study to analyze mortality rate trends from the death certificates between 2008 and 2013. We calculated specific mortality rates and adjusted by age and sex. Results: Seven thousand one hundred and thirty five deaths were attributed to orphan diseases, and 51.4 % of them occurred among men of all ages. The mean mortality rate during the study period was 2.53 deaths per 100,000 people. Overall, the trend showed an increasing pattern of mortality although very heterogeneous across the country. Mortality rates were higher in Bogota (20), and the Andes and the Caribbean regions (5.3 and 3.7 deaths per 100,000 population). The five most important causes of mortality among men were: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, muscular dystrophy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia originating in the perinatal period, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and gastroschisis, and among women: multiple sclerosis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, gastroschisis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia originating in the perinatal period, Guillain-Barre syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. The mean mortality rate by acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 0.17 deaths per 100,000 men younger than 15 years and that of multiple sclerosis was 0.16 in women over 40 years of age. Conclusion: The causes of death showed a similar pattern in both sexes. However, the burden of mortality was higher among men of all ages in Bogota.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is one of the respiratory complications to be evaluated in a child who is born prematurely and who is immersed in different respiratory and systemic comorbidities that impact development throughout his or her life. For this reason, a follow-up and treatment guide aimed at preventing complications and improving his or her quality of life is essential for the decision making of the doctors in charge of patients with this disease. This guide for long-term follow-up and treatment of children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia contains updated information aimed at health personnel with the aim of improving the processes of care and prevention in people from 2 months to 18 years of age. It includes evidence and recommendations about: Image studies, respiratory function, fluid intake, diuretics, bronchodilators, steroids, oxygen, pulmonary hypertension, sleep disorders, exacerbations, nutrition, comorbidities and prevention of complications. In Mexico, the official incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia is unknown; however, it is presumed to increase thanks to the survival of these children in the country's neonatal intensive therapies, so general practitioners, family doctors, rehabilitators, pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists need to be updated for coordinated and effective monitoring of this population.Copyright © 2019, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias.

AB  - Through this study, we aimed to assess the ability of routine neonatal screening at time of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) diagnosis to predict the development of late pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). This is a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 37 premature infants with BPD assessing the utility of screening serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiograms performed at the time of BPD diagnosis ('early PHTN') to predict 'late PHTN' at the last follow-up. Screening evaluation demonstrated early PHTN in 9/37 patients. At an average follow-up interval of 52.7 +/- 38.7 weeks, 4/9 had late PHTN; one patient without early PHT had late PHT. At initial screening, infants with late PHTN were significantly more likely to have demonstrated elevated BNP values (p = 0.003), and echocardiographic evidence of right atrial dilatation (p = 0.01), right ventricular hypertrophy (p = 0.01), lower right ventricular area change percentage (p = 0.03), and larger main pulmonary artery Z-scores (p = 0.02). Serum BNP and echocardiographic evaluation performed at the time of BPD diagnosis can detect patients at increased risk of late PHTN. Large, prospective studies are necessary to further address this question.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Free radicals (FRs) are unstable, short lived, and highly reactive molecules that are continuously generated by endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. The burden of FR generation is counteracted by the intracellular antioxidant systems, and the maintenance of oxidant/antioxidant balance is critical to normal cellular functions. The dangerous effects of FRs are linked to their property of being very unstable molecules and their ability to react with polyunsaturated fatty acids of cell membranes, proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, causing functional alterations within the cell. In neonatal period, hypoxia, ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion, hyperoxia, inflammation, mitochondrial impairment, presence of nonprotein bound iron are responsible of excessive FRs production. Moreover, a less efficient antioxidant system is not able to counteract the harmful effects of FRs leading to FR-related cellular, tissue, and organ damages. In preterm babies, the severity of mechanisms responsible of FRs production, the stage at which the oxidative insult occurs, the degree of maturity of the organs have differential effects on the distinct cell populations of the body, with certain specific cell types being particularly vulnerable in perinatal period. We propose the hypothesis that oxidative stress (OS) is the common pathogenic factor involved in the onset and develop of intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. This suggests that developing effective antioxidant strategies for preterm infants requires a detailed understanding of oxidative stress reactions and cell responses in perinatal period.Copyright © 2016, Georg Thieme Verlag KG.

AB  - Objective:To compare risk-adjusted changes in outcomes of preterm infants <29 weeks gestation born in 1996 to 1997 with those born in 2006 to 2007. Study Design:Observational retrospective comparison of data from 15 units that participated in the Canadian Neonatal Network during 1996 to 1997 and 2006 to 2007 was performed. Rates of mortality and common neonatal morbidities were compared after adjustment for confounders. Result(s):Data on 1897 infants in 1996 to 1997 and 1866 infants in 2006 to 2007 were analyzed. A higher proportion of patients in the later cohort received antenatal steroids and had lower acuity of illness on admission. Unadjusted analyses revealed reduction in mortality (unadjusted odds ratio (UAOR): 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63, 0.98), severe retinopathy (UAOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.92), but increase in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (UAOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.39 to 1.86) and patent ductus arteriosus (UAOR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.39). Adjusted analyses revealed increases in the later cohort for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.88, 95% CI: 1.60 to 2.20) and severe neurological injury (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.80). However, the ascertainment methods for neurological findings and ductus arteriosus differed between the two time periods. Conclusion(s):Improvements in prenatal care has resulted in improvement in the quality of care, as reflected by reduced severity of illness and mortality. However, after adjustment of prenatal factors, no improvement in any of the outcomes was observed and on the contrary bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased. There is need for identification and application of postnatal strategies to improve outcomes of extreme preterm infants.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 19 May 2011; doi:10.1038/jp.2011.68.

AB  - Hyperoxia exposure of immature lungs contributes to lung injury and airway hyperreactivity. Up to now, treatments of airway hyperreactivity induced by hyperoxia exposure have been ineffective. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of quercetin on hyperoxia-induced airway hyperreactivity, impaired relaxation, and lung inflammation. Newborn rats were exposed to hyperoxia (FiO2 > 95%) or ambient air (AA) for seven days. Subgroups were injected with quercetin (10 mg.kg-1.day-1). After exposures, tracheal cylinders were prepared for in vitro wire myography. Contraction to methacholine was measured in the presence or absence of organ bath quercetin and/or Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Relaxation responses were evoked in preconstricted tissues using electrical field stimulation (EFS). Lung tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Contractile responses of tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) of hyperoxic animals were significantly increased compared with AA animals (P < 0.001). Treatment with quercetin significantly reduced contraction in hyperoxic groups compared with hyperoxic control (P < 0.01), but did not have any effect in AA groups. In hyperoxic animals, relaxation of TSM was significantly reduced compared with AA animals (P < 0.001), while supplementation of quercetin restored the lost relaxation in hyperoxic groups. Incubation of preparations in L-NAME significantly reduced the quercetin effects on both contraction and relaxation (P < 0.01). Treatment of hyperoxic animals with quercetin significantly decreased the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta compared with hyperoxic controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). The findings of this study demonstrate the protective effect of quercetin on airway hyperreactivity and suggest that quercetin might serve as a novel therapy to prevent and treat neonatal hyperoxia-induced airway hyperreactivity and inflammation.Copyright © 2023 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also called chronic lung disease of immaturity, afflicts approximately one third of all extremely premature infants, causing lifelong lung damage. There is no effective treatment other than supportive care. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which impairs vision irreversibly, is common in BPD, suggesting a related pathogenesis. However, specific mechanisms of BPD and ROP are not known. Herein, a neonatal mouse hyperoxic model of coincident BPD and retinopathy was used to screen for candidate mediators, which revealed that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), also known as colony-stimulating factor 3, was up-regulated significantly in mouse lung lavage fluid and plasma at postnatal day 14 in response to hyperoxia. Preterm infants with more severe BPD had increased plasma G-CSF. G-CSF-deficient neonatal pups showed significantly reduced alveolar simplification, normalized alveolar and airway resistance, and normalized weight gain compared with wild-type pups after hyperoxic lung injury. This was associated with a marked reduction in the intensity, and activation state, of neutrophilic and monocytic inflammation and its attendant oxidative stress response, and protection of lung endothelial cells. G-CSF deficiency also provided partial protection against ROP. The findings in this study implicate G-CSF as a pathogenic mediator of BPD and ROP, and suggest the therapeutic utility of targeting G-CSF biology to treat these conditions.Copyright © 2023 American Society for Investigative Pathology

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the role of NETs in BPD of hyperoxia-induced rat model and the effect of heparin on alveolarization and vascular development in BPD. The neonatal rats exposed to 90% oxygen continuously for 7 days to mimic BPD, meanwhile, the rats were injected by different doses of histones to evaluate the impact on lung injury. The newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia were injected by different doses of heparin (250 U/kg, 500 U/kg) or anti-H4 antibody to evaluate the effect of heparin. Histones and hyperoxia impaired alveolarization with the increase of mean linear intercept (MLI) and the decrease of radial alveolar count (RAC), decreased lung angiogenesis with the decrease expression of VEGF, and increased the expression of NETs, histones and pro-inflammatory factor. However, low dose heparin (250U/kg) administration enhanced survival, improved alveolarization and vascular development in hyperoxia-induced BPD, as well as reduced expression of NETs, histones and pro-inflammatory factor. We concluded that heparin improves alveolarization and vascularization in BPD by inhibiting NETs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common complication of premature birth, imposing a significant and potentially life-long burden on patients and their families. Despite advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to patterns of lung injury and dysfunctional repair, current therapeutic strategies remain non-specific with limited success. Contemporary definitions of BPD continue to rely on clinician prescribed respiratory support requirements at specific time points. While these criteria may be helpful in broadly identifying infants at higher risk of adverse outcomes, they do not offer any precise information regarding the degree to which each compartment of the lung is affected. In this review we will outline the different pulmonary phenotypes of BPD and discuss important features in the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of these frequently overlapping scenarios.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: To perform a survey on postnatal corticosteroids usage in neonatal units in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Method(s): An 18-item structured questionnaire was created asking for the level of neonatal care and corticosteroid prescribing practices. A consultant neonatologist or senor specialty training registrar/advanced neonatal nurse practitioner was contacted in every neonatal unit in the UK and Ireland between September and December 2022. Result(s): The response rate to the survey was 96% (203 of 211 units). Postnatal corticosteroids were prescribed in 48% of units: 5% of special care units, 43% of local neonatal units and 100% of neonatal intensive care units. Most units (90%) prescribed dexamethasone, which was prescribed to infants born at gestational ages less than 30 weeks in all those units prescribing postnatal corticosteroids, however, eight units also reported use in infants greater than 30 weeks of gestation. Dexamethasone regimens varied with starting doses from 50 to 500 mug/kg/day. Most tertiary units (97%) prescribed repeated courses of dexamethasone. In all levels of neonatal care, postnatal corticosteroids were prescribed to ventilated infants as well as those receiving non-invasive respiratory support. Conclusion(s): There is use of postnatal corticosteroids in all levels of neonatal care and much of the practice is not evidence based.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Pregnant women exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are at increased risk for premature delivery. Premature infants often require supplemental oxygen, a known risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been implicated in hyperoxic lung injury. We hypothesize that prenatal PAH exposure exacerbates oxygen-mediated lung injury in neonatal mice, and that this effect is differentially altered in mice lacking the gene for (Cyp)1a1, 1a2, or 1b1. Timed pregnant wild type (WT) (C57BL/6J) mice were orally administered a PAH mixture of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) or the vehicle corn oil (CO) once daily on gestational days 16-19, and the dose response on postnatal lung injury was examined. In addition, timed pregnant mice with one of four genotypes, WT, Cyp1a1-null, Cyp1a2-null, and Cyp1b1-null, were treated orally with CO or PAH on gestational days 16-19 and exposed to hyperoxia or room air for 14 days. Lung injury was assessed on PND15 by radial alveolar count (RAL) and mean linear intercept (MLI). Gene expression of DNA repair genes in lung and liver were measured. Results showed that hyperoxic lung injury is augmented by prenatal PAH exposure in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was differentially altered in the Cyp1a1-, 1a2, and 1b1-null mice, with Cyp1a2-null showing the greatest extent of lung injury. We concluded that newborn mice exposed to PAH in utero had more significant lung injury in response to hyperoxia than non-PAH exposed pups, and CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are protective against lung injury while CYP1B1 augments lung injury. doi: xxxxxCopyright © 2023

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the levels of angiogenic factors in cord blood are associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with maternal preeclampsia., STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 199 singleton infants (gestational age<32weeks), including the preeclampsia group (59 infants) with severe/moderate BPD (24 infants) or no/mild BPD (35 infants) and the no preeclampsia group (140 infants)., MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin, and placental growth factor (PlGF) in cord blood were measured and compared among the study groups., RESULTS: The soluble endoglin level and the ratio of (sFlt-1+soluble endoglin) to PlGF were significantly higher in the preeclampsia group than in the no preeclampsia group (P<.05). Among preterm infants with maternal preeclampsia, both of these parameters were also significantly higher in the severe/moderate BPD group than the no/mild BPD group (P<.05). Receiver operator curve analysis revealed that increased cord blood soluble endoglin was predictive of severe or moderate BPD in preterm infants with maternal preeclampsia (area under the curve 0.73). Gestational age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.25; P<.001) and high soluble endoglin level in cord blood (>3420pg/mL) (adjusted OR 11.9; P=.006) were significant risk factors for the development of severe or moderate BPD in the preeclampsia group according to multivariate logistic regression analysis., CONCLUSION: Increased cord blood soluble endoglin is associated with the development of severe or moderate BPD in preterm infants with maternal preeclampsia.

AB  - Background - Advances in neonatal intensive care have resulted in high survival rates for infants born with extremely low birth weight. Accordingly, the treatment and rehabilitation of premature neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is indisputably an urgent problem. Objective - To evaluate the efficacy of vibroacoustic therapy in patients with BPD in the complex of therapeutic measures. Material and Methods - The study was a prospective, non-randomized open-label controlled clinical trial conducted in 2018-2020 in Astana, Kazakhstan. It included 69 children with BPD hospitalized with a concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia between the ages of 1 and 2 years. The study subjects were distributed among two groups: Group 1 (the main group, n=37) receiving vibroacoustic therapy with the VibroLung apparatus in combination with the main treatment and Group 2 (the control, n=32) receiving solely the main treatment. Results - The inclusion of the vibroacoustic method of treatment in the combination therapy of pneumonia in children with BPD resulted in early leveling of the following clinical symptoms: a reduction in the duration of the high fever by 1.18 days vs. the control group (p<0.05), relief of respiratory failure 1.4 days earlier vs. the control group (p<0.05) and a decrease in the duration of inpatient treatment by 2.9 days, compared with the control group (p<0.05). All of these implied the efficacy of this treatment method. Conclusion - Our results demonstrated that vibroacoustic therapy was a relevant addition to the treatment of pneumonia in children with BPD.Copyright © 2023 Russian Open Medical Journal.

AB  - Background: Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), possibly contributing to persistent respiratory morbidity after preterm birth. We aimed to assess if inflammatory markers were elevated in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of infants born very prematurely (< 32 weeks gestation) at 12-16 corrected months of age, and if increased levels were associated with BPD diagnosis and respiratory morbidity. Method(s): EBC samples and respiratory questionnaires were collected from 15 term-born infants and 33 preterm-born infants, 12 with a neonatal BPD diagnosis. EBC samples were analysed for leukotriene B4 (inflammation) and 8-isoprostane (oxidative stress) concentrations using enzyme-linked immune-assays. Differences between groups were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis Test with post-hoc comparisons, independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test depending on normality of the data. Result(s): Leukotriene B4 and 8-isoprostane levels were elevated in exhaled breath condensate of preterm-born infants compared to those born at term (mean difference [95% CI]; 1.52 [0.45, 2.59], p = 0.02; 0.77 [0.52, 1.02], p < 0.001, respectively). Leukotriene B4 and 8-isoprostane levels were independent of BPD diagnosis and respiratory morbidity over the first year of life. Conclusion(s): Infants born very prematurely exhibit elevated markers of airway neutrophilic inflammation and oxidative stress beyond the first year of life, regardless of a neonatal diagnosis of chronic lung disease or respiratory morbidity during infancy. These findings may have implications for future lung health. Trial Registration: N/A.Copyright © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a common heterogeneous lung disease that can result from preterm birth at less than 28-weeks gestation, prenatal and postnatal inflammatory insults, ventilator associated lung injury, and oxygen-related injury. Synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) are commonly used pre- and postnatally to treat inflammation and improve lung physiology. Clinical responses to sGC therapy for BPD vary in patients. We hypothesize that genetic background differences in transcriptional response to sGC therapy dictate the efficacy in infants with BPD. Identifying pathways and genes that mediate these differences will allow prospective determination of which infants would respond to sGC treatment. 26 preterm infants that received sGC treatment for BPD were identified. Respiratory Severity Score (RSS), an indication of BPD severity, was measured at diagnosis, 4 days, and 7 days post-sGC treatment. Patients were stratified into Responders versus Non-Responders by improvement in respiratory function after treatment. Changes in RSS were used to discriminate Responders (R >3 decrease in RSS) to treatment from Non-Responders (NR <3 decrease). 13 Responders and 13 Non-Responders were selected. They included 7 females and 19 males with an average gestational age of 24.3 weeks, and were 46% Caucasian, 31% African American, 19% Hispanic, and 4% other. 100muL of blood was collected before and after seven days of a dexamethasone treatment course. To examine differences in transcription response between Responders (n = 13) and Non-Responders (n= 13), RNA was isolated and analyzed using the Clariom S Human Transcriptome Affymetrix array. 21,500 expressed genes were profiled. Result(s): were imported into the Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) software, and genes with a significant difference (fold change >1.48 or < -1.48 and p-value <0.05) in Responders and Non-Responders were identified. Of those, 133 genes were upregulated and 74 downregulated. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify signaling pathways and disease processes that were uniquely altered in Responders versus Non- Responders. Non-Responders showed significant activation of neuroinflammatory signaling pathways, degranulation pathways, and lymphocyte activation disease pathways. Target genes in the top dysregulated pathways were evaluated using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Expression changes in Matrix Metalloproteinase-25, Interleukin-12 Receptor beta, and Microsomal Glutathione Transferase-1, key mediators of inflammation, were validated in independent studies using qPCR. While response to systemic glucocorticoids in neonates with BPD is variable, these studies identified pathways that are altered in Responders versus Non-Responders and are a step towards developing pre-screening tools to stratify infants for response to sGC BPD therapy.

AB  - Even with remarkable advances in the care of preterm infants, chronic lung disease in the form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a significant pathologic consequence of prematurity. BPD is caused by the interruption of physiologic lung development and exposure of the immature newborn lung to high O2 tensions. BPD is characterized by a simplified alveolar structure, arrested lung growth, impaired vascular development and lung fibrosis (1). To identify effective treatment strategies for BPD, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder. MicroRNAs (miRNA, miR) are known to regulate growth, development and repair of the developing lung; whereas, dysregulation of miRNA expression has been associated with pulmonary disease. Specifically, members of the miR-29 family have been linked to pulmonary cancers, fibrosis, and BPD. Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that developmental induction of miR-29 expression in the fetal lung near term serves a key role in promoting surfactant-producing type II cell differentiation and function through repression of TGF-beta2 signaling (2). To understand the role of miR-29 in protection against BPD, in the present study, we created mice in which the entire miR-29 family (miR-29a/b1 and miR-29b2/c) (miR-29 dKO) was disrupted. Upon exposure of miR-29 dKO and WT neonatal mice to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 5 days immediately after birth, expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, IL-1 beta, TGF-beta1, CXCL2 and IL-6, were significantly increased in the lungs of miR-29 dKO mice, compared to WT. Furthermore, lungs of miR-29 dKO adult mice manifested increased expression of their direct targets, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3. This was associated with increased collagen deposition, as evidenced by enhanced trichrome staining, suggesting the development of lung fibrosis. HDAC4 (a direct target of miR-29) and proinflammatory TNF-alpha, which have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis, also were upregulated in the lungs of miR-29 dKO mice. Overall, our studies suggest a key role of the miR-29 family and its targets in prevention of inflammatory and profibrotic signaling in the neonatal lung leading to lung pathology.

AB  - Premature birth leads to a significant increase in adverse clinical outcomes, including Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Intraventricular Hemorrhage. Synthetic Glucocorticoids (sGC) are administered prenatally to pregnant mothers at risk to reduce the chance of these complications. However, there is a correlation between long-term neurological defects in the infant and the clinical use of sGC prenatally. The use of the sGCs have been linked to the development of cerebral palsy and deficits in attention and concentration. To investigate the cellular basis of these abnormalities, we examined the consequences of sGC administration of the developing murine brain. Our studies demonstrated that premature exposure to sGC alters neural stem cell biology and has long term consequences for adult behavior in mice. In humans, site-specific phosphorylation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) on Serine 211 versus Serine 226 is associated with activated or repressed transcriptional states and clinical studies indicate that the ratio of S220/S226 phosphorylation is associated with increased predisposition to specific psychiatric disease states, including Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. To examine the role of these phosphorylation sites in the development of behavioral abnormalities, we utilized a knock-in mouse model where Serine 220 (equivalent to human Serine 211) was replaced with an alanine (S220A). In-vitro microarray analysis of neural stem cells and QPCR validation were performed to examine the expression changes in individual transcripts in critical pathways that may correlate with long-term neurologic disorders. Our results indicated that changing the phosphorylation status of GR alters the expression of 2570 genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that the major pathways altered include those involved in cellular proliferation, mitochondrial function, Valine degradation and G-coupled protein receptors involved in neurotransmission. Both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments indicated that the S220A mutation alters the cells response to sGC administration by impacting proliferation and differentiation. The longterm goal of these experiments was to demonstrate a role for S220 phosphorylation in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - The collection of exhaled breath condensates (EBCs) is a noninvasive method for obtaining samples from patients. This increased attention is due to the fact that EBC is simple, effort, independent, rapid, can be repeated frequently, and can be performed on young children and patients suffering from a variety of diseases (like asthma, cystic fibrosis, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia). By having a subject breathe tidally through a cooling system for 15-20 min, a sufficient amount of condensate is collected for analysis of biomarkers in clinical studies. However, bioanalysis of EBC involves an unavoidable sample preparation step due to the low concentration of its components. Thus, there is a need for a new and more sensitive analytical method of assessing EBC samples. The goal was to establish an analytical method for amino acids (AA) analysis in EBC samples obtained from children with Duchenne muscle dystrophy (DMD). It is a genetic disease that causes progressing and irreversible muscle dystrophy. In this study, we present the LC-FL method for the detection and quantification of AA in EBC samples after the derivatization process using the OPA/3MPA reagent. The chromatographic separation was performed using a Supelco Discovery C18 (150x4.6 mm; 5 mum), thermostated at 25 C. Mobile phase A was 0.05 M sodium acetate:methanol (95:5, v/v) phase B was methanol:water (70:30, v/v). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.5 mL/min. The developed assay is an attractive alternative to standard analytical methods because it allows for the non-invasive, fast, sensitive, and reliable analysis of AA after the derivatization step in EBC. This method can be successfully applied to patients with DMD.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of caffeine citrate when combined with mechanical ventilation in the treatment of apnea of prematurity and its influence on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Method(s): One hundred and sixty (160) premature infants with apnea admitted in Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China were enrolled in this study, and divided into control and study groups. Children in the control group underwent mechanical ventilation combined with aminophylline therapy, while children in the study group were administered mechanical ventilation combined with caffeine citrate. Blood gas and pulmonary function indices, as well as clinical symptom and neurodevelopmental improvements were assessed. Also, the incidence of adverse reactions were recorded during treatment. Result(s): Blood gas indices including oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) levels in the study group were significantly higher, but partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level was lower (p < 0.05); furthermore, tidal volume, respiratory rate and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the study group were higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the disappearance time of apnea, invasive mechanical ventilation time and oxygen inhalation time in the study group were shorter than in the control group (p < 0.05). Mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) values in the study group were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05), while the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, feeding intolerance, tachycardia and hyperglycemia in the study group was significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The combination of caffeine citrate and mechanical ventilation aids improvement in the neurodevelopmental outcome of children, as well as reduction in the incidence of adverse reactions. However, further clinical trials are required prior to application of this strategy in clinical practice.Copyright © 2023 The authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung condition that occurs in premature infants who undergo prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. Existing treatment methods have shown limited efficacy, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. Artesunate (AS) is a compound known for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, and studies have shown its protective effects against acute lung injury. However, its impact on BPD and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AS on chronic hyperoxiainduced BPD in neonatal mice. METHOD(S): Full-term C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the Air+lactate Ringer's solution (L/R) group, O2 + L/R group, and O2 + AS group. Analysis was performed using assay methods such as ELISA, RT-qPCR, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and Western blotting. RESULT(S): Compared with the O2+L/R group, the expression of inflammatory factors in the serum, tissue, and BALF of the O2+AS group was significantly reduced, the lung function of the mice was improved, and the inflammatory infiltrates were significantly alleviated. AS inhibited the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors in mice. We found that the expression of nuclear p65 and cytoplasmic p-IkappaBalpha in the NF-kappaB pathway was inhibited after adding AS. CONCLUSION(S): AS ameliorated chronic hyperoxia-induced BPD in neonatal mice probably by inhibiting the expression of NF-kappaB pathway and inflammatory factors.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

AB  - Background: Mammalian mucosal barriers secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as critical, host-derived regulators of the microbiota. However, mechanisms that support microbiota homeostasis in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as supraphysiologic oxygen, remain unclear. Result(s): We show that supraphysiologic oxygen exposure to neonatal mice, or direct exposure of intestinal organoids to supraphysiologic oxygen, suppresses the intestinal expression of AMPs and alters intestinal microbiota composition. Oral supplementation of the prototypical AMP lysozyme to hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice reduced hyperoxia-induced alterations in their microbiota and was associated with decreased lung injury. Conclusion(s): Our results identify a gut-lung axis driven by intestinal AMP expression and mediated by the intestinal microbiota that is linked to lung injury in newborns. Together, these data support that intestinal AMPs modulate lung injury and repair. [MediaObject not available: see fulltext.]Copyright © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - SESSION TITLE: Obstructive Lung Diseases Case Report Posters 2 SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/10/2023 09:40 am - 10:25 am INTRODUCTION: Early onset emphysema is a relatively rare entity, with the majority of the cases involving genetic and environmental causes. In 2018, 249,791 adults from 18-44 years old, or 0.2% of the population in the US, had emphysema [1]. We report a case of early onset emphysema and the lesson we learnt. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old Black male with past medical history of childhood asthma controlled with albuterol PRN, heavy marijuana use (~5 joints a day) since the age of 14 years and total of 1 pack year of cigarette smoking, presented to the emergency department with 4 days of shortness of breath and right sided chest pain, exacerbated by cough and movement. Further questioning revealed that the patient was born prematurely around 32 weeks and required oxygen support for 8 months after birth. He works at a construction site and has never been admitted for asthma exacerbation. He had moderate effort tolerance. On admission, vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed bilateral diffuse rhonchi. CT Chest showed severe bullous emphysematous disease in the lung apices bilaterally with predominance on the right. alpha1-Antitrypsin level was 245 mg/dL(n:90-200mg/dL). Symptoms resolved with nebulization and he was discharged the following day hemodynamically stable. Follow-up PFT revealed a FEV1: 73%, FEV1/FVC ratio: 65% (71.4-91.7%) (moderate obstructive defect, mild restrictive defect) with a moderate decrease in diffusion capacity (DLCO/VA (69%). He was diagnosed with emphysema and started on tiotropium with a PRN Albuterol inhaler. DISCUSSION: Patients with a history of prematurity who require prolonged oxygen therapy with or without mechanical ventilation fall into the diagnostic criteria of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). These patients have a higher risk of developing chronic lung disease at a younger age than the normal population. The disease is characterized by airflow obstruction, architectural distortion and intermittent exacerbations [2][3]. In our case, the early onset of symptoms were secondary to the chronic smoking history. While the emphysematous changes might have developed prior to this, the absence of smoking might have slowed the onset of his chronic respiratory symptoms. Smoking cessation counselling is especially important in this population, along with childhood screening, and follow-up with pulmonary function test by the pediatrician for early diagnosis and treatment of emphysema, preventing further complications. CONCLUSION(S): Early onset emphysema as a sequel of BPD is a complex, multidisciplinary disease, which despite much work has continued to present as a diagnostic conundrum for physicians. An approach which targets both at-risk infants, and follows individuals with a history of BPD is key to improve the quality of life and survival of these patients. We also emphasize the need for increased awareness and follow-ups with pulmonary function tests for patients with history of oxygen dependence in prematurity and BPD. Early screening and diagnosis, along with smoking cessation counselling can potentially delay the onset of chronic pulmonary diseases and prevent further complication and deterioration.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) derived exosomes mediate tissue protection and regeneration in many injuries and diseases by modulating cell protein production, protecting from apoptosis, inhibiting inflammation, and increasing angiogenesis. In the present study, daily intraperitoneal injection of MSC-derived exosomes protected alveolarization and angiogenesis in a newborn rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) induced by 14 days of neonatal hyperoxia exposure (85% O2). Exosome treatment during hyperoxia prevented disruption of alveolar growth, increased small blood vessel number, and inhibited right heart hypertrophy at P14, P21, and P56. In vitro, exosomes significantly increased tube-like network formation by HUVEC, in part through a VEGF mediated mechanism. In summary, daily intraperitoneal injection of exosomes increased blood vessel number and size in the lung through pro-angiogenic mechanisms. MSC-derived exosomes therefore have both anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic mechanism to protect the lung from hyperoxia induced lung and heart disease associated with BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a common pathology of premature newborns caused by oxygen and mechanical ventilation, resulting in hypoalveolarization and impaired angiogenesis. It can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH-BPD) with excess mortality. Celastrol has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Objective(s): We addressed potential therapeutic interest of celastrol in PH-BPD. Method(s): Different concentrations of celastrol (0,1-0,5-1 mg/kg/d) were tested in a murine model of hyperoxic PH-BPD (14 days with 90% O2-Hx). We evaluated hemodynamic parameters with echocardiography, lung remodeling with histological methods and pulmonary arterial (PA) reactivity with myograph. Cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+i) response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) was evaluated in human fetal PA smooth muscle cells (fPASMC) with spectrophotometry in normoxic (21% O2) and Hx conditions (48 h with 60% O2). Inflammation and oxidant stress were also addressed. Results/Expected results: Celastrol reduces mortality at doses of 1 and 0,5 mg/kg/d compared to Hx control. At 1 mg/kg/d, it normalizes PA acceleration time and reduces vascular hyperreactivity to ET-1 inversely to phenylephrine and 5-HT, with no effect on the altered response to acetylcholine induced by Hx. At all doses, it decreases right heart hypertrophy and vascular remodeling but has no effect on media cells proliferation observed in Hx condition. It has also no impact on alveolarization and vascular density. Although celastrol (0.1 and 0.3 muM) decreases the increased Ca2+i response to ET-1 in Hx in fPASMC, expression of ET-1 receptors was unchanged. In fPASMC, celastrol 0.3 muM decreases the increased concentration of IL6 observed in Hx but has no effect on IL8 and MIF. In both models, Hx-induced oxidant stress remains mild with absence of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation and celastrol at 1 mg/kg/d increases heme oxygenase 1 expression. Conclusion/Perspectives: Celastrol has a preventive dose-dependent effect on major hallmarks of PH induced by Hx and could be considered as a new potential therapeutic option for PH-BPD.Copyright © 2023

AB  - Introduction: Oxidative stress and inflammation have proven to be key factors contributing to the occurrence of BPD. Erythromycin has been shown to be effective in treating the redox imbalance seen in many non-bacterial infectious chronic inflammatory diseases. Method(s): Ninety-six premature rats were randomly divided into air + saline chloride group, air + erythromycin group, hyperoxia + saline chloride group and hyperoxia + erythromycin group. Lung tissue specimens were collected from 8 premature rats in each group on days 1, 7 and 14, respectively. Result(s): Pulmonary pathological changes in premature rats after hyperoxia exposure were similar to those of BPD. Hyperoxia exposure induced high expression of GSH, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta. Erythromycin intervention caused a further increase in GSH expression and a decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression. Conclusion(s): GSH, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are all involved in the development of BPD. Erythromycin may alleviate BPD by enhancing the expression of GSH and inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease in the respiratory system of premature infants. Gm15886, as a lncRNA, is highly expressed in lung tissue of BPD newborn mice. Aim(s): This study aimed to clarify the roles of the Gm15886 gene in the pathogenesis of BPD mice by determining the expression of Gm15886 and Hipk1 in lung tissues. Method(s): Sequence and localization of the Gm15886 gene and the related information of its adjacent genes were obtained using the UCSC browsing tool. The targeting gene of the Gm15886 was predicted using the Ensemble database and double luciferase assay. Neonatal C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 95% hyperoxia for 7 days to generate the hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model. RT-PCR assay was used to detect Gm15886, Hipk1, and VEGF gene transcriptions in lung tissues in the development process of BPD (0, 3, 5, and 7 days). The pathological changes in lung tissues and Hipk1/VEGF gene transcription in lung tissues were detected in the Gm15886 gene silenced BPD mice. Result(s): Gm15886 gene transcription in lung tissues was significantly increased in mice of the hyperoxia model group compared to that in the air control group (p<0.05). Gm15886 gene could completely bind and interact with the base sequence within the second exon of the Hipk1 gene. Hipk1 was a targeting gene for Gm15886. Gene transcription and expression of Hipk1 were remarkably enhanced in mice of the hy-peroxia model group compared to that in the air control group (p<0.05). The silencing of the Gm15886 gene improved alveolar morphology and markedly downregulated Hipk1 and upregulated VEGF gene transcription compared to those in the Blank vector BPD group (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Gm15886-Hipk1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of BPD through modulating Hipk1 and VEGF gene transcription. This study might provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Diaphragm ultrasound (DU) has been used in adult and pediatric critical patients in relation to prediction of extubation success or to detect diaphragm dysfunction, but there is a lack of evidence in neonates. Our aim is to study the evolution of diaphragm thickness in preterm infants, as well as related variables. This prospective monocentric observational study included preterm infants born before 32 weeks (PT32). We performed DU to measure right and left inspiratory and expiratory thickness (RIT, LIT, RET, and LET) and calculated the diaphragm-thickening fraction (DTF) in the first 24 h of life and then weekly until 36 weeks postmenstrual age, death, or discharge. Using multilevel mixed-effect regression, we evaluated the influence of time since birth on diaphragm measurements, as well as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), birth weight (BW), and days of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We included 107 infants, and we performed 519 DUs. All diaphragm thickness increased with time since birth, but the only additional variable that influenced this growth was BW: beta coefficients RIT = 0.00006; RET = 0.00005; LIT = 0.00005; and LET = 0.00004, p < 0.001. Right DTF values remained stable since birth but left DTF increased with time only in infants with BPD. Conclusion(s): In our population we found that the higher the BW, the higher diaphragm thicknesses at birth and follow-up. Contrary to the previously published findings in adult and pediatric settings, we were unable to describe a relationship between days of IMV and diaphragm thickness in PT32. The final diagnosis of BPD does not influence this increase either, but it does increase left DTF. What is Known: * Diaphragm thickness and diaphragm thickening fraction have been related to the time on invasive mechanical ventilation in adults and pediatric patients, as well as with extubation failure. * Very few evidence is yet available on the use of diaphragmatic ultrasound in preterm infants. What is New: * Birth weight is the only variable related to diaphragm thickness in preterm infants born before 32 weeks postmenstrual age. * Days of invasive mechanical ventilation do not influence diaphragm increase in thickness in preterm infants.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Rationale Preterm infants with oxygen supplementation frequently develop a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pathomechanistically, an inflammatory response with increased migration and activation of macrophages plays a major role. Elevated levels of CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), which has chemotactic and activating effects on proinflammatory inflammatory cells, were detected in lungs of infants evolving BPD. Therefore, we investigated whether CXCL10 deficiency protects newborn mice from hyperoxia-induced lung injury (as a model of BPD). Methods (1) Homozygous CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10-/-) mice as well as wildtype mice (WT) were either exposed to hyperoxia (85 % O2, HYX) or normoxia (21 % O2, NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14 and studied at P14. (2) For recovery, some mice were transferred from HYX to NOX for two additional weeks and were then sacrificed at P28. Excised lungs were snap-frozen for molecular biology studies or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histomorphometric analyses. (3) J744A.1 macrophages were treated with CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist, and cell migration was studied. Results (1). Lungs of HYX-exposed WT showed significantly increased macrophage invasion at P14 compared with the control group. This inflammatory response after HYX resulted in impaired alveolarization, increased apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. CXCL10-/- protected the newborn mice from the inflammation and partially from the HYX-induced structural changes. (2) After recovery at P28, CXCL10-/- mice exhibited improved lung structure and attenuated matrix remodeling in comparison to WT. (3) Loss of CXCL10 prevented the macrophage influx to the lungs at both P14 and P28 after HYX. (3) Mouse and human macrophages treated with recombinant CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist significantly increased and reduced migration, respectively. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that deficiency of CXCR3-CXCL10 axis blocks macrophage chemotaxis to the lung, partially enables lung growth, and protects from ECM in experimental BPD.

AB  - Objective To analyze the status of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) management in 10 hospitals in Northwest China over the past five years and to investigate the strategies for improving the prevention and treatment of RDS. Methods This retrospective study involved premature infants with RDS who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) of 10 hospitals (six in Shaanxi Province, three in Gansu Province, and one in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region) of the Northwest China Neonatal Collaborative Group within 3 d after birth from January 1 to December 31, 2016, and from January 1 to December 31, 2021. Basic information, perinatal condition, treatment approaches, complications, and prognosis of the patients were compared. T-test, rank sum, and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. Result (1) This study enrolled 322 premature infants with RDS in 2016 and 349 in 2021. Premature infants at the gestational age of 30 to 33 weeks were mainly affected, and the majority were male [64.3% (207/322) and 57.3% (200/349)]. The average maternal age in 2021 was older than that in 2016 [(30.6+/-4.8) years vs (28.6+/-5.4) years, t=24.02, P<0.001], and the proportion of women at advanced maternal age was also higher in 2021 [19.2% (67/349) vs 12.4% (40/322), chi2=4.18, P<0.05]. (2) The proportions of pregnancies conceived with assisted reproductive technologies [11.7% (41/349) vs 1.9% (6/322), chi2=25.12], underwent routine prenatal examinations [58.5% (204/349) vs 30.4% (98/322), chi2=53.33], exposed to steroids [62.2% (217/349) vs 28.6% (92/322), chi2=82.58] and delivered by cesarean section or elective cesarean section [73.6% (257/349) vs 51.6% (166/322), chi2=35.06; 24.1% (84/ 349) vs 6.5% (21/322), chi2=39.07], as well as the ratio of cesarean scar pregnancy [7.4% (26/349) vs 3.4% (11/322), chi2=5.23] were all higher in 2021 than those in 2016 (all P<0.05). Moreover, the incidence of fetal distress [30.1% (105/349) vs 20.2% (65/322), chi2=8.68], gestational hypertension [24.6% (86/349) vs 13.0% (42/322), chi2=14.59], premature rupture of membranes [16.0% (56/349) vs 10.2% (33/322), chi2=4.89], meconium-stained amniotic fluid [12.6% (44/349) vs 5.6% (18/322), chi2=9.83], placental abruption [10.3% (36/349) vs 5.3% (17/322), chi2=5.84], gestational diabetes mellitus [10.3% (36/349) vs 1.6%(5/322), chi2=22.41], chorioamnionitis [4.6%(16/349) vs 0.9% (3/322), chi2=8.12], thyroid dysfunction [4.3% (15/349) vs 0.6% (2/322), chi2=7.88] and heart disease [4.3% (15/349) vs 0.3% (1/322), chi2=9.17] were higher in 2021 than in 2016 (all P<0.05). (3) In 2021, the rate of pulmonary surfactant (PS) usage, the dosage of porcine PS, and the proportion of bovine PS usage were all significantly higher than those in 2016 [73.6% (257/349) vs 67.1% (216/322), chi2=11.62; (178.5+/-38.0) mg/kg vs (165.2+/-42.8) mg/kg, t=7.85; 47.9% (123/257) vs 19.4% (42/216), chi2=41.72; all P<0.01]. No significant difference in the incidence of intubation-surfactant-extubation (INSURE), early PS administration (<=2 h after birth), or the arterial blood gas values before and after PS treatment was found between the cases enrolled in 2021 and 2016. The duration of antibiotic treatment [7.0 d (5.0-14.0 d) vs 5.0 d (1.0-8.0 d), Z=7.55] and assisted ventilation [144 h (81-264 h) vs 73 h (47-134 h), Z=8.20] and the median hospital stay [24 d(14-42 d) vs 16 d (10-25 d), Z=6.74] were significantly longer in 2021 than in 2016 (all P<0.01). More patients required nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation [29.6% (100/338) vs 1.0% (3/306), chi2=97.81] and conventional ventilation [42.6% (144/338) vs 30.1% (92/306), chi2=10.87] in 2021 as compared with those five years ago (both P<0.01). (4) In 2021, the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus [15.5% (54/349) vs 6.2% (20/322), chi2=63.40], bronchopulmonary dysplasia [9.2% (32/349) vs 2.8% (9/322), chi2=12.88], persistent pulmonary hypertension [5.4% (19/349) vs 0.6% (2/322), chi2=12.85], periventricular leukomalacia [4.3% (15/349) vs 1.2% (4/322), chi2=7.52] and pneumothorax [3.4% (12/349) vs 0.3% (1/322), chi2=9.68] increased as compared with those in 2016 (all P<0.05), while the incidence of nosocomial infection decreased significantly [7.4% (26/349) vs 19.6% (63/322), chi2=21.37, P<0.001]. (5) The cure rate of premature infants with RDS was 70.8% (247/349) in 2021, which was significantly higher than that in 2016 [56.2% (181/322), chi2=15.37, P<0.001]. Moreover, the rate of withdrawing treatment and the total mortality rate was lower in 2021 than in 2016 [7.7% (27/349) vs 14.3% (46/322), chi2=7.41; in-hospital: 1.4% (5/349) vs 5.6% (18/322), chi2=8.74; out of hospital: 8.3% (29/349) vs 13.7% (44/322), chi2=4.96; all P<0.05]. Conclusions The clinical management of RDS in premature infants in the involved hospitals has been improved. However, there is room for improvement in prenatal examinations.Copyright © 2023 Authors.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia has become one of the most common adverse outcomes in premature infants, however, the pathogenesis remains unanswered. This was a prospective pilot study to investigate potential biomarkers of the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which could help in the understanding and management of this disease. Method(s): Exosomes were separated from the sputum samples of bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients at 28 days of life (early group) and the time when bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed (confirmed group). Exosomal micro-RNA was compared with a control group to find differentially expressed micro-RNA. Result(s): Microvesicles isolated from sputum samples of three groups were assessed by transmission electron microscopy, particle size analysis, as well as flow cytometry. The shape and size of the isolated vesicles from the three groups all matched the typical appearance of exosomes. The micro vesicles isolated from the sputum samples expressed clusters of differentiation (CD), the exosomal biomarkers strikingly, including CD63, CD9, and CD8. There were 1308 exosomal micro-RNA captured in total, in which, miR-320c (micro-RNA 320c) was significantly upregulated in the patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, starting at 28 days of age. Compared with the control group, the p value was 0.0046 in the early group and 0.021 in the confirmed group, respectively. There was no significant difference in the expression of miR-320c between the early and confirmed bronchopulmonary dysplasia groups (p = 0.062). Conclusion(s): The up-regulation of exosomal micro-RNA 320c may serve as a potential biomarker in the early stage of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of prematurity and has no specific treatment option. Moreover, inflammation and fibrosis play a vital role in the development of BPD. Thus, this study aimed to explore the role of the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug cryptotanshinone (CTS) in the treatment of inflammation and fibrosis in BPD. Method(s): In vivo, Sprague-Dawley rats (male) were divided into air, hyperoxia and CTS groups with different dose interventions (7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg). A BPD rat model was induced by continuous inhalation of hyperoxia (95%) for 7 days, during which different doses of CTS were injected intraperitoneally. Furthermore, histological examination, hydroxyproline content measurement, Western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the levels of inflammation and fibrosis in the tissues. RAW264.7 cells exposed to 95% oxygen were collected and co-cultured with fibroblasts to determine the expression levels of alpha-SMA, collagen- and MMPs. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 and pro-fibrotic factor TGF-beta1 in the supernatants were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Result(s): Haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that CTS reduced the inflammatory response in rat lungs. Masson staining revealed that CTS alleviated the level of pulmonary fibrosis. CTS also reduced the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 along with the expression of the fibrosis marker alpha-SMA in lung tissue. Similarly, in vitro analysis revealed that CTS decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 expressed in RAW 264.7 cells, and reduced alpha-SMA, collagen-, MMPs concentrations in HFL-1 cells co-cultured with the supernatant of RAW264.7 cells after hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): CTS can attenuate the hyperoxia-induced inflammatory response and the level of fibrosis by regulating the levels of inflammatory factors and fibrotic factor TGF-beta1 expressed by macrophages, thereby highlighting the therapeutic potential of CTS in the treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2023 Ma, Bao, Li, Cao, Yu, Hu, Cheng and Tian.

AB  - In premature birth and postpartum damage to the developing lung, the processes of the formation of pulmonary vessels and alveoli are disrupted, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is a multifactorial disease and the pathogenesis of lung tissue damage is still not fully understood. Studies of angiogenesis biomarkers can be informative for assessing the development of BPD. In this study we examined the blood serum of 65 premature infants aged 6 to 180 days of life; gestational age at birth was 23-33 weeks, body weight 480-1840 g, APGAR score 5-6. All children in the early neonatal period had respiratory distress syndrome, then 46 children formed and 19 did not form bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The concentration of the factors of angiogenesis and fibrosis was determined in blood serum by ELISA. There were no differences in the levels of angiopoietins 1 and 2, vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-D, transforming growth factor beta TGF-beta, thrombospondin-1. We observed a tendency to increasing the level of VEGF-A, which is a key regulator of angiogenesis and lung maturation; we regard this tendency as a favorable sign of lung formation. We found tendencies to increase of the adhesion molecule of endothelial platelet cells PECAM-1, interleukin 8 and connective tissue growth factor CTGF. CTGF expression is enhanced by artificial lung ventilation and exposure to high oxygen concentrations. We consider an increase of CTGF in BPD to be an unfavorable change, since the binding of CTGF to VEGF inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In children with BPD, we found a decrease in the level of platelet derived growth factor PDGF-BB, the median concentration was 3180 pg/mL in BPD versus 4782 pg/mL without BPD (p = 0.024). PDGF is an important factor in tissue regeneration and plays an important role in the formation of blood vessels. We assume the decreasing of PDGF concentration in BPD can lead to a violation of the alveolarization necessary for the formation of the structure of healthy lungs. Studies of angiogenesis factors will help to better understand the pathogenesis of lung damage in BPD.Copyright © Semikina E.L. et al., 2023.

AB  - Background: Diagnosis of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at an early stage may improve their quality of life. However, there is no proper diagnostic method. Therefore, a specific and objective marker is critically required. Here, we aim to evaluate the predictive characteristics of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and krebs von den lungen-6 (KL-6) as diagnostic biomarkers for preterm infants with BPD. Method(s): A prospective cohort study was performed on 11 preterm infants with BPD and 21 preterm infants without BPD. Plasma levels of HE4 and KL-6 were measured and compared at 1, 14, and 28 days after birth. The correlation of HE4 and KL-6 with the clinical characteristics of preterm infants was also evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency in identifying BPD. Result(s): Interestingly, plasma HE4 and KL-6 levels were significantly increased in preterm infants with BPD at 1, 14, and 28 days after birth, and these levels were significantly correlated with gestational age, the weight of preterm infants, Apgar score (1 min), Apgar score (5 min), and invasive ventilation. ROC curve analysis showed that HE4 or KL-6 was highly capable of differentiating preterm infants with BPD from preterm infants without BPD. Notably, the combination of HE4 and KL-6 showed higher discriminatory capacity than HE4 or KL-6 alone. Conclusion(s): Plasma HE4 and KL-6 levels could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting BPD, and the combination of HE4 and KL-6 could also function as an efficient diagnostic marker.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common respiratory morbidity of preterm infants. Importantly, the disease lack specific therapies and is associated with long-term cardio-pulmonary and neurodevelopmental morbidities, signifying the need to discover novel therapies and decrease the disease burden. We and others have demonstrated that leflunomide, a food and drug administration approved drug to treat humans with rheumatoid arthritis, increases the expression of the anti-oxidant enzymes, NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). However, whether this drug can decrease oxidative stress in fetal human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs) is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that leflunomide will decrease hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress by upregulating these anti-oxidant enzymes in HPAECs. Leflunomide decreased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and increased the mRNA and protein levels of catalase, NQO1, and SOD2 in HPAECs at basal conditions. Further, leflunomide-treated cells continued to have decreased H2O2 and increased SOD2 levels upon hyperoxia exposure. Leflunomide did not affect the expression of other anti-oxidant enzymes, including hemoxygenase-1 and SOD1. AhR-knockdown experiments suggested that leflunomide regulated NQO1 levels via AhR-dependent mechanisms and H2O2, catalase, and SOD2 levels via AhR-independent mechanisms. Collectively, the results support the hypothesis that leflunomide decreases oxidative stress in HPAECs via SOD2-and catalase-dependent, but AhR- and NQO1-independent mechanisms. Our findings indicate that leflunomide is a potential drug for the management of BPD in preterm infants. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Cardiac troponin I (cTn I) has been demonstrated as a possible useful biomarker for myocardial injuries. The present study aimed to evaluate potential relationships between this biomarker and neonatal morbidities among preterm neonates. Method(s): This cohort study was carried out at an Iranian Hospital (Tehran-Iran; 2021). Newly-born preterm neonates entered the study. Blood sampling was performed immediately after neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and sent to the laboratory to detect levels of plasma cTnI. The correlations between the levels of plasma Tn I and each neonatal outcome were evaluated as the primary outcome. Result(s): A total of 101 NICU hospitalized neonates with the mean gestational age, 1st, and 5th minutes Apgar scores of 33.750+/-2.125 (Range: 29-37) weeks, 7.6471+/-1.766, and 9.188+/-1.205 entered the study. The mean and median of Troponin I levels were 0.131+/-0.126 and 0.0920 ng/ml. The results pointed out that neonates who died during hospitalization or required CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) had lower troponin I in comparison with their controls; nonetheless, the differences were not significant (P=0.950 & P=0.557). The mean+/-SD of troponin I was not significantly different between neonates with and without PDA (p=0.741), asphyxia (P=0.298), and intubation (P=0.212). The occurrences of necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and sepsis were not also significant factors for the alteration of troponin I (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Since there were no relationships between cTn I and neonatal outcomes, great caution should be implemented regarding the use of single cTn I value as a diagnostic marker for short-term neonatal adverse outcomes. Further investigations with larger sample sizes are strongly suggested.Copyright © 2023 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To analyze the distribution of ages at the interhospital transfer of outborn very preterm infants in China and to compare their perinatal characteristics and outcomes at discharge and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) treatment. Methods A total of 3 405 outborn very premature infants with a gestational age of 24-31+6 weeks who were transferred to the NICUs of the Chinese Neonatal Network (CHNN) in 2019 were included in this retrospective study. According to the age at transfer, they were divided into three groups: early transfer (<=1 d), delayed transfer (>1-7 d) and late transfer (>7 d) groups. Analysis of variance, t-test, Chi-square test (Bonferroni correction), Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to compare the general clinical condition, treatment, and outcomes at discharge among the three groups. Results The median gestational age was 29.7 weeks (28.3-31.0 weeks) and the average birth weight was (1 321.0 +/- 316.5) g for these 3 405 infants. There were 2 031 patients (59.6%) in the early transfer group, 406 (11.9%) in the delayed transfer group and 968 (28.4%) in the late transfer group. Infants who received continuous positive airway pressure ventilation and tracheal intubation in the delivery room accounted for 8.4% (237/2 806) and 32.9% (924/2 805), respectively. A total of 62.7% (1 569/2 504) of the mothers received antenatal glucocorticoid therapy and the ratio in the early transfer group was 68.7% (1 121/1 631), which was higher than that in the delayed transfer group [56.1% (152/271), chi2=16.78, P<0.017] and the late transfer group [49.2% (296/602), chi2=72.56, P<0.017]. The total mortality rate of very premature infants was 12.7% (431/3 405), and the mortality rates in the early, delayed and late transfer groups were 12.4% (252/2 031), 16.3% (66/406) and 11.7% (113/968), respectively (chi2=5.72, P=0.057). The incidences of severe intraventricular hemorrhage, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia at the corrected gestational age of 36 weeks or discharge were all higher in the delayed and late transfer groups than in the early transfer group, respectively. The incidences of retinopathy of prematurity, retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment and bronchopulmonary dysplasia at the corrected gestational age of 36 weeks or discharge in the late transfer group were significantly higher than that in the delayed transfer group (Bonferroni correction, all P<0.017). In the late transfer group, the median age of very premature infants at discharge was 66.0 d (51.0-86.0 d), and the corrected gestational age at discharge was 38.9 weeks (37.1-41.2 weeks), and both were greater than those in the early transfer [48.0 d (37.0-64.0 d), Z=260.83; 36.9 weeks (35.7-38.3 weeks), Z=294.32] and delayed transfer groups [52.0 d (41.0-64.0 d), Z=81.49; 37.4 weeks (36.1-38.7 weeks), Z=75.97] (all P<0.017). Conclusions Many very premature infants need to be transferred to higher-level hospitals after birth. The later the very premature infants are transferred, the higher the incidence of complications will be. It is suggested that intrauterine or early postnatal transport may improve the prognosis of very premature infants.Copyright © 2023 Chinese Journal of Perinatal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Aim: Treatment of preterms and low birthweight (LBW) neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) may be limited due to early need of cardiac procedures. We aimed on analysing clinical outcome in this combined high-risk patient group. Method(s): The analysis based on data of the European Association of Brain in Congenital Heart Disease (EUR-ABC), a European-wide collaboration. We analysed clinical characteristics, morbidity, mortality and neurodevelopmental (ND) outcome of preterms (<37 weeks GA) and LBW (<2500g) born between 2016 and 2020, requiring cardiac procedure (catheter or surgery) during first year of life, treated in three European centers (Zurich, CH; Utrecht, NL; Munich, GE). Solitary closure of patent arterial duct was excluded. Result(s): 308 Neonates (51% male) of which 237 (77%) preterms and 71 (23%) LBW term-newborns were born at median (IQR) GA of 35.4 (33.3-36.9) weeks, mean (SD) birth weight of 2016 (580) g. CHD were mild (17%), moderate (60%), or severe (24%) including cyanotic (39%), and single ventricle CHD (10%). Rate of associated extra-cardiac anomalies was high (42%). Surgical (90%) as well as catheter-based procedures (10%) were performed at chronological age of 68 (12-155) days, resp. postmenstrual age of 43.1 (38.0-56.8) weeks at 3275 (2383-5143) g. One year mortality was high (19%), both before (7%) or after first intervention (13%) and was associated with perinatal factors such as lower 5min-Apgar score (p<0.001), smaller head circumference at birth and at first intervention (both, p<0.05), more complicative course including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p<0.05), more severe type of CHD, cyanotic diagnosis, resp. duct dependent CHD (all, p<0.01), genetic anomalies (p<0.05), lower body weight, and younger age at time of intervention (both, p <0.001). Preoperative neuroimaging was performed by cerebral ultrasound (76%), combined with MRI (12%). Data on ND outcome after one year were scarce (19%). Conclusion(s): Treatment of congenital heart disease plus prematurity and low birth weight remains challenging due to perinatal, cardiac, genetic factors as well as age and body size at first intervention. Low number of ND outcome data in this combined high-risk population shows the need of prospective structured follow-up programs including neuroimaging, neuromonitoring, and functional ND outcome in Europe.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a life-threatening disorder affecting premature newborns, for which no definite cure is available1,2. Lung fibrosis is one of the main problems that affect young patients. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism of action of human extracellular vesicles (EVs) both in vitro and in an animal model of hyperoxiainduced BPD. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of EVs on the development of fibrosis and on functionality of lung epithelial cells. METHODOLOGY: GMP-grade EVs were produced by human Wharton-Jelly derived MSCs (Exo Biologics, Belgium), isolated by tangential flow filtration and characterized according to MISEV2018. Rat pups were divided in 3 groups: normoxia + PBS vehicle (control group), hyperoxia with PBS (untreated), hyperoxia with MSC EVs in PBS (treated). Both PBS and EVs were injected intratracheally (IT) on day 3, 7 and 10 and pups were sacrified on day 14. The expression of the genes TGFbeta1 and aSMA was analysed in lungs. To evaluate epithelial secretory function, the expression of glycosaminoglycans (Alcian blue staining) and of surfactant protein C (SFTPC) was analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence. Collagen deposition was assessed by Sirius Red staining. Macrophages from rat bone marrow were treated with TGFbeta, cultured and analyzed for aSMA and CD90 expression by flow cytometry. RESULT(S): Pups under hyperoxia exhibited an increase in collagen deposition in the lungs. This parameter was reduced by treatment with MSC EVs. The area of lung tissue expressing glycosaminoglycans was significantly increased in MSC EV-treated rat pups in respect to untreated animals. In addition, cells expressing SFTPC were significantly increased in MSC EVs treated pups with respect to the untreated group. In vitro, MSC EVs suppressed the induction of aSMA expression in macrophages. CONCLUSION(S): Intratracheal administration of clinical-grade MSC-EVs counteracts the development of fibrosis and improve pulmonary epithelial function in a neonatal model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. These results can contribute to understand the mechanism of action of these nanoparticles in preventing the development of BPD. .

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the pulmonary parenchyma must maintain the structural relationships among resident cells during the constant distortion imposed by respiration. This dictates that both the ECM and cells adapt to changes in shape, while retaining their attachment. Membrane-associated integrins and discoidin domain receptors (DDR) bind collagen and transmit signals to the cellular cytoskeleton. Although the contributions of DDR2 to collagen deposition and remodeling during osseous development are evident, it is unclear how DDR2 contributes to lung development. Using mice (smallie, Slie/Slie, DDR2D) bearing a spontaneous inactivating deletion within the DDR2 coding region, we observed a decrease in gas-exchange surface area and enlargement of alveolar ducts. Compared with fibroblasts isolated from littermate controls, DDR2D fibroblasts, spread more slowly, developed fewer lamellipodia, and were less responsive to the rigidity of neighboring collagen fibers. Activated b1-integrin (CD29) was reduced in focal adhesions (FA) of DDR2D fibroblasts, less phospho-zyxin localized to and fewer FA developed over ventral actin stress fibers, and the adhesions had a lower aspect ratio compared with controls. However, DDR2 deletion did not reduce cellular displacement of the ECM. Our findings indicate that DDR2, in concert with collagen-binding b1-integrins, regulates the timing and location of focal adhesion formation and how lung fibroblasts respond to ECM rigidity. Reduced rigidity sensing and mechano-responsiveness may contribute to the distortion of alveolar ducts, where the fiber cable-network is enriched and tensile forces are concentrated. Strategies targeting DDR2 could help guide fibroblasts to locations where tensile forces organize parenchymal repair.Copyright © 2023 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose : Hypoxiamimesis via stabilization of hepatic hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) protects against oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), brain hypomyelination, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in mice. N-oxoglutarate (NOG) inhibits HIF prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), stimulating stabilization of the HIF-1a subunit, but is too polar to cross cell membranes. We hypothesized that PHD inhibition by small molecules containing NOG with modifications leading to enhanced drug levels in the liver would stabilize and activate hepatic HIF even in hyperoxic conditions. Methods : A library of 25 novel carbonyl glycine small molecules was synthesized by chemical modification of NOG with various R-groups to encourage accumulation of NOG in the liver. HIF stabilization and activity in vitro were assessed by immunoblot of Hep3B cells and luciferase activity in NIH3T3/HIF-luc cells treated with 1mM of each drug after 1, 3, 6, and 24 hrs. In vivo tissue distribution of PHD inhibition and HIF stabilization was determined by luciferase assay and immunoblot, respectively, of brain, liver, kidney, and retina from P8 luc-ODD mice 24 hrs after intraperitoneal (IP) drug injection (1 mmol/g). Protection against OIR at P17 was quantified by comparing vasoobliteration (VO) and neovascularization (NV) in retinas of C57BL/6J mice treated with 3 IP injections of either drug or vehicle at P6, 8, and 10. Results : Eleven compounds demonstrated >1.5-fold increase in luciferase activity after 24 hrs in vitro. Six induced >2-fold increase in HIF protein in cultured hepatocytes 3 hrs after treatment. Compound 209 sustained >2-fold increase in endogenous HIF over 24 hrs. When tested in the OIR model, 3 compounds decreased VO and NV in the retina, with Compound 209 demonstrating the greatest effect (65% VO reduction, p=0.004; 88% NV reduction, p=0.01). In luc-ODD reporter mice, Compound 209 showed a hepatotropic pattern of HIF PHD inhibition suggesting enhanced drug levels in the liver. Conclusions : A select group of small molecules formed by modification of NOG leads to PHD inhibition specifically in the liver when administered systemically. Stabilization of hepatic HIF during hyperoxia by brief treatment with these drugs confers protection against OIR, presenting a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of retinopathy of prematurity and other oxygen-induced organ toxicities.

AB  - Objective To investigate the changes and significance of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), interleukin-33 (IL-33), interleukin-25 (IL-25), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and interleukin-13 (IL-13) in peripheral blood of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Methods A total of 76 preterm infants with a gestational age of <32 weeks and a length of hospital stay of >=14 days who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from September 2020 to December 2021 were enrolled. According to the diagnostic criteria for BPD, they were divided into a BPD group with 30 infants and a non-BPD group with 46 infants. The two groups were compared in terms of the percentage of ILC2 and the levels of IL-33, IL-25, TSLP, IL-5, and IL-13 in peripheral blood on days 1, 7, and 14 after birth. Results The BPD group had significantly lower birth weight and gestational age than the non-BPD group (P<0.05). On days 7 and 14 after birth, the BPD group had significantly higher levels of ILC2, IL-33, TSLP, and IL-5 than the non-BPD group (P<0.05), and these indices had an area under the curve of >0.7 in predicting the devolpment of BPD (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for gestational age and birth weight, peripheral blood IL-33, TSLP and IL-5 on days 7 and 14 after birth were closely related to the devolpment of BPD (P<0.05). Conclusions Early innate immune activation and upregulated expression of related factors may be observed in preterm infants with BPD. ILC2, IL-33, TSLP, and IL-5 may be used as biological indicators for early diagnosis of BPD.Copyright © 2023 Xiangya Hospital of CSU. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The role of systemic inflammatory indices in the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the possible clinical utility of systemic inflammatory indices in the prediction of moderate to severe BPD. Method(s): Premature infants < 32 weeks of gestational age were included in the study. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) were calculated at birth and at the time of diagnosis of BPD (at 36th weeks of postmenstrual age). The patients were divided into two groups as no or mild BPD and moderate or severe BPD. Result(s): A total of 1146 infants were included in the study, 957 in Group 1 and 189 in Group 2. The SIRI value was significantly higher in moderate or severe BPD both at birth and at the 36th week of postmenstrual age (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The AUC value of SIRI was 0.809 and the cut-off value was > 0.98 in the predictivity of BPD at birth. The AUC value of SIRI was 0.842 and the cut-off value was > 1.33 for the diagnosis of BPD at 36th week of postmenstrual age. After multiple logistic regression analysis, SIRI was shown to be a significant parameter for the diagnosis of BPD (OR 2.847, 95% CI 1.557-4.875). Conclusion(s): SIRI may be a useful biomarker for predicting moderate to severe BPD and a marker of clinical importance in the follow-up of infants with BPD.Copyright © 2023 SEPAR

AB  - Background: Remodeling and altered ventricular geometry have been described in adults born preterm. Although they seem to have an adverse cardiac phenotype, the impact of various degrees of prematurity on cardiac development has been scarcely reported. In this study, we evaluated the impact of gestational age (GA) at birth on cardiac dimensions and function at near-term age among extremely preterm infants. Method(s): This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of infants born at <29 weeks of GA between 2015 and 2019. Infants with available clinically acquired echocardiography between 34 and 43 weeks were included. Two groups were investigated: those born <26 weeks and those born >=26 weeks. All measurements were done by an expert masked to clinical data using the raw images. The primary outcome was measurements of cardiac dimensions and function based on GA group. Secondary outcomes were the association between cardiac dimensions and postnatal steroid exposure and with increments of GA at birth. Result(s): A total of 205 infants were included (<26 weeks, n = 102; >=26 weeks, n = 103). At time of echocardiography, weight (2.4 +/- 0.5 vs 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg, P = .86) and age (37.2 +/- 1.6 vs 37.1 +/- 1.9 weeks, P = .74) were similar between groups. There was no difference in metrics of right-sided dimensions and function. However, left-sided dimensions were decreased in infants born <26 weeks, including systolic left ventricle (LV) diameter (1.06 +/- 0.20 cm vs 1.12 +/- 0.18 cm, P = .02), diastolic LV length (2.85 +/- 0.37 vs 3.02 +/- 0.57 cm, P = .02), and estimated LV end-diastolic volume (5.36 +/- 1.69 vs 6.01 +/- 1.79 mL, P = .02). Conclusion(s): In our cohort of very immature infants, birth at the extreme of prematurity was associated with smaller left cardiac dimensions around 36 weeks of corrected age. Future longitudinal prospective studies should evaluate further the impact of prematurity on LV development and performance and their long-term clinical impact.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Echocardiography

AB  - New bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal disease that is theorized to begin in utero and manifests as reduced alveolarization due to inflammation of the lung. Risk factors for new BPD in human infants include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), premature birth (PTB) and formula feeding. Using a mouse model, our group recently reported that a paternal history of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure increased his offspring's risk of IUGR, PTB, and new BPD. Additionally, formula supplementation of these neonates worsened the severity of pulmonary disease. In a separate study, we reported that a paternal preconception fish oil diet prevented TCDD-driven IUGR and PTB. Not surprisingly, eliminating these two major risk factors for new BPD also significantly reduced development of neonatal lung disease. However, this prior study did not examine the potential mechanism for fish oil's protective effect. Herein, we sought to determine whether a paternal preconception fish oil diet attenuated toxicant-associated lung inflammation, which is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of new BPD. Compared to offspring of standard diet TCDD-exposed males, offspring of TCDD-exposed males provided a fish oil diet prior to conception exhibited a significant reduction in pulmonary expression of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators (Tlr4, Cxcr2, Il-1 alpha). Additionally, neonatal lungs of pups born to fish oil treated fathers exhibited minimal hemorrhaging or edema. Currently, prevention of BPD is largely focused on maternal strategies to improve health (e.g., smoking cessation) or reduce risk of PTB (e.g., progesterone supplementation). Our studies in mice support a role for also targeting paternal factors to improve pregnancy outcomes and child health.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common complication of extreme preterm birth, can be caused by oxygen-related lung injury and is characterized by impaired alveolar and vascular development. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have lung protective effects. Conversely, BPD is associated with increased MSCs in tracheal aspirates. We hypothesized that endogenous lung (L-)MSCs are perturbed in a well-established oxygen-induced rat model mimicking BPD features. Rat pups were exposed to 21% or 95% oxygen from birth to postnatal day 10. On day 12, CD146+ L-MSCs were isolated and characterized according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy criteria. Epithelial and vascular repair potential were tested by scratch assay and endothelial network formation, respectively, immune function by mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. Microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip and gene set enrichment analysis software. CD146+ L-MSCs isolated from rat pups exposed to hyperoxia had decreased CD73 expression and inhibited lung endothelial network formation. CD146+ L-MSCs indiscriminately promoted epithelial wound healing and limited T cell proliferation. Expression of potent antiangiogenic genes of the axonal guidance cue and CDC42 pathways was increased after in vivo hyperoxia, whereas genes of the anti-inflammatory Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and lung/vascular growth-promoting fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways were decreased. In conclusion, in vivo hyperoxia exposure alters the proangiogenic effects and FGF expression of L-MSCs. In addition, decreased CD73 and JAK/STAT expression suggests decreased immune function. L-MSC function may be perturbed and contribute to BPD pathogenesis. These findings may lead to improvements in manufacturing exogenous MSCs with superior repair capabilities.

AB  - Background Cyclooxygenase inhibitors are commonly used in infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), but the benefit of these drugs is uncertain. Methods In this multicenter, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned infants with echocardiographically confirmed PDA (diameter, >1.5 mm, with left-to-right shunting) who were extremely preterm (<28 weeks' gestational age) to receive either expectant management or early ibuprofen treatment. The composite primary outcome included necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage IIa or higher), moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. The noninferiority of expectant management as compared with early ibuprofen treatment was defined as an absolute risk difference with an upper boundary of the one-sided 95% confidence interval of less than 10 percentage points. Results A total of 273 infants underwent randomization. The median gestational age was 26 weeks, and the median birth weight was 845 g. A primary-outcome event occurred in 63 of 136 infants (46.3%) in the expectant-management group and in 87 of 137 (63.5%) in the early-ibuprofen group (absolute risk difference, -17.2 percentage points; upper boundary of the one-sided 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.4; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in 24 of 136 infants (17.6%) in the expectant-management group and in 21 of 137 (15.3%) in the early-ibuprofen group (absolute risk difference, 2.3 percentage points; two-sided 95% CI, -6.5 to 11.1); bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurred in 39 of 117 infants (33.3%) and in 57 of 112 (50.9%), respectively (absolute risk difference, -17.6 percentage points; two-sided 95% CI, -30.2 to -5.0). Death occurred in 19 of 136 infants (14.0%) and in 25 of 137 (18.2%), respectively (absolute risk difference, -4.3 percentage points; two-sided 95% CI, -13.0 to 4.4). Rates of other adverse outcomes were similar in the two groups. Conclusions Expectant management for PDA in extremely premature infants was noninferior to early ibuprofen treatment with respect to necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication in preterm infants characterized by alveolar growth arrest. Interleukin (IL)-33 and type 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) affect type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII) differentiation in BPD mice and may cause increased lung epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Amphiregulin (AREG) can be produced by ILC2 and is associated with tissue repair. However, the action mechanism of AREG produced by ILC2 to alveolar development in BPD is unclear. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the role and mechanism of AREG in influencing AECII transdifferentiation in the lung tissue of BPD mice. The effects of ILC2-derived AREG on AECII transdifferentiation were verified in vivo and in vitro, and the role of IL-33 on ILC2-derived AREG in AECII transdifferentiation in BPD mice and a preliminary investigation of the role of AREG's receptor-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on AECII transdifferentiation. The results showed that neonatal mice developed severe lung injury after hyperoxia, and IL-33 induced AREG production via ILC2 affected normal AECII differentiation and promoted EMT. In addition, the blockade of EGFR was found to alleviate the impaired AECII differentiation under hyperoxia in an in vitro study. In summary, our study demonstrates that AREG secreted by ILC2 affects AECII transdifferentiation in BPD mice, which provides a new idea for the clinical treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The aim of this observational study was to investigate the influence of different typical preterm diseases on NT-proBNP serum levels in the early postnatal period of life of a preterm infant. NT-proBNP levels of 118 preterm infants born <= 31 weeks GA were determined at the first week of life, after 4 +/- 1 weeks of life, and at a corrected gestational age of 36 + 2 weeks. Relevant complications with a possible influence on NT-proBNP values in the first week of life such as early neonatal infection, hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA), early pulmonary hypertension (early PH), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) were evaluated; at 4 +/- 1 weeks of life, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), BPD-related pulmonary hypertension (BPD-associated PH), late infection, IVH, and intestinal complications were evaluated. At a corrected gestational age of 36 +/- 2 weeks, we examined the effect of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), BPD, BPD-associated PH, and late infection on NT-proBNP levels. In the first days of life, only the isolated occurrence of hsPDA resulted in significantly increased NT-proBNP levels. In multiple linear regression analysis, early infection remained independently associated with NT-proBNP levels. At 4 +/- 1 weeks of age, the isolated presence of BPD and BPD-related PH resulted in increased levels, and the effect remained significant in the multiple regression analysis. At a corrected gestational age of 36 +/- 2 weeks, infants with relevant complications at this final evaluation time tended to have lower NT-proBNP values than our exploratory reference values. Conlusion: NT-proBNP in the first week of life seems to be mainly influenced by an hsPDA and infection or inflammation. BPD and BPD-related PH are the most important factors influencing NT-proBNP serum levels in the first month of life. When preterm infants reach a corrected GA of 36 +/- 2 weeks, chronological age rather than complications of prematurity must be considered when interpreting NT-proBNP levels. What is Known:* Several complications associated with prematurity, such as hemodynamically significant PDA, pulmonary hypertension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy of prematurity, have been shown to influence NT-proBNP levels in preterm infants in their early postnatal life.What is New:* Hemodynamically relevant PDA is a major factor in the increase of NT-proBNP levels in the first week of life.* Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia are important factors in the increase in NT-proBNP levels in preterm infants at approximately 1 month of age.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treatment in very preterm infants is controversial. This study focused on preterm infants born at 28-32 weeks of gestation and analyzed the association between various PDA treatments and clinical outcomes. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants born at 28-32 weeks of gestation between 2016 and 2019 at 22 hospitals in the Taiwan Premature Infant Follow-up Network. We categorized the infants into four groups according to treatment strategies: medication, primary surgery, medication plus surgery, or conservative treatment. Result(s): A total of 1244 infants presented with PDA, and 761 (61.1%) were treated. Medication was the predominant treatment (50.0%), followed by conservative treatment (38.9%), medication plus surgery (7.6%), and primary surgery (3.5%). The risk of mortality was not reduced in the active treatment group compared to the conservative treatment group. There was a higher prevalence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and any degree of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in both the primary surgery and medication plus surgery groups than in the conservative treatment group. After adjustment, both the primary surgery and medication plus surgery groups still had higher odds ratios for the occurrence of NEC and any degree of BPD. Conclusion(s): Compared with active PDA treatment, conservative treatment for PDA did not increase the risk of mortality and morbidity in very preterm infants born at 28-32 weeks of gestation.

AB  - Background. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most serious complications in premature infants. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been indicated to promote immune tolerance and induce anti-inflammatory responses during the neonatal stage. However, the role of MDSCs in BPD has not been completely expounded. Methods. 130 cases of newborns were collected from six tertiary hospitals in Guangzhou from August 2019 to June 2022. They were divided into BPD group, non-BPD preterm infants group, and term infants group according to gestational age and presence of BPD. The peripheral blood was collected and used to analyze the proportion, phenotypic, and function of MDSCs at 3 to 7 days and 8 to 14 days after birth, respectively. Results. We indicated that the number of both MDSCs in premature infants is reduced, and the number of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) in peripheral blood of BPD infants was significantly lower than that of non-BPD infants under 34 weeks of gestational age (P<0.05). Furthermore, PMN-MDSCs from peripheral blood of patients presented inhibitory effect on proliferation of CD4+T and CD8+T cells in each group. However, PMN-MDSCs from BPD group had obviously weaker inhibitory effect on proliferation of CD4+T and CD8+T cells than that from non-BPD preterm infants group. In addition, we demonstrated that the expression of NADPH oxidase (Nox2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PMN-MDSCs of BPD children was significantly lower than that in non-BPD preterm infants, suggesting that ROS pathway was affected in BPD in premature infants. Conclusion. This study preliminarily revealed the role of PMN-MDSCs in the pathogenesis of BPD in premature infants. The specific immune regulation mechanism of PMN-MDSCs in BPD will provide new ideas and strategies for clinical prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants.Copyright © 2022 Wangkai Liu et al.

AB  - Background: Neurofilament light (NfL) has been identified as a biomarker for neuroaxonal damage in preterm infants, but its relation with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been established. We hypothesized that BPD is associated with increased NfL levels at an early stage, indicative of early neuroaxonal damage. Method(s): We included preterm infants born <30 weeks of gestation for assessment of NfL levels from cord blood and blood obtained at postnatal days 3, 7, 14, and 28. We used linear regression analysis to compare NfL levels between infants with moderate/severe BPD and infants with no/mild BPD, and linear mixed model analysis to compare the effect of time on NfL levels between groups. Result(s): Sixty-seven infants with a gestational age (GA) of 27 +/- 1.3 weeks were included for analysis, of whom 19 (28%) developed moderate/severe BPD. Although NfL levels were higher at every time point in infants with BPD, statistical significance was lost after adjustment for GA, small for gestational age (SGA) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Groups did not differ in NfL change over time. Conclusion(s): The positive association between BPD and NfL in the first weeks of life could be explained by GA, SGA and IVH rather than by development of BPD. Impact: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a known biomarker for neuroaxonal damage.Biomarkers for brain damage during the first weeks of life in preterm infants developing BPD are lacking.NfL levels obtained during the first weeks of life did not differ between infants with and without BPD in analyses adjusted for GA, SGA, and IVH.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Objective.To study the effect of gasdermin D (GSDMD) inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) on alveolarization arrest in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) newborn rats via inhibiting alveolar epithelial cell pyroptosis. Methods.Pregnant SD rats were randomly assigned to four groups as follows: control, BPD, BPD with NSA and NSA group, and then were prepared to receive intra-amniotic injection of LPS. Lung tissues of newborn rats on the first, third and seventh day after birth were stained by hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) to observe lung development. The expressions of GSDMD-N-terminal in lungs of newborn rats in each group were detected by immunofluorescence. The mRNA levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) of newborn rats' lungs was detected by real-time PCR. In vitro, the mouse alveolar epithelial cell line MLE-12 was cultured and treated with LPS/ adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and NSA. The cell viability of MLE-12 cells was detected by CCK-8 method, the pyroptosis was detected by Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) staining, and the expressions of surfactant protein C (SFTPC) and GSDMD-N protein in MLE-12 cells were detected by immunofluorescence. Results.In vivo, intra-amniotic injection of LPS hindered lung development, resulting in the pathological hallmarks of BPD. The GSDMD-N expression of alveolar epithelial cells increased in the BPD rat model established by intra-amniotic injection of LPS, while NSA treatment significantly improved the lung development of BPD rats and inhibited the IL-1beta mRNA expression (both P<0.05). In vitro, the study confirmed that LPS/ATP treatment decreased the viability of alveolar epithelial cells MLE-12 and induced pyroptosis, while NSA treatment increased alveolar epithelial cell viability and inhibited pyroptosis (both P<0.05). In addition, NSA treatment upregulated the SFTPC expression and inhibited the GSDMD-N expression in LPS/ATP-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells (both P<0.05). Conclusion.Inhibiting the alveolar epithelial cell pyroptosis can improve the alveolar development in BPD newborn rats.Copyright © 2023 Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

AB  - Objective: To compare obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in patients with p-PROM (preterm premature rupture of membranes) at less than 30 weeks of gestational age before and after the application of protocols developed on the basis of international guidelines and to identify local barriers and strategies for their implementation. Study design: Single and twin pregnancies with p-PROM < 30 weeks of gestation without signs of infection were retrospectively collected. The population was divided in two groups. Group A contained patients treated before the introduction of the protocol, hospitalized from the day of the p-PROM to delivery and treated according to clinicians' practice. Group B included patients managed according to a standardized protocol, treated with home care management under strict surveillance, after 48 h of hospitalization. Result(s): 19 women with 21 newborns in group A and 22 women with 26 newborns in group B were enrolled. Maternal characteristics and p-PROM gestational age were comparable. In group A we observed minor latency time from diagnosis to delivery (1.6 vs 6.5 weeks, p < 0.001) with lower gestational age at delivery (25.8 +/- 2 vs 30.7 +/- 4.2 weeks, p = 0.00) and lower newborn weight (859 +/- 268 vs 1511 +/- 917 g, p = 0.002). Concerning neonatal outcomes, in group A there were lower Apgar score at 1 min (4.0 +/- 2.1vs 6.3 +/- 2, p = 004), longer hospitalization (42 +/- 38 vs 68 +/- 38 days, p = 0.05) and, even if non statistically significant, major rate of neonatal mortality (11,5% vs 19%, p = 1.00) and of neonatal complications (need of neonatal intensive care unit, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, mechanical ventilation). Postnatal follow-up showed comparable outcomes at 24 months of correct age. Conclusion(s): Educational and interdisciplinary meetings, along with group performance audit and standardization of procedures are successful strategies to implement guidelines application. Applying this strategy, we developed a protocol according to international guidelines for the treatment of early onset p-PROM based on a standardized conservative management at home, achieving better results compared to hospital management in terms of latency, gestational age at delivery, neonatal weight and neonatal hospitalization.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition in pregnant women disrupts the first 1000 days of life (DOL). DOL is known as the Window of Opportunity or the Golden Period, which occurs for 1000 DOL to improve children's growth and development optimally. Disturbances that arise during this period will impact the survival of the child and child's growth and development, which is permanent. However, malnutrition in pregnant women can be prevented by the early intervention. AIM: This study aims to describe the maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with chronic energy deficiency malnutrition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research is a retrospective cohort study with a descriptive research design. Pregnant women with prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) below 18.5 kg/m2 was included in this study. The subject characteristic, maternal, and neonatal outcomes were collected from the medical record. Variables received includes characteristics (age, education, residence, maternal occupation, paternal occupation, pregnancy frequency, pregnancy interval, comorbidities before pregnancy, body weight before and after pregnancy, height, weight increase, and BMI before pregnancy); maternal outcome (hemoglobin level, complication during pregnancy or labor); and neonatal outcome (birth weight, birth length, 1st min APGAR score, 5th min APGAR score, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, intrauterine growth restriction, and neonatal complications). RESULT(S): Eighty-one pregnant women with malnutrition who came to Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital from 2017 to 2020 were included in the study. Some of our subjects had moderate (26%) and severe (16%) malnutrition before pregnancy. The average weight gain is 8.78 kg, lower than the recommendation. The results of this study showed a high incidence of anemia (51.9%) and perinatal maternal complications (54.4%). The neonatal outcome showed a high incidence of congenital defects and hyaline membrane disease (p = 0.031) and NICU (p = 0.001). The incidence of hyaline membrane disease and congenital defects is 15 (18.5%) and 5 (6.1%) in this study. CONCLUSION(S): Chronic energy deficiency in pregnancy could lead to significant maternal and neonatal complications.Copyright © 2023, Scientific Foundation SPIROSKI. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To explore the detection rate and risk factors of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in very low birth weight infants (VLBWI). Methods A total of 208 VLBWI admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit from April 2017 to May 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. They were divided into the ROP group (98 patients, 192 eyes) and non-ROP group (110 patients, 220 eyes) according to the occurrence of retinopathy. Infants in the ROP group were divided into the severe group (6 patients, 12 eyes) and non-severe group (92 patients, 180 eyes) according to the need for treatment. General data on the VLBWI, mothers' perinatal conditions, treatment measures during hospitalization, and related diseases of premature infants were recorded for univariate analysis, and statistically significant single factors were screened for Logistic regression analysis to explore independent risk factors for ROP. Results Among the 208 VLBWI, 98 patients suffered ROP, accounting for 47.1%, and 6 of the 98 ROP infants needed surgical intervention, accounting for 6.1%. The single-factor analysis results showed that the differences between the ROP group and non-ROP group in vaginal delivery, gestational age, birth weight, low Apgar score after 1 minute and 5 minutes, tracheal intubation, pulmonary surfactant (PS) application, time duration of oxygen inhalation, oxygen concentration>=40%, blood transfusion, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, early-onset neonatal sepsis, and hypothyroidism were all statistically significant (all P<0.05). The multi-factor Logistic regression analysis results showed that the gestational age (OR=0.497, 95% CI:0.391-0.631, P<0.001) and birth weight (OR=0.998, 95% CI:0.996-1.000, P=0.046) were independent risk factors for ROP. There were statistically significant differences in the gestational age and gender between the severe group and non-severe group (all P<0.05). Short-term outcomes showed that among the follow-up 68 patients (69.3%), 53 patients (77.9%) had no ROP and complete vascularization, 11 patients (16.2%) had no ROP but incomplete vascularization, and 4 patients (5.9%) had scar formation. The average duration of complete vascularization was 168.4 days. Conclusion VLBWIs have higher ROP detection rate. The gestational age and birth weight are independent risk factors for ROP in VLBWIs and regular fundus examination and timely treatment are very important to prevent blindness caused by ROP.Copyright © 2021, Xinxiang Medical University.

AB  - Rationale: Premature birth affects 10% of live births in the United States and is associated with alveolar simplification and altered pulmonary microvascular development. However, little is known about the long-term impact prematurity has on the pulmonary vasculature. Objectives: Determine the long-term effects of prematurity on right ventricular and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics. Methods: Preterm subjects (n = 11) were recruited from the Newborn Lung Project, a prospectively followed cohort at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, born preterm with very low birth weight (<=1,500 g; average gestational age, 28 wk) between 1988 and 1991. Control subjects (n = 10) from the same birth years were recruited from the general population. All subjects had no known adult cardiopulmonary disease. Right heart catheterization was performed to assess right ventricular and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics at rest and during hypoxic and exercise stress. Measurements and Main Results:  Preterm subjects had higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures (mPAPs), with 27% (3 of 11) meeting criteria for borderline pulmonary hypertension (mPAP, 19-24 mm Hg) and 18% (2 of 11) meeting criteria for overt pulmonary hypertension (mPAP >= 25 mm Hg). Pulmonary vascular resistance and elastance were higher at rest and during exercise, suggesting a stiffer vascular bed. Preterm subjects were significantly less able to augment cardiac index or right ventricular stroke work during exercise. Among neonatal characteristics, total ventilatory support days was the strongest predictor of adult pulmonary pressure. Conclusions: Young adults born preterm demonstrate early pulmonary vascular disease, characterized by elevated pulmonary pressures, a stiffer pulmonary vascular bed, and right ventricular dysfunction, consistent with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - Backgroud: Recent research has focused on the role of immune cells and immune responses in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the exact mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Previously, the key roles of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in the lung immune network of BPD were explored. Here, we investigated the role Th17 cell response in hyperoxia-induced lung injury of BPD, as well as the relationship between ILC2 and Th17 cell response. Method(s): A hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model was constructed and the pathologic changes of lung tissues were evaluated by Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to determine the levels of Th17 cell, ILC2 and IL-6+ILC2. The expression levels of IL-6, IL-17 A, IL-17 F, and IL-22 in the blood serum and lung tissues of BPD mice were measured by ELISA. To further confirm the relationship between ILC2 and Th17 cell differentiation, ILC2 depletion was performed in BPD mice. Furthermore, we used immunomagnetic beads to enrich ILC2 and then flow-sorted mouse lung CD45+Lin-CD90.2+Sca-1+ILC2. The sorted ILC2s were injected into BPD mice via tail vein. Following ILC2 adoptive transfusion, the changes of Th17 cell response and lung injury were detected in BPD mice. Result(s): The expression levels of Th17 cells and Th17 cell-related cytokines, including IL-17 A, IL-17 F, and IL-22, were significantly increased in BPD mice. Concurrently, there was a significant increase in the amount of ILC2 and IL-6+ILC2 during hyperoxia-induced lung injury, which was consistent with the trend for Th17 cell response. Compared to the control BPD group, ILC2 depletion was found to partially abolish the Th17 cell response and had protective effects against lung injury after hyperoxia. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of ILC2 enhanced the Th17 cell response and aggravated lung injury in BPD mice. Conclusion(s): This study found that ILC2 regulates hyperoxia-induced lung injury by targeting the Th17 cell response in BPD, which shows a novel strategy for BPD immunotherapy.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - To evaluate the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for multidrug-resistant bacterial infection (MDRI) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) readmitted to the hospital due to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), providing a basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of MDRI.A retrospective analysis of readmission due to LRTI in infants with BPD within 1 year corrected age from October 2012 to December 2020 was performed. Twenty-nine children with MDRI were selected as the case group, and 80 children without MDRI during the same period served as the control group. We reviewed and collected relevant infants' neonatal hospitalization experience, broad-spectrum antibiotic (BSA) selection, and microbiological data. BSA included carbapenem antibiotics, third-generation cephalosporins and cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, and penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor (P/BLI) combinations.The length of stay in hospitalized patients with MDRI was significantly prolonged (p < 0.05), and the BSA use rate was high (>94.1%). Single-level factor analyses showed that nosocomial infection and the P/BLI usage rate in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) were related to MDRIs (all p < 0.05). NICU-MDRI, BSA, dual antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation were not significantly associated with MDRIs on readmission (all p > 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis indicated nosocomial infection as an independent risk factor related to MDRIs (Odds ratio (OR) 5.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-16.4).Nosocomial infection remains the most important risk factor for MDRI in BPD infants. For infants with BPD, more cautions should be taken on whether to choose BSA directly based on the bacterial species infected during the NICU or the long-term hospitalization history.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background & Aim: Allogeneic cell therapy represents a new era of treatment modality for currently intractable diseases. Safety and tolerability were demonstrated with allogenic amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) in a first-in-human Phase 1 trial in extremely premature infants with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The two-year follow up outcomes of this study has now been reported. Quality metrics are a critical component to address for achieving standardization of vial to vein workflow strategies. To better inform clinical studies, clinical grade hAEC immunosuppressive capacity and stability were assessed, with the aim of establishing the maximal holding time for thawed clinical grade hAECs. Methods, Results & Conclusion(s): Clinical grade hAECs were cocultured with donor T cells in the presence of CD3/CD28. Proliferation capacity of T cells (Cell Trace Violet) was measured using flow cytometry. To establish the maximal holding time of clinical grade hAECs, vials were thawed, pooled, and formulated with infusion solution as per patients' trial requirement. Viability was measured by Trypan blue dye exclusion. Results and Conclusions. hAECs from thirty-one donors were evaluated for immunomodulatory capacity. Compared to positive control, hAECs were able to inhibit proliferation of activated T cells. (One-way ANOVA, P<0.001) (Figure 1A). Interestingly, while all batches of hAECs were able to suppress T cell proliferation, the suppressive capacity varied between hAEC donors from a very immunosuppressive proliferation index of 1 to not very suppressive with a proliferation index of 2. Gaussian distribution (Figure 1B) demonstrated that majority of proliferation index data ranged between 1.5 -1.8. Clinical grade hAECs did not completely abrogate activated T cell responses. Lastly, we evaluated the maximum holding time of clinical hAECs following infusion prep (Figure 2). As viability is the most tested critical quality attribute in stability studies for cell therapy products, viability was assessed at hourly intervals following formulation at specific storage temperatures. Viability remained stable for over 4 hours between 15-30degreeC. (Two-way ANOVA, P> 0.05). Taken together, these assays provide valuable insights for profiling clinical grade hAECs. Studies to evaluate the utility of immunosuppressive capacity as a potency assay are underway. [Figure presented]Copyright © 2023 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy

AB  - Extremely preterm infants are born with immature lungs and are exposed to an inflammatory environment as a result of oxidative stress. This may lead to airway remodeling, cellular aging and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Reliable markers that predict the long-term consequences of BPD in infancy are still lacking. We analyzed two biomarkers of cellular aging and lung function, telomere length and YKL-40, respectively, at 10 years of age in children born preterm with a history of BPD (n = 29). For comparison, these markers were also evaluated in sex-and-age-matched children born at term with childhood asthma (n = 28). Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured in whole blood with qPCR and serum YKL-40 with ELISA, and both were studied in relation to gas exchange and the regional ventilation/perfusion ratio using three-dimensional V/Q-scintigraphy (single photon emission computer tomography, SPECT) in children with BPD. Higher levels of YKL-40 were associated with shorter leukocyte RTL (Pearson's correlation: -0.55, p = 0.002), but were not associated with a lower degree of matching between ventilation and perfusion within the lung. Serum YKL-40 levels were significantly higher in children with BPD compared to children with asthma (17.7 vs. 13.2 ng/mL, p < 0.01). High levels of YKL-40 and short RTLs were associated to the need for ventilatory support more than 1 month in the neonatal period (p < 0.01). The link between enhanced telomere shortening in childhood and structural remodeling of the lung, as observed in children with former BPD but not in children with asthma at the age of 10 years, suggests altered lung development related to prematurity and early life inflammatory exposure. In conclusion, relative telomere length and YKL-40 may serve as biomarkers of altered lung development as a result of early-life inflammation in children with a history of prematurity.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this review, the Basic and Translational Science Assembly of the European Respiratory Society provides an overview of the 2022 International Congress highlights. We discuss the consequences of respiratory events from birth until old age regarding climate change related alterations in air quality due to pollution caused by increased ozone, pollen, wildfires and fuel combustion as well as the increasing presence of microplastic and microfibres. Early life events such as the effect of hyperoxia in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and crucial effects of the intrauterine environment in the context of pre-eclampsia were discussed. The Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) was put forward as a new point of reference for healthy human lungs. The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data in the HLCA has enabled the discovery of new cell types/states and niches, and served as a platform that facilitates further investigation of mechanistic perturbations. The role of cell death modalities in regulating the onset and progression of chronic lung diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target was also discussed. Translational studies identified novel therapeutic targets and immunoregulatory mechanisms in asthma. Lastly, it was highlighted that the choice of regenerative therapy depends on disease severity, ranging from transplantation to cell therapies and regenerative pharmacology.Copyright © The authors 2023.

AB  - Premature newborns are a special category of children with their inherent morpho-functional immaturity and specific pathological conditions that cause significant differences in the survival, morbidity and their baby care consequences in comparison with children of other weight categories. The problems of premature babies are at the forefront of neonatal research and perinatal care. Purpose - to establish a link between the formation of adverse consequences in preschool children born prematurely, with a body weight of less than 1500 g, and placental changes. Materials and methods. The study involved 220 preschool children born prematurely. The results of a pathomorphological study of the placentae of mothers of 220 children were analyzed. Its results enabled to distinguish 5 groups of mothers according to the classification of changes in the placentae. In the course of the study, this category of children was under observation of the doctors the Prematurity and Hight-Risk Neonates Post-discharge Follow-ups Department in order to regular assess their health. Clinical indicators such as body weight, height, head circumference, neurological, general cognitive development and low severity dysfunction, the post-discharge history including respiratory diseases, skeletal system problems, hematological and metabolic disorders, were analyzed. Ophthalmological and audiological examinations were performed prospectively to assess vision and hearing. Depending on the severity of disabling pathology, children with severe disabling consequences (n=54) were isolated - 24.5%. Further analysis concerned the state of health of these children, divided into 5 groups according to the identified changes in the placentas of their mothers. Results. All the children involved in the study had a disease combination in the neonatal period that caused severe conditions. Pathological changes of the placenta significantly affected the course of the neonatal period. Thus, newborns with signs of inflammatory changes and immaturity were 10 times more likely to suffer generalized intrauterine infections and neonatal sepsis, they also significantly more frequently have intraventricular hemorrhages, periventricular leu-komalacia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The course of the neonatal period in groups of children with signs of premature aging of placenta and blood flow disorders was characterized by a low frequency of infections, but periventricular leukomalacia was diagnosed 5 times more often. Conclusions. It was found out that transplacental infection and pathological placenta immaturity had a negative impact on the health of children of groups III and IV, causing their birth 3 weeks prematurely, unlike the children in the comparison group. Newborns of groups III and IV needed resuscitation care in the delivery room 9 times more often, and the need for respiratory support was 10 times higher than in the comparison group, which predetermined a significantly longer duration of hospital stay for children of groups III and IV - on average 30-45 days longer compared to newborns of Group V. The research was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki declaration. The study protocol was approved by the Local ethics committee of the participating institution. The informed consent of the patient was obtained for conducting the studies. No conflict of interest was declared by the author.Copyright © 2022 Group of Companies Med Expert, LLC.

AB  - Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a psychostimulant that acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist. It is a naturally occurring central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class that can be isolated from more than sixty plants, but can also be produced synthetically and added to our daily foods and medicines. Depending on the plant in which it occurs, it is referred to by a different name, such as guaranine (when it comes from guarana seeds), matein (when it comes from yerba mate), and theine (when it comes from tea leaves). It is considered the most often used psychoactive drug in the world. It is used in the preparation of daily beverages to refresh and offset symptoms of mental and physical fatigue, which are commonly used around the world in the form of coffee, tea or chocolate. There are also many medications containing caffeine, and the substance is also added to carbonated drinks (Pepsi, Coca-Cola) and energy drinks. After oral administration, caffeine is quickly and completely (i.e.99%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (especially the small intestine), caffeine is distributed throughout the body. It penetrates all tissues through cell membranes and enters the water space of tissues. Caffeine is practically completely biotransformed in the liver, only 2% of the ingested dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Caffeine metabolism is affected by many exogenous and endogenous factors, such as genetics, age, gender, pregnancy, diet, lifestyle, smoking, environmental factors, drugs and diseases. Caffeine is removed from the body mainly by the kidneys. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has approved caffeine for use in the treatment of apnea and the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Caffeine modifies the effects of some medications. Caffeine has a wide range of effects on the body, both positive and negative, that may partially affect the variability of caffeine consumption between individuals.Copyright © 2022 by American Animal Hospital Association.

AB  - Introduction: Ascites is defined as a collection of more than 25mL of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, most commonly caused by liver cirrhosis. Cardiogenic ascites from heart failure contributes to 5% of cases. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication of ascites, defined as an infection of ascitic fluid in the absence of a surgically treatable source. This is more commonly associated with hepatic cirrhosis. Here we present a case of SBP in a patient with cardiogenic ascites. Case Description/Methods: Patient is a 37-year-old male with right sided heart failure secondary to bronchopulmonary dysplasia with no history of liver disease. The patient was found to have dyspnea and anasarca, so he was admitted for heart failure exacerbation. CT of the abdomen showed large volume ascites and hepatomegaly. While being diuresed, 5L of ascitic fluid was removed via paracentesis. Analysis revealed a serum albumin-ascites gradient (SAAG) of 0.7, protein 4.5, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 948, and negative culture. The patient was then started on ceftriaxone for SBP. An additional 4.5L was removed via paracentesis 3 days later due to worsening ascites. Analysis at that time showed SAAG 0.6, protein 4.2, and ANC 4,808. No cultures were reported. Antibiotics were escalated to piperacillintazobactam due to worsening ANC. A third paracentesis was performed 3 days later after reaccumulation of ascites (3.2L) and to assess therapeutic response. Peritoneal fluid analysis revealed SAAG 0.8, protein 3.7, ANC 2,931, and negative culture. At this point, the infectious disease team was consulted, recommending discontinuation of antibiotics and close monitoring. Patient was discharged 6 days later as he was afebrile and without leukocytosis. Discussion(s): The pathophysiology of SBP is thought to be related to bacterial translocation and impaired immunity, specifically deficiencies in complement protein neutrophil function. This is reflected by low ascites protein. However, SBP is exceedingly rare in cardiogenic ascites with only 8 cases reported. This is likely secondary to the high protein and opsonic character in this type of ascites, developing from elevated intrahepatic pressures and congestive hepatopathy. This composition of ascites fluid yields antimicrobial activity similar to normal peritoneal fluid. Perhaps this was the reason for the patient's elevated ANC despite negative cultures. Future studies could focus on the role of antibiotics and prophylaxis in these patients.

AB  - Background: 8p inversion duplication deletion syndrome (8p invdupdel) is an uncommon chromosomal anomaly that is seen in approximately 1/20,000 births. It is thought to be caused by abnormal pairing of chromosomes during meiosis I, leading to unequal crossover. Manifestations include hypotonia, facial abnormalities, agenesis of the corpus colosseum, and intellectual and developmental delays. We present a case of a 3-month-old female born at 28+1 weeks gestation via cesarean section after early delivery due to HELLP syndrome. The pregnancy was complicated by intrauterine growth restriction and agenesis of the corpus collosum diagnosed on ultrasound, prompting amniocentesis, and revealing the diagnosis of 8p invdupdel. At birth, the patient was transferred to the NICU due to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and central hypoventilation. A PDA coil was placed successfully at about 11 weeks of age. The patient was stable before deteriorating 10 days later. She developed pulmonary hypertension, likely caused by pneumonia. She ultimately died due to suspected aspiration and ventilator associated pneumonia. PCR revealed the infection was caused by Pseudomonas and Klebsiella. Method(s): At the request of the family, hospital autopsy and medical records review were performed via standardized pediatric autopsy procedures. Result(s): At autopsy, findings consistent with 8p invdupdel were noted. Her ears were low set, below the palpebral fissure, and the nasal bridge was broad with anteverted nares. Her forehead was prominent, and her neck was shorter than average. There was congenital absence of the gallbladder and complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Evaluation of the cardiovascular system revealed the coiling device in place, a patent foramen ovale, and a single ventricular septal defect. Both lungs were diffusely consolidated with copious, purulent fluid in the right mainstem bronchus, consistent with the diagnosis of pneumonia. The right upper lobe was also found to have multiple intraparenchymal nodules and pleural plaques. On microscopic examination, mixed inflammation, bronchial and vessel destruction, necrosis, and copious bacilli organisms were present. All other organ systems were unremarkable. Conclusion(s): While 8p invdupdel is not a fatal disease, certain features likely contributed to disease progression in this patient. Hypotonia increases susceptibility to developing pneumonia as muscle hypotonia can lead to hypoventilation and atelectasis, as well as impaired swallowing and subsequent aspiration. A case study was published in 2022 of an infant with Prader Willi Syndrome that died from infection after aspiration of tube feedings secondary to hypotonia from his condition. Ultimately, the combination of prematurity, chromosomal anomaly, and complications of medical therapy related to this all contributed to the patient's demise.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated are at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. No treatment is available for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Preterm birth is associated with rapid decline in plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) protein level. We used our preterm lamb model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia to determine if recombinant human (rh) IGF-1 bound to binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) improves respiratory gas exchange indices. Methods Used: Preterm lambs (~128d gestation; saccular stage lung development) were divided into two groups, both of which were mechanically ventilated for 7d (Drager VN500, PC-SIMV mode). Group 1 was given continuous infusion of saline (vehicle control, iv; n=8; 4F 4M). Group 2 was given continuous infusion of rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 (optimzed dosage of 1.5 mg/Kg/d, iv; n=9; 4F 5M). Respiratory severity score, oxygenation index (Oi), SpO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratio, PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio, Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, resistance (R), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), and last 20% end expiratory compliance (20/Cdyn) were measured. Summary of Results: Preterm lambs treated with rhIGF-1/rhIGFB-3 had statistically better respiratory severity score, , S/F ratio, P/F ratio, oxygenation index, and A-a gradient (Fig 1). No significant differences were detected for lung compliance, as measure by R, Cdyn, and 20/Cdyn. Conclusion(s): Continuous infusion of rhIGF1/rhIGFBP-3 during 7d of mechanical ventilation improved respiratory gas exchange indices, but not respiratory system mechanics in preterm lambs. We suggest that rhIGF-1/rhIGFB-3 may be an effective treatment for preterm infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) seriously affects the health and prognosis of children, but the efficacy of treatments is poor. The present study aimed to examine the effects of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3beta (LC3B), and the interaction between CHOP and LC3B, in newborn rats with BPD. At 1, 7, 14 and 21 days, the rats in the model [fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)=80-85%] and control groups (FiO2=21%) were randomly sacrificed, and lung samples were collected. Alveolar development was evaluated according to the radial alveolar count (RAC) and alveolar septum thickness. Ultrastructural changes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the expression levels of CHOP, ATF4 and LC3B were determined by immunohistochemistry, and western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. The co-localization of CHOP and LC3B in lung tissues was determined by immunofluorescence. The results showed that, compared with the control group, alveolarization arrest was present in the model group. The TEM observations revealed that, at 14 days, type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII) lamellar bodies were damaged, with an apparent dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and autophagy in cells within the model group. Between days 7 and 14, the protein levels of ATF4, CHOP and LC3B were significantly increased in the model group. The mRNA levels of CHOP and LC3B were lower at days 7-21. CHOP and LC3B were co-localized in the cells of the lung tissues at day 14 in the model group. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the protein levels of CHOP and LC3B-II were positively correlated in the model groups. As in previous studies, the present study demonstrated that BPD damaged the AECII cells, which exhibited detached and sparse microvilli and the vacuolization of lamellar bodies. In addition, it was found that the ER was dilated, with autophagosomes containing ER and other organelles in AECII cells; the expression levels of CHOP and LC3B-II were upregulated. CHOP and LC3B-II may have joint involvement in the occurrence and development of BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Impaired glomerular vascular development after postnatal events such as mechanical ventilation (MV) underlies different diseases of prematurity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles (MEx) treatment improved alveolar formation in preterm lambs supported by mechanical ventilation for 6-7d (Major, 2022). We tested the hypothesis that MEx will improve glomerular capillary formation in the same preterm lambs. Methods Used: Kidneys of preterm lambs (128d; term ~150d; ~28w human gestation) were analyzed. The preterm lambs were exposed to antenatal steroids, perinatal surfactant replacement, and resuscitated and supported by mechanical ventilation for 6-7d (Drager VN500, SIMV). Physiological targets were PaO2 60-90 mmHg, PaCO2 45-60 mmHg, O2 saturation 88-92%, pH 7.25-7.35. The control group received vehicle (MEx diluent in saline; 10 mL; n=8; 4F 4M). The MEx-treated group received 60 x 106 cell equivalents of MEx (10 mL; n=8; 4F 4M). Treatment was limited to hours of life 6 and 78 (iv). We used morphometry and stereology to quantify surface density of glomerular capillaries (Sv gc), using immunohistochemically stained tissue sections (anti-CD31 antibody). Summary of Results: Sv gc was significantly greater in the MEx-treated group compared to the control group (Fig 1A). MEx treatment was also associated with better enteral feeding tolerance (Fig 1B), stable weight (Fig 1C), and equivalent urine output (Fig 1D). MEx treatment did not alter plasma levels of BUN, bilirubin direct, total bilirubin, creatinine, total protein, or albumin. No differences were detected between females and males. Conclusion(s): We conclude that MEx improved glomerular capillary formation in mechanically ventilated preterm lambs. We speculate that MEx may be an effective therapy to promote structural development of the kidney, in addition to the lung, in preterm infants at-risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Purpose of Study: AAP recommends use of expressed breast milk (EBM) or donor human milk (DHM) in preterm infants fortified with proteins, minerals, and vitamins to ensure optimal nutrient intake. A higher rate of hypoglycemia has been seen in our center after the implementation of an exclusive human milk (EHM) diet in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Cream derived from human milk can be used to increase caloric intake for infants with poor weight gain on EHM feeding. The objective of this study is to assess the clinical impact of adding human milk cream to an EHM diet in VLBW infants. Methods Used: Retrospective study of all VLBW infants admitted to neonatal intensive care unit receiving EHM feeding before and after the implementation of cream supplementation to EHM started at 100 ml/kg/day of enteral feeding from November 2017 - March 2022. Infants in the cream cohort were included in the study if they received > 7 days of cream. Neonatal demographics, growth velocity, laboratory values and clinical outcomes such as severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), late-onset sepsis (LOS), were collected. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose < 55 mg/dL within 72 of reaching full enteral feeding and off of TPN or intravenous fluids. Summary of Results: A total of 90 infants were included in the study. 56 received EHM (median birth weight [BW]: 937 g and median gestational age [GA]: 26.8 weeks), and 34 received EHM + Cream (median BW: 947 g, GA: 27.8 weeks). Median duration of cream supplementation was 29 days. There was no significant difference in rates of BPD, ROP, and LOS. The growth velocity in the cream cohort was not significantly higher before transition to a bovine containing diet but the cream cohort had significantly higher median levels of serum sodium, potassium, and calcium at time of transition to a bovine containing diet. Median blood glucose levels were comparable, and incidence of hypoglycemia was lower but not significant. (Table) Conclusion(s): Our preliminary findings suggest that implementation of cream in VLBW infants led to improved electrolyte measures but has a limited impact on rate of hypoglycemia and growth. We hypothesize that hypoglycemia and growth can possibly be improved by the early initiation of cream supplementation but further studies with a larger study population is needed.
