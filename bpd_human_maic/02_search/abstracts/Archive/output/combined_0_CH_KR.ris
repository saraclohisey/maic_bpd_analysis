AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory disease in infants and children. MEDI-493 (palivizumab, Synagis) is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody to the fusion protein of RSV, and it is highly active in vitro against RSV A and B strains., OBJECTIVE: To describe the safety, tolerance, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of monthly intramuscular injections of MEDI-493 among premature infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and to compare these data with information previously obtained with intravenous dosing., DESIGN: A Phase I/II multicenter, open label, escalating dose clinical trial. PATIENT POPULATION AND DOSING REGIMEN: Children (n=65) born prematurely at < or =35 weeks of gestation who were < or =6 months of age (n=41) and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who were < or =24 months of age (n=24) were enrolled. From 1 to 5 monthly injections were given at doses of 5 mg/kg (n=11), 10 mg/kg (n=6) and 15 mg/kg (n=48). Serum was collected before administration of each dose, 30 days after the last dose, and 2, 7 and 14 days after the first and second doses for measurement of MEDI-493 concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of MEDI-493 were similar to those of other human IgG1 antibodies. Mean serum MEDI-493 concentrations were 91.1 microg/ml (range, 52.3 to 174.0) 2 days after the initial dose of 15 mg/kg and 49.2 microg/ml (range, 13.5 to 132.0) at 30 days. Monthly dosing of 15 mg/kg maintained mean trough concentrations of approximately 70 microg/ml. These concentrations were similar to previously published trough concentrations after i.v. administration. MEDI-493 injections were well-tolerated. Only three children had adverse events judged to be possibly related to MEDI-493. Ten children had transient, low titer anti-MEDI-493 binding titers (1:10 to 1:40) which were not associated with a pattern of specific adverse events or alterations of MEDI-493 concentrations. Two patients in the 5-mg/kg dose group were hospitalized for RSV; no RSV hospitalizations were found in the higher dose groups., CONCLUSIONS: MEDI-493 was safe and well-tolerated. Monthly intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg maintained mean trough serum concentrations that were above 40 microg/ml (the value associated with 99% reduction of pulmonary RSV in the cotton rat model). These concentrations were similar to those previously reported with i.v. administration of MEDI-493.

AB  - Rationale. Chronic lung disease in the preterm infant, i.e. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common complications in this patient cohort. Characterized by impaired alveolar and vascular development, mechanical ventilation along with oxygen toxicity and pre- and postnatal infections are known to increase the risk for the development of the disease. These risk factors are known to commonly induce pulmonary inflammation, indicated by the pulmonary presence of neutrophils and macrophages. Despite some insights into the pathopysiology, early markers indicating patients at risk are still missing. The purpose of this study was therefore to identify critical pathways and potential early markers that would enable timely diagnosis and potential treatment monitoring in patients with BPD. Objective and methods. Cord blood (CB) specimen from 22 preterm infants (cohort 1) were subjected to microarray-based gene expression analysis (Code Link) to identify critical pathways characterizing patients developing BPD. CB specimen from 110 preterm infants (cohort 2) were available for protein analysis (LuminexxMAP technology) to confirm potential early markers at birth indicating disease development. In vitro studies in fibroblasts isolated from tracheal aspirates (TA) of ventilated preterm infants after birth were used for confirmatory analyses. Results. In a comprehensive gene expression analysis, transcripts were analyzed in correlation with duration of assisted ventilation as well as the need for oxygen supplementation and corrected for the maturity of the preterm infant at birth. This advanced unsupervised clustering (PreAnalytiX; CodeLink human Uniset I 10k) revealed three main clusters of gene transcripts classified in preterms with no BPD and preterms who developed BPD. Genes correlated with the duration of ventilation and oxygen supply could be attributed to the categories apoptosis and inflammation/infection. Likewise, orthogonal partial least squares discriminance analysis (OPLS-DA) of protein results indicated a separation of BPD/no BPD through levels of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and EGF under consideration of gestational age, persistent ductus arteriosus and congenital infection. In line with this, the assessment of both analyses by ingenuity pathway analysis indicated an overlap of signaling pathways in preterms later developing BPD involving monocyte signaling and growth factor expression (epidermal growth factor- (EGF, ErbB), glucocorticoid receptor-, endocytosis- (macropinocytosis, caveolae-mediated), telomerase-, macrophage-stimulating protein- (MSP-Ron), interleukin-8, -6). In vitro analyses confirmed the proliverative effect of EGF on fibroblasts isolated from tracheal aspirates of preterms with BPD. Conclusion. Gene expression analyses and protein profiling from CB of preterms allows differentiation for later BPD diagnosis, indicating for increased monocyte signaling and fibroblast activation to play a central role in the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Hyperoxia contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We showed that newborn aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) dysfunctional mice are more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and alveolar simplification than wild type (WT) controls due to decreases in the expression of phase I (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A) and phase II (NADP(H) quinone oxidoreductase and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1) detoxifying enzymes. Whether AhR protects newborn human lung cells against hyperoxic injury is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that AhR deficient neonatal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) will have increased oxidative stress and cell death compared to AhR sufficient HPMEC upon exposure to hyperoxia. Methods Used: We knocked down AhR gene in HPMEC by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection and validated the results by western blotting and real-time RT-PCR analysis. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the HPMEC were exposed to room air (95% air and 5% CO2 at 370C) or hyperoxia (95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 370C) for upto 48 h. Following exposure, the cells were harvested to determine viability (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay), necrosis and apoptosis (Annexin V staining and flow cytometry), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (2'-7'- dichorodihyrofluorecein diacetate staining and flow cytometry), and AhR expression (western blotting and real-time RT-PCR analysis). Summary of Results: Interestingly, exposure to hyperoxia decreased AhR expression in HPMEC. In both AhR sufficient and deficient HPMEC, exposure to hyperoxia increased ROS generation and cell necrosis, and decreased cell viability. However, hyperoxia-induced ROS generation and cell death was significantly increased in AhR deficient cells compared to AhR sufficient cells. Conclusion(s): AhR deficient HPMEC have increased oxidative stress and cell death compared to AhR sufficient HPMEC upon exposure to hyperoxia. Our data suggest that strategies directed towards increasing AhR activation would be effective in the prevention and treatment of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Background: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) increases the risk and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), with males more severely affected than females. Infants who develop BPD do so following postnatal interventions, such as oxygen exposure. Histologically, BPD is characterized by increased elastin deposition and alveolar simplification. Male IUGR rats are vulnerable to mild hyperoxia (60% oxygen) exposure and develop increased lung elastin expression, increased elastic fiber deposition and alveolar simplification. Mild postnatal hyperoxia, on the other hand, does not affect female IUGR or control lungs. It is unknown if male IUGR rats who develop a BPD-like phenotype, following hyperoxia, will develop functional changes in lung mechanics. Objective(s): We hypothesized that exposure to 60% oxygen postnatally, will decrease lung static compliance in male IUGR rat pups but not female IUGR rat pups. Methods Used: IUGR (induced by uterine ligation) and control rat pups were exposed to 60% oxygen or room air from postnatal days 3-6. Rat pups were kept with the dam in room air to postnatal day 21 (d21). Pup nutrition was not affected. At postnatal d21, closed chest, lung static compliance was measured using the FlexiVent System. Summary of Results: In male IUGR lungs, 60% hyperoxia from days 3-6 decreased static compliance relative to sex-matched room air control (79+/- 15%, p<0.05) and sex-matched hyperoxia control (83+/-12%, p<0.05). In female IUGR rat lungs, 60% hyperoxia from days 3-6 did not affect static compliance relative to sex-matched room air control or hyperoxia control. Conclusion(s): These novel findings indicate that the male IUGR rat lung is vulnerable to alterations in lung mechanics in response to mild hyperoxia from days 3-6. Hyperoxia that was not severe enough to affect control lungs. Gene expression of elastin and other lung repair genes is altered in the male IUGR rat lung before, as well as after, hyperoxia exposure. We speculate that IUGR, alters the regulation of expression of lung repair genes, rendering the lung hyper-responsive to a second hit that otherwise does not cause lung injury.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have confirmed that prolonged inhalation of high concentrations of oxygen not only can cause acute lung tissue damage, but also can affect the further development of neonatal lung tissue,leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) of the occurrence and prognosis of severely affected newborns quality of life, and the treatment of hyperoxiainduced lung injury is still no effective method. Xuebijing injection from safflower, Chuanxiong, Salvia, Angelica, Paeonia, composed of pure Chinese medicine, used for sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in the treatment, and obtained significant effects . Objective By observing the protective effects of Xuebijing injection on hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats. Method(s): The 22-day gestation full term rats in 12 hours after birth were randomly marked with a different number and assigned to six groups: air + NS group,air + Dexamethasone group, air + Xuebijing group, group,hyperoxia + NS group, hyperoxia + Dexamethasone group and hyperoxia + Xuebijing group. After 5 days of hyperoxia exposure,the animals were killed .Some of them were detected the ratio of lung wet weight to lung dry weight (W/D) and lung tissue HE staining.Some of them were detected the content of protein, TNF-alpha, the counts of inflammatory cell and IL-10 of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Result(s): 1. After exposing in hyperoxia environment for 5 days, the animal case fatality ratio, the ratio of lung wet weight to lung dry weight, the content of protein, TNF-alpha and of the counts of inflammatory cell of BALF in hyperoxia group was significantly higher than the air control group. 2. Apply Xuebijing when hyperoxia exposing can lower the death ratio, ease the rising of lung tissue W/D, protein content in BALF, Leucocyte number, and the rising of TNF-alpha; increase IL-10 content in BALF. The curative effect is better than dexamethasone. Conclusion(s): 1. Xuebijing can reduce high mortality of SD rats due to continued hyperoxia exposing, ease the degree of acute hyperoxic lung injury, and its efficacy is superior to dexamethasone. 2. Xuebijing probably by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) production, and promote the production to play its protective effect.

AB  - Background: Alveolar macrophages (AM) exhibit significant phenotypic plasticity. Depending on the microenvironment, they undergo distinct polarization that either propagates inflammation, or alternatively promotes tissue repair. Inflammation-related genes are increased in M1-polarized cells, whereas, M2 polarized cells are important for tissue remodeling. No information is currently available on AM polarization in preterm neonates at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We speculate AM polarization may be perturbed in this paradigm. Aim(s): To assess the polarization state of AM obtained from the tracheal aspirates (TA) of preterm neonates at risk for BPD. Method(s): We obtained serial TA samples from a cohort of intubated preterm infants. The neonates were in two groups: Group 1, infants born between 22 and 30 weeks' gestation (High BPD risk). Group 2 included infants born between 31 and 36 weeks' gestation (Low BPD Risk). The inflammatory cells were isolated and subjected to Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) using antibodies against specific surface markers. Anti-CD14 and Anti-CD163 were used to identify M1- and M2- polarized AMs, respectively. The infants' clinical data were also analyzed. Result(s): TA samples from 12 preterm neonates were collected and analyzed. Among the subjects, only 5 neonates survived without BPD. FACS analysis was performed on 47 samples. The percentile of CD14-positive AM was highly variable in both High and Low BPD Risk groups. No differences were found between the two groups. The abundance of M1-polarized AM did not correlate with the risk for BPD or death. Interestingly, in a small number of Group 2 neonates M2-polarized AM increased as a function of postnatal age. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze polarization of AM in the lungs of neonates at risk for BPD. The relationship between AM polarization and BPD appears complex. In the neonates examined, M1 polarization did not correlate with BPD risk. Additional studies are underway to elucidate the role of AM polarization in BPD.

AB  - Myeloid cells are key factors in the progression of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis. Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) mediates myeloid cell trafficking. The origin and physiological mechanism by which EMAP II affects pathogenesis in BPD is unknown. The objective was to determine the functional consequences of elevated EMAP II levels in the pathogenesis of murine BPD and to investigate EMAP II neutralization as a therapeutic strategy. Three neonatal mouse models were used: (1) BPD (hyperoxia), (2) EMAP II delivery, and (3) BPD with neutralizing EMAP II antibody treatments. Chemokinic function of EMAP II and its neutralization were assessed by migration in vitro and in vivo. We determined the location of EMAP II by immunohistochemistry, pulmonary proinflammatory and chemotactic gene expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, lung outcome by pulmonary function testing and histological analysis, and right ventricular hypertrophy by Fulton's Index. In BPD, EMAP II initially is a bronchial club-cell-specific protein-derived factor that later is expressed in galectin-3+ macrophages as BPD progresses. Continuous elevated expression corroborates with baboon and human BPD. Prolonged elevation of EMAP II levels recruits galectin-3+ macrophages, which is followed by an inflammatory state that resembles a severe BPD phenotype characterized by decreased pulmonary compliance, arrested alveolar development, and signs of pulmonary hypertension. In vivo pharmacological EMAP II inhibition suppressed proinflammatory genes Tnfa, Il6, and Il1b and chemotactic genes Ccl2 and Ccl9 and reversed the severe BPD phenotype. EMAP II is sufficient to induce macrophage recruitment, worsens BPD progression, and represents a targetable mechanism of BPD development.

AB  - Background: Intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI) is associated with increased risk of preterm birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the mechanisms by which IAI leads to preterm birth and BPD are poorly understood, and there are no effective therapies for preterm birth and BPD. The transcription factor c-Myc regulates various biological processes like cell growth, apoptosis, and inflammation. We hypothesized that c-Myc modulates inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface, and neonatal lung remodeling. The objectives of our study were 1) to determine the kinetics of c-Myc in the placenta, fetal membranes and neonatal lungs exposed to IAI, and 2) to determine the role of c-Myc in modulating inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface, and neonatal lung remodeling induced by IAI. Methods: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: 1) Intra-amniotic saline injections only (control), 2) Intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections only, and 3) Intra-amniotic LPS injections with c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4. c-Myc expression, markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, immunohistochemistry, and transcriptomic analyses were performed on placenta and fetal membranes, and neonatal lungs to determine kinetics of c-Myc expression in response to IAI, and effects of prenatal systemic c-Myc inhibition on lung remodeling at postnatal day 14. Results: c-Myc was upregulated in the placenta, fetal membranes, and neonatal lungs exposed to IAI. IAI caused neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in the placenta and fetal membranes, and neonatal lung remodeling with pulmonary hypertension consistent with a BPD phenotype. Prenatal inhibition of c-Myc with 10058-F4 in IAI decreased neutrophil infiltration and NET formation, and improved neonatal lung remodeling induced by LPS, with improved alveolarization, increased angiogenesis, and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling. Discussion: In a rat model of IAI, c-Myc regulates neutrophil recruitment and NET formation in the placenta and fetal membranes. c-Myc also participates in neonatal lung remodeling induced by IAI. Further studies are needed to investigate c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for IAI and IAI-associated BPD.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants worldwide, yet its pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study sought to explore microRNA-mRNA regulatory networks and immune cells involvement in BPD through a combination of bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation., Methods: MicroRNA and mRNA microarray datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) were identified in BPD patients compared to control subjects, and their target genes were predicted using miRWalk, miRNet, miRDB, and TargetScan databases. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) and functional enrichment analyses were conducted on the target genes. 30 hub genes were screened using the Cytohubba plugin of the Cytoscape software. Additionally, mRNA microarray data was utilized to validate the expression of hub genes and to perform immune infiltration analysis. Finally, real-time PCR (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and flow cytometry were conducted using a mouse model of BPD to confirm the bioinformatics findings., Results: Two DEMs (miR-15b-5p and miR-20a-5p) targeting genes primarily involved in the regulation of cell cycle phase transition, ubiquitin ligase complex, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and MAPK signaling pathway were identified. APP and four autophagy-related genes (DLC1, PARP1, NLRC4, and NRG1) were differentially expressed in the mRNA microarray dataset. Analysis of immune infiltration revealed significant differences in levels of neutrophils and naive B cells between BPD patients and control subjects. RT-PCR and IHC confirmed reduced expression of APP in a mouse model of BPD. Although the proportion of total neutrophils did not change appreciably, the activation of neutrophils, marked by loss of CD62L, was significantly increased in BPD mice., Conclusion: Downregulation of APP mediated by miR-15b-5p and miR-20a-5p may be associated with the development of BPD. Additionally, increased CD62L- neutrophil subset might be important for the immune-mediated injury in BPD. Copyright © 2024 Li et al.

AB  - Background: The effect of gestational age (GA) on comorbidity prevalence, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and all-cause costs is significant for extremely premature (EP) infants in the United States. Objectives: To characterize real-world patient characteristics, prevalence of comorbidities, rates of HCRU, and direct healthcare charges and societal costs among premature infants in US Medicaid programs, with respect to GA and the presence of respiratory comorbidities. Methods: Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, diagnosis and medical claims data from 6 state Medicaid databases (1997-2018) of infants born at less than 37 weeks of GA (wGA) were collected retrospectively. Data from the index date (birth) up to 2 years corrected age or death, stratified by GA (EP, <=28 wGA; very premature [VP], >28 to <32 wGA; and moderate to late premature [M-LP], >=32 to <37 wGA), were compared using unadjusted and adjusted generalized linear models. Results: Among 25 573 premature infants (46.1% female; 4462 [17.4%] EP; 2904 [11.4%] VP; 18207 [71.2%] M-LP), comorbidity prevalence, HCRU, and all-cause costs increased with decreasing GA and were highest for EP. Total healthcare charges, excluding index hospitalization and all-cause societal costs (US dollars), were 2 to 3 times higher for EP than for M-LP (EP $74436 vs M-LP $27541 and EP $28504 vs M-LP $15892, respectively). Conclusions: Complications of preterm birth, including prevalence of comorbidities, HCRU, and costs, increased with decreasing GA and were highest among EP infants during the first 2 years in this US analysis.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the predictive value of umbilical cord blood Interleukin-6 (UCB IL-6) for the severity-graded BPD and to establish machine learning (ML) predictive models in a Chinese population based on the 2019 NRN evidence-based guidelines., Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we included infants born with gestational age <32 weeks, who underwent UCB IL-6 testing within 24 h of admission to our NICU between 2020 and 2022. We collected their medical information encompassing the maternal, perinatal, and early neonatal phases. Furthermore, we classified the grade of BPD according to the 2019 NRN evidence-based guidelines. The correlation between UCB IL-6 and the grades of BPD was analyzed. Univariate analysis and ordinal logistic regression were employed to identify risk factors, followed by the development of ML predictive models based on XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest. The AUROC was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of each model. Besides, we generated feature importance distribution plots based on SHAP values to emphasize the significance of UCB IL-6 in the models., Results: The study ultimately enrolled 414 preterm infants, with No BPD group (n = 309), Grade 1 BPD group (n = 73), and Grade 2-3 BPD group (n = 32). The levels of UCB IL-6 increased with the grades of BPD. UCB IL-6 demonstrated clinical significance in predicting various grades of BPD, particularly in distinguishing Grade 2-3 BPD patients, with an AUROC of 0.815 (95% CI: 0.753-0.877). All four ML models, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest, exhibited Micro-average AUROC values of 0.841, 0.870, 0.851, and 0.878, respectively. Notably, UCB IL-6 consistently appeared as the most prominent feature across the feature importance distribution plots in all four models., Conclusion: UCB IL-6 significantly contributes to predicting severity-graded BPD, especially in grade 2-3 BPD. Through the development of four ML predictive models, we highlighted UCB IL-6's importance. Copyright © 2023 Gao, Yang, Luo, Lei, Shi, Cheng, Zhang, Cao, Ren, Zhang, Wang and Zhang.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease commonly seen in preterm infants. It is characterized by delayed development of the alveoli and lung fibrosis. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is an inflammatory driver that plays a proinflammatory role mainly through the P38 MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway., METHODS: Newborn rat pups were kept under air or oxygen at >60% concentration. Lung tissues were collected at postnatal days (P) 1, 4, 7, and 10 to observe pathological changes and take measurements., RESULTS: In the hyperoxic group, P4 and P7 rats showed delayed alveolar development, septal thickening, and disturbances in alveolar structure.PAR2, P38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, and IL-18 expression at P4, P7, and P10 was significantly higher than in the air group., CONCLUSION: PAR2 is involved in lung injury induced by persistent hyperoxia. Activated PAR2 promotes IL-18 overexpression through the P38 MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, which may be an important mechanism of PAR2-mediated lung injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Premature infants are known to have immature immune systems compared to term infants; however, the impacts of ex utero immune development are not well characterized. Our previous retrospective clinical review showed prolonged T cell lymphopenia in a subset of extremely premature infants, suggesting that they may have lasting abnormalities in their T cell compartments. We used T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing to analyze the composition of the T cell compartment in premature and term infants in our NICU. We collected twenty-eight samples from individual subjects and analyzed the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity, CDR3 length, and V gene usage between groups based on gestational age at birth and postmenstrual age at the time of sample collection. Further, we examined the TCR repertoire in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and those with abnormal T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assays. Former extremely premature infants who were corrected to term postmenstrual age had TCR repertoire diversity that was more similar to term born infants than extremely premature infants, supporting normal maturation of the repertoire. Infants with severe BPD did not appear to have increased abnormalities in repertoire diversity. Decreased TCR repertoire diversity was associated with repeatedly abnormal TREC screening, although the diversity was within the normal range for subjects without low TRECs. This study suggests that extremely premature infants demonstrate normal maturation of the T cell repertoire ex utero. Further work is needed to better characterize postnatal T cell development and function in this population. Copyright © 2022 Morton, Schnur, Kerper, Young and O'Connell.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of prematurity and may cause substantial long-term disabilities. To characterize and compare the nasal swabs microbiome of early stage in premature infants and determine whether microbial diversity or composition in the nostrils associated with BPD disease. We performed a prospective observational cohort design. Preterm neonates less than or equal to 30 weeks of gestation were recruited from NICU, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from 2019 to 2020. Sterile foam swabs were collected from anterior nares at 1 and 3 weeks of postnatal age. We used PCR amplification and 16S rDNA sequencing. Neonatal demographic data including gestational age, birth weight, medication administration history and discharge outcomes were recorded. A total of 49 nasal swab samples were collected from 28 premature infants. Thirteen infants with BPD and 15 controls were finally involved in the study. Birth weights ranged from 700 to 1550 g. Gestational age ranged from 252/7 to 30. We found increased in the expression of Prevotella and decreased of Caulobacter in BPD group at both times. Prevotella and Caulobacter were correlated with the severity of BPD (Spearman r = 0.551, r = - 0.545; P = 0.00005, 0.00006; respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under characteristic curve of Caulobacter model at first week reached 0.821 and Prevotella model at third week was 0.796. Moreover, microbial functional prediction analysis revealed that ABC-type transports were distinctively changed in BPD group. In summary, the use of non-invasive nasal swabs of microbiome to explore the pathophysiology in BPD is a compelling method worthy continuing to expand and research. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly found in premature infants. Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to BPD occurrence and development. Simvastatin, as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, has been reported to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its effect and possible mechanisms in hyperoxia-induced lung injury are rarely reported. In this study, in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to investigate whether simvastatin could ameliorate hyperoxia-induced lung injury and explore its potential mechanism. For the in vivo study, simvastatin could improve alveolar development after hyperoxic lung injury and reduce hyperoxic stress and inflammation. The in vitro study revealed that simvastatin can reduce inflammation in A549 cells after high-oxygen exposure. Simvastatin suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and played anti-inflammatory and antioxidant roles by increasing KLF2 (Kruppel-like factor 2) expression. In vitro experiments also revealed that these effects of simvastatin were partially reversed by KLF2 shRNA, indicating that KLF2 was involved in simvastatin effects. In summary, our findings indicate that simvastatin could downregulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and attenuate lung injury in hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia via KLF2-mediated mechanism.

AB  - AIMS: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common respiratory disease in newborns; however, there is no effective treatment. We aimed to investigate the effects of the potential probiotics Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Bifidobacterium bifidum on BPD using 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomics methods., METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal samples were collected from 10 BPD patients and 10 healthy subjects. 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that microbial diversity was decreased and compositions were affected in BPD. Escherichia-Shigella and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 were increased in the BPD group, and Enterobacteriaceae, Megamonas, Blautia, Lactobacillus (Limosilactobacillus), [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group, Phascolarctobacterium and Bifidobacterium were reduced. Metabolomics analysis identified 129 differentiated metabolites that were changed in BPD patients, and they were associated with a preference for carbohydrate metabolism in translation and metabolism during genetic information processing. Correlation analysis revealed a remarkable relationship between gut microbiota and metabolites. Subsequently, a BPD cell model was constructed to test the effect of the potential probiotics. Cell function experiments verified that treatment with the potential probiotics L. reuteri and B. bifidum promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells. In addition, treatment with the potential probiotics L. reuteri and B. bifidum reduced inflammation and oxidative stress damage., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the potential probiotics L. reuteri and B. bifidum could alleviate BPD and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress damage., SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: This study was the first to report positive roles for the potential probiotics L. reuteri and B. bifidum in BPD. The potential probiotics L. reuteri and B. bifidum were shown to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress damage in BPD. This study provided new insights on the pathogenesis and treatment of BPD.

AB  - Background: Gut microbiota has been proposed to be related to the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as asthma and lung cancer, according to the gut-lung axis. However, little is known about the roles of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This study was designed to investigate the changes of gut microbiota in neonatal mice with BPD., Methods: BPD model was induced through exposure to high concentration of oxygen. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was utilized to determine the modeling efficiency. Stool samples were collected from the distal colon for the sequencing of V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA, in order to analyze the gut microbiota diversity., Results: Alpha diversity indicated that there were no statistical differences in the richness of gut microbiota between BPD model group and control group on day 7, 14 and 21. Beta diversity analysis showed that there were statistical differences in the gut microbiota on day 14 (R = 0.368, p = 0.021). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that there were 22 markers with statistical differences on day 14 (p < 0.05), while those on day 7 and 21 were 3 and 4, respectively. Functional prediction analysis showed that the top three metabolic pathways were signal transduction (PFDR = 0.037), glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (PFDR = 0.032), and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides (PFDR = 0.049)., Conclusions: BPD mice showed disorder of gut microbiota, which may involve specific metabolic pathways in the early stage. With the progression of neonatal maturity, the differences of the gut microbiota between the two groups would gradually disappear. Copyright © 2022 Fan et al.

AB  - During gestation, the most drastic change in oxygen supply occurs with the onset of ventilation after birth. As the too early exposure of premature infants to high arterial oxygen pressure leads to characteristic diseases, we studied the adaptation of the oxygen sensing system and its targets, the hypoxia-inducible factor- (HIF-) regulated genes (HRGs) in the developing lung. We draw a detailed picture of the oxygen sensing system by integrating information from qPCR, immunoblotting, in situ hybridization, and single-cell RNA sequencing data in ex vivo and in vivo models. HIF1alpha protein was completely destabilized with the onset of pulmonary ventilation, but did not coincide with expression changes in bona fide HRGs. We observed a modified composition of the HIF-PHD system from intrauterine to neonatal phases: Phd3 was significantly decreased, while Hif2a showed a strong increase and the Hif3a isoform Ipas exclusively peaked at P0. Colocalization studies point to the Hif1a-Phd1 axis as the main regulator of the HIF-PHD system in mouse lung development, complemented by the Hif3a-Phd3 axis during gestation. Hif3a isoform expression showed a stepwise adaptation during the periods of saccular and alveolar differentiation. With a strong hypoxic stimulus, lung ex vivo organ cultures displayed a functioning HIF system at every developmental stage. Approaches with systemic hypoxia or roxadustat treatment revealed only a limited in vivo response of HRGs. Understanding the interplay of the oxygen sensing system components during the transition from saccular to alveolar phases of lung development might help to counteract prematurity-associated diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous study showed that the lungs are involved in the biogenesis of platelets (PLTs). Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the association between bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, and PLT parameters in very premature infants., METHODS: The study subjects were premature infants with a gestational age of <= 30 weeks and birth weight of <= 1500 g in a preterm birth cohort study recruited between January 1, 2015, and August 31, 2019. BPD was defined as the need for oxygen supplementation more than 28 days after birth. The PLT count, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT) level were compared between BPD and non-BPD infants. A generalized estimating equation model was used to adjust for confounding factors. A forward stepwise logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for thrombocytopenia in the BPD group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of PLT count combined with gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) for BPD., RESULTS: The final study subjects were 134 very premature infants, namely, 64 infants with BPD and 70 infants without BPD. The BPD infants had lower PLT counts (F = 4.44, P = 0.03) and PCT levels (F = 12.54, P = 0.00) than the non-BPD infants. However, the MPV (F = 14.25, P = 0.00) and PDW (F = 15.04, P = 0.00) were higher in the BPD group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the BPD infants had a higher risk of thrombocytopenia than the non-BPD infants (adjusted aOR 2.88, 95% CI 1.01-8.15), and the risk of BPD was increased in very premature infants with a PLT count <= 177*109/L (OR 4.74, 95% CI 1.93-11.62) at the end of the second week. In the multivariate predictive model, it was showed that the AUC area (0.85), sensitivity (0.88), specificity (0.70) and Youden index (0.58) are improved using PLT counts <= 177*109/L combined with GA and BW., CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal PLT parameters were observed in BPD infants, and a PLT count <= 177*109/L was a potential risk factor for the development of BPD in very premature infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Discrete but ordered covariates are quite common in applied statistics, and some regularized fitting procedures have been proposed for proper handling of ordinal predictors in statistical models. Motivated by a study from neonatal medicine on Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), we show how quadratic penalties on adjacent dummy coefficients of ordinal factors proposed in the literature can be incorporated in the framework of generalized additive models, making tools for statistical inference developed there available for ordinal predictors as well., RESULTS: The approach presented allows to exploit the scale level of ordinally scaled factors in a sound statistical framework. Furthermore, several ordinal factors can be considered jointly without the need to collapse levels even if the number of observations per level is small. By doing so, results obtained earlier on the BPD data analyzed could be confirmed. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations between higher antibiotic use rates (AURs) and adverse outcomes in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants without culture-proven sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a multicenter of China., METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed on VLBW infants admitted to 24 neonatal intensive care units from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. AUR was calculated as calendar days of antibiotic therapy divided by total hospital days. The composite primary outcome was defined as mortality or severe morbidity, including any of the following: severe neurologic injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and stage 3 or higher retinopathy of prematurity., RESULTS: A total of 1,034 VLBW infants who received antibiotics without culture-proven sepsis or NEC were included in this study. The overall AUR of eligible VLBW infants was 55%, and the AUR of each eligible VLBW infant ranged from 3 to 100%, with a median of 56% (IQR 33%, 86%). After generalized propensity score and logistic regression analysis of 4 groups of VLBW infants with different AUR range, infants in the higher quartile AUR, (Q3, 0.57~0.86) and (Q4, 0.87~1.00), had higher odds of composite primary outcome (adjusted OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.23-2.67; adjusted OR 2.37; 95% CI: 1.59-3.54, respectively) and BPD (adjusted OR: 3.09; 95% CI: 1.52-6.57; adjusted OR 3.17; 95% CI: 1.56-6.57, respectively) than those in the lowest AUR (Q1)., CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic overexposure in VLBW infants without culture-proven sepsis or NEC was associated with increased risk of composite primary outcome and BPD. Rational empirical antibiotic use in VLBW infants is urgently needed in China. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that mainly affects premature newborns. Many different factors, increasingly genetic, are involved in the pathogenesis of BPD. The aim of the study is to investigate the possible influence of fibronectin SNP on the occurrence of BPD. The study included 108 infants born between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation. BPD was diagnosed based on the National Institutes of Health Consensus definition. The 5 FN1 gene polymorphisms assessed in the study were the following: rs3796123; rs1968510; rs10202709; rs6725958; and rs35343655. BPD developed in 30 (27.8%) out of the 108 preterm infants. Incidence of BPD was higher in infants with lower APGAR scores and low birthweight. Investigation did not confirm any significant prevalence for BPD development in any genotypes and alleles of FN1. Further studies should be performed to confirm the role of genetic factors in etiology and pathogenesis of BPD. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The level of linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has been proved to be a sensor of cell state, but its relationship with hyperoxia-induced alveolar type 2 epithelial cells injure and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been clarified. In this study, we evaluated if these effects ultimately led to functional damage in hyperoxia-induced alveolar cells., METHODS: We treated RLE-6TN cells at 85% hyperoxia for 0, 24 and 48 h with Thiamet G (TG), an OGA inhibitor; OSMI-1 (OS), an OGT inhibitor; or with UDP-GlcNAc, which is involved in synthesis of O-GlcNAc as a donor. The metabolic rerouting, cell viability and apoptosis resulting from the changes in O-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase levels were evaluated in RLE-6TN cells after hyperoxia exposure. We constructed rat Park2 overexpression and knockdown plasmmids for in vitro verification and Co-immunoprecipitation corroborated the binding of Parkin and O-GlcNAc. Finally, we assessed morphological detection in neonatal BPD rats with TG and OS treatment., RESULTS: We found a decrease in O-GlcNAc content and levels of its metabolic enzymes in RLE-6TN cells under hyperoxia. However, the inhibition of OGT function with OSMI-1 ameliorated hyperoxia-induced lung epithelial cell injury, enhanced cell metabolism and viability, reduced apoptosis, and accelerated the cell proliferation. Mitochondrial homeostasis was affected by O-GlcNAc and regulated Parkin., CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the decreased O-GlcNAc levels and increased O-GlcNAcylation of Parkin might cause hyperoxia-induced alveolar type II cells injurys.

AB  - Prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) increase the risk of asthma later in life. Supplemental oxygen therapy is a risk factor for chronic respiratory symptoms in infants with BPD. Hyperoxia induces cell injury and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Cytoskeletal filamentous actin (F-actin) is a DAMP which binds Clec9a, a C-type lectin selectively expressed on CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs). Co-stimulation of Clec9a and TLR3 induces maximal proinflammatory responses. We have shown that neonatal hyperoxia (a model of BPD) increases lung IL-12+Clec9a+CD103+ DCs, pro-inflammatory responses and airway hyperreactivity following rhinovirus (RV) infection. CD103+ DCs and Clec9a are required for these responses. Hyperoxia increases F-actin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We hypothesized that the F-actin severing protein gelsolin attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced Clec9a+CD103+ DC-dependent pro-inflammatory responses to RV and preserves alveolarization. We exposed neonatal mice to hyperoxia and treated them with gelsolin intranasally. Subsequently we inoculated the mice with RV intranasally. Alternatively, we inoculated normoxic neonatal mice with BALF from hyperoxia-exposed mice (hyperoxic BALF), RV and gelsolin. We analyzed lung gene expression two days after RV infection. For in vitro studies, lung CD11c+ cells were isolated from C57BL/6J or Clec9agfp-/- mice and incubated with hyperoxic BALF and RV. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In neonatal mice, gelsolin blocked hyperoxia-induced Il12p40, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma mRNA and protein expression in response to RV infection. Similar effects were observed when gelsolin was co-administered with hyperoxic BALF and RV. Gelsolin decreased F-actin levels in hyperoxic BALF in vitro and inhibited hyperoxia-induced D103lo DC expansion and inflammation in vivo. Gelsolin also attenuated hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization. Further, incubation of lung CD11c+ cells from WT and Clec9agfp-/- mice with hyperoxic BALF and RV, showed Clec9a is required for maximal hyperoxic BALF and RV induced IL-12 expression in CD103+ DCs. Finally, in tracheal aspirates from mechanically ventilated human preterm infants the F-actin to gelsolin ratio positively correlates with FiO2, and gelsolin levels decrease during the first two weeks of mechanical ventilation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a promising role for gelsolin, administered by inhalation into the airway to treat RV-induced exacerbations of BPD and prevent chronic lung disease.

AB  - RATIONALE: Clinical management of neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is often imprecise and can vary widely between different institutions and providers, due to limited objective measurements of disease pathology severity. There is critical need to improve guidance on the application and timing of interventional treatments, such as tracheostomy., OBJECTIVES: To generate an imaging-based clinical tool for early identification of those patients with BPD who are likely to require later tracheostomy and long-term mechanical ventilation., METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of n = 61 infants (55 BPD, 6 preterm non-BPD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores of lung parenchymal disease were used to create a binomial logistic regression model for predicting tracheostomy requirement. This model was further investigated using clinical variables and MRI-quantified tracheomalacia (TM)., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A model for predicting tracheostomy requirement was created using MRI parenchymal score. This model had 89% accuracy, 100% positive predictive value (PPV), and 85% negative predictive value (NPV), compared with 84%, 60%, and 83%, respectively, when using only relevant clinical variables. In a subset of patients with airway MRI (n = 36), a model including lung and TM measurements had 83% accuracy, 92% PPV, and 78% NPV., CONCLUSIONS: MRI-based measurements of parenchymal disease and TM can be used to predict need for tracheostomy in infants with BPD, more accurately than clinical factors alone. This prediction model has strong potential as a clinical tool for physicians and families for early determination of tracheostomy requirement. Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common devastating pulmonary complication in preterm infants. Supplemental oxygen is a lifesaving therapeutic measure used for premature infants with pulmonary insufficiency. However, oxygen toxicity is a significant trigger for BPD. Oxidative stress disrupts lung development, accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression and immune cells infiltration in lung tissue. Licorice, a typical traditional herbal medicine, is commonly used in the medicine and food industries. 18beta-Glycyrrhetinic acid (18beta-GA), a primary active ingredient of licorice, has powerful anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to determine whether 18beta-GA has a protective effect on neonatal rats with hyperoxia exposure. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were kept in either 21% (normoxia) or 80% O2 (hyperoxia) continuously from postnatal day (PN) 1 to 14. 18beta-GA was injected intragastrically at 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight once a day from PN 1 to 14. We examined the body weight and alveolar development and measured ROS level and the markers of pulmonary inflammation. Mature-IL-1beta and NF-kappaB pathway proteins, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, were assessed; concurrently, caspase-1 activity was measured. Our results indicated that hyperoxia resulted in alveolar simplification and decreased bodyweight of neonatal rats. Hyperoxia increased ROS level and pulmonary inflammation and activated NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome. 18beta-GA treatment inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome, decreased ROS level and pulmonary inflammation, improved alveolar development, and increased the bodyweight of neonatal rats with hyperoxia exposure. Our study demonstrates that 18beta-GA has a protective effect on neonatal rats with hyperoxia exposure. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - As a stem cell of alveolar epithelium, the physiological status of alveolar epithelium type II cells (AECII) after hyperoxia exposure is closely related to the occurrence of hyperoxia-induced lung injury and the restoration of normal morphological function of damaged alveolar epithelium. However, the relevant mechanisms involved are not very clear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on AECII exposed to hyperoxia and its potential mechanisms. The AECII viability was detected using MTT assay. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were detected by spectrophotometry. The transdifferentiation capacity of AECII was evaluated by flow cytometry. The expression levels of Notch1, Hes, HERP, and AECII markers were detected using immunohistochemistry and/or RT-qPCR or immunofluorescence. ELISA was used for the determination of inflammatory markers. The results showed that CGRP significantly promoted cell viability, and markedly suppressed hyperoxia-induced transdifferentiation of AECII; these biological alterations were coincided with decreased MDA level, increased SOD activity, and activated Notch signaling pathway (upregulated expression levels of Notch1, Hes, and HERP). Notably, the in vitro effects of CGRP on Notch signaling pathway were further investigated in animal model, and the HE staining results showed that CGRP reduced in vivo oxidative injury and inflammation in hyperoxia-treated AECII through the promotion of structural and functional regeneration, accompanied by elevated Notch1 expression and activated Notch signaling cascade as shown by immunohistochemistry and QPCR, respectively. Immunohistochemistry of APQ-5 and SPC indicated that CGRP reversed the transdifferentiation of AECIIs in vivo. Our current results were consistent across both in vitro and in vivo settings, and provide a new direction for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Copyright © 2021.

AB  - Metformin has potential anti-inflammatory properties and accelerates wound healing by enhancing vascular development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on pulmonary vascular development and the underlying mechanism. Newborn mice were subcutaneously injected with metformin from day 2 after exposure to hyperoxia. Pulmonary vascular development, inflammation, and Shh signaling pathway-related protein expression were evaluated by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. M2 macrophage polarization was measured by flow cytometry. The effect of metformin on macrophage polarization was determined using RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to 90% oxygen in vitro. The role of metformin and purmorphamine on M1 and M2 polarization was observed by flow cytometry. M2 polarization of pulmonary macrophages was inhibited after hyperoxic exposure, and metformin increased the number of M2 macrophages in the lung on postnatal day 14. Metformin upregulated CD31 expression and suppressed inflammation in the lung of mice exposed to hyperoxia on postnatal days 7 and 14. Metformin downregulated the Gli1 expression in macrophages in the lung after exposure to hyperoxia on postnatal day 14. In vitro studies showed that metformin inhibited the Gli1 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to 90% oxygen, which was reversed after purmorphamine pretreatment. Exposure to 90% oxygen inhibited the polarization of M2 macrophages, whereas metformin increased the number of M2 macrophages. Purmorphamine reversed the effects of metformin on M2 polarization and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulation in RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to hyperoxia. In conclusion, metformin regulates macrophage polarization via the Shh signaling pathway to improve pulmonary vascular development in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - AIM: Genetic variants contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of 45 SNPs with BPD susceptibility in a Turkish premature infant cohort., METHODS: Infants with gestational age <32 weeks were included. Patients were divided into BPD or no-BPD groups according to oxygen need at 28 days of life, and stratified according to the severity of BPD. We genotyped 45 SNPs, previously identified as BPD risk factors, in 192 infants., RESULTS: A total of eight SNPs were associated with BPD risk at allele level, two of which (rs4883955 on KLF12 and rs9953270 on CHST9) were also associated at the genotype level. Functional relationship maps suggested an interaction between five of these genes, converging on WNT5A, a member of the WNT pathway known to be implicated in BPD pathogenesis. Dysfunctional CHST9 and KLF12 variants may contribute to BPD pathogenesis through an interaction with WNT5A., CONCLUSIONS: We suggest investigating the role of SNPs on different genes which are in relation with the Wnt pathway in BPD pathogenesis. We identified eight SNPs as risk factors for BPD in this study. In-silico functional maps show an interaction of the genes harboring these SNPs with the WNT pathway, supporting its role in BPD pathogenesis., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03467828., IMPACT: It is known that genetic factors may contribute to the development of BPD in preterm infants. Further studies are required to identify specific genes that play a role in the BPD pathway to evaluate them as a target for therapeutic interventions. Our study shows an association of BPD predisposition with certain polymorphisms on MBL2, NFKBIA, CEP170, MAGI2, and VEGFA genes at allele level and polymorphisms on CHST9 and KLF12 genes at both allele and genotype level. In-silico functional mapping shows a functional relationship of these five genes with WNT5A, suggesting that Wnt pathway disruption may play a role in BPD pathogenesis. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease characterized by interrupted alveologenesis and alveolar simplification caused by oxygen therapy in premature infants. Metabolic dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of BPD. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is significantly increased in specific lung tissues in patients with BPD. Therefore, we investigated whether BMS309403, an FABP4 inhibitor that can mitigate tissue fibrosis, can regulate pulmonary fibrotic processes in newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia. Newborn rat pups were exposed to room air (RA; 21% O2 ) or 85% O2 from 5 to 14 days of age and were then allowed to recover in RA until 29 days of age. They received intraperitoneal injection with placebo (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) or BMS 309403 (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg kg-1 d-1 ) every other day from 4 to 14 days of age then were divided into O2 plus PBS or low dose or high dose and RA plus PBS or low dose or high dose groups. We assessed lung histology and evaluated lung collagen I, FABP4 as well as TGF-beta1 expression at 14 and 29 days of age. In the hyperoxia injury-recovery model, prophylactic BMS309403 treatment reduced mean linear intercept values and FABP4 expression (p < 0.001). Prophylactic BMS309403 treatment mitigated pulmonary fibrosis and TGF-beta1 expression immediately after hyperoxia exposure (p < 0.05). The attenuation of hyperoxia-induced alveolar developmental impairment and pulmonary fibrosis by FABP4 inhibition indicated that such inhibition has potential clinical and therapeutic applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory processes are key drivers of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease in preterm infants. In a large sample, we verify previously reported associations of genetic variants of immunology-related genes with BPD., METHODS: Preterm infants with a gestational age <=32 weeks from PROGRESS and the German Neonatal Network (GNN) were included. Through a consensus case/control definition, 278 BPD cases and 670 controls were identified. We identified 49 immunity-related genes and 55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with BPD through a comprehensive literature survey. Additionally, a quantitative genetic association analysis regarding oxygen supplements, mechanical ventilation, and continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) was performed., RESULTS: Five candidate SNPs were nominally associated with BPD-related phenotypes with effect directions not conflicting the original studies: rs11265269-CRP, rs1427793-NUAK1, rs2229569-SELL, rs1883617-VNN2, and rs4148913-CHST3. Four of these genes are involved in cell adhesion. Extending our analysis to all well-imputed SNPs of all candidate genes, the strongest association was rs45538638-ABCA3 with CPAP (p = 4.9 x 10-7, FDR = 0.004), an ABC transporter involved in surfactant formation., CONCLUSIONS: Most of the previously reported associations could not be replicated. We found additional support for SNPs in CRP, NUAK1, SELL, VNN2, and ABCA3. Larger studies and meta-analyses are required to corroborate these findings., IMPACT: Larger cohort for improved statistical power to detect genetic associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Most of the previously reported genetic associations with BPD could not be replicated in this larger study. Among investigated immunological relevant candidate genes, additional support was found for variants in genes CRP, NUAK1, SELL, VNN2, and CHST3, four of them related to cell adhesion. rs45538638 is a novel candidate SNP in reported candidate gene ABC-transporter ABCA3. Results help to prioritize molecular candidate pathomechanisms in follow-up studies. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - RATIONALE: Premature infants exposed to oxygen are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterised by lung growth arrest. Inflammation is important, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated inflammatory pathways and therapeutic targets in severe clinical and experimental BPD., METHODS AND RESULTS: First, transcriptomic analysis with in silico cellular deconvolution identified a lung-intrinsic M1-like-driven cytokine pattern in newborn mice after hyperoxia. These findings were confirmed by gene expression of macrophage-regulating chemokines (Ccl2, Ccl7, Cxcl5) and markers (Il6, Il17A, Mmp12). Secondly, hyperoxia-activated interleukin 6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling was measured in vivo and related to loss of alveolar epithelial type II cells (ATII) as well as increased mesenchymal marker. Il6 null mice exhibited preserved ATII survival, reduced myofibroblasts and improved elastic fibre assembly, thus enabling lung growth and protecting lung function. Pharmacological inhibition of global IL-6 signalling and IL-6 trans-signalling promoted alveolarisation and ATII survival after hyperoxia. Third, hyperoxia triggered M1-like polarisation, possibly via Kruppel-like factor 4; hyperoxia-conditioned medium of macrophages and IL-6-impaired ATII proliferation. Finally, clinical data demonstrated elevated macrophage-related plasma cytokines as potential biomarkers that identify infants receiving oxygen at increased risk of developing BPD. Moreover, macrophage-derived IL6 and active STAT3 were related to loss of epithelial cells in BPD lungs., CONCLUSION: We present a novel IL-6-mediated mechanism by which hyperoxia activates macrophages in immature lungs, impairs ATII homeostasis and disrupts elastic fibre formation, thereby inhibiting lung growth. The data provide evidence that IL-6 trans-signalling could offer an innovative pharmacological target to enable lung growth in severe neonatal chronic lung disease. Copyright ©The authors 2022.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neonatal lung injury as a consequence of hyperoxia (HO) therapy and ventilator care contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Increased expression and activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a key enzyme that cross-links collagen, was associated with increased sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) in human BPD. We, therefore, examined closely the link between LOX and SPHK1 in BPD., METHOD: The enzyme expression of SPHK1 and LOX were assessed in lung tissues of human BPD using immunohistochemistry and quantified (Halo). In vivo studies were based on Sphk1-/- and matched wild type (WT) neonatal mice exposed to HO while treated with PF543, an inhibitor of SPHK1. In vitro mechanistic studies used human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs)., RESULTS: Both SPHK1 and LOX expressions were increased in lungs of patients with BPD. Tracheal aspirates from patients with BPD had increased LOX, correlating with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels. HO-induced increase of LOX in lungs were attenuated in both Sphk1-/- and PF543-treated WT mice, accompanied by reduced collagen staining (sirius red). PF543 reduced LOX activity in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and supernatant of HLMVECs following HO. In silico analysis revealed STAT3 as a potential transcriptional regulator of LOX. In HLMVECs, following HO, ChIP assay confirmed increased STAT3 binding to LOX promoter. SPHK1 inhibition reduced phosphorylation of STAT3. Antibody to S1P and siRNA against SPNS2, S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) and STAT3 reduced LOX expression., CONCLUSION: HO-induced SPHK1/S1P signalling axis plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation of LOX expression via SPNS2, S1P1 and STAT3 in lung endothelium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The new bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) grading system was developed based on its correlation with long-term respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes and may provide better personalized prognostication. Identifying early-life predictors for accurate BPD grade prediction may allow interventions to be tailored to individual needs. This study aimed to assess whether oxygenation index (OI) dynamics in the first three weeks of life are a predictor of BPD grade., METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was performed. Generalized additive mixed modeling was used to model OI trajectories for each BPD grade subgroup. A multinomial regression model was then developed to quantify the association between OI dynamics and BPD grade., RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-four infants were identified for inclusion in the trajectory modeling. A total of 6,243 OI data points were available for modeling. OI trajectory estimates showed distinct patterns in the three groups, most prominent during the third week of life. The average daily OI change was -0.33 +/- 0.52 (n = 85) in the No-BPD group, -0.04 +/- 0.75 (n = 82) in the Low-Grade BPD group, and 0.22 +/- 0.65 (n = 75) in the High-Grade BPD group (p < 0.001). A multinomial regression analysis showed the initial OI value and the average daily OI change both independently correlated with BPD grade outcomes after adjusting for birth gestation, birth weight z-score, sex, and the duration of invasive ventilation., CONCLUSION: Early-life OI dynamics may be a useful independent marker for BPD grade prediction. Prospective studies may be warranted to further validate the findings. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common respiratory disease of preterm infants. Lower circulatory/intrapulmonary levels of the adipokine, adiponectin (APN), occur in premature and small-for-gestational-age infants and at saccular/alveolar stages of lung development in the newborn rat. However, the role of low intrapulmonary APN during hyperoxia exposure in developing lungs is unknown., METHODS: We test the hypothesis that treatment of hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice with recombinant APN protein attenuates the BPD phenotype characterized by inflammation, impaired alveolarization, and dysregulated vascularization. We used developmentally appropriate in vitro and in vivo BPD modeling systems as well as human lung tissue., RESULTS: We observed reduced levels of intrapulmonary APN in experimental BPD mice and human BPD lungs. APN-deficient (APN-/-) newborn mice exposed to moderate (60% O2) hyperoxia showed a worse BPD pulmonary phenotype (inflammation, enhanced endothelial dysfunction, impaired pulmonary vasculature, and alveolar simplification) as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment of hyperoxia-exposed newborn WT mice with recombinant APN protein attenuated the BPD phenotype (diminished inflammation, decreased pulmonary vascular injury, and improved pulmonary alveolarization) and improved pulmonary function tests., CONCLUSIONS: Low intrapulmonary APN is associated with disruption of lung development during hyperoxia exposure, while recombinant APN protein attenuates the BPD pulmonary phenotype., IMPACT: Intrapulmonary APN levels were significantly decreased in lungs of experimental BPD mice and human BPD lung tissue at various stages of BPD development. Correlative data from human lung samples with decreased APN levels were associated with increased lung adhesion markers (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin). Decreased APN levels were associated with endothelial dysfunction and moderate BPD phenotype in APN-deficient, as compared to WT, experimental BPD mice. WT experimental BPD mice treated with recombinant APN protein had an improved pulmonary structural and functional phenotype. Exogenous APN may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent BPD. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - The impact of prematurity on human development and neonatal diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, has been widely reported. However, little is known about the effects of prematurity on the programs of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation of the upper respiratory epithelium, which is key for adaptation to neonatal life. We developed a minimally invasive methodology for isolation of neonatal basal cells from nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates and performed functional analysis in organotypic cultures to address this issue. We show that preterm NP progenitors have a markedly distinct molecular signature of abnormal proliferation and mitochondria quality control compared to term progenitors. Preterm progenitors had lower oxygen consumption at baseline and were unable to ramp up consumption to the levels of term cells when challenged. Although they formed a mucociliary epithelium, ciliary function tended to decline in premature cells as they differentiated, compared to term cells. Together, these differences suggested increased sensitivity of preterm progenitors to environmental stressors under non-homeostatic conditions.

AB  - Preterm infants are highly susceptible to sustained lung inflammation, which may be triggered by exposure to multiple environmental cues such as supplemental oxygen (O2) and infections. We hypothesized that dysregulated macrophage (M ) activation is a key feature leading to inflammation-mediated development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Therefore, we aimed to determine age-dependent differences in immune responses of monocyte-derived M comparing cord blood samples derived from preterm (n=14) and term (n=19) infants as well as peripheral blood samples from healthy adults (n=17) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. Compared to term and adult M , LPS-stimulated preterm M showed an enhanced and sustained pro-inflammatory immune response determined by transcriptome analysis, cytokine release inducing a RORC upregulation due to T cell polarization of neonatal T cells, and TLR4 surface expression. In addition, a double-hit model was developed to study pulmonary relevant exposure factors by priming M with hyperoxia (O2 = 65%) or hypoxia (O2 = 3%) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100ng/ml). When primed by 65% O2, subsequent LPS stimulation in preterm M led to an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response (e.g. increased HLA-DR expression and cytokine release) compared to LPS stimulation alone. Both, exposure to 65% or 3% O2 together with subsequent LPS stimulation, resulted in an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response of preterm M determined by transcriptome analysis. Downregulation of two major transcriptional factors, early growth response gene (Egr)-2 and growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1), were identified to play a role in the exaggerated pro-inflammatory response of preterm M to LPS insult after priming with 65% or 3% O2. Preterm M responses to LPS and hyperoxia/hypoxia suggest their involvement in excessive inflammation due to age-dependent differences, potentially mediated by downregulation of Egr2 and Gfi1 in the developing lung.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in premature infants, characterized by alveolar dysplasia and pulmonary microvascular remodeling. In the present study, we have investigated the functional roles of ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) in BPD, and its relationship with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) mediated type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII) apoptosis., METHODS: A hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model was constructed and the pathologic changes of lung tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cell apoptosis and protein expression were determined by TUNEL assay and Western blotting, respectively. Further reagent kit with specific fluorescent substrate was utilized to measure the activity of 20 s proteasome. Meanwhile, AECII were cultured in vitro and exposed to hyperoxia. AECII apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. In contrast, MG132 treatment was induced to explore UPP during hyperoxia exposure on AECII apoptosis and ERS sensors expression., RESULTS: A significant increase in apoptosis and total ubiquitinated proteins expression were observed in BPD rats and AECII culture, and the change of UPP was associated with ERS. In order to confirm the role of UPP in AECII apoptosis of BPD, AECII cells were treated by MG132 with the concentration of 10 mumol/L under hyperoxia exposure. We found that the proteins expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP-78), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), as well as AECII apoptosis were increased following MG132 treatment. Furthermore, the relatively up-regulated in the levels of total ubiquitinated proteins expression and 20 s proteasome activity were correlated with increased ERS sensors expression., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that UPP may participate in the ERS-induced AECII apoptosis under hyperoxia condition.

AB  - Preclinical studies suggest mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) reduce inflammation and improve organ function in lung diseases; however, an objective analysis of all available data is needed prior to translation. Using rigorous meta-research methods, we determined the effectiveness of MSC-EVs for preclinical respiratory diseases and identified experimental conditions that may further refine this therapy. A systematic search of MEDLINE/Embase identified 1167 records. After screening, 52 articles were included for data extraction and evaluated for risk of bias and quality of reporting in study design. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted for acute lung injury (ALI; N = 23), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; N = 8) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; N = 7). Subgroup analyses identified EV methods/characteristics that may be associated with improved efficacy. Data is presented as standardized mean differences (SMD) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For ALI, MSC-EVs markedly reduced lung injury (SMD -4.33, CI -5.73 to -2.92), vascular permeability (SMD -2.43, CI -3.05 to -1.82), and mortality (RR 0.39, CI 0.22 to 0.68). Small EVs were more consistently effective than large EVs whereas no differences were observed between tissue sources, immunocompatibility or isolation techniques. For BPD, alveolarization was improved by MSC-EVs (SMD -1.45, CI -2.08 to -0.82) with small EVs more consistently beneficial then small/large EVs. In PAH, right ventricular systolic pressure (SMD -4.16, CI -5.68 to -2.64) and hypertrophy (SMD -2.80, CI -3.68 to -1.91) were significantly attenuated by EVs. In BPD and PAH, EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation demonstrated therapeutic benefit whereas tangential flow filtration (N = 2) displayed minimal efficacy. Lastly, risk of bias and quality of reporting for experimental design were consistently unclear across all studies. Our findings demonstrate clear potential of MSC-EVs to be developed as therapy for acute and chronic lung diseases. However, greater transparency in research design and direct comparisons of isolation technique and EV subtypes are needed to generate robust evidence to guide clinical translation.

AB  - Preterm very low birth weight infants (VLBWi) are known to be at greater risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Identifying early factors associated with outcome is essential in order to refer patients for early intervention. Few studies have investigated neurodevelopmental outcome in Italian VLBWi. The aim of our longitudinal study is to describe neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months of corrected age in an eleven-year cohort of 502 Italian preterm VLBWi and to identify associations with outcome. At 24 months, Griffiths' Mental Developmental Scales were administered. Neurodevelopmental outcome was classified as: normal, minor sequelae (minor neurological signs, General Quotient between 76 and 87), major sequelae (cerebral palsy; General Quotient <= 75; severe sensory impairment). 75.3% showed a normal outcome, 13.9% minor sequelae and 10.8% major sequelae (3.8% cerebral palsy). Male gender, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, abnormal neonatal neurological assessment and severe brain ultrasound abnormalities were independently associated with poor outcome on multivariate ordered logistic regression. Rates of major sequelae are in line with international studies, as is the prevalence of developmental delay over cerebral palsy. Analysis of perinatal complications and the combination of close cUS monitoring and neurological assessment are still essential for early identification of infants with adverse outcome.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown as an effective medicinal means to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The widely used MSCs were from Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs). Amniotic fluid MSCs (AF-MSCs) may be produced before an individual is born to treat foetal diseases by autoplastic transplantation. We evaluated intratracheal (IT) MSCs as an approach to treat an hyperoxia-induced BPD animal model and compared the therapeutic effects between AF-, UC- and BM-MSCs. A BPD animal model was generated by exposing newborn rats to 95% O2 . The continued stress lasted 21 days, and the treatment of IT MSCs was conducted for 4 days. The therapeutic effects were analysed, including lung histology, level of inflammatory cytokines, cell death ratio and state of angiogenesis, by sacrificing the experimental animal at day 21. The lasting hyperoxia stress induced BPD similar to the biological phenotype. The treatment of IT MSCs was safe without deaths and normal organ histopathology. Specifically, the treatment was effective by inhibiting the alveolar dilatation, reducing inflammatory cytokines, inducing angiogenesis and lowering the cell death ratio. AF-MSCs had better therapeutic effects compared with UC-MSCs in relieving the pulmonary alveoli histological changes and promoting neovascularization, and UC-MSCs had the best immunosuppressive effect in plasma and lung lysis compared with AF-MSCs and BM-MSCs. This study demonstrated the therapeutic effects of AF-, UC- and BM-MSCs in BPD model. Superior treatment effect was provided by antenatal MSCs compared to BM-MSC in a statistical comparison.

AB  - Pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a multifactorial disease with diverse etiologies and presenting features. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), defined as elevated pulmonary artery pressure, is the presenting feature for several pulmonary vascular diseases. It is often a hidden component of other lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Alterations in lung development and genetic conditions are an important contributor to pediatric pulmonary hypertensive disease, which is a distinct entity from adult PH. Many of the causes of pediatric PH have prenatal onset with altered lung development due to maternal and fetal conditions. Since lung growth is altered in several conditions that lead to PPH, therapy for PPH includes both pulmonary vasodilators and strategies to restore lung growth. These strategies include optimal alveolar recruitment, maintaining physiologic blood gas tension, nutritional support, and addressing contributing factors, such as airway disease and gastroesophageal reflux. The outcome for infants and children with PH is highly variable and largely dependent on the underlying cause. The best outcomes are for neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) and reversible lung diseases, while some genetic conditions such as alveolar capillary dysplasia are lethal. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Central venous catheter (CVC) placement is common in the care of very low birthweight (VLBW) preterm neonates. Although it is generally considered to be safe, CVC placement is associated with complications, including extravasation that may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. We report the clinical course of an extremely preterm neonate born at 27 weeks gestation, and another 5 VLBW preterm neonates reported in the literature with hemidiaphragmatic paralysis related to extravasation of parenteral solution from CVC placement. In VLBW preterm neonates, spontaneous recovery of diaphragmatic paralysis related to extravasation of parenteral solution is possible. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

AB  - Treating premature infants with high oxygen is a routine intervention in the context of neonatal intensive care. Unfortunately, the increase in survival rates is associated with various detrimental sequalae of hyperoxia exposure, most notably bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease of disrupted lung development. The effects of high oxygen exposure on other developing organs of the infant, as well as the possible impact such disrupted development may have on later life remain poorly understood. Using a neonatal mouse model to investigate the effects of hyperoxia on the immature immune system we observed a dramatic involution of the thymic medulla, and this lesion was associated with disrupted FoxP3+ regulatory T cell generation and T cell autoreactivity. Significantly, administration of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MEx) restored thymic medullary architecture and physiological thymocyte profiles. Using single cell transcriptomics, we further demonstrated preferential impact of MEx treatment on the thymic medullary antigen presentation axis, as evidenced by enrichment of antigen presentation and antioxidative-stress related genes in dendritic cells (DCs) and medullary epithelial cells (mTECs). Our study demonstrates that MEx treatment represents a promising restorative therapeutic approach for oxygen-induced thymic injury, thus promoting normal development of both central tolerance and adaptive immunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aminophylline use and the association between clinical outcomes and therapy timing have been less investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of early aminophylline use (within the first two days of life) in premature infants., METHOD: A retrospective observational cohort of infants weighing <1500 g and <30 weeks of gestational age at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital received aminophylline either within the first two days of life (EA, early aminophylline group), after the third day of life (LA, late aminophylline group), or without aminophylline during the first month of life (WA, without aminophylline group). Demographic data and neonatal clinical outcomes were compared among the three groups., RESULTS: This study included 89 preterm infants (EA = 33, LA = 38, WA = 18). The EA group had a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) than the WA group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 8.86(1.56-59.32); P = 0.024). Although there was no significant difference in BPD incidence between the EA and LA groups (aOR = 2.66(0.51-13.81), P = 0.244), a trend remained. Birth body weight less than 1000 g was also a significant risk factor for BPD (aOR = 8.86(1.32-47.41), P = 0.014). The duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter in the infants in the EA group compared to the WA group (estimated beta = -11.344(-19.57-3.12); P = 0.008)., CONCLUSION: Early aminophylline administration may be associated with a decreased incidence of BPD in preterm infants. However, the clinical benefits of aminophylline treatment require further investigation. In addition, a birth body weight of less than 1000 g was a crucial risk factor for BPD.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced lung injury plays a key role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by inflammatory injury and impaired lung development in preterm infants. Although BPD is a predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, currently it is uncertain how lung injury contributes to brain injury in preterm infants. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures that regulate intercellular and inter-organ communications. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) has emerged as a key executor of inflammasome-mediated cell death and inflammation. In this study, we utilized a neonatal rat model of BPD to assess if hyperoxia stimulates lung release of circulating EVs and if these EVs induce lung and brain injury. We found that hyperoxia-exposed rats had elevated numbers of plasma-derived EVs compared to rats maintained in room air. These EVs also had increased cargos of surfactant protein C, a marker of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), and the active (p30) form of GSDMD. When these EVs were adoptively transferred into normal newborn rats via intravenous injection, they were taken up both by lung and brain tissues. Moreover, EVs from hyperoxic animals induced not only the pathological hallmarks of BPD, but also brain inflammatory injury in recipient rats, as well as inducing cell death in cultured pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and neural stem cells (NSC). Similarly, hyperoxia-exposed cultured AEC-like cells released EVs that also contained increased GSDMD-p30 and these EVs induced pyroptotic cell death in NSC. Overall, these data indicate that hyperoxia-activated circulating EVs mediate a lung to brain crosstalk resulting in brain injury and suggest a mechanism that links lung injury and neurodevelopmental impairment in BPD infants.

AB  - We used agnostic, unsupervised machine learning to cluster a large clinical database of information on infants admitted to neonatal units in England. Our aim was to obtain insights into nutritional practice, an area of central importance in newborn care, utilising the UK National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD). We performed clustering on time-series data of daily nutritional intakes for very preterm infants born at a gestational age less than 32 weeks (n = 45,679) over a six-year period. This revealed 46 nutritional clusters heterogeneous in size, showing common interpretable clinical practices alongside rarer approaches. Nutritional clusters with similar admission profiles revealed associations between nutritional practice, geographical location and outcomes. We show how nutritional subgroups may be regarded as distinct interventions and tested for associations with measurable outcomes. We illustrate the potential for identifying relationships between nutritional practice and outcomes with two examples, discharge weight and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We identify the well-known effect of formula milk on greater discharge weight as well as support for the plausible, but insufficiently evidenced view that human milk is protective against BPD. Our framework highlights the potential of agnostic machine learning approaches to deliver clinical practice insights and generate hypotheses using routine data.

AB  - The proliferation of fetal alveolar type II cells (FATIICs) was impaired in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is modulated by hyperoxia and inflammatory response. Interleukin 24 (IL-24), a cytokine produced by certain cell types, plays an essential role in inflammation and host protection against infection. However, the ability of FATIICs to produce IL-24 remains unclear, and the role of IL-24 in BPD progression is yet to be determined. With reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the authors evaluated whether FATIICs produce IL-24 in physiological conditions. The authors quantified IL-24 expression in the lungs of newborn rat pups exposed to hyperoxia (70% oxygen) and in FATIICs isolated on embryonic day 19 that were exposed to 95% oxygen or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The role of IL-24 in FATIICs, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle were further evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and flow cytometric analysis. Also, they assessed caspase-3 and SOCS3 mRNA in IL-24 siRNA-treated cells by using RT-qPCR. During culture, IL-24 mRNA and protein levels in FATIICs gradually decreased with FATIIC differentiation. IL-24 expression increased significantly in rat lungs exposed to hyperoxia and FATIICs exposed to oxygen or LPS. Recombinant IL-24 enhanced cell proliferation by decreasing the proportion of apoptotic cells and increasing the proportion of cells in the S phase. The IL-24 siRNA-treated cells expressed more caspase-3 mRNA. Furthermore, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) mRNA was significantly decreased in rats and FATIICs exposed to oxygen, whereas it dramatically increased in FATIICs exposed to LPS. The IL-24 siRNA-treated cells expressed more SOCS3 mRNA. These studies suggest IL-24 is a pulmonary target cytokine in BPD, and may possibly regulate SOCS3 in oxidative stress and inflammation of the lung.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was first described by Northway et al in 1967. This article describes the evolution of our understanding of the pathophysiology of BPD and the approaches to treatments of this illness developed over the past fifty years. These interventions had their roots in the understanding of the principles of the surface tension present at air-liquid interfaces, which were developed over 150 years before BPD's initial description. Improving outcomes in neonatal care have led to greater survival of preterm and very preterm infants, and to an evolution of the pathogenesis and pathology of BPD, from an illness caused primarily by barotrauma and oxygen toxicity to one of interruption of lung development. While the incidence of BPD has remained about the same in recent decades, this is because survival of infants born at lower gestational ages is increasing. Understanding of molecular, genetic and physiologic mechanisms has led to newer treatments that have mitigated some of the harmful effects of prolonged mechanical ventilation. Recognition of BPD as a chronic multi-system disease has resulted in further improvements in care after discharge from neonatal intensive care. Since many of the origins of chronic obstructive lung disease in adults are based in childhood respiratory illnesses, improving outcomes of BPD in infancy and childhood will undoubtedly lead to improved respiratory outcomes in the adults that these children will become.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) following preterm birth and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) are both forms of developmental lung disease that may result in persistent pulmonary and pulmonary vascular morbidity in childhood. The pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) which accompanies BPD and CDH is due to developmental abnormalities and ongoing perinatal insults. This may be accompanied by evidence of elevated right heart pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The development of PH in these conditions is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the vulnerable BPD and CDH populations. We present a review of PVD pathogenesis and evaluation in BPD and CDH and discuss management of related sequelae of PH co-morbidity for affected infants. Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - About 10% of term neonates present with respiratory distress at birth. The most common aetiologies include transient tachypnoea of the newborn, pneumonia and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) in a term infant occurs either as primary HMD, secondary surfactant deficiency or congenital surfactant dysfunction. A detailed history supported with appropriate radiological and laboratory investigations can help a clinician reach a diagnosis. We report a case of surfactant dysfunction disorder which presented as severe MAS and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. In the infant described, the significant history of a sibling death with severe neonatal respiratory disease led us to think of diffuse developmental lung diseases especially surfactant dysfunction syndromes. Exome sequencing detected a heterozygous missense variation in exon 21 of the ATP binding cassette protein member 3 (ABCA3) gene. Based on the clinical picture supported with the exome sequencing, a diagnosis of surfactant dysfunction disorder (ABCA3 deficiency) was confirmed. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have lifelong increased risk of respiratory morbidities associated with environmental pathogen exposure and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The resident immune cells of the lung play vital roles in host defense. However, the effect of perinatal events associated with BPD on pulmonary-specific immune cells is not well understood., METHODS: We used a double-hit model of BPD induced by prenatal chorioamnionitis followed by postnatal hyperoxia, and performed a global transcriptome analysis of all resident pulmonary immune cells., RESULTS: We show significant up-regulation of genes involved in chemokine-mediated signaling and immune cell chemotaxis, and down-regulation of genes involved in multiple T lymphocyte functions. Multiple genes involved in T cell receptor signaling are downregulated and Cd8a gene expression remains downregulated at 2 months of age in spite of recovery in normoxia for 6 weeks. Furthermore, the proportion of CD8a+CD3+ pulmonary immune cells is decreased., CONCLUSIONS: Our study has highlighted that perinatal lung inflammation in a double-hit model of BPD results in short- and long-term dysregulation of genes associated with the pulmonary T cell receptor signaling pathway, which may contribute to increased environmental pathogen-associated respiratory morbidities seen in children and adults with BPD., IMPACT: In a translationally relevant double-hit model of BPD induced by chorioamnionitis and postnatal hyperoxia, we identified pulmonary immune cell-specific transcriptomic changes and showed that T cell receptor signaling genes are downregulated in short term and long term. This is the first comprehensive report delineating transcriptomic changes in resident immune cells of the lung in a translationally relevant double-hit model of BPD. Our study identifies novel resident pulmonary immune cell-specific targets for potential therapeutic modulation to improve short- and long-term respiratory health of preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most prevalent chronic paediatric lung disease and is linked to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. MicroRNA-based regulation of type II alveolar epithelial cell (T2AEC) proliferation and apoptosis is an important factor in the pathogenesis of BPD and warrants further investigation., EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Two murine models of hyperoxic lung injury (with or without miR-342-5p or Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 3 [Spred3] modulation) were employed: a hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury model (100% O2 on postnatal days 1-7) and the BPD model (100% O2 on postnatal days 1-4, followed by room air for 10 days). Tracheal aspirate pellets from healthy control and moderate/severe BPD neonates were randomly selected for clinical miR-342-5p analysis., KEY RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased miR-342-5p levels in primary T2AECs, MLE12 cells and neonatal mouse lungs. Transgenic miR-342 overexpression in neonatal mice ameliorated survival rates and improved the BPD phenotype and BPD-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). T2AEC-specific miR-342 transgenic overexpression, as well as miR-342-5p mimic therapy, also ameliorated the BPD phenotype and associated PAH. miR-342-5p targets the 3'UTR of the Raf1 regulator Spred3, inhibiting Spred3 expression. Treatment with recombinant Spred3 exacerbated the BPD phenotype and associated PAH. Notably, miR-342-5p inhibition under room air conditions did not mimic the BPD phenotype. Moderate/severe BPD tracheal aspirate pellets exhibited decreased miR-342-5p levels relative to healthy control pellets., CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that miR-342-5p mimic therapy may show promise in the treatment or prevention of BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic and environmental influences on long-term outcomes in preterm twins., METHODS: From a prospective cohort of 225 preterm neonates studied with MRI, 24 monozygotic and 52 dizygotic twins were included. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1.5 and 3 years were assessed with the Bayley-III and at 4.5 years with The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III., RESULTS: Preterm monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (N = 76 neonates) had similar neurodevelopmental outcomes at all time points. Monozygotic twins (N = 24) did not show greater agreement for outcomes relative to dizygotic twins (N = 52). Twin pairs who were discordant in development (N = 12) were born at a lower gestational age and had a higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. Discordant twins become more similar in cognitive and language outcomes over time., CONCLUSIONS: Neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins may relate more strongly to environmental factors than genetics. Discordant twins were born earlier and had more perinatal morbidities. Despite the initial discordance, these twin pairs become similar in outcomes over time, which may reflect the positive impact of home environment or early intervention programs., IMPACT: Neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins relate more strongly to environmental factors than genetics. Monozygotic twins did not show greater agreement in outcomes relative to dizygotic twins suggesting a stronger environmental, rather than genetic, influence on development. Twin pairs who were discordant in development were born at a lower gestational age and had a higher incidence of perinatal morbidities. Despite the initial discordance, these twin pairs become more similar in cognitive and language outcomes over time, which may reflect the positive impact of early intervention programs or home environment. Neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins are influenced by exposure to early-life insults or environmental stressors. The initial variability in outcomes among preterm infants is not fixed, and efforts made post-discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit can have a substantial impact on long-term outcomes.

AB  - We investigated the hypothesis that exposure of lungs at the saccular stage of development to hyperoxia leads to persistent growth arrest and dysfunction of 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key energy sensor in the cell. We exposed neonatal rat pups from postnatal day 1- day 10 (P1-P10) to >=90% oxygen or control normoxia. Pups were euthanized at P4 or P10 or recovered in normoxia until euthanasia at P21. Half of the pups in each group received AMPK activator, metformin, or saline intraperitoneally from P1 to P10. Lung histology, morphometric analysis, immunofluorescence, and immunoblots were done for changes in lung structure at P10 and P21 and AMPK function at P4, P10, and P21. Phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) was decreased in lungs at P10 and P21 in hyperoxia-exposed pups. Metformin increased the levels of p-AMPK and PGC-1alpha, a downstream AMPK target which regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, at P4, P10, and P21 in hyperoxia pups. Lung ATP levels decreased during hyperoxia and were increased by metformin at P10 and P21. Radial alveolar count and alveolar septal tips were decreased and mean linear intercept increased in hyperoxia-exposed pups at P10 and the changes persisted at P21; these were improved by metformin. Lung capillary number was decreased in hyperoxia-exposed pups at P10 and P21 and was restored by metformin. Hyperoxia leads to impaired AMPK function, energy balance and alveolar simplification. The AMPK activator, metformin improves AMPK function and alveolar and vascular growth in this rat pup model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common lung disease of premature infants. Hyperoxia exposure and microbial dysbiosis are contributors to BPD development. However, the mechanisms linking pulmonary microbial dysbiosis to worsening lung injury are unknown. Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a transcription factor that regulates oxidative stress responses and modulates hyperoxia-induced lung injury. We hypothesized that airway dysbiosis would attenuate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant function, resulting in a more severe phenotype of BPD. Here, we show that preterm infants with a Gammaproteobacteria-predominant dysbiosis have increased endotoxin in tracheal aspirates, and mice monocolonized with the representative Gammaproteobacteria Escherichia coli show increased tissue damage compared with germ-free (GF) control mice. Furthermore, we show Nrf2-deficient mice have worse lung structure and function after exposure to hyperoxia when the airway microbiome is augmented with E. coli. To confirm the disease-initiating potential of airway dysbiosis, we developed a novel humanized mouse model by colonizing GF mice with tracheal aspirates from human infants with or without severe BPD, producing gnotobiotic mice with BPD-associated and non-BPD-associated lung microbiomes. After hyperoxia exposure, BPD-associated mice demonstrated a more severe BPD phenotype and increased expression of Nrf2-regulated genes, compared with GF and non-BPD-associated mice. Furthermore, augmenting Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity by supporting colonization with Lactobacillus species improved dysbiotic-augmented lung injury. Our results demonstrate that a lack of protective pulmonary microbiome signature attenuates an Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, which is augmented by a respiratory probiotic blend. We anticipate antioxidant pathways will be major targets of future microbiome-based therapeutics for respiratory disease.

AB  - Lung macrophages mature after birth, placing newborn infants, particularly those born preterm, within a unique window of susceptibility to disease. We hypothesized that in preterm infants, lung macrophage immaturity contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common serious complication of prematurity. By measuring changes in lung macrophage gene expression in preterm patients at risk of BPD, we show here that patients eventually developing BPD had higher inflammatory mediator expression even on the first day of life. Surprisingly, the ex vivo response to LPS was similar across all samples. Our analysis did however uncover macrophage signature genes whose expression increased in the first week of life specifically in patients resilient to disease. We propose that these changes describe the dynamics of human lung macrophage differentiation. Our study therefore provides new mechanistic insight into both neonatal lung disease and human developmental immunology.

AB  - Many premature babies who are born with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) go on to develop Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) and later Post-Prematurity Respiratory Disease (PRD) at one year corrected age, characterized by persistent or recurrent lower respiratory tract symptoms frequently related to inflammation and viral infection. Transcriptomic profiles were generated from sorted peripheral blood CD8+ T cells of preterm and full-term infants enrolled with consent in the NHLBI Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) at the University of Rochester and the University at Buffalo. We identified outcome-related gene expression patterns following standard methods to identify markers for oxygen utilization and BPD as outcomes in extremely premature infants. We further identified predictor gene sets for BPD based on transcriptomic data adjusted for gestational age at birth (GAB). RNA-Seq analysis was completed for CD8+ T cells from 145 subjects. Among the subjects with highest risk for BPD (born at <29 weeks gestational age (GA); n=72), 501 genes were associated with oxygen utilization. In the same set of subjects, 571 genes were differentially expressed in subjects with a diagnosis of BPD and 105 genes were different in BPD subjects as defined by physiologic challenge. A set of 92 genes could predict BPD with a moderately high degree of accuracy. We consistently observed dysregulation of TGFB, NRF2, HIPPO, and CD40-associated pathways in BPD. Using gene expression data from both premature and full-term subjects (n=116), we identified a 28 gene set that predicted the PRD status with a moderately high level of accuracy, which also were involved in TGFB signaling. Transcriptomic data from sort-purified peripheral blood CD8+ T cells from 145 preterm and full-term infants identified sets of molecular markers of inflammation associated with independent development of BPD in extremely premature infants at high risk for the disease and of PRD among the preterm and full-term subjects.

AB  - The vitamin D receptor (VDR), coded by the VDR gene, plays a pivotal role in executing cellular functions when bound by the active form of vitamin D. Gene polymorphisms in this receptor have been increasingly associated with a heightened state of vulnerability to certain diseases. However, limited data is available concerning the role of VDR gene polymorphisms in preterm infant complications. In 114 premature infants (< 32 weeks gestation) we analyze four single nucleotide VDR polymorphisms (rs2228570 (FokI), rs1544410 (BsmI), rs797532 (ApaI), rs731236 (TaqI)) for their association with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The results show that BPD was almost four times more likely in infants with the genotype CC of ApaI (rs7975232) (OR 3.845; p = 0.038). While both BPD and NEC were 2.1 times more likely to occur in preterm infants with the allele C of ApaI (rs7975232) (respectively: OR 2.111 and OR 2.129, p < 0.05). The ApaI VDR polymorphism appears to influence incidence of BPD and NEC in preterm infants. Considering VDR polymorphisms in future genetic investigations, in preterm complications, may prove clinically relevant.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic disease of preterm babies with poor clinical outcomes. Nrf2 transcription factor is crucial for cytoprotective response, whereas Keap1-an endogenous inhibitor of Nrf2 signaling-dampens these protective responses. Nrf2-sufficient (wild type) newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia develop hypoalveolarization, which phenocopies human BPD, and Nrf2 deficiency worsens it. In this study, we used PND1 pups bearing bearing hypomorphic Keap1 floxed alleles (Keap1f/f) with increased levels of Nrf2 to test the hypothesis that constitutive levels of Nrf2 in the premature lung are insufficient to mitigate hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization. Both wildtype and Keap1f/f pups at PND1 were exposed to hyperoxia for 72 h and then allowed to recover at room air for two weeks (at PND18), sacrificed, and lung hypoalveolarization and inflammation assessed. Hyperoxia-induced lung hypoalveolarization was remarkably lower in Keap1f/f pups than in wildtype counterparts (28.9% vs 2.4%, wildtype vs Keap1f/f). Likewise, Keap1f/f pups were protected against prolonged (96 h) hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization. However, there were no differences in hyperoxia-induced lung inflammatory response immediately after exposure or at PND18. Lack of hypoalveolarization in Keap1f/f pups was accompanied by increased levels of expression of antioxidant genes and GSH as assessed immediately following hyperoxia. Keap1 knockdown resulted in upregulation of lung cell proliferation postnatally but had opposing effects following hyperoxia. Collectively, our study demonstrates that augmenting endogenous Nrf2 activation by targeting Keap1 may provide a physiological way to prevent hypoalveolarization associated with prematurity.

AB  - The histopathology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) includes hypoalveolarization and interstitial thickening due to abnormal myofibroblast accumulation. Chorioamnionitis and sepsis are major risk factors for BPD development. The cellular mechanisms leading to these lung structural abnormalities are poorly understood. We used an animal model with repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration into the airways of immature mice to simulate prolonged airway exposure to gram-negative bacteria, focusing on the role of C-C chemokine receptor type 2-positive (CCR2+) exudative macrophages (ExMf). Repetitive LPS exposure of immature mice induced persistent hypoalveolarization observed at 4 and 18 days after the last LPS administration. LPS upregulated the expression of lung pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-17a, IL-6, IL-1beta) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL7, CXCL1, and CXCL2), while the expression of genes involved in lung alveolar and mesenchymal cell development (PDGFR-alpha, FGF7, FGF10, and SPRY1) was decreased. LPS induced recruitment of ExMf, including CCR2+ ExMf, as well as other myeloid cells like DCs and neutrophils. Lungs of LPS-exposed CCR2-/- mice showed preserved alveolar structure and normal patterns of alpha-actin and PDGFRalpha expression at the tips of the secondary alveolar crests. Compared to wild type mice, a significantly lower number of ExMf, including TNF-alpha+ ExMf were recruited to the lungs of CCR2-/- mice following repetitive LPS exposure. Further, pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 with TAK-242 also blocked the effect of LPS on alveolarization, alpha-SMA and PDGFRalpha expression. TNF-alpha and IL-17a induced alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in the distal airspaces of E16 fetal mouse lung explants. In human preterm lung mesenchymal stromal cells, TNF-alpha reduced mRNA and protein expression of PDGFR-alpha and decreased mRNA expression of WNT2, FOXF2, and SPRY1. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that in immature mice repetitive LPS exposure, through TLR4 signaling increases lung inflammation and impairs lung alveolar growth in a CCR2-dependent manner.

AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important for the ontogenetic control of immune activation and tissue damage in preterm infants. However, the role of Tregs for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is yet unclear. The aim of our study was to characterize CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)+ Tregs in peripheral blood of well-phenotyped preterm infants (n = 382; 23 + 0 - 36 + 6 weeks of gestational age) with a focus on the first 28 days of life and the clinical endpoint BPD (supplemental oxygen for longer than 28 days of age). In a subgroup of preterm infants, we characterized the immunological phenotype of Tregs (n = 23). The suppressive function of Tregs on CD4+CD25- T cells was compared in preterm, term and adult blood. We observed that extreme prematurity was associated with increased Treg frequencies which peaked in the second week of life. Independent of gestational age, increased Treg frequencies were noted to precede the development of BPD. The phenotype of preterm infant Tregs largely differed from adult Tregs and displayed an overall naive Treg population (CD45RA+/HLA-DR-/Helios+), especially in the first days of life. On day 7 of life, a more activated Treg phenotype pattern (CCR6+, HLA-DR+, and Ki-67+) was observed. Tregs of preterm neonates had a higher immunosuppressive capacity against CD4+CD25- T cells compared to the Treg compartment of term neonates and adults. In conclusion, our data suggest increased frequencies and functions of Tregs in preterm neonates which display a distinct phenotype with dynamic changes in the first weeks of life. Hence, the continued abundance of Tregs may contribute to sustained inflammation preceding the development of BPD. Functional analyses are needed in order to elucidate whether Tregs have potential as future target for diagnostics and therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and serious complication in premature infants. Lung fibroblasts (LFs) are present in the extracellular matrix and participate in pulmonary development in response to BPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) on LFs cultured from newborn rats. Material and Methods. Primary LFs were isolated and treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of an ERK inhibitor, PD98059 (10 mumol/L). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) protein levels were determined using immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and real-time reverse transcription quantitative (RT-q)PCR. LF proliferation was examined by flow cytometry and a cell counting kit-8 assay. LF transdifferentiation was examined by protein and mRNA expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) by immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. LF migration was examined by the transwell method., RESULTS: Phosphorylated ERK1/2, which was activated by EGF, promoted LF proliferation by accelerating cell-cycle progression from the G1 to S phase. After treatment with PD98059, the expression of p-ERK1/2 in LFs, cellular proliferation, and the percentage of cells in S phase were significantly decreased. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 also promoted the differentiation of LFs into myofibroblasts through increased alpha-SMA synthesis and migration., CONCLUSION: The activation of ERK promotes proliferation, transdifferentiation, and migration of lung fibroblasts from newborn rats.

AB  - Sex-specific differences in the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are due to different susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury, but the mechanism is unclear. In this study, neonatal male and female mouse pups (C57BL/6J) were exposed to hyperoxia and lung tissues were excised on postnatal day 7 for histological analysis and tandem mass tags proteomic analysis. We found that the lung sections from the male mice following postnatal hyperoxia exposure had increased alveolar simplification, significant aberrant pulmonary vascularization and arrest in angiogenesis compared with females. Comparison of differentially expressed proteins revealed 377 proteins unique to female and 425 unique to male as well as 750 proteins in both male and female. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that several differentially expressed proteins could contribute to the differences in sex-specific susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury. Our results may help identify sex-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets of BPD. Copyright © The author(s).

AB  - Preterm infants are at high risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension from inflammatory lung injury. In adult models, adiponectin (APN)-an adipocyte-derived hormone-protects the lung from inflammatory injury and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Cord blood APN levels in premature infants born < 26 weeks gestation are 5% of the level in infants born at term. We previously reported the expression profile of APN and its receptors in neonatal rat lung homogenates during the first 3 weeks of postnatal development. Here, we characterize the expression profile of APN and its receptors in specific lung cells and the effects of exogenous recombinant APN (rAPN) on lipopolysaccharide-(LPS)-induced cytokine and chemokine production in total lung homogenates and specific lung cells. In vitro, rAPN added to primary cultures of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells attenuated the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, intraperitoneal rAPN (2 mg/kg), given 4 hr prior to intrapharyngeal administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) to newborn rats at postnatal day 4, significantly reduced gene and protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1s and reduced protein expression of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) in the lung. LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lung were also decreased. Moreover, rAPN given 20 hr after intrapharyngeal LPS had a similar effect on lung inflammation. These findings suggest a role for APN in protecting the lung from inflammation during early stages of lung development. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth implies an array of respiratory diseases including apnea of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Caffeine has been introduced to treat apneas but also appears to reduce rates of BPD. Oxygen is essential when treating preterm infants with respiratory problems but high oxygen exposure aggravates BPD. This experimental study is aimed at investigating the action of caffeine on inflammatory response and cell death in pulmonary tissue in a hyperoxia-based model of BPD in the newborn rat. Material/Methods. Lung injury was induced by hyperoxic exposure with 80% oxygen for three (P3) or five (P5) postnatal days with or without recovery in ambient air until postnatal day 15 (P15). Newborn Wistar rats were treated with PBS or caffeine (10 mg/kg) every two days beginning at the day of birth. The effects of caffeine on hyperoxic-induced pulmonary inflammatory response were examined at P3 and P5 immediately after oxygen exposure or after recovery in ambient air (P15) by immunohistological staining and analysis of lung homogenates by ELISA and qPCR., RESULTS: Treatment with caffeine significantly attenuated changes in hyperoxia-induced cell death and apoptosis-associated factors. There was a significant decrease in proinflammatory mediators and redox-sensitive transcription factor NFkappaB in the hyperoxia-exposed lung tissue of the caffeine-treated group compared to the nontreated group. Moreover, treatment with caffeine under hyperoxia modulated the transcription of the adenosine receptor (Adora)1. Caffeine induced pulmonary chemokine and cytokine transcription followed by immune cell infiltration of alveolar macrophages as well as increased adenosine receptor (Adora1, 2a, and 2b) expression., CONCLUSIONS: The present study investigating the impact of caffeine on the inflammatory response, pulmonary cell degeneration and modulation of adenosine receptor expression, provides further evidence that caffeine acts as an antioxidative and anti-inflammatory drug for experimental oxygen-mediated lung injury. Experimental studies may broaden the understanding of therapeutic use of caffeine in modulating detrimental mechanisms involved in BPD development. Copyright © 2020 Stefanie Endesfelder et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal caffeine dosing in extremely premature neonates remains elusive. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of birth weight on caffeine pharmacokinetics and various dosing regimens., METHODS: In this pharmacokinetic simulation study, we generated the body weights (0-49 days of postnatal age [PNA]) of neonates <28 weeks gestational age with different birth weights (550, 750, and 1050 g). Their pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on published pharmacokinetic models. Then, we simulated and compared the caffeine base concentration-time profiles of standard versus off-label caffeine citrate dose regimens., RESULTS: The half-life decreased and the weight-adjusted clearance increased more significantly in neonates with lower birth weights, resulting in lower caffeine plasma concentrations. The neonate with the lowest birth weight did not achieve a threshold trough concentration of 15 mg/L after receiving the standard dose (5 mg/kg/day), while the higher-birth-weights (>=750 g) had trough concentrations below the threshold around the second week of life. Higher caffeine doses (10 mg/kg/day) resulted in peak concentrations of <36 mg/L by 10-14 days of PNA while maintaining trough concentrations above 15 mg/L throughout the 49 days PNA., CONCLUSION: Higher-than-standard caffeine dosing may be needed for extremely premature neonates, especially for those with lower birth weights., IMPACT: Extremely premature neonates with a lower birth weight may require a higher weight-based caffeine dosing due to their higher weight-adjusted clearance and shorter half-lives. Not only do these extremely premature neonates have a higher risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to their structurally underdeveloped lungs, but the low birth weight-related underdosing may further contribute to the reduced caffeine effectiveness. Higher-than-standard caffeine citrate dosing (e.g., 10 mg/kg/day maintenance dose) may be needed to further prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe complication of preterm infants characterized by increased alveolarization and inflammation. Premature exposure to hyperoxia is believed to be a key contributor to the pathogenesis of BPD. No effective preventive or therapeutic agents have been created. Stimulator of interferon gene (STING) is associated with inflammation and apoptosis in various lung diseases. Long non-coding RNA MALAT1 has been reported to be involved in BPD. However, how MALAT1 regulates STING expression remains unknown. In this study, we assessed that STING and MALAT1 were up-regulated in the lung tissue from BPD neonates, hyperoxia-based rat models and lung epithelial cell lines. Then, using the flow cytometry and cell proliferation assay, we found that down-regulating of STING or MALAT1 inhibited the apoptosis and promoted the proliferation of hyperoxia-treated cells. Subsequently, qRT-PCR, Western blotting and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that suppressing MALAT1 decreased the expression and promoter activity of STING. Moreover, transcription factor CREB showed its regulatory role in the transcription of STING via a chromatin immunoprecipitation. In conclusion, MALAT1 interacts with CREB to regulate STING transcription in BPD neonates. STING, CREB and MALAT1 may be promising therapeutic targets in the prevention and treatment of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to discover unknown differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), analyze their functions and enriched signaling pathways, and identify hub genes correlating with BPD incidence and evolvement., RESULTS: Of 1289 DEGs identified, 568 were downregulated and 721 were upregulated. The DEGs were mainly associated with oxidative stress, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, inflammation, cell cycle, and protein binding. Eight DEGs were identified as hub genes, including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (Cxcl5), connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), interleukin 6 (IL6), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (Mapk14), platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (Timp1), and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (Timp2). IL6 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of neonates with BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Hence, BPD involves complex biological changes. Our findings indicate that inflammation and angiogenesis may play major roles in BPD pathogenesis and that IL6 has the potential to serve as a biomarker for early BPD diagnosis.

AB  - Systemic sepsis is a known risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants, a disease characterized by dysregulated angiogenesis and impaired vascular and alveolar development. We have previoulsy reported that systemic endotoxin dysregulates pulmonary angiogenesis resulting in alveolar simplification mimicking BPD in neonatal mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We undertook an unbiased discovery approach to identify novel signaling pathways programming sepsis-induced deviant lung angiogenesis. Pulmonary endothelial cells (EC) were isolated for RNA-Seq from newborn C57BL/6 mice treated with intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic systemic sepsis. LPS significantly differentially-regulated 269 genes after 6 h, and 1,934 genes after 24 h. Using bioinformatics, we linked 6 h genes previously unknown to be modulated by LPS to 24 h genes known to regulate angiogenesis/vasculogenesis to identify pathways programming deviant angiogenesis. An immortalized primary human lung EC (HPMEC-im) line was generated by SV40 transduction to facilitate mechanistic studies. RT-PCR and transcription factor binding analysis identified FOSL1 (FOS like 1) as a transcriptional regulator of LPS-induced downstream angiogenic or vasculogenic genes. Over-expression and silencing studies of FOSL1 in immortalized and primary HPMEC demonstrated that baseline and LPS-induced expression of ADAM8, CXCR2, HPX, LRG1, PROK2, and RNF213 was regulated by FOSL1. FOSL1 silencing impaired LPS-induced in vitro HPMEC angiogenesis. In conclusion, we identified FOSL1 as a novel regulator of sepsis-induced deviant angiogenic signaling in mouse lung EC and human fetal HPMEC.

AB  - Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) have accelerated lung aging and poor long-term outcomes. Klotho is an antiaging protein that modulates oxidative stress, angiogenesis and fibrosis. Here we test the hypothesis that decreased cord Klotho levels in preterm infants predict increased BPD-PH risk and early Klotho supplementation prevents BPD-like phenotype and PH in rodents exposed to neonatal hyperoxia. In experiment 1, Klotho levels were measured in cord blood of preterm infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study. In experiment 2, using an experimental BPD-PH model, rat pups exposed to room air or hyperoxia (85% O2) were randomly assigned to receive every other day injections of recombinant Klotho or placebo. The effect of Klotho on lung structure, PH and cardiac function was assessed. As compared to controls, preterm infants with BPD or BPD-PH had decreased cord Klotho levels. Early Klotho supplementation in neonatal hyperoxia-exposed rodents preserved lung alveolar and vascular structure, attenuated PH, reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling and improved cardiac function. Together, these findings have important implications as they suggest that perinatal Klotho deficiency contributes to BPD-PH risk and strategies that preserve Klotho levels, may improve long-term cardiopulmonary outcomes in preterm infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease (CLD) in premature infants. The present study was designed to elucidate the regulation of miRNA-547-3p on adrenomedullin (ADM) during the pathogenesis of BPD. We used Agilent Human 4x44K Gene Expression Microarrays v2 and miRCURY LNA TM microRNA Array to identify the differently expressed miRNA and its potential target genes, and certified them again by luciferase reporter gene analysis. We only retained target genes that met the following two conditions: first, coexisting in two databases, and second, expressing differences, and then identifying target genes by luciferase reporter gene analysis. Thus, we selected miRNA-574-3p and its target gene ADM for further research. We used real-time q-PCR to determine the expression of miRNA-574-3p and its target gene ADM in premature infants with BPD. We used microarray expression to analyze BPD samples and non-BPD samples and found that there were 516 differently expressed probes between them. The 516 differently expressed probes included 408 up-regulated probes and 108 down-regulated probes. The blood samples of BPD infants were detected by real-time q-PCR and found that the expression of miRNA-574-3p was decreased, while the expression of ADM was significantly increased. Luciferase reporter gene analysis showed that hsa-miR-574-3p can regulate the expression of luciferase with ADM 3'UTR, and decrease it by 61.84%. It has been reported in the literature that ADM can protect the premature infants with BPD. The target gene ADM of miRNA-574-3p may contribute to the prevention and treatment of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in premature infants, characterized by alveolar simplification, surfactant deficiency, and respiratory distress. In the present study, we have investigated the functional roles of sumoylated CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) in the BPD rat model. A significant increase in small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) and sumoylated C/EBPalpha protein levels were observed in BPD rats, and the levels of the sumoylated C/EBPalpha were associated with the pulmonary surfactant proteins (SPs). In order to confirm the role of sumoylated C/EBPalpha in BPD rats, SUMO1 was knocked down by lentiviral transfection of neonatal rat lungs with SUMO1-RNAi-LV. We found that the expression of C/EBPalpha and surfactant proteins increased following SUMO1 knockdown. Furthermore, the relatively low decrease in the levels of C/EBPalpha sumoylation was correlated with reduced glycogen consumption. Besides, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that sumoylation is involved in the regulation of the interaction between C/EBPalpha and TGFbeta2 in the lung. In conclusion, our findings indicate that sumoylation may act as a negative regulator of the C/EBPalpha-mediated transactivation in BPD rats. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - To investigate the evolution of lung function in preterm infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and to determine the perinatal characteristics associated with indexes of lung function in later infancy. Longitudinal lung function assessments were performed at approximately 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age in preterm infants. Perinatal characteristics were further analyzed to ascertain the determinants of lung function indexes. Although all preterm infants (n = 121; 61 without BPD and 60 with BPD) exhibited decreased lung function in early infancy (6 months of age), after body length was adjusted for, only infants with BPD exhibited poor performance. Furthermore, the lung function of infants with mild to moderate BPD caught up gradually, but the generally poor lung function performance of infants with severe BPD, especially in forced expiratory flow, persisted until later age (24 months). Regarding perinatal characteristics, the z-score of body length at the time of examination and total number of days on positive-pressure ventilation are the major determinants of lung function in later infancy.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a devastating lung condition that develops in premature newborns exposed to prolonged mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with this costly disease and effective therapies are limited. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can repair injured tissue by secreting paracrine factors known to restore the function and integrity of injured lung epithelium and endothelium. Most preclinical studies showing therapeutic efficacy of MSCs for BPD are administered either intratracheally or intravenously. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of human cord tissue-derived MSC administration given via the intranasal route. Human umbilical cord tissue MSCs were isolated, characterized, and given intranasally (500 000 cells per 20 muL) to a hyperoxia-induced rat model of BPD. Lung alveolarization, vascularization, and pulmonary vascular remodeling were restored in animals receiving MSC treatment. Gene and protein analysis suggest the beneficial effects of MSCs were attributed, in part, to a concerted effort targeting angiogenesis, immunomodulation, wound healing, and cell survival. These findings are clinically significant, as neonates who develop BPD have altered alveolar development, decreased pulmonary vascularization and chronic inflammation, all resulting in impaired tissue healing. Our study is the first to report the intranasal delivery of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly MSCs in experimental BPD is feasible, noninvasive, and an effective route that may bear clinical applicability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To characterize esophageal motility and function of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: High-resolution manometry with impedance was used to investigate esophageal motility and EGJ function in 28 tube-fed preterm infants with BPD. Patients with BPD were studied at term age during oral feeding. Thirteen healthy term-aged infants were included as controls. Esophageal analysis derived objective measures to evaluate esophageal contractile vigor, bolus distension pressure, EGJ relaxation, and EGJ barrier function (in rest and during respiration). In addition, we investigated the effect of BPD severity on these measures., KEY RESULTS: A total of 140 nutritive swallows were analyzed (BPD, n = 92; controls, n = 48). Normal esophageal peristaltic wave patterns were observed in all infants. BPD patients had higher distal contractile esophageal strength compared with controls (Kruskal-Wallis (KW) P = .048), and their deglutitive EGJ relaxation was comparable to controls. Severe BPD patients showed higher bolus distension pressures, higher EGJ resting pressures, and increased EGJ contractile integrals compared with mild BPD patients (Mann-Whitney U P = .009, KW P = .012 and KW P = .028, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Preterm infants with BPD consistently present with normal peristaltic esophageal patterns following nutritive liquid swallows. The EGJ barrier tone and relaxation pressure appeared normal. In general, infants with BPD do not have altered esophageal motor function. There is however evidence for increased flow resistance at the EGJ in severe BPD patients possibly related to an increased contractility of the diaphragm. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Altered pulmonary angiogenesis contributes to disrupted alveolarization, which is the main characteristic of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) plays an important role during lung vascular development, and recent studies have demonstrated that endoglin is engaged in the modulation of TGFbeta downstream signalling. Although there are two different isoforms of endoglin, L- and S-endoglin, little is known about the effect of S-endoglin in developing lungs. We analysed the expression of both L- and S-endoglin in the lung vasculature and its contribution to TGFbeta-activin-like kinase (ALK)-Smad signalling with respect to BPD development. Hyperoxia impaired pulmonary angiogenesis accompanied by alveolar simplification in neonatal mouse lungs. S-endoglin, phosphorylated Smad2/3 and connective tissue growth factor levels were significantly increased in hyperoxia-exposed mice, while L-endoglin, phosphor-Smad1/5 and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 levels were significantly decreased. Hyperoxia suppressed the tubular growth of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), and the selective inhibition of ALK5 signalling restored tubular growth. These results indicate that hyperoxia alters the balance in two isoforms of endoglin towards increased S-endoglin and that S-endoglin attenuates TGFbeta-ALK1-Smad1/5 signalling but stimulates TGFbeta-ALK5-Smad2/3 signalling in pulmonary ECs, which may lead to impaired pulmonary angiogenesis in developing lungs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate and validate the improvement of current risk stratification for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) early after birth by plasma protein markers (sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 14 (SIGLEC-14), basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM), angiopoietin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL-3)) in extremely premature infants., METHODS AND RESULTS: Proteome screening in first-week-of-life plasma samples of n = 52 preterm infants <32 weeks gestational age (GA) on two proteomic platforms (SomaLogic R, Olink-Proteomics R) confirmed three biomarkers with significant predictive power: BCAM, SIGLEC-14, and ANGPTL-3. We demonstrate high sensitivity (0.92) and specificity (0.86) under consideration of GA, show the proteins' critical contribution to the predictive power of known clinical risk factors, e.g., birth weight and GA, and predicted the duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation, as well as neonatal intensive care stay. We confirmed significant predictive power for BPD cases when switching to a clinically applicable method (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in an independent sample set (n = 25, p < 0.001) and demonstrated disease specificity in different cohorts of neonatal and adult lung disease., CONCLUSION: While successfully addressing typical challenges of clinical biomarker studies, we demonstrated the potential of BCAM, SIGLEC-14, and ANGPTL-3 to inform future clinical decision making in the preterm infant at risk for BPD., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Deutsches Register Klinische Studien (DRKS) No. 00004600; https://www.drks.de ., IMPACT: The urgent need for biomarkers that enable early decision making and personalized monitoring strategies in preterm infants with BPD is challenged by targeted marker analyses, cohort size, and disease heterogeneity. We demonstrate the potential of the plasma proteins BCAM, SIGLEC-14, and ANGPTL-3 to identify infants with BPD early after birth while improving the predictive power of clinical variables, confirming the robustness toward proteome assays and proving disease specificity. Our comprehensive analysis enables a phase-III clinical trial that allows full implementation of the biomarkers into clinical routine to enable early risk stratification in preterms with BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), also called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is a major consequence of preterm birth, but the role of the microbiome in its development remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed the progression of the bacterial community in ventilated preterm infants over time in the upper and lower airways, and assessed the gut-lung axis by comparing bacterial communities in the upper and lower airways with stool findings. Finally, we assessed whether the bacterial communities were associated with lung inflammation to suggest dysbiosis., METHODS: We serially sampled multiple anatomical sites including the upper airway (nasopharyngeal aspirates), lower airways (tracheal aspirate fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and the gut (stool) of ventilated preterm-born infants. Bacterial DNA load was measured in all samples and sequenced using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene., RESULTS: From 1102 (539 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 276 tracheal aspirate fluid, 89 bronchoalveolar lavage, 198 stool) samples from 55 preterm infants, 352 (32%) amplified suitably for 16S RNA gene sequencing. Bacterial load was low at birth and quickly increased with time, but was associated with predominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all sample types. There was dissimilarity in bacterial communities between the upper and lower airways and the gut, with a separate dysbiotic inflammatory process occurring in the lower airways of infants. Individual OTUs were associated with increased inflammatory markers., CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that targeted treatment of the predominant organisms, including those not routinely treated, such as Ureaplasma spp., may decrease the development of CLD in preterm-born infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are key regulators of various biological processes. The present study aimed to explore the biological roles of circRNAs in BPD pathogenesis., METHODS: A newborn BPD rat model was developed to construct a circRNA library; Illumina deep sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to reveal differential expression of circRNAs in the hyperoxia-induced BPD rat models. Sanger sequencing and a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were performed to confirm circRNAs that may be related to BPD. After miRNA binding-site prediction, we constructed a network diagram of circRNA-competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) related to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and p53 pathways using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis., RESULTS: In total, 256 differentially expressed circRNAs were detected between the hyperoxia group and the normoxia group. Of these circRNAs, 195 were up-regulated and 61 were down-regulated. The differences of circRNA distribution between the two groups were analyzed and six circRNAs were validated in the tissue samples. GO analysis indicated that 6519 target genes were enriched in cell location and biological processes. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that circRNAs involved in 242 KEGG pathways. A network diagram of circRNA-ceRNA related to TGF-beta and p53 pathways was constructed., CONCLUSIONS: CircRNAs are differentially expressed between the BPD model and control group. Many target genes of circRNAs are involved in the developmental process, which suggests that BPD may be associated with pathways including extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, vascular endothelial growth factor signaling and vascular smooth muscle contraction.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects the quality of life of infants. At present, premature exposure to hyperoxia for extended periods of time is believed to affect the development of lung tissue and vascularity, resulting in BPD. The oxidative stress caused by hyperoxia exposure is an important risk factor for BPD in premature infants. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of antioxidant mechanisms. As a microRNA, microRNA-125b (miR-125b) plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Although the Nrf2/ARE pathway has been extensively studied, little is known about the regulatory role of microRNAs in Nrf2 expression. In this study, the expression levels of Nrf2 and miR-125b in the lung tissues of premature Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and A549 cells exposed to hyperoxia were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the apoptosis of A549 cells was detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that Nrf2 and miRNA-125b in the lung tissues of premature rats increased significantly upon exposure to hyperoxia and played a protective role. Nrf2 was suppressed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in A549 cells, miR-125b was similarly inhibited, and apoptosis was significantly increased. These results suggest that miR-125b helps protect against BPD as a downstream target of Nrf2. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Excessive inflammation induced by various risk factors is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Caffeine exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects as a clinical preventive medicine for BPD. Recently, NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been demonstrated to be essential for the pathogenesis of BPD. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-induced THP-1 macrophages and to explore the underlying the detailed mechanism. We found that caffeine significantly reduced NLRP3 expression, ASC speck formation, and caspase 1 cleavage and therefore decreased IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion in THP-1 macrophages. Caffeine also markedly decreased the phosphorylation levels of MAPK and NF-kappaB pathway members, further suppressing the translocation of NF-kappaB in THP-1 macrophages. Moreover, silencing of the caffeine-antagonized adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) significantly decreased cleaved caspase 1 expression in THP-1 macrophages by reducing ROS production. Given these findings, we conclude that caffeine inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by suppressing MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling and A2aR-associated ROS production in LPS-induced THP-1 macrophages.

AB  - Being of the male sex has been identified as a risk factor for multiple morbidities associated with preterm birth, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Exposure to inflammatory stress is a well-recognized risk factor for developing BPD. Whether there is a sex difference in pulmonary innate immune TLR4 signaling, lung injury and subsequent abnormal lung development is unknown. Neonatal (P0) male and female mice (ICR) were exposed to systemic LPS (5 mg/kg, IP) and innate immune signaling, and the transcriptional response were assessed (1 and 5 hours), along with lung development (P7). Male and female mice demonstrated a similar degree of impaired lung development with decreased radial alveolar counts, increased surface area, increased airspace area and increased mean linear intercept. We found no differences between male and female mice in the baseline pulmonary expression of key components of TLR4-NFkappaB signaling, or in the LPS-induced pulmonary expression of key mediators of neonatal lung injury. Finally, we found no difference in the kinetics of LPS-induced pulmonary NFkappaB activation between male and female mice. Together, these data support the conclusion that the innate immune response to early postnatal LPS exposure and resulting pulmonary sequelae is similar in male and female mice.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and refractory disease affecting newborn children and infants with alveolar dysplasia and declined pulmonary function. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be differentially expressed in BPD progression. This study further explores the role of miR-421 via fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) in mice with BPD. A mouse model of BPD was established through the induction of hyperoxia, in which the expression pattern of miR-421 and Fgf10 was identified. Furthermore, adenovirus-packed vectors were injected in mice to intervene miR-421 and Fgf10 expression, including miR-421 mimics or inhibitors, and si-Fgf10 to explore the role of miR-421 and Fgf10 in BPD. The target relationship between miR-421 and Fgf10 was investigated. Inflammatory response and cell apoptosis were observed in the mice, with inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis-related factors detected by applying Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fgf10 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-421. Elevated expression of miR-421 was evident, while Fgf10 was poorly expressed in BPD. upregulation of miR-421 and silence of Fgf10 aggravated inflammatory response in lung tissue and promoted lung cell apoptosis in BPD. The aforementioned alterations could be reversed by downregulation of miR-421. Collectively, inhibition of miR-421 can assist in the development of BPD in mice BPD by upregulating Fgf10. Therefore, the present study provides a probable target for the treatment of BPD. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of prematurity defined by requirement for respiratory support at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), but structural sequelae like lung hyperinflation are often not quantified. Quiet-breathing, nonsedated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows tomographic quantification of lung volumes and densities. We hypothesized that functional residual capacity (FRC) and intrapleural volume (IV) are increased in BPD and correlate with qualitative radiological scoring of hyperinflation., METHODS: Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI of 17 neonates (acquired at ~39 weeks PMA) were reconstructed at end-expiration and end-inspiration via the time course of the k0 point in k-space. Images were segmented to determine total lung, tidal, parenchymal tissue, and vascular tissue volumes. FRC was calculated by subtracting parenchymal and vascular tissue volumes from IV. Respiratory rate (RR) was calculated via the UTE respiratory waveform, yielding estimates of minute ventilation when combined with tidal volumes (TVs). Two radiologists scored hyperinflation on the MR images., RESULTS: IV at FRC increased in BPD: for control, mild, and severe (patients the median volumes were 32.8, 33.5, and 50.9 mL/kg, respectively. TV (medians: 2.21, 3.64, and 4.84 mL/kg) and minute ventilation (medians: 493, 750, and 991 mL/min) increased with increasing severity of BPD (despite decreasing RR, medians: 75.6, 63.0, and 56.1 breaths/min). FRC increased with increasing severity of BPD (39.3, 38.3, and 56.0 mL, respectively). Findings were consistent with increased hyperinflation scored by radiologists., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that UTE MRI can quantify hyperinflation in neonatal BPD and that lung volumes significantly increase with disease severity.

AB  - The hexapeptide WKYMVm, which is a strong formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2 agonist, exhibits pro-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. However, its therapeutic efficacy in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been tested to date. Here, we investigated whether WKYMVm attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and ensuing injuries by upregulating FPR2. The proliferation and tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), along with the level of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, were evaluated in vitro. Newborn mice were randomly exposed to 80% oxygen or room air for 14 days starting at birth. WKYMVm (2.5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administrated daily from postnatal day (P) 5 to P8. At P14, mice were sacrificed for histopathological and morphometric analyses. Along with upregulation of FPR2 and p-ERK, WKYMVm promoted HUVEC cell proliferation and tube formation in vitro. Additionally, WKYMVm promoted proliferation of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HULEC-5a) and murine pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells in vitro. WKYMVm significantly attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation, as evidenced by increased inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, and alveolar macrophages, and resultant lung injuries, which included impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis, an increased number of apoptotic cells, and reduced levels of growth factors in vivo, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. WKYMVm attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injuries and lung inflammation by upregulating FPR2 and p-ERK.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common type of chronic lung disease in infancy; however, there is no effective treatment for it. In the present study, a neonatal mouse BPD model was established by continuous exposure to high oxygen (HO) levels. Mice were divided randomly into 5 groups: control, BPD, EPO, MSCs, and MSCs+EPO. At 2 weeks post-treatment, vessel density and the expression levels of endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) were significantly increased in the MSC+EPO group compared with the EPO or MSCs group alone; moreover, EPO significantly enhanced MSCs proliferation, migration, and anti-apoptosis ability in vitro. Furthermore, the MSCs could differentiate into cells that were positive for the type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII)-specific marker surfactant protein-C, but not positive for the AECI-specific marker aquaporin 5. Our present results suggested that MSCs in combination with EPO could significantly attenuate lung injury in a neonatal mouse model of BPD. The mechanism may be by the indirect promotion of angiogenesis, which may involve the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.

AB  - Identification of functional pathways mediating molecular responses may lead to better understanding of disease processes and suggest new therapeutic approaches. We introduce a method to detect such mediating functions using topological properties of protein-protein interaction networks. We define the concept of pathway centrality, a measure of communication between disease genes and differentially expressed genes. Using pathway centrality, we identify mediating pathways in three pulmonary diseases (asthma; bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). We systematically evaluate the significance of all identified central pathways using genetic interactions. Mediating pathways shared by all three pulmonary disorders favor innate immune and inflammation-related processes, including toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, PDGF- and angiotensin-regulated airway remodeling, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and interferon gamma. Disease-specific mediators, such as neurodevelopmental processes in BPD or adhesion molecules in COPD, are also highlighted. Some of our findings implicate pathways already in development as drug targets, while others may suggest new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial, and there are limited data about prenatal exposures and risk of BPD., STUDY DESIGN: Our study performed parallel analyses using a logistic regression model in a cohort of 4527 infants with data from a curated registry and using a phenome wide association study (PheWAS) based on ICD9/10-based phecodes. We examined 20 prenatal exposures from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) curated registry database related to pregnancy and maternal health as well as 94 maternal diagnosis phecodes with a PheWAS analysis., RESULT: In both the curated registry and PheWAS analyses, polyhydramnios was associated with an increased risk of BPD (OR 5.70, 95% CI 2.78-11.44, p = 1.37 x 10-6)., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that polyhydramnios may be a clinical indicator of premature infants at increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Combining curated registry data with PheWAS analysis creates a valuable tool to generate hypotheses., IMPACT: Polyhydramnios was significantly associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in both a curated registry and by ICD coding analysis with a phenome wide association study (PheWAS). Preterm polyhydramnios may be a clinical indicator of infants at increased risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia after preterm birth. Combining curated registry with PheWAS analysis creates a valuable tool to generate hypotheses about perinatal risk factors and morbidities associated with preterm birth. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - New perinatal care technologies have improved the survival rate of preterm neonates, but the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most intractable problems in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), remains unchanged. In present study, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was performed to detect the expression profiles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) in hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model. Significant differentially expressed RNAs were selected and clustered between the BPD group and the control group. The results revealed that expressions of 1778 lncRNAs, 1240 mRNAs, 97 circRNAs, and 201 miRNAs were significantly altered in the BPD group. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to predict the potential functions of differentially expressed RNAs. lncRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA coexpression networks were constructed to detect their association with the pathogenesis of BPD. Our study provides a systematic perspective on the potential function of RNAs during BPD. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preterm birth is a significant cause of infant morbidity and mortality, which are primarily the result of respiratory and neurodevelopmental complications. However, no objective biomarker is currently available to predict at birth the risk and severity of such complications. Thus, we sought to determine whether serum neurotrophins concentrations measured at birth correlate with risk for later development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes., METHODS: This study prospectively included 223 newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and divided into three groups: (i) preterm infants who developed BPD; (ii) preterm infants who did not develop BPD; (iii) term infants. An exploratory cohort was enrolled in West Virginia, followed by a validation cohort recruited in four NICUs in Ohio. Specimens for serum and tracheal neurotrophins concentrations were collected within 48 h of admission. Infants requiring a fraction of inspired oxygen >0.21 for at least 28 days were diagnosed with BPD. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were extrapolated from Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Third Edition (BSID-III) administered at the 24-month follow-up visit., RESULTS: Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration at birth had significant negative correlation with later diagnosis of BPD (P = 0.011) and with duration of invasive ventilation and oxygen supplementation (P = 0.009 and 0.015, respectively). Serum nerve growth factor (NGF) concentration at birth had significant positive correlation with BSID-III cognitive and language composite scores at 24 months (P < 0.001 and 0.010, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that serum neurotrophins concentrations measured at birth provide prognostic information on subsequent respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of preterm birth that leads to lifelong respiratory morbidity. The EPICure study has investigated the longitudinal health outcomes of infants born extremely preterm (EP; <26 weeks gestation). Our aim was to characterise the airway microbiome in young adults born extremely preterm, with and without neonatal BPD, in comparison to matched term-born controls. Induced sputum was collected from 92 young adults aged 19 years (51 EP and 41 controls). Typical respiratory pathogens were detected using quantitative PCR. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was completed on 74 samples (29 EP with BPD; 9 EP without BPD; and 36 controls). The preterm group with BPD had the least diverse bacterial communities. The relative abundance of Bacteriodetes, particularly Prevotella melaninogenica was significantly lower in the preterm group compared to controls. This decline was balanced by a nonsignificant increase in Firmicutes. Total Prevotella relative abundance correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s z-score (rho=0.272; p<0.05). Typical respiratory pathogen loads and prevalence were similar between groups. In conclusion, extremely preterm birth is associated with a significant dysbiosis in airway microbiome in young adulthood regardless of neonatal BPD status. This is characterised by a shift in the community composition away from Bacteriodetes as manifested in a significant drop in Prevotella relative abundance. Copyright ©ERS 2019.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) is being trialled in preterm infants to reduce brain injury, but high doses increase lung injury in ventilated preterm lambs. We aimed to determine whether early administration of lower doses of EPO could reduce ventilation-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation in preterm lambs. Ventilation was initiated in anaesthetized preterm lambs [125 +/- 1 (SD) days gestation] using an injurious strategy for the first 15 min. Lambs were subsequently ventilated with a protective strategy for a total of 2 h. Lambs were randomized to receive either intravenous saline (Vent; n = 7) or intravenous 300 ( n = 5), 1,000 (EPO1000; n = 5), or 3,000 (EPO3000; n = 5) IU/kg of human recombinant EPO via an umbilical vein. Lung tissue was collected for molecular and histological assessment of inflammation and injury and compared with unventilated control lambs (UVC; n = 8). All ventilated groups had similar blood gas and ventilation parameters, but EPO1000 lambs had a lower fraction of inspired oxygen requirement and lower alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen. Vent and EPO lambs had increased lung interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA, early lung injury genes connective tissue growth factor, early growth response protein 1, and cysteine-rich 61, and liver serum amyloid A3 mRNA compared with UVCs; no difference was observed between Vent and EPO groups. Histological lung injury was increased in Vent and EPO groups compared with UVCs, but EPO3000 lambs had increased lung injury scores compared with VENT only. Early low-doses of EPO do not exacerbate ventilation-induced lung inflammation and injury and do not provide any short-term respiratory benefit. High doses (>=3,000 IU/kg) likely exacerbate lung inflammation and injury in ventilated preterm lambs. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Trials are ongoing to assess the efficacy of erythropoietin (EPO) to provide neuroprotection for preterm infants. However, high doses of EPO increase ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) in preterm lambs. We investigated whether early lower doses of EPO may reduce VILI. We found that lower doses did not reduce, but did not increase, VILI, while high doses (>=3,000 IU/kg) increase VILI. Therefore, lower doses of EPO should be used in preterm infants, particularly those receiving respiratory support.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by a severe impairment in lung alveolarization and vascular development. We have previously shown that pulmonary angiogenesis is preserved in hyperoxia-exposed female mice accompanied by increased miR-30a expression, which is a proangiogenic miRNA. Also, miR-30a expression is decreased in human BPD. HIF-1alpha plays an essential role in postnatal lung development, especially in recovery from hyperoxic injury. Snai1 activation promotes pathological fibrosis through many mechanisms including Endo-MT, which may in turn adversely impact lung vascular development. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that higher miR-30a expression through HIF-1alpha decreases Snai1 expression in females and attenuates injury in the developing lung. Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (P1-5, 0.95 FiO2) and euthanized on P21. Neonatal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs; 18-24-week gestation donors; 3/group either sex) were subjected to hyperoxia (95% O2 and 5% CO2) or normoxia (air and 5% CO2) up to 72 h. Snai1 expression was measured in HPMECs in vitro and in neonatal mouse lungs in vivo. Also, Snai1 expression was measured in HPMECs after miR-30a mimic and miR-30a inhibitor treatment. To further establish the potential regulation of miR-30a by Hif-1alpha, miR-30a expression after Hif-1alpha inhibition was measured in HPMECs. In vivo, Snai1 expression was decreased in neonatal female lungs compared to males at P7. Increased Snai1 expression was seen in male HPMECs upon exposure to hyperoxia in vitro. Treatment with the miR-30a mimic decreased Snai1 expression in HPMECs, while miR-30a inhibition significantly increased Snai1 expression in HPMECs. siRNA-mediated loss of Hif-1alpha expression in HPMECs decreased miR-30a expression. Hif-1alpha may lead to differential sex-specific miR-30a expression and may contribute to protection from hyperoxic lung injury in female neonatal mice through decreased Snai1 expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comprehensive metabolic panel tests (CMP) are routinely performed in extremely premature infants within the first days of life. The association between the parameters of first postnatal CMP and the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains elusive., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the parameters of first postnatal CMP and the risk of BPD in a cohort of extremely premature infants (born with a gestational age less than 28 weeks or a birth weight less than 1000 grams) at the neonatal intensive care unit, Shenzhen Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, from January 2016 to October 2018. A multivariant regression model was built to assess the association of the first postnatal CMP with the development of BPD., RESULTS: A total of 256 extremely premature infants were included in this study. BPD developed in 76 (29.7%) infants. The first CMP in these infants was performed at 5 to 8 days after birth. The levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and magnesium were significantly higher in infants with BPD compared to infants with no BPD (10.2 versus 7.5 mmol/L, P < 0.001 and 0.9 versus 0.8 U/L, P = 0.001, respectively) whereas the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total protein was significantly lower in infants with BPD (215.5 versus 310.0 U/L, P = 0.002 and 41.2 versus 42.9 g/L, P = 0.037, respectively). Multiple analysis showed that a higher level of BUN (>8.18 mmol/L) was independently associated with BPD (OR 3.261, 95% CI 1.779-5.978)., CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a higher postnatal BUN level (>8.18 mmol/L) may be a predictor for the development of BPD in extremely premature infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many lung diseases. Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) conditioned media (CdM) can attenuate inflammation. Our aim was threefold: (1) summarize the existing animal literature evaluating CdM as a therapeutic agent for pediatric/adult lung disease, (2) quantify the effects of CdM on inflammation, and (3) compare inflammatory effects of CdM to MSCs., METHODS: Adhering to the Systematic Review Protocol for Animal Intervention Studies, a systematic search of English articles was performed in five databases. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed to generate random effect size using standardized mean difference (SMD)., RESULTS: A total of 10 studies met inclusion. Lung diseases included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CdM decreased inflammatory cells (1.02 SMD, 95% CI 0.86, 1.18) and cytokines (0.71 SMD, 95% CI 0.59, 0.84). The strongest effect for inflammatory cells was in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (3.74 SMD, 95% CI 3.13, 4.36) while pulmonary hypertension had the greatest reduction in inflammatory cytokine expression (1.44 SMD, 95% CI 1.18, 1.71). Overall, CdM and MSCs had similar anti-inflammatory effects., CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of animal models recapitulating lung disease, CdM improved inflammation and had an effect size comparable to MSCs. While these findings are encouraging, the risk of bias and heterogeneity limited the strength of our findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the neonatal outcomes of very preterm triplets with those of matched singletons using a large international cohort., METHODS: A retrospective matched-cohort study of preterm triplets and singletons born between 2007 and 2013 in the International Network for Evaluation of Outcomes in neonates database countries and matched by gestational age, sex, and country of birth was conducted. The primary outcome was a composite of mortality or severe neonatal morbidity (severe neurologic injury, treated retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for model 1 (maternal hypertension and birth weight z score) and model 2 (variables in model 1, antenatal steroids, and mode of birth). Models were fitted with generalizing estimating equations and random effects modeling to account for clustering., RESULTS: A total of 6079 triplets of 24 to 32 weeks' gestation or 500 to 1499 g birth weight and 18 232 matched singletons were included. There was no difference in the primary outcome between triplets and singletons (23.4% vs 24.0%, adjusted odds ratio: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-1.01 for model 1 and 1.00, 95% CI: 0.90-1.11 for model 2). Rates of severe neonatal morbidities did not differ significantly between triplets and singletons. The results were also similar for a subsample of the cohort (1648 triplets and 4944 matched singletons) born at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation., CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were identified in mortality or major neonatal morbidities between triplets who were very low birth weight or very preterm and matched singletons.

AB  - Male sex is a risk factor for development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common chronic lung disease following preterm birth. We previously found that tracheal aspirate mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from premature infants developing BPD show reduced expression of PDGFRalpha, which is required for normal lung development. We hypothesized that MSCs from male infants developing BPD exhibit a pathologic gene expression profile deficient in PDGFR and its downstream effectors, thereby favoring delayed lung development. In a discovery cohort of 6 male and 7 female premature infants, we analyzed the tracheal aspirate MSCs transcriptome. A unique gene signature distinguished MSCs from male infants developing BPD from all other MSCs. Genes involved in lung development, PDGF signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling were differentially expressed. We sought to confirm these findings in a second cohort of 13 male and 12 female premature infants. mRNA expression of PDGFRA, FGF7, WNT2, SPRY1, MMP3 and FOXF2 were significantly lower in MSCs from male infants developing BPD. In female infants developing BPD, tracheal aspirate levels of proinflammatory CCL2 and profibrotic Galectin-1 were higher compared to male infants developing BPD and female not developing BPD. Our findings support a notion for sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of BPD development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease associated with atypical pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan at the end of 2019. Transmission usually occurs via infected droplets and close personal contact; the possibility of vertical transmission is still under debate. This retrospective study aimed to analyze clinical characteristics of premature infants born to mothers with symptomatic COVID-19 disease., STUDY DESIGN: This case control study compared the clinical and laboratory data of 20 premature infants born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 with sex and gestational age-matched historical controls., RESULTS: The median gestational age and birth weight in both groups were similar. Respiratory distress developed in 11 (55.5%) infants in study group and 19 (47.5%) infants in control group. Mechanical ventilation and endotracheal surfactant administration rates were similar. Median duration of hospitalization was 8.5 (2-76) days in study group and 12 days in historical controls. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 were found to be negative twice, in the first 24 hours and later at 24 to 48 hours of life. No neutropenia or thrombocytopenia was detected in the study group. Patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis rates were similar between groups. No mortality was observed in both groups., CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few studies evaluating the clinical outcomes of premature infants born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers. There was no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected women to the neonate in our cohort. The neonatal outcomes also seem to be favorable with no mortality in preterm infants., KEY POINTS: . SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a challenge for pregnant women.. . Neonatal outcomes of premature infants born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 not well defined.. . SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have no adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in premature infants.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia is associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, wheezing and asthma in later childhood. Currently, there are no studies available investigating maternal blood pressure measurements during multiple time-points in pregnancy and respiratory outcome measures in the child. We examined the associations of maternal blood pressure and hypertensive disorders with the risk of lower lung function, wheezing and asthma in children aged 10 years. This study among 4894 children was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study. We used multivariate analyses, taking lifestyle and socioeconomic factors into account. We observed consistent associations per 5 mmHg higher maternal blood pressure in early pregnancy with a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio (z-score -0.03 (95% CI -0.05- -0.01)) and per 5 mmHg higher blood pressure in late pregnancy with a higher risk for current wheezing and current asthma (OR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.06 (95% CI 1.00-1.11), respectively). We found no associations of maternal hypertensive disorders during pregnancy with child lung function, current wheezing or current asthma.Our results suggest that higher blood pressure in pregnant women is associated with lower lung function and increased risks of current wheezing and current asthma in children. The associations may be trimester specific. Copyright ©ERS 2018.

AB  - The aim of this study is to optimize the timing of erythropoietin gene modified mesenchymal stem cells (EPO-MSCs) transplantation for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Three weeks post-operation, the results indicated that the damage of airway structure and apoptosis were significantly decreased, the proliferation was increased in three EPO-MSCs transplantation groups as compared with BPD mice. Moreover, the inflammation cytokines were improvement in early EPO-MSCs injection mice than in BPD mice, but there was no significant difference between late injection and BPD groups. Furthermore, the protein expression ratio of p-p38/p38MAPK was down-regulation in early mice but not in late transplantation mice. Our findings suggest that EPO-MSCs maybe attenuate BPD injury in early than in late administration by inhibiting inflammation response through down-regulation of the p38MAPK signalling pathway.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) plays an important role in the development and maturation of the gastrointestinal tract. Recombinant EPO (rEPO) has been used to prevent anemia of prematurity. The gastrointestinal trophic effects of EPO may reduce feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm neonates. The aim of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to evaluate the effects of rEPO on clinical outcomes such as feeding intolerance, stage II or higher NEC, any stage NEC, sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm neonates. Twenty-five RCTs (intravenous: 13; subcutaneous: 10; enteral: 2; n = 4025) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis of data from 17 RCTs (rEPO compared with placebo) with the use of a fixed-effects model showed no significant effect of rEPO on stage II or higher NEC (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.19; P = 0.39). Meta-analysis of data from 25 RCTs (rEPO compared with placebo) showed that rEPO significantly decreased the risk of any stage NEC [cases/total sample: 120/2058 (5.83%) compared with 146/1967 (7.42%); RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.97; P = 0.03]. Only one RCT reported on time to full feedings. Meta-analysis of data from 15 RCTs showed a significant reduction in late-onset sepsis after rEPO administration (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.94; P = 0.004). Meta-analysis of 13 RCTs showed no significant effect of rEPO on mortality, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Prophylactic rEPO had no effect on stage II or higher NEC, but it reduced any stage NEC, probably by reducing feeding intolerance, which is often labeled as stage I NEC. Adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A) signaling through PDGF receptor alpha is essential for alveogenesis. Previous studies have shown that Pdgfa-/- mouse lungs have enlarged alveolar airspace with absence of secondary septation, both distinctive features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To study how PDGF-A signaling is involved in alveogenesis, we generated lung-specific Pdgfa knockout mice (Pdgfafl/-; Spc-cre) and characterized their phenotype postnatally. Histological differences between mutant mice and littermate controls were visible after the onset of alveogenesis and maintained until adulthood. Additionally, we generated Pdgfafl/-; Spc-cre; PdgfraGFP/+ mice in which Pdgfra+ cells exhibit nuclear GFP expression. In the absence of PDGF-A, the number of PdgfraGFP+ cells was significantly decreased. In addition, proliferation of PdgfraGFP+ cells was reduced. During alveogenesis, PdgfraGFP+ myofibroblasts failed to form the alpha-smooth muscle actin rings necessary for alveolar secondary septation. These results indicate that PDGF-A signaling is involved in myofibroblast proliferation and migration. In addition, we show an increase in both the number and proliferation of alveolar type II cells in Pdgfafl/-; Spc-cre lungs, suggesting that the increased alveolar airspace is not caused solely by deficient myofibroblast function.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate predictors of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), laboratory and echocardiographic measures of PH were analyzed., METHODS: A retrospective review of all infants and children < 2 years of age with PH from January 2011 to August 2016 was conducted. Correlations were determined using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Differences in characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors were analyzed and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated., RESULTS: Of 56 patients, the majority were extremely premature; of African American ethnicity; and had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Patients who died were more likely to have underlying congenital heart disease; have a higher increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood (pCO2 ) with a corresponding greater mean percentage decrease in pH and percentage rise in NT-pro BNP during PH exacerbations; more likely to have been on medications for pulmonary hypertension; and have a higher RVSP/SBP (%) ratio and S/D ratio. There were positive correlations between percentage rise in NT-pro BNP and pCO2 ; NT-pro BNP and RVSP/SBP (%) ratio; and RVSP/SBP (%) ratio and S/D ratio., CONCLUSIONS: Infants and young children with pulmonary hypertension have increased morbidity and mortality. NT-pro BNP is a useful biomarker for both respiratory exacerbations and mortality, and RVSP/SBP (%) ratio and S/D ratio are echocardiographic identifiers for increased mortality.

AB  - Previous studies by our group have confirmed excessive transdifferentiation of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in a hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model, but the underlying mechanism have remained elusive. The transcription factor zonula occludens 1-associated nucleic acid binding protein (ZONAB) has the biological functions of inhibition of epithelial cell differentiation and promotion of epithelial cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to explore the regulatory effect of ZONAB on the transdifferentiation and proliferation of AECs in a model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Newborn Wistar rats were randomly allocated to a model group (inhalation of 85% O2) or a control group (inhalation of normal air), and ZONAB expression in lung tissues was detected at different time-points. Type II AECs (AEC II) isolated from normal newborn rats were primarily cultured under an atmosphere of 85 or 21% O2, and ZONAB expression in the cells was examined. The primary cells were further transfected with ZONAB plasmid or small interfering (si)RNA and then exposed to hyperoxia, and the indicators for transdifferentiation and proliferation were measured. The present study indicated that ZONAB expression in AEC II of the BPD rats was significantly decreased from 7 days of exposure to hyperoxia onwards. In the AEC II isolated from normal neonatal rats, ZONAB expression in the model group was also reduced compared with that in the control group. After transfection with the plasmid pCMV6-ZONAB, the expression of aquaporin 5 (type I alveolar epithelial cell marker) decreased and the expression of surfactant protein C (AEC II marker), proliferating-cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D1 increased, which was opposite to the effects of ZONAB siRNA. Transfection with pCMV6-ZONAB also alleviated excessive transdifferentiation and inhibited proliferation of AEC II induced by hyperoxia treatment. These results suggest that ZONAB expression in AEC II decreases under hyperoxia conditions, which promotes transdifferentiation and inhibits proliferation of AECs. This may, at least in part, be the underlying mechanism of lung epithelial injury in the hyperoxia-induced BPD model.

AB  - Neonatal respiratory distress is a major mortality factor in cloned animals, but the pathogenesis of this disease is rarely investigated. In this study, four neonatal cloned cattle, born after full-term gestation, exhibited symptoms of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), which included symptoms of hyaline membrane disease as well as disordered surfactant homeostasis in their collapsed lungs. No differences in DNA methylation or histone modifications correlated with the suppressed SPB and SPC transcription observed in the cloned cattle group (p > 0.05), whereas TTF-1 occupancy at SPB and SPC promoter regions in cloned cattle was significantly reduced to 24% and 20% that of normal lungs, respectively (SPB, p < 0.05; SPC, p < 0.01). Decreased TTF1 expression, dysregulation of SPB and SPC transcription by TTF-1, and disordered proteolytic processing of Surfactant protein B precursor together potentially contribute to the disruption of surfactant homeostasis and NRDS in bovine clones. Elucidation of the associated mechanisms should facilitate the development of novel preventive or therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality rate of cloned animals and to improve the efficiency of SCNT technology.

AB  - Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are at risk for frequent respiratory infections and reduced pulmonary function. We studied whether neonatal hyperoxia disrupts adaptive immune responses in adult mice, contributing to higher respiratory-related morbidities seen in these infants. Newborn mice litters were randomized at 3 days to 85% O2 or room air (RA) for 12 days. Whole lung mRNA was isolated in both the groups at 2 weeks and 3 months. Gene expression for T-cell and B-cell adaptive immune response was performed by real-time PCR and qRT-PCR; protein expression (p21, IL4, IL10, IL27, cd4) was performed by enzyme immunoassay along with p21 immunohistochemistry. Hyperoxia increased expression of p21 and decreased expression of 19 genes representing T/B-cell activation by >= fourfold; three of them significantly (Rag1, Cd1d1, Cd28) compared to the RA group at 2 weeks. Despite RA recovery, the expression of IFNgamma, IL27, and CD40 was significantly reduced at 3 months in the hyperoxia group. Expression of p21 was significantly higher and IL27 protein lower at 2 weeks following hyperoxia. Adult mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia had lower IL4 and IL10 in the lung at 3 months. Adaptive immune responses are developmentally regulated and neonatal hyperoxia suppresses expression of genes involved in T-/B-cell activation with continued alterations in gene expression at 3 months. Dysfunction of adaptive immune responses increases the risk for susceptibility to infection in premature infants. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are characterized by the destruction or malformation of the alveolar regions of the lung. The underlying pathomechanisms at play are an area of intense interest since these mechanisms may reveal pathways suitable for interventions to drive reparative processes. Lipid-laden fibroblasts (lipofibroblasts) express the Perilipin 2 (Plin2) gene-product, PLIN2, commonly called adipose-differentiation related protein (ADRP). These cells are also thought to play a role in alveolarization and repair after injury to the alveolus. Progress in defining the functional contribution of lipofibroblasts to alveolar generation and repair is hampered by a lack of in vivo tools. The present study reports the generation of an inducible mouse Cre-driver line to target cells of the ADRP lineage. Robust Cre-mediated recombination in this mouse line was detected in mesenchymal cells of the postnatal lung, and in additional organs including the heart, liver, and spleen. The generation and validation of this valuable new tool to genetically target, manipulate, and trace cells of the ADRP lineage is critical for assessing the functional contribution of lipofibroblasts to lung development and repair.

AB  - Neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD) affects a significant number of neonates receiving mechanical ventilation with oxygen-rich gas (MV-O2). Regardless, the primary molecular driver of the disease remains elusive. We discover significant enrichment for SNPs in the PDGF-Ralpha gene in preterms with nCLD and directly test the effect of PDGF-Ralpha haploinsufficiency on the development of nCLD using a preclinical mouse model of MV-O2 In the context of MV-O2, attenuated PDGF signaling independently contributes to defective septation and endothelial cell apoptosis stemming from a PDGF-Ralpha-dependent reduction in lung VEGF-A. TGF-beta contributes to the PDGF-Ralpha-dependent decrease in myofibroblast function. Remarkably, endotracheal treatment with exogenous PDGF-A rescues both the lung defects in haploinsufficient mice undergoing MV-O2 Overall, our results establish attenuated PDGF signaling as an important driver of nCLD pathology with provision of PDGF-A as a protective strategy for newborns undergoing MV-O2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a lung disease in premature infants caused by therapeutic oxygen supplemental and characterized by impaired pulmonary development which persists into later life. While advances in neonatal care have improved survival rates of premature infants, cases of BPD have been increasing with limited therapeutic options for prevention and treatment. This study was designed to explore the relationship between gestational age (GA), birth weight, and estimated blood cell-type composition in premature infants and to elucidate early epigenetic biomarkers associated with BPD., METHODS: Cord blood DNA from preterm neonates that went on to develop BPD (n = 14) or not (non-BPD, n = 93) was applied to Illumina 450 K methylation arrays. Blood cell-type compositions were estimated using DNA methylation profiles. Multivariable robust regression analysis elucidated CpGs associated with BPD risk. cDNA microarray analysis of cord blood RNA identified differentially expressed genes in neonates who later developed BPD., RESULTS: The development of BPD and the need for oxygen supplementation were strongly associated with GA (BPD, p < 1.0E-04; O2 supplementation, p < 1.0E-09) and birth weight (BPD, p < 1.0E-02; O2 supplementation, p < 1.0E-07). The estimated nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) percent was negatively associated with birth weight and GA, positively associated with hypomethylation of the tobacco smoke exposure biomarker cg05575921, and high-NRBC blood samples displayed a hypomethylation profile. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) identified 38 (Bonferroni) and 275 (false discovery rate 1%) differentially methylated CpGs associated with BPD. BPD-associated CpGs in cord blood were enriched for lung maturation and hematopoiesis pathways. Stochastic epigenetic mutation burden at birth was significantly elevated among those who developed BPD (adjusted p = 0.02). Transcriptome changes in cord blood cells reflected cell cycle, development, and pulmonary disorder events in BPD., CONCLUSIONS: While results must be interpreted with caution because of the small size of this study, NRBC content strongly impacted DNA methylation profiles in preterm cord blood and EWAS analysis revealed potential insights into biological pathways involved in BPD pathogenesis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the main consequence of prematurity, has a significant heritability, but little is known about predisposing genes. The aim of this study was to identify gene loci predisposing infants to BPD. The initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) included 174 Finnish preterm infants of gestational age 24-30 weeks. Thereafter, the most promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BPD were genotyped in both Finnish (n = 555) and non-Finnish (n = 388) replication cohorts. Finally, plasma CRP levels from the first week of life and the risk of BPD were assessed. SNP rs11265269, flanking the CRP gene, showed the strongest signal in GWAS (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, p = 3.4 x 10-6). This association was nominally replicated in Finnish and French African populations. A number of other SNPs in the CRP region, including rs3093059, had nominal associations with BPD. During the first week of life the elevated plasma levels of CRP predicted the risk of BPD (OR 3.4, p = 2.9 x 10-4) and the SNP rs3093059 associated nominally with plasma CRP levels. Finally, SNP rs11265269 was identified as a risk factor of BPD (OR 1.8, p = 5.3 x 10-5), independently of the robust antenatal risk factors. As such, in BPD, a potential role for variants near CRP gene is proposed.

AB  - Lysyl oxidases are credited with pathogenic roles in lung diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Lysyl oxidases facilitate the covalent intra- and intermolecular cross-linking of collagen and elastin fibers, thereby imparting tensile strength to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Alternative ECM-independent roles have recently been proposed for lysyl oxidases, including regulation of growth factor signaling, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation, all of which impact cell phenotype. We demonstrate here that three of the five lysyl oxidase family members, Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2, are highly expressed in primary mouse lung fibroblasts compared with other constituent cell types of the lung. Microarray analyses revealed that small interfering RNA knockdown of Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 was associated with apparent changes in the expression of 134, 3,761, and 3,554 genes, respectively, in primary mouse lung fibroblasts. The impact of lysyl oxidase expression on steady-state Mmp3, Mmp9, Eln, Rarres1, Gdf10, Ifnb1, Csf2, and Cxcl9 mRNA levels was validated, which is interesting, since the corresponding gene products are relevant to lung development and BPD, where lysyl oxidases play a functional role. In vivo, the expression of these genes broadly correlated with Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 expression in a mouse model of BPD. Furthermore, beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a selective lysyl oxidase inhibitor, did not affect the steady-state mRNA levels of lysyl oxidase target genes, in vitro in lung fibroblasts or in vivo in BAPN-treated mice. This study is the first to report that lysyl oxidases broadly influence the cell transcriptome. Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) using an established cell model of BPD. For this purpose, EA.hy926 cell cultures were divided into 4 groups as follows: the air group as the blank control, the hyperoxia group, the hyperoxia plus PBEF siRNA group and the hyperoxia plus scramble siRNA group. Cell viability and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined using respective kits. Moreover, the protein and mRNA expression levels of PBEF, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were also detected by corresponding methods. Compared with the hyperoxia group, the ROS levels in the hyperoxia plus PBEF siRNA group were significantly reduced (P<0.01). The silencing of PBEF increased cell viability compared with the hyperoxia group. The protein and mRNA expression levels of PBEF, IL-8 and TNF-alpha were all decreased in the hyperoxia plus PBEF siRNA group compared with the hyperoxia group (P<0.01). Our study thus demonstrates that the inhibition of PBEF attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation induced by hyperoxia in EA.hy926 cells, suggesting that PBEF may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target, which may be used for the development of novel treatment strategies for BPD.

AB  - Hyperoxia is one of the primary causes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which may occur in premature infants following supplemental oxygen therapy. Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which is a molecular chaperone located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), has been reported to regulate hyperoxia-associated ER stress. The role of GRP78 in lung epithelial cells during hyperoxia remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the A549 cultured human lung epithelial cell line was exposed to hyperoxic conditions, and then transfected with short interfering (si)RNA targeted to GRP78. siRNA or pEGFP-N1 plasmid were used to knockdown or overexpress specific genes, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect RNA and protein levels of gene expression, and flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. The expression levels of ER stress-associated genes were determined, and a significant increase in C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression and apoptosis of A549 cells was observed, following GRP78 knockdown. The overexpression of CHOP downregulated B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 expression levels, upregulated BCL2 associated X (Bax), and increased apoptosis of A549 cells under conditions of hyperoxia. CHOP knockdown demonstrated the opposite effect on Bcl-2 and Bax expression levels. These results suggested that GRP78 silencing promoted lung epithelial cell apoptosis during hyperoxia, via regulation of the CHOP pathway.

AB  - With considerable morbidity and mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a focus of attention in neonatology. Hyperoxia-induced lung injury has long been used as a model of BPD. Among all the signaling pathways involved, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been demonstrated to play an important role, and is known to be regulated by vitamin D. This study aimed at elucidating the effect of vitamin D on hyperoxia-induced lung injury and the role of TLR4 in the process. Vitamin D was administered to hyperoxia-treated neonatal rats to investigate changes in the morphology of lungs and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins and TLR4. Vitamin D attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung injury by protecting the integrity of the lung structure, decreasing extracellular matrix deposition and inhibiting inflammation. The upregulation of TLR4 by hyperoxia was ameliorated by vitamin D and apoptosis was reduced. Vitamin D administration antagonized the activation of TLR4 and therefore alleviated inflammation, reduced apoptosis and preserved lung structure.

AB  - Postnatal lung maturation generates a large number of small alveoli, with concomitant thinning of alveolar septal walls, generating a large gas exchange surface area but minimizing the distance traversed by the gases. This demand for a large and thin gas exchange surface area is not met in disorders of lung development, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) histopathologically characterized by fewer, larger alveoli and thickened alveolar septal walls. Diseases such as BPD are often modeled in the laboratory mouse to better understand disease pathogenesis or to develop new interventional approaches. To date, there have been no stereology-based longitudinal studies on postnatal mouse lung development that report dynamic changes in alveoli number or alveolar septal wall thickness during lung maturation. To this end, changes in lung structure were quantified over the first 22 mo of postnatal life of C57BL/6J mice. Alveolar density peaked at postnatal day (P)39 and remained unchanged at 9 mo (P274) but was reduced by 22 mo (P669). Alveoli continued to be generated, initially at an accelerated rate between P5 and P14, and at a slower rate thereafter. Between P274 and P669, loss of alveoli was noted, without any reduction in lung volume. A progressive thinning of the alveolar septal wall was noted between P5 and P28. Pronounced sex differences were observed in alveoli number in adult (but not juvenile) mice, when comparing male and female mouse lungs. This sex difference was attributed exclusively to the larger volume of male mouse lungs. Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - We characterized the expression profile of angiogenesis-related genes (ARG) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes in preterm infants, with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We reanalyzed a gene expression dataset for preterm infants from the Gene Expression Omnibus database using the Gene-Cloud of Biotechnology Information platform. A total of 1,652 genes were differentially (1.2-fold change) expressed: 811 were highly expressed in infants with BPD, and 841 were highly expressed in those without BPD. Twenty-eight and 11 ARGs were upregulated in infants with and without BPD, respectively. Among 27 detected MMPs and TIMPs, MMP8, MMP9, MMP25, TIMP2 and TIMP3 were differently expressed. Levels of THBS1, MMP8, MMP9, MMP25, TIMP2 and TIMP3 increased as severity of BPD and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) increased, whereas ETS1, LEF1 and SPOCK2 exhibited the opposite trend. Expression of ETS1 and LEF1 had a fitting rate of R2 = 0.849 and P < 0.001. ELISAs showed a positive correlation between THBS1 and CD36 (receptor of THBS1) levels in serum samples from preterm infants. Our study indicates that the upregulation of THBS1 and downregulation of ETS1, LEF1 promotes BPD in preterm infants by disrupting blood vessel formation rather than by dysregulation of MMPs and TIMPs.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease of preterm infants, which is characterized by fewer, enlarged alveoli and increased inflammation. BPD has grave consequences for affected infants, but no effective and safe therapy exists. We previously showed that prophylactic treatment with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) prevents murine BPD induced by perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia. Here, we used the same BPD model to assess whether an alternative anti-inflammatory agent, protein C (PC), is as effective as IL-1Ra against BPD. We also tested whether delayed administration or a higher dose of IL-1Ra affects its ability to ameliorate BPD and investigated aspects of drug safety. Pups were reared in room air (21% O2 ) or hyperoxia (65% or 85% O2 ) and received daily injections with vehicle, 1200 IU/kg PC, 10 mg/kg IL-1Ra (early or late onset) or 100 mg/kg IL-1Ra. After 3 or 28 days, lung and brain histology were assessed and pulmonary cytokines were analysed using ELISA and cytokine arrays. We found that PC only moderately reduced the severe impact of BPD on lung structure (e.g. 18% increased alveolar number by PC versus 34% by IL-1Ra); however, PC significantly reduced IL-1beta, IL-1Ra, IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 by up to 89%. IL-1Ra at 10 mg/kg prevented BPD more effectively than 100 mg/kg IL-1Ra, but only if treatment commenced at day 1 of life. We conclude that prophylactic low-dose IL-1Ra and PC ameliorate BPD and have potential as the first remedy for one of the most devastating diseases preterm babies face. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung condition in preterm infants that results in abnormal lung development and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality, making BPD one of the most common complications of preterm birth. We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of Klebsiella, Salmonella, Escherichia/Shigella, and Bifidobacterium in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71+ early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. IMPORTANCE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the microbiota may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.

AB  - Impaired vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesized that the effects of VEGF on lung structure during development may be mediated through its downstream effects on both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activity, and that, in the absence of eNOS, trophic effects of VEGF would be mediated through HGF signaling. To test this hypothesis, we performed an integrative series of in vitro (fetal rat lung explants and isolated fetal alveolar and endothelial cells) and in vivo studies with normal rat pups and eNOS(-/-) mice. Compared with controls, fetal lung explants from eNOS(-/-) mice had decreased terminal lung bud formation, which was restored with recombinant human VEGF (rhVEGF) treatment. Neonatal eNOS(-/-) mice were more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced inhibition of lung growth than controls, which was prevented with rhVEGF treatment. Fetal alveolar type II (AT2) cell proliferation was increased with rhVEGF treatment only with mesenchymal cell (MC) coculture, and these effects were attenuated with anti-HGF antibody treatment. Unlike VEGF, HGF directly stimulated isolated AT2 cells even without MC coculture. HGF directly stimulates fetal pulmonary artery endothelial cell growth and tube formation, which is attenuated by treatment with JNJ-38877605, a c-Met inhibitor. rHGF treatment preserves alveolar and vascular growth after postnatal exposure to SU-5416, a VEGF receptor inhibitor. We conclude that the effects of VEGF on AT2 and endothelial cells during lung development are partly mediated through HGF-c-Met signaling and speculate that reciprocal VEGF-HGF signaling between epithelia and endothelia is disrupted in infants who develop BPD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen (H2) is regarded as a novel therapeutic agent against several diseases owing to its inherent biosafety. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been widely considered among adverse pregnancy outcomes, without effective treatment. Placenta plays a role in defense, synthesis, and immunity, which provides a new perspective for the treatment of BPD. This study aimed to investigate if H2 reduced the placental inflammation to protect the neonatal rat against BPD damage and potential mechanisms., METHODS: We induced neonatal BPD model by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 microg) into the amniotic fluid at embryonic day 16.5 as LPS group. LPS + H2 group inhaled 42% H2 gas (4 h/day) until the samples were collected. We primarily analyzed the neonatal outcomes and then compared inflammatory levels from the control group (CON), LPS group and LPS + H2 group. HE staining was performed to evaluate inflammatory levels. RNA sequencing revealed dominant differentially expressed genes. Bioinformatics analysis (GO and KEGG) of RNA-seq was applied to mine the signaling pathways involved in protective effect of H2 on the development of LPS-induced BPD. We further used qRT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA methods to verify differential expression of mRNA and proteins. Moreover, we verified the correlation between the upstream signaling pathways and the downstream targets in LPS-induced BPD model., RESULTS: Upon administration of H2, the inflammatory infiltration degree of the LPS-induced placenta was reduced, and infiltration significantly narrowed. Hydrogen normalized LPS-induced perturbed lung development and reduced the death ratio of the fetus and neonate. RNA-seq results revealed the importance of inflammatory response biological processes and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in protective effect of hydrogen on BPD. The over-activated upstream signals [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-kappaB p65), Caspase1 (Casp1) and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome] in LPS placenta were attenuated by H2 inhalation. The downstream targets, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, IL-1beta, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1)], were decreased both in mRNA and protein levels by H2 inhalation in LPS-induced placentas to rescue them from BPD. Correlation analysis displayed a positive association of TLR4-mediated signaling pathway both proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in placenta., CONCLUSION: H2 inhalation ameliorates LPS-induced BPD by inhibiting excessive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the TLR4-NFkappaB-IL6/NLRP3 signaling pathway in placenta and may be a potential therapeutic strategy for BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature infants, subjected to supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, may develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease characterized by alveolar dysplasia and impaired vascularization. We and others have shown that hyperoxia causes senescence in cultured lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Although miR-34a modulates senescence, it is unclear whether it contributes to hyperoxia-induced senescence. We hypothesized that hyperoxia increases miR-34a levels, leading to cellular senescence., METHODS: We exposed mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells and primary human small airway epithelial cells to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) or air (21% O2/5% CO2) for 24 h. Newborn mice (< 12 h old) were exposed to hyperoxia (> 95% O2) for 3 days and allowed to recover in room air until postnatal day 7. Lung samples from premature human infants requiring mechanical ventilation and control subjects who were not mechanically ventilated were employed., RESULTS: Hyperoxia caused senescence as indicated by loss of nuclear lamin B1, increased p21 gene expression, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. Expression of miR-34a-5p was increased in epithelial cells and newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia, and in premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation. Transfection with a miR-34a-5p inhibitor reduced hyperoxia-induced senescence in MLE-12 cells. Additionally, hyperoxia increased protein levels of the oncogene and tumor-suppressor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), which were inhibited by a miR-34a-5p inhibitor. Furthermore, KLF4 knockdown by siRNA transfection reduced hyperoxia-induced senescence., CONCLUSION: Hyperoxia increases miR-34a-5p, leading to senescence in lung epithelial cells. This is dictated in part by upregulation of KLF4 signaling. Therefore, inhibiting hyperoxia-induced senescence via miR-34a-5p or KLF4 suppression may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate the detrimental consequences of hyperoxia in the neonatal lung.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children worldwide. Premature birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, and Down syndrome are risk factors for high mortality and prolonged morbidity after RSV infection. Conversely, many previously healthy, full-term children are also admitted to the hospital because of RSV, and some of them experience severe sequelae or die due to the virus. Various complications of RSV infection have been reported, such as encephalopathy, encephalitis, and cardiomyopathy. However, the pathogenesis of serious cases in children without an underlying disease has not been elucidated. In this report, we present 2 RSV-related deaths of children who were born at full-term and developed normally up to the age of 19 months. Their cardiopulmonary arrests occurred within half a day after the onset of symptoms, such as cough and high fever. Many postmortem examinations were performed to investigate their unexpected deaths. Histopathological examinations revealed extensive bronchiolitis and mild pneumonia accompanying airway obstruction. Immunostaining revealed the presence of the virus mainly in bronchial epithelia, but not in alveoli. Complete brain edema was prominent, and encephalopathy was developing. Blood tests revealed that the IL-6 level was elevated more than >200-fold above normal, despite a normal C-reactive protein level. Because IL-6 may reflect the severity of bronchial epithelial damage and contribute to brain edema, an extreme elevation of IL-6 may predict the risk for sudden death in children with RSV infection.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is often complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH). We investigated three biomarkers potentially suitable as screening markers for extremely preterm infants at risk of BPD-associated PH. In this prospective observational cohort study conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit, 83 preterm infants with BPD born <28-wk gestation and still inpatients at 36-wk corrected age received an echocardiogram and blood tests of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin I, and YKL-40. Infants were analyzed according to echocardiographic evidence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Thirty infants had evidence of TR on echocardiogram at 36-wk corrected age. Infants with or without TR had similar baseline demographics: mean +/- SD gestational age 261 +/- 12 vs. 261 +/- 11 wk and birth weight 830 +/- 206 vs. 815 +/- 187 g, respectively. There was no difference in duration of respiratory support. The right ventricular systolic pressure of infants with evidence of TR was 40 +/- 16 mmHg. BNP was the only biomarker that proved to be significantly higher in infants with evidence of TR: median (interquartile range) serum level 54.5 (35-105) vs. 41.5 (30-59) pg/ml, P = 0.043. Subgroup analysis of infants with severe BPD requiring discharge on home oxygen or BPD-related mortality revealed similar results. There was no difference between groups for troponin I and YKL-40. In conclusion, increased serum levels of BNP were associated with evidence of TR at 36-wk corrected gestational age in extremely preterm infants, suggesting a potential role as a screening biomarker for BPD-associated PH.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the chronic lung disease associated with premature birth, characterized by impaired vascular and alveolar growth. In neonatal rats bleomycin decreases lung growth and causes pulmonary hypertension (PH), which is poorly responsive to nitric oxide. In the developing lung, through Rho kinase (ROCK) activation, ET-1 impairs endothelial cell function; however, whether ET-1-ROCK interactions contribute to impaired vascular and alveolar growth in experimental BPD is unknown. Neonatal rats were treated daily with intraperitoneal bleomycin with and without selective ETA (BQ123/BQ610) and ETB (BQ788) receptor blockers, nonselective ET receptor blocker (ETRB) (bosentan), or fasudil (ROCK inhibitor). At day 14, lungs were harvested for morphometrics, and measurements of Fulton's index (RV/LV+S), medial wall thickness (MWT), and vessel density. Lung ET-1 protein and ROCK activity (phospho-MYPT-1:total MYPT-1 ratio) were also measured by Western blot analysis. Bleomycin increased lung ET-1 protein expression by 65%, RV/LV+S by 60%, mean linear intercept (MLI) by 212%, and MWT by 140% and decreased radial alveolar count (RAC) and vessel density by 40 and 44%, respectively (P < 0.01 for each comparison). After bleomycin treatment, fasudil and bosentan partially restored RAC and vessel density and decreased MLI, RV/LV+S, and MWT to normal values. Bleomycin increased ROCK activity by 120%, which was restored to normal values by bosentan but not selective ETRB. We conclude that ET-1-ROCK interactions contribute to decreased alveolar and vascular growth and PH in experimental BPD. We speculate that nonselective ETRB and ROCK inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of infants with BPD and PH. Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that decreased miR-17~92 cluster expression was 1) present in lungs from human infants who died with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); 2) inversely correlated with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression and promoter methylation; and 3) correlated with a subsequent diagnosis of BPD at 36 wk gestational age. We tested the hypothesis that plasma miR-17 levels would be lowest in infants who ultimately develop severe BPD. Secondly, we utilized our well-characterized murine model of severe BPD that combines perinatal inflammation with postnatal hyperoxia to test the hypothesis that alterations in lung miR-17~92, DNMT, and promoter methylation in our model would mirror our findings in tissues from premature human infants. Plasma was obtained during the first 5 days of life from premature infants born <=32 wk gestation. Lung tissues were harvested from mice exposed to maternal inflammation and neonatal hyperoxia for 14 days after birth. miR-17~92 cluster expression and DNA methyltransferase expression were measured by qRT-PCR, and promoter methylation was assessed by Methyl-Profiler assay. Plasma miR-17 levels are significantly lower in the first week of life in human infants who develop severe BPD compared with mild or moderate BPD. Data from our severe BPD murine model reveal that lung miR-17~92 cluster expression is significantly attenuated, and levels inversely correlated with DNMT expression and miR-17~92 cluster promoter methylation. Collectively, our data support a plausible role for epigenetically altered miR-17~92 cluster in the pathogenesis of severe BPD. Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Chronic lung disease of prematurity/bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity in developed countries. Inflammation is a prominent finding. Currently available interventions have associated toxicities and limited efficacy. While BPD often resolves in childhood, survivors of preterm birth are at risk for acquired respiratory disease in early life and are more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adulthood. We previously cloned Crispld2 (Lgl1), a glucocorticoid-regulated mesenchymal secretory protein that modulates lung branching and alveogenesis through mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. Absence of Crispld2 is embryonic lethal. Heterozygous Crispld2+/- mice display features of BPD, including distal airspace enlargement, disruption of elastin, and neonatal lung inflammation. CRISPLD2 also plays a role in human fetal lung fibroblast cell expansion, migration, and mesenchymal-epithelial signaling. This study assessed the effects of endogenous and exogenous CRISPLD2 on expression of proinflammatory mediators in human fetal and adult (normal and COPD) lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. CRISPLD2 expression was upregulated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human fetal lung fibroblast line (MRC5). LPS-induced upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and CCL2 was exacerbated in MRC5-CRISPLD2(knockdown) cells. siRNA suppression of endogenous CRISPLD2 in adult lung fibroblasts (HLFs) led to augmented expression of IL-8, IL-6, CCL2. LPS-stimulated expression of proinflammatory mediators by human lung epithelial HAEo- cells was attenuated by purified secretory CRISPLD2. RNA sequencing results from HLF-CRISPLD2(knockdown) suggest roles for CRISPLD2 in extracellular matrix and in inflammation. Our data suggest that suppression of CRISPLD2 increases the risk of lung inflammation in early life and adulthood. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by lifelong obstructive lung disease and profound, refractory bronchospasm. It is observed among survivors of premature birth who have been treated with prolonged supplemental oxygen. Therapeutic options are limited. Using a neonatal mouse model of BPD, we show that hyperoxia increases activity and expression of a mediator of endogenous bronchoconstriction, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase. MicroRNA-342-3p, predicted in silico and shown in this study in vitro to suppress expression of GSNO reductase, was decreased in hyperoxia-exposed pups. Both pretreatment with aerosolized GSNO and inhibition of GSNO reductase attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo among juvenile and adult mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia. Our data suggest that neonatal hyperoxia exposure causes detrimental effects on airway hyperreactivity through microRNA-342-3p-mediated upregulation of GSNO reductase expression. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that this adverse effect can be overcome by supplementing its substrate, GSNO, or by inhibiting the enzyme itself. Rates of BPD have not improved over the past two decades; nor have new therapies been developed. GSNO-based therapies are a novel treatment of the respiratory problems that patients with BPD experience. Copyright © 2016 by The Author(s).

AB  - Isolation of Ureaplasma spp. from preterm neonates and the association with development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has been previously investigated. However, few studies have contrasted the nature of infection in twins. In this article, we report that dizygotic twins (1 girl, 1 boy) born at 24 weeks gestation both yielded culturable Ureaplasma from endotracheal secretions. The samples were part of a serial blind collection cohort of ventilated premature neonates, and analysis of repeat cultures showed stable, separate infections over a period of 17 and 21 days, respectively. Immunoblot and probe-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis determined that Twin 1 was solely infected with Ureaplasma parvum (specifically, serovar 6 by gene sequencing), whereas Twin 2 was solely infected with Ureaplasma urealyticum (specifically, genotype A- serovars 2, 5, and 8 by gene sequencing). Immunoblot analysis found that the major surface antigen (multiple-banded antigen) altered relative mass for both strains during the course of infection. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of extracted endotracheal aspirates confirmed no evidence of mixed infection for either twin. Failure of sentinel ventilated preterm infants on the same ward to acquire Ureaplasma infection after the first week of birth suggests no cot-to-cot transfer of Ureaplasma infection occurred. This study demonstrated not only a contrasting clinical outcome for a set of twins infected with 2 separate species of Ureaplasma, but also the first real-time demonstration of multiple-banded antigen alteration and evolution of Ureaplasma over the course of a clinical infection.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation of preterm lambs causes lung inflammation and injury to the airway epithelium, which is repaired by 15 days after ventilation. In mice, activated basal cells (p63+, KRT14+, KRT8+) initiate injury repair to the trachea, whereas club cells coordinate distal airway repair. In both human and sheep, basal cells line the pseudostratified airways to the distal bronchioles with club cells only present in terminal bronchioles. Mechanical ventilation causes airway epithelial injury that is repaired through basal cell activation in the fetal lung. Ewes at 123 +/- 1 day gestational age had the head and chest of the fetus exteriorized and tracheostomy placed. With placental circulation intact, fetal lambs were mechanically ventilated with up to 15 ml/kg for 15 min with 95% N2/5% CO2 Fetal lambs were returned to the uterus for up to 24 h. The trachea, left mainstem bronchi, and peripheral lung were evaluated for epithelial injury and cellular response consistent with repair. Peripheral lung tissue had inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, epithelial growth factor receptor ligand upregulation, increased p63 expression, and proliferation of pro-SPB, TTF-1 positive club cells. In bronchi, KRT14 and KRT8 mRNA increased without increases in Notch pathway mRNA or proliferation. In trachea, mRNA increased for Notch ligands, SAM pointed domain-containing Ets transcription factor and mucin 5B, but not for basal cell markers. A brief period of mechanical ventilation causes differential epithelial activation between trachea, bronchi, and peripheral lung. The repair mechanisms identified in adult mice occur at different levels of airway branching in fetal sheep with basal and club cell activation. Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to investigate the protection effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in combination with EPO against hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) injury in neonatal mice. BPD model was prepared by continuous high oxygen exposure, 1x106 bone marrow MSCs and 5000U/kg recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) were injected respectively. Results showed that administration of MSCs, EPO especially MSCs+EPO significant attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung damage with a decrease of fibrosis, radical alveolar counts and inhibition of the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, MSCs+EPO co-treatment more significantly suppressed the levels of transforming growth factor-beta1(TGF-beta1) than MSCs or EPO alone. Collectively, these results suggested that MSCs, EPO in particular MSCs+EPO co-treatment could promote lung repair in hyperoxia-induced alveoli dysplasia injury via inhibition of TGF-beta1 signaling pathway to further suppress EMT process and may be a promising therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading complication of premature birth and occurs primarily in infants delivered during the saccular stage of lung development. Histopathology shows decreased alveolarization and a pattern of fibroblast proliferation and differentiation to the myofibroblast phenotype. Little is known about the molecular pathways and cellular mechanisms that define BPD pathophysiology and progression. We have developed a novel three-dimensional human model of the fibroblast activation associated with BPD, and using this model we have identified the Notch pathway as a key driver of fibroblast activation and proliferation in response to changes in oxygen. Fetal lung fibroblasts were cultured on sodium alginate beads to generate lung organoids. After exposure to alternating hypoxia and hyperoxia, the organoids developed a phenotypic response characterized by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and other genes known to be upregulated in BPD and also demonstrated increased expression of downstream effectors of the Notch pathway. Inhibition of Notch with a gamma-secretase inhibitor prevented the development of the pattern of cellular proliferation and alpha-SMA expression in our model. Analysis of human autopsy tissue from the lungs of infants who expired with BPD demonstrated evidence of Notch activation within fibrotic areas of the alveolar septae, suggesting that Notch may be a key driver of BPD pathophysiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Motor Optimality Score-Revised (MOS-R) is a detailed scoring of the General Movement Assessment (GMA), measuring the spontaneous behaviors of infants. Infants born moderate-late preterm are not traditionally followed in high-risk clinics, but have increased risk of neurodevelopmental disability., AIMS: Compare MOS-R at 3 months corrected age (CA) in high-risk (HR; very preterm or abnormal neuroimaging) infants to infants born moderate-late preterm (MLP)., STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective cohort study, parents of enrolled infants created video recordings using an app at 3 months CA. Videos were scored with the General Movement Assessment (GMA) and MOS-R. MOS-R scores were divided into "higher-risk" (<=19) and "lower-risk" (>=20)., SUBJECTS: 181 infants born MLP or categorized as HR., RESULTS: Among enrolled infants, 68 (38 %) were in the MLP group, and 113 infants were in the HR group. The HR group had 3.8 increased odds of having an aberrant GMA score compared to the MLP group (p < 0.01, 95 % CI 1.38-10.52). The HR group had significantly lower MOS-R scores (mean 20) than the MLP group (mean 24; p < 0.001; 95%CI 3.3-7.3). The HR group had 11.2 increased odds of having a higher-risk MOS-R score (95%CI 2.5-47.6, p < 0.001) than MLP group. Infants were most likely to have a lower MOS-R score if they had any of the following: VP shunt placement, periventricular leukomalacia, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant GMA and higher-risk MOS-R scores were more common in infants at high-risk, reflecting history of brain lesions and younger gestational age at birth.

AB  - Anemia is commonly seen in preterm infants. It may reduce the capacity of hemoglobin to transport oxygen throughout the body and may result in tissue and organ dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the effect of anemia on the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. 243 infants who were admitted to BaYi Children's Hospital Affiliated to Clinical Medical College in Beijing Military General Hospital with gestational age (GA) less than 32 weeks from February, 2014 to February, 2015 were included in the study. Maternal and infant data were recorded. Multivarariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between anemia and BPD. Of 243 preterm infants, the incidence of anemia was higher in BPD patients than non-BPD patients (p < 0.001). Mean Hct in BPD patients was lower than non-BPD patients at different time points in 1d, 7d, 14d, and 21d. Controlling for other confounding factors, early anemia was associated with an increased risk of BPD. Number of transfusions is also a significant risk factor for BPD (p = 0.001). Therefore, prevention and treatment of early anemia is necessary and reducing number of transfusions may reduce the incidence of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by premature alveolar developmental arrest. Antenatal exposure to inflammation inhibits lung morphogenesis, thus increasing the risk of developing BPD. Alveolar myofibroblasts are thought to migrate into the septal tips and elongate secondary septa during alveolarization. Here we found lipopolysaccharide (LPS) disrupted the directional migration of myofibroblasts and increased actin stress fiber expression and focal adhesion formation. In addition, COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk) activity was downregulated in myofibroblasts treated with LPS, while activation of Src or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was upregulated by LPS treatment. Specifically, decreased Csk activity and increased activation of Src or EGFR was also observed in primary myofibroblasts isolated from newborn rat lungs with intra-amniotic LPS exposure, a model for BPD. Further investigation revealed that EGFR was involved in cell migration impairment induced by LPS, and Src inhibition blocked LPS-induced activation of EGFR or cell migration impairment. Csk silencing also resulted in EGFR activation and cell migration impairment. Besides, we found the effect of EGFR on myofibroblast migration was mediated through RhoA activation. EGFR inhibition alleviated the abnormal localization of myofibroblasts and improved alveolar development in antenatal LPS-treated rats. Taken together, our data suggest that the Csk/Src/EGFR signaling pathway is critically involved in regulating directional migration of myofibroblasts and may contribute to arrested alveolar development in BPD.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRs) are small conserved RNA that regulate gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis of miRNA profiles during mouse lung development indicated a role for multiple miRNA, including miRNA-489. miR-489 increased on completion of alveolar septation [postnatal day 42 (P42)], associated with decreases in its conserved target genes insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) and tenascin C (Tnc). We hypothesized that dysregulation of miR-489 and its target genes Igf1 and Tnc contribute to hyperoxia-induced abnormal lung development. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to normoxia (21%) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from P4 to P14, in combination with intranasal locked nucleic acid against miR-489 to inhibit miR-489, cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV)-miR-489 to overexpress miR-489, or empty vector. Hyperoxia reduced miR-489 and increased Igf1 and Tnc. Locked nucleic acid against miR-489 improved lung development during hyperoxia and did not alter it during normoxia, whereas miR-489 overexpression inhibited lung development during normoxia. The 3' untranslated region in vitro reporter studies confirmed Igf1 and Tnc as targets of miR-489. While miR-489 was of epithelial origin and present in exosomes, its targets Igf1 and Tnc were produced by fibroblasts. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) had reduced lung miR-489 and increased Igf1 and Tnc compared with normal preterm or term infants. These results suggest increased miR-489 is an inhibitor of alveolar septation. During hyperoxia or BPD, reduced miR-489 and increased Igf1 and Tnc may be inadequate attempts at compensation. Further inhibition of miR-489 may permit alveolar septation to proceed. The use of specific miRNA antagonists or agonists may be a therapeutic strategy for inhibited alveolarization, such as in BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory disease in the very preterm infant is frequent and often severe. Bilirubin is both a potent neurotoxin and antioxidant, and may have a clinical impact on preterm respiratory disease. The Gilbert genotype, the UGT1A1*28 allele, is the major known genetic cause of variation in bilirubin., OBJECTIVES: To study the association between respiratory disease in the very preterm infant and the UGT1A1*28 allele., METHODS: This is a cohort study of 1,354 very preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks) born in Jutland, Denmark in 1997-2011. Genotypes were obtained from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank, and clinical information was obtained from the databases of two tertiary neonatal intensive care units. Outcomes were the need for surfactant therapy, any need for and duration of supplementary oxygen and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., RESULTS: Per UGT1A1*28 allele, odds were increased for any need of supplementary oxygen (odds ratio 1.26; 1.05-1.50) and for BPD (odds ratio 1.71; 1.23-2.39), the need of supplementary oxygen increased by 6.38 days (1.87-10.89), and chance per day of no longer needing supplementary oxygen was reduced (hazard rate 0.84; 0.76-0.93). No effect was observed for need of surfactant treatment (odds ratio 1.08; 0.91-1.28). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was unlikely for the cohort (p < 0.012). This could be explained by death prior to genotype sampling. In tests of robustness this failed to explain the primary results., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the common genotype, UGT1A1*28 genotypes were associated with an increased need of oxygen supplementation and risk of BPD in very preterm newborns.

AB  - An observational study of neuropsychological outcomes at preschool age of tiered lowered oxygen (O2) saturation targets in extremely preterm neonates. We studied 111 three-year-olds born <28 weeks' gestational age. Fifty-nine participants born in 2009-2010 during a time-limited quality improvement initiative each received three-tiered stratification of oxygen rates (83-93% until age 32 weeks, 85-95% until age 35 weeks, and 95% after age 35 weeks), the TieredO2 group. Comparisons were made with 52 participants born in 2007-2008 when pre-initiative saturation targets were non-tiered at 89-100%, the Non-tieredO2 group. Neuropsychological domains included general intellectual, executive, attention, language, visuoperceptual, visual-motor, and fine and gross motor functioning. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted. Group comparisons were not statistically significant. Descriptively, the TieredO2 group had better general intellectual, executive function, visual-motor, and motor performance and the Non-tieredO2 group had better language performance. Cohen's d and confidence intervals around d were in similar direction and magnitude across measures. A large effect size was found for recall of digits-forward in participants born at 23 and 24 weeks' gestation, d=0.99 and 1.46, respectively. Better TieredO2 outcomes in all domains except language suggests that the tiered oxygen saturation target method is not harmful and merits further investigation through further studies. Benefit in auditory attention appeared greatest in those born at 23 and 24 weeks. Participants in the tiered oxygen saturation group also had fewer ventilation days and a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, perhaps explanatory for these neuropsychological outcomes at age 3.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parenting influences child development, but it is unclear whether early parenting behavior can influence school-age outcomes in very preterm (VPT) children, and/or if certain groups of VPT children may be more affected by early parenting behavior. These research questions were examined., METHODS: Participants were 147 children born <30 weeks' gestation or birth weight <1250 g and their primary caregiver. At term corrected age (CA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine presence and severity of brain abnormality and medical data collected. High medical risk was defined as the presence of at least one of sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, moderate to severe white matter abnormality on MRI, or postnatal corticosteroids. At 2 years CA, parent-child interaction was assessed, and at 7 years CA, general intelligence (IQ), language, executive function, academic skills, and social-emotional functioning were assessed., RESULTS: Higher levels of parent-child synchrony, and parent facilitation, sensitivity and positive affect at 2 years were associated with better child outcomes at 7 years, while higher levels of intrusiveness and negative affect were associated with poorer outcomes. Many of these relationships remained after controlling for early child cognitive development. Interactions between child medical risk (higher/lower) and parenting were limited to child reading, math, and executive functioning outcomes, with stronger relationships for lower medical risk children., CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of early parenting to VPT children's school-age performance is significant, with stronger effects for lower medical risk children in some outcomes. These findings support the premise that parenting strategies should be included in the NICU and early interventions programs for VPT infants.

AB  - Prevention or treatment of lung diseases caused by the failure to form, or destruction of, existing alveoli, as observed in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and adults with emphysema, requires understanding of the molecular mechanisms of alveolar development. In addition to its critical role in gas exchange, the pulmonary circulation also contributes to alveolar morphogenesis and maintenance by the production of paracrine factors, termed "angiocrines," that impact the development of surrounding tissue. To identify lung angiocrines that contribute to alveolar formation, we disrupted pulmonary vascular development by conditional inactivation of the Vegf-A gene during alveologenesis. This resulted in decreased pulmonary capillary and alveolar development and altered lung elastin and retinoic acid (RA) expression. We determined that RA is produced by pulmonary endothelial cells and regulates pulmonary angiogenesis and elastin synthesis by induction of VEGF-A and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-18, respectively. Inhibition of RA synthesis in newborn mice decreased FGF-18 and elastin expression and impaired alveolarization. Treatment with RA and vitamin A partially reversed the impaired vascular and alveolar development induced by VEGF inhibition. Thus we identified RA as a lung angiocrine that regulates alveolarization through autocrine regulation of endothelial development and paracrine regulation of elastin synthesis via induction of FGF-18 in mesenchymal cells.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease associated with preterm birth, results from the disruption of normal pulmonary vascular and alveolar growth. Though BPD was once described as primarily due to postnatal injury from mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy after preterm birth, it is increasingly appreciated that BPD results from antenatal and perinatal factors that interrupt lung development in infants born at the extremes of prematurity. The lung in BPD consists of a simplified parenchymal architecture that limits gas exchange and leads to increased cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. This review outlines recent advances in the understanding of pulmonary vascular development and describes how the disruption of these mechanisms results in BPD. We point to future therapies that may augment postnatal vascular growth to prevent and treat this severe chronic lung disease. Copyright © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a devastating lung disease in preterm infants, includes inflammation, the mechanisms of which are not fully characterized. Here we report that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is associated with the development of BPD. Hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice have increased caspase-1 activation, IL1beta and inflammation, and decreased alveolarization. Nlrp3(-/-) mice have no caspase-1 activity, no IL1beta, no inflammatory response and undergo normal alveolarization. Treatment of hyperoxia-exposed mice with either IL1 receptor antagonist to block IL1beta or glyburide to block the Nlrp3 inflammasome results in decreased inflammation and increased alveolarization. Ventilated preterm baboons show activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome with increased IL1beta:IL1ra ratio. The IL1beta:IL1ra ratio in tracheal aspirates from preterm infants with respiratory failure is predictive of the development of BPD. We conclude that early activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key mechanism in the development of BPD, and represents a novel therapeutic target for BPD.

AB  - High pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), proximal pulmonary artery (PA) impedance, and right ventricular (RV) afterload due to remodeling contribute to the pathogenesis and severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Intra-amniotic exposure to endotoxin (ETX) causes sustained PH and high mortality in rat pups at birth, which are associated with impaired vascular growth and RV hypertrophy in survivors. Treatment of ETX-exposed pups with antenatal vitamin D (vit D) improves survival and lung growth, but the effects of ETX exposure on RV-PA coupling in the neonatal lung are unknown. We hypothesized that intrauterine ETX impairs RV-PA coupling through sustained abnormalities of PA stiffening and RV performance that are attenuated with vit D therapy. Fetal rats were exposed to intra-amniotic injections of ETX, ETX+vit D, or saline at 20 days gestation (term = 22 days). At postnatal day 14, pups had pressure-volume measurements of the RV and isolated proximal PA, respectively. Lung homogenates were assayed for extracellular matrix (ECM) composition by Western blot. We found that ETX lungs contain decreased alpha-elastin, lysyl oxidase, collagen I, and collagen III proteins (P < 0.05) compared control and ETX+vit D lungs. ETX-exposed animals have increased RV mechanical stroke work (P < 0.05 vs. control and ETX+vit D) and elastic potential energy (P < 0.05 vs. control and ETX+vit D). Mechanical stiffness and ECM remodeling are increased in the PA (P < 0.05 vs. control and ETX+vit D). We conclude that intrauterine exposure of fetal rats to ETX during late gestation causes persistent impairment of RV-PA coupling throughout infancy that can be prevented with early vit D treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth, especially at less than 30 weeks' gestation, is significantly associated with respiratory, neurodevelopmental and growth abnormalities. The AZTEC study has recruited 799 infants born at < 30 weeks' gestation to determine if a ten-day intravenous treatment with azithromycin improves survival without development of chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) at 36 weeks' post menstrual age (PMA) when compared to placebo. The follow-up studies will compare respiratory, neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes up to 2 years of corrected age between infants who received azithromycin and those who received placebo in the early neonatal period., METHODS: Survivors at 36 weeks' PMA from the main Azithromycin Therapy for Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity (AZTEC) study with parental consent will continue to be followed up to discharge from the neonatal unit and to 2 years of corrected age. Length of stay, rates of home oxygen, length of supplemental oxygen requirement, hospital admissions, drug usage, respiratory illness, neurodevelopmental disability and death rates will be reported. Data is being collected via parentally completed respiratory and neurodevelopmental questionnaires at 1 and 2 years of corrected age respectively. Additional information is being obtained from various sources including hospital discharge and clinical letters from general practitioners and hospitals as well as from national databases including the National Neonatal Research Database and NHS Digital., DISCUSSION: The AZTEC-FU study will assess mortality and important neonatal morbidities including respiratory, neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes. Important safety data will also be collected, including the incidence of potential consequences of early macrolide use, primarily pyloric stenosis. This study may have implications on future neonatal care., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively registered on ISRCTN (ISRCTN47442783). Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Alveolarization is the process by which the alveoli, the principal gas exchange units of the lung, are formed. Along with the maturation of the pulmonary vasculature, alveolarization is the objective of late lung development. The terminal airspaces that were formed during early lung development are divided by the process of secondary septation, progressively generating an increasing number of alveoli that are of smaller size, which substantially increases the surface area over which gas exchange can take place. Disturbances to alveolarization occur in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which can be complicated by perturbations to the pulmonary vasculature that are associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension. Disturbances to lung development may also occur in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in term newborn infants, as well as in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. These disturbances can lead to the formation of lungs with fewer and larger alveoli and a dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. Consequently, affected lungs exhibit a reduced capacity for gas exchange, with important implications for morbidity and mortality in the immediate postnatal period and respiratory health consequences that may persist into adulthood. It is the objective of this Perspectives article to update the reader about recent developments in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of alveolarization and the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Fetal lung development normally occurs in a hypoxic environment. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha is robustly induced under hypoxia and transactivates many genes that are essential for fetal development. Most preterm infants are prematurely exposed to hyperoxia, which can halt hypoxia-driven lung maturation. We were to investigate whether the HIF-1alpha inducer, deferoxamine (DFX) can improve alveolarization in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). A rat model of BPD was produced by intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration and postnatal hyperoxia (85% for 7 days), and DFX (150 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was administered to rat pups intraperitoneally for 14 days. On day 14, the rat pups were sacrificed and their lungs were removed and examined. A parallel in vitro study was performed with a human small airway epithelial cell line to test whether DFX induces the expression of HIF-1alpha and its target genes. Alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development were impaired in rats with BPD. However, DFX significantly ameliorated these effects. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that HIF-1alpha was significantly upregulated in the lungs of BPD rats treated with DFX. DFX was also found to induce HIF-1alpha in human small airway epithelial cells and to promote the expression of HIF-1alpha target genes. Our data suggest that DFX induces and activates HIF-1alpha, thereby improving alveolarization and vascular distribution in the lungs of rats with BPD.

AB  - A reduced number of alveoli is the structural hallmark of diseases of the neonatal and adult lung, where alveoli either fail to develop (as in bronchopulmonary dysplasia), or are progressively destroyed (as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). To correct the loss of alveolar septa through therapeutic regeneration, the mechanisms of septa formation must first be understood. The present study characterized platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha-positive (PDGFRalpha(+)) cell populations during late lung development in mice. PDGFRalpha(+) cells (detected using a PDGFRalpha(GFP) reporter line) were noted around the proximal airways during the pseudoglandular stage. In the canalicular stage, PDGFRalpha(+) cells appeared in the more distal mesenchyme, and labeled alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive tip cells in the secondary crests and lipofibroblasts in the primary septa during alveolarization. Some PDGFRalpha(+) cells appeared in the mesenchyme of the adult lung. Over the course of late lung development, PDGFRalpha(+) cells consistently expressed collagen I, and transiently expressed markers of mesenchymal stem cells. With the use of both, a constitutive and a conditional PDGFRalpha(Cre) line, it was observed that PDGFRalpha(+) cells generated alveolar myofibroblasts including tip cells of the secondary crests, and lipofibroblasts. These lineages were committed before secondary septation. The present study provides new insights into the time-dependent commitment of the PDGFRalpha(+) cell lineage to lipofibroblasts and myofibroblasts during late lung development that is needed to better understand the cellular contribution to the process of alveolarization.

AB  - The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is emerging as a mediator of lung physiology and disease. Recent studies revealed that H2S administration limited perturbations to lung structure in experimental animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), partially restoring alveolarization, limiting pulmonary hypertension, limiting inflammation, and promoting epithelial repair. No studies have addressed roles for endogenous H2S in lung development. H2S is endogenously generated by cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (Cth). We demonstrate here that the expression of Cbs and Cth in mouse lungs is dynamically regulated during lung alveolarization and that alveolarization is blunted in Cbs(-/-) and Cth(-/-) mouse pups, where a 50% reduction in the total number of alveoli was observed, without any impact on septal thickness. Laser-capture microdissection and immunofluorescence staining indicated that Cbs and Cth were expressed in the airway epithelium and lung vessels. Loss of Cbs and Cth led to a 100-500% increase in the muscularization of small- and medium-sized lung vessels, which was accompanied by increased vessel wall thickness, and an apparent decrease in lung vascular supply. Ablation of Cbs expression using small interfering RNA or pharmacological inhibition of Cth using propargylglycine in lung endothelial cells limited angiogenic capacity, causing a 30-40% decrease in tube length and a 50% decrease in number of tubes formed. In contrast, exogenous administration of H2S with GYY4137 promoted endothelial tube formation. These data confirm a key role for the H2S-generating enzymes Cbs and Cth in pulmonary vascular development and homeostasis and in lung alveolarization.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature infants that is characterized by alveolar simplification and decreased lung angiogenesis. Hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation contributes to the development of BPD in premature infants. Adrenomedullin (AM) is an endogenous peptide with potent angiogenic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Whether AM regulates hyperoxic injury in fetal primary human lung cells is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that AM-deficient fetal primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) will have increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and cytotoxicity compared to AM-sufficient HPMEC upon exposure to hyperoxia. Adrenomedullin gene (Adm) was knocked down in HPMEC by siRNA-mediated transfection and the resultant AM-sufficient and -deficient cells were evaluated for hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, cytotoxicity, and Akt activation. AM-deficient HPMEC had significantly increased hyperoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytotoxicity compared to AM-sufficient HPMEC. Additionally, AM-deficient cell culture supernatants had increased macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha and 1beta, indicating a heightened inflammatory state. Interestingly, AM deficiency was associated with an abrogated Akt activation upon exposure to hyperoxia. These findings support the hypothesis that AM deficiency potentiates hyperoxic injury in primary human fetal HPMEC via mechanisms entailing Akt activation. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A significant portion of lung development is completed postnatally during alveolarization, rendering the immature lung vulnerable to inflammatory stimuli that can disrupt lung structure and function. Although the NF-kappaB pathway has well-recognized pro-inflammatory functions, novel anti-inflammatory and developmental roles for NF-kappaB have recently been described. Thus, to determine how NF-kappaB modulates alveolarization during inflammation, we exposed postnatal day 6 mice to vehicle (PBS), systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or the combination of LPS and the global NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (LPS + BAY). LPS impaired alveolarization, decreased lung cell proliferation, and reduced epithelial growth factor expression. BAY exaggerated these detrimental effects of LPS, further suppressing proliferation and disrupting pulmonary angiogenesis, an essential component of alveolarization. The more severe pathology induced by LPS + BAY was associated with marked increases in lung and plasma levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). Experiments using primary neonatal pulmonary endothelial cells (PEC) demonstrated that MIP-2 directly impaired neonatal PEC migration in vitro; and neutralization of MIP-2 in vivo preserved lung cell proliferation and pulmonary angiogenesis and prevented the more severe alveolar disruption induced by the combined treatment of LPS + BAY. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a key anti-inflammatory function of the NF-kappaB pathway in the early alveolar lung that functions to mitigate the detrimental effects of inflammation on pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolarization. Furthermore, these data suggest that neutralization of MIP-2 may represent a novel therapeutic target that could be beneficial in preserving lung growth in premature infants exposed to inflammatory stress.

AB  - The molecular pathomechanisms underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remain to be fully elucidated, however, lung injury is considered to be a key event. The present study was performed to determine the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and investigate the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells in a BPD rat model. A total of 48 preterm Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a control group and a hyperoxia group. The rats in the BPD group were exposed to 85% hyperoxia, while the rats in the control group were exposed to room air. A total of eight rats in each group were sacrificed 7, 14 or 21 days after exposure. The expression levels of 78-kDa glucose-regulated/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in the lung tissues were examined using immunohistochemistry, and the mRNA and protein levels of GRP78 and CHOP were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. In addition, the levels of apoptosis in the lung cells were evaluated suing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. It was demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of GRP78 and CHOP, and the levels of cell apoptosis in the hyperoxia group differed significantly from those in the control group (P<0.05) at different time-points, and increased with extension of the duration of hyperoxic exposure. These data demonstrated that the ER stress pathway, involving CHOP, is activated and is important in the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Animal models demonstrate that exposure to supraphysiological oxygen during the neonatal period compromises both lung and pulmonary vascular development, resulting in a phenotype comparable to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Our prior work in murine models identified postnatal maturation of antioxidant enzyme capacities as well as developmental regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress in hyperoxia. We hypothesize that consequences of hyperoxia may also be developmentally regulated and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent. To determine whether age of exposure impacts the effect of hyperoxia, neonatal mice were placed in 75% oxygen for 72 h at either postnatal day 0 (early postnatal) or day 4 (late postnatal). Mice exposed to early, but not late, postnatal hyperoxia demonstrated decreased alveolarization and septation, increased muscularization of resistance pulmonary arteries, and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) compared with normoxic controls. Treatment with a mitochondria-specific antioxidant, (2-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride (mitoTEMPO), during early postnatal hyperoxia protected against compromised alveolarization and RVH. In addition, early, but not late, postnatal hyperoxia resulted in induction of NOX1 expression that was mitochondrial ROS dependent. Because early, but not late, exposure resulted in compromised lung and cardiovascular development, we conclude that the consequences of hyperoxia are developmentally regulated and decrease with age. Attenuated disease in mitoTEMPO-treated mice implicates mitochondrial ROS in the pathophysiology of neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, with potential for amplification of ROS signaling through NOX1 induction. Furthermore, it suggests a potential role for targeted antioxidant therapy in the prevention or treatment of BPD. Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Because therapeutic options are lacking for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), there is an urgent medical need to discover novel targets/drugs to treat this neonatal chronic lung disease. Metformin, a drug commonly used to lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes patients, may be a novel therapeutic option for BPD by reducing pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis and improving vascularization. We investigated the therapeutic potential of daily treatment with 25 and 100 mg/kg metformin, injected subcutaneously in neonatal Wistar rats with severe experimental BPD, induced by continuous exposure to 100% oxygen for 10 days. Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, pulmonary fibrin and collagen deposition, vascular leakage, right ventricular hypertrophy, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in BPD pathogenesis, including inflammation, coagulation, and alveolar development. After daily metformin treatment rat pups with experimental BPD had reduced mortality, alveolar septum thickness, lung inflammation, and fibrosis, demonstrated by a reduced influx of macrophages and neutrophils and hyperoxia-induced collagen III and fibrin deposition (25 mg/kg), as well as improved vascularization (100 mg/kg) compared with control treatment. However, metformin did not ameliorate alveolar enlargement, small arteriole wall thickening, vascular alveolar leakage, and right ventricular hypertrophy. In conclusion metformin prolongs survival and attenuates pulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation, coagulation, and fibrosis but does not affect alveolar development or prevent pulmonary arterial hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy in neonatal rats with severe hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen treatment in preterm infants may cause bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterized by alveolar simplification and vascular disorganization. Despite type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC II) damage being reported previously, we found no decrease in the AEC II-specific marker, surfactant protein C (SP-C), in the BPD model in our previous study. We thus speculated that AEC II injury is not a unique mechanism of BPD-related pulmonary epithelial repair dysfunction and that abnormal transdifferentiation can exist. Newborn rats were randomly assigned to model (85% oxygen inhalation) and control groups (room air inhalation). Expressions of AEC I (aquaporin 5, T1alpha) and AEC II markers (SP-C, SP-B) were detected at three levels: 1) in intact lung tissue, 2) in AEC II isolated from rats in the two groups, and 3) in AEC II isolated from newborn rats, which were further cultured under either hyperoxic or normoxic conditions. In the model group, increased AEC I was observed at both the tissue and cell level, and markedly increased transdifferentiation was observed by immunofluorescent double staining. Transmission electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in alveolar epithelium such as damaged AECs, a fused air-blood barrier structure, and opened tight junctions in the model group. These findings indicate that transdifferentiation of AECs is not suppressed but rather is increased under hyperoxic treatment by compensation; however, such repair during injury cannot offset pulmonary epithelial air exchange and barrier dysfunction caused by structural damage to AECs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term respiratory consequences for children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are well known. However, there is little emphasis on monitoring preterm infants without BPD. Few studies have explored the lung function status of infants with the symptoms of chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD)., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate functional lung deficits in preterm infants with CLD, and to assess the perinatal determinants of diminished lung function., METHODS: In our cross-sectional study, 132 preterm infants with symptomatic CLD underwent infant pulmonary function testing (iPFT) at a median post-term age of 0.9 years. The iPFT included bodypletysmography, compliance measurement, tidal breath analysis, and rapid thoracoabdominal compression. The relationships between the respective z scores of the iPFT parameters and perinatal characteristics, postnatal treatment, and BPD status were investigated., RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (55.3%) were born before the 28th week of gestation, and 92 (69.7%) met the BPD criteria. Functional deficits were detected in 85.8%. The obstructive ventilatory pattern was more prevalent than restrictive (36.3 vs. 12.4%, p < 0.001). Infants with restriction had lower birth weight (BW) and required a longer duration of oxygenotherapy. In a univariate model, the lung function correlated with the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, gestational week, and BW. In a general linear model, BPD status was not an additional determinant of the iPFT results., CONCLUSION: IPFT may reveal significant functional deficits in preterm infants with CLD even without BPD. The current symptoms and perinatal factors may be more important determinants of functional deficits than the BPD status itself. Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress-induced lung injury is involved in the occurrence and developmental process of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The present study assessed whether oxidative DNA damage occurs in the early stages of hyperoxia-induced BPD in neonatal rats and evaluated the expression and localization of the DNA repair gene, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), upon exposure to hyperoxia. Neonatal rats and primary cultured neonatal rat alveolar epithelial type II (AECII) cells were exposed to hyperoxia (90% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) and the expression levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the lung tissues and AECII cells were determined using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DNA strand breaks in the AECII cells were detected using a comet assay. The expression and localization of the OGG1 protein in the lung tissues and AECII cells were determined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and western blotting. The mRNA expression levels of OGG1 in the lung tissues and AECII cells were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of 8-OHdG was elevated in the hyperoxia-exposed neonatal rat lung tissue and the AECII cells compared with the normoxic controls. The occurrence of DNA strand breaks in the AECII cells increased with increasing duration of hyperoxia exposure. The protein expression of OGG1 was significantly increased in the hyperoxia-exposed lung tissues and AECII cells, with OGG1 preferentially localized to the cytoplasm. No concomitant increase in the mRNA expression of OGG1 was detected. These results revealed that oxidative DNA damage occurred in lung epithelial cells during early-stage BPD, as confirmed by in vitro and in vivo hyperoxia exposure experiments, and the increased expression of OGG1 was associated with this process.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate KL-6 and CC16 levels and their correlation with neurodevelopmental outcome among very low birth weight pre-term infants at 12 months corrected age. This prospective cohort study was performed from 2011 to 2013 by enrolling pre-term neonates of gestational age <= 32 weeks and birth weight <= 1500 g. Serum KL-6 and CC16 levels were determined 7 days after birth and their correlation with neurodevelopment was evaluated using Gesell Mental Developmental Scales. Of the 86 eligible pre-term infants, 63 completed follow-up, of which 15 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At 12 months corrected age, 49 infants had favorable outcomes and 14 infants had poor neurodevelopmental outcome. KL-6 levels were higher and CC16 levels were lower in infants with poor neurodevelopmental outcome compared with those infants who had favourable neurodevelopmental outcome. Serum KL-6 levels less than 90.0 ng/ml and CC16 levels greater than 320.0 pg/ml at 7 days of life were found to be predictive of a favourable outcome at 12 months corrected age. These biological markers could predict neurodevelopmental outcome at 12 months corrected age in very low birth weight premature infants, and help the clinician plan early therapeutic interventions to minimize or avoid poor neurodevelopmental outcome.

AB  - Rapid growth and formation of new gas exchange units (alveogenesis) are hallmarks of the perinatal lung. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), common in very premature infants, is characterized by premature arrest of alveogenesis. Mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts) regulate both lung branching and alveogenesis through mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. Temporal or spatial deficiency of late-gestation lung 1/cysteine-rich secretory protein LD2 (LGL1/CRISPLD2), expressed in and secreted by lung fibroblasts, can impair both lung branching and alveogenesis (LGL1 denotes late gestation lung 1 protein; LGL1 denotes the human gene; Lgl1 denotes the mouse/rat gene). Absence of Lgl1 is embryonic lethal. Lgl1 levels are dramatically reduced in oxygen toxicity rat models of BPD, and heterozygous Lgl1(+/-) mice exhibit features resembling human BPD. To explore the role of LGL1 in mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in developing lung, we developed a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible RNA-mediated LGL1 knockdown cellular model in human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC5(LGL1KD)). We assessed the impact of LGL1 on cell proliferation, cell migration, apoptosis, and wound healing. DOX-induced MRC5(LGL1KD) suppressed cell growth and increased apoptosis of annexin V(+) staining cells and caspase 3/7 activity. LGL1-conditioned medium increased migration of fetal rat primary lung epithelial cells and human airway epithelial cells. Impaired healing by MRC5(LGL1KD) cells of a wound model was attenuated by addition of LGL1-conditioned medium. Suppression of LGL1 was associated with dysregulation of extracellular matrix genes (downregulated MMP1, ColXValpha1, and ELASTIN) and proapoptosis genes (upregulated BAD, BAK, CASP2, and TNFRSF1B) and inhibition of 44/42MAPK phosphorylation. Our findings define a role for LGL1 in fibroblast expansion and migration, epithelial cell migration, and mesenchymal-epithelial signaling, key processes in fetal lung development.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in the treatment of lung injury in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and examine the underlying mechanisms. A mouse model of BPD was created using continuous exposure to high oxygen levels for 14 days. BMSCs were isolated, cultured and then labeled with green fluorescent protein. Cells (1x106) were subsequently injected intravenously 1 h prior to high oxygen treatment. Animals were randomly divided into three groups (n=5 in each): Control group, BPD model group and BMSC injection group. At two weeks post-treatment, the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) was detected using immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence. Compared with the BPD model group, the body weight, airway structure and levels of TGF-beta1 and VEGF were significantly improved in the BMSC-treated group. Immunofluorescence observations indicated that BMSCs were able to differentiate into cells expressing vWF and VEGF, which are markers of vascular tissues. The present study demonstrated that intravenous injection of BMSCs significantly improved lung damage in a neonatal mouse model of BPD at 14 days following hyperoxia-induced injury. This provides novel information which may be used to guide further investigation into the use of stem cells in BPD.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen, used to treat hypoxia in preterm and term neonates, increases the risk of neonatal lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and asthma. There is a known sex predilection for BPD, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that altered, local estradiol following hyperoxia contributes to pathophysiological changes observed in immature lung. In human fetal airway smooth muscle (fASM) cells exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia, we measured the expression of proteins involved in estrogen metabolism and cell proliferation responses to estradiol. In fASM cells, CYP1a1 expression was increased by hyperoxia, whereas hyperoxia-induced enhancement of cell proliferation was blunted by estradiol. Pharmacological studies indicated that these effects were attributable to upregulation of CYP1a1 and subsequent increased metabolism of estradiol to a downstream intermediate 2-methoxyestradiol. Microarray analysis of mouse lung exposed to 14 days of hyperoxia showed the most significant alteration in CYP1a1 expression, with minimal changes in expression of five other genes related to estrogen receptors, synthesis, and metabolism. Our novel results on estradiol metabolism in fetal and early postnatal lung in the context of hyperoxia indicate CYP1a1 as a potential mechanism for the protective effect of estradiol in hyperoxia-exposed immature lung, which may help explain the sex difference in neonatal lung diseases.

AB  - Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia remain the leading causes of preterm infant morbidity, mortality, and lifelong disability. Research to improve outcomes requires translational large animal models for RDS. Preterm pigs delivered by caesarian section at gestation days (GD) 98, 100, 102, and 104 were provided 24 h of neonatal intensive care, monitoring (pulse oximetry, blood gases, serum biomarkers, radiography), and nutritional support, with or without intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV; pressure control ventilation with volume guarantee). Spontaneous development of RDS and mortality without MV are inversely related with GD at delivery and correspond with inadequacy of tidal volume and gas exchange. GD 98 and 100 pigs have consolidated lungs, immature alveolar architecture, and minimal surfactant protein-B expression, and MV is essential at GD 98. Although GD 102 pigs had some alveoli lined by pneumocytes and surfactant was released in response to MV, blood gases and radiography revealed limited recruitment 1-2 h after delivery, and mortality at 24 h was 66% (35/53) with supplemental oxygen provided by a mask and 69% (9/13) with bubble continuous positive airway pressure (8-9 cmH2O). The lungs at GD 104 had higher densities of thin-walled alveoli that secreted surfactant, and MV was not essential. Between GD 98 and 102, preterm pigs have ventilation inadequacies and risks of RDS that mimic those of preterm infants born during the saccular phase of lung development, are compatible with standards of neonatal intensive care, and are alternative to fetal nonhuman primates and lambs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Airway inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the inflammatory activity in plasma and exhaled air in very low birth weight (VLBW) BPD survivors at school age., METHODS: Twenty-one 6-14-year-old former VLBW (birth weight <=1,500 g) children with severe radiographic BPD (radBPD), 19 without radBPD (nonBPD group) and 19 non-asthmatic term controls underwent measurement of eosinophil cationic protein, IL-6, IL-8, adiponectin, adipsin, leptin, and resistin in plasma, leukotriene B4 and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate, and NO in exhaled breath. Background data were obtained from patient records, clinical examination and parental questionnaire. Both univariate and multivariate models were applied in the statistical analysis., RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the inflammatory markers measured. Five (25%) radBPD and 2 (11%) nonBPD children reported asthma (P = 0.058). In logistic regression analysis, exposure to chorioamnionitis was associated with low IL-8 (OR 29.0, 95% CI 3.27-258) and postnatal corticosteroid therapy with high adiponectin (OR 32.0, 95% CI 1.29-793). High body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) was associated with high plasma adipsin (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.07-5.75) and leptin (OR 5.76, 95%CI 1.83-18.2) levels., CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory activity seems to decrease by school age in VLBW BPD survivors. Chorioamnionitis and postnatal corticosteroid treatment may modulate the inflammatory responsiveness in VLBW subjects even up to school age. The respiratory outcome in VLBW infants might be improved by preventing excessive weight gain. Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study investigated changes in vascular endothelial cell tight junction structure and the expression of the gene encoding connexin 40 (Cx40) at the early pneumonedema stage of hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in a newborn rat model. A total of 96 newborn rats were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups, the hyperoxia group (n=48) and the control group (n=48). A hyperoxia-induced BPD model was established for the first group, while rats in the control group were maintained under normoxic conditions. Extravasation of Evans Blue (EB) was measured; the severity of lung injury was assessed; a transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to examine the vascular endothelial cell tight junction structures, and immunohistochemical assay, western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to evaluate the expression of Cx40 at the mRNA and protein level. Our findings showed that injuries due to BPD are progressively intensified during the time-course of exposure to hyperoxic conditions. Pulmonary vascular permeability in the hyperoxia group reached the highest level at day 5, and was significantly higher compared to the control group. TEM observations demonstrated tight junctions between endothelial cells were extremely tight. In the hyperoxia group, no marked changes in the tight junction structure were found at days 1 and 3; paracellular gaps were visible between endothelial cells at days 5 and 7. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the Cx40 protein is mainly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of lung tissue. Western blotting and RT-PCR assays showed a gradual decrease in Cx40 expression, depending on the exposure time to hyperoxic conditions. However, the Cx40 mRNA level reached a trough at 5 days. Overall, our study demonstrated that exposure to hyperoxia damages the tight junction structures between vascular endothelial cells and downregulates Cx40. We therefore conclude that hyperoxia may participate in the regulation of pulmonary vascular endothelial permeability.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the effects of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) on the mRNA expression of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) in lung tissue in newborn rats with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). For this purpose, a total of 96 newborn SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=24): the control group, air room plus APS group, BPD group and the APS group (20 mg/kg/day). Lung tissues were obtained on days 4, 10 and 14 after birth. Morphological changes were observed and the protein and mRNA expression levels of EGFL7, Bax and Bcl-2 were determined. The rats in the BPD group (BPD induced by hyperoxia) presented with an arrest in alveolar and vascular development and low mRNA and protein expression levels of of EGFL7, Bcl-2 and high levels of Bax compared with the rats in the control group. However, lung damage in the APS intervention group was attenuated compared with the BPD group. The protein and mRNA expression levels of EGFL7 and Bcl-2 were also increased and the level of Bax was decreased in the APS intervention group (P<0.01) compared with the BPD model group after birth on days 4, 10 and 14. Our data demonstrate that APS reduce airway remodeling and alveolar damage by upregulating the expression of EGFL7 and exert protective effects against BPD in neonatal rats. Thus, APS may have potential for use as a therapeutic strategy for BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early pulmonary hypertension (PH) at 10-14 days of life in preterm infants is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective observational cohort study of infants <28 weeks' gestation. Exclusion criteria were any major anomaly, genetic syndrome, or death before the initial echocardiogram. Echocardiograms were performed between 10 and 14 days of life and at 36 weeks' PMA to assess PH. BPD and its severity were determined at 36 weeks PMA by the National Institutes of Health workshop definition., RESULTS: From March 2011 to April 2013, of 146 consecutively admitted infants <28 weeks, 120 were enrolled. One infant was excluded, 17 did not consent, and 8 died before undergoing a study echocardiogram. At 10-14 days of life, 10 infants had early PH (8%). Male sex (56% vs 40%), gestational age (26(+2) +/- 1(+2) vs 25(+6) +/- 1(+4) weeks), birth weight (837 +/- 205 g vs 763 +/- 182 g), and small for gestational age (14% vs 20%) were not significantly different among infants with no PH and early PH, respectively. Infants with early PH required >0.3 fraction of inspired oxygen by day 10 of life (70% vs 27%, P < .01). Moderate/severe BPD or death was greater among infants with early PH (90%) compared with no PH (47%, relative risk 1.9, 95% CI 1.43-2.53)., CONCLUSION: In this prospective, single-center cohort, early PH was associated with moderate/severe BPD or death at 36 weeks' PMA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term hyperoxia impairs growth of the lungs and contributes to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Ectodysplasin A (EDA) binds to ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) and is essential for normal prenatal development. The functioning of EDA2R in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is investigated in this study., METHODS: Murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were exposed to hyperoxia to induce cell injury. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected, respectively, by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay and flow cytometry. Inflammation and oxidative stress were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay., RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis of MLE-12. EDA2R was elevated in hyperoxia-induced MLE-12. Silencing of EDA2R enhanced cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis of hyperoxia-induced MLE-12. Hyperoxia-induced up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-18 as well as MLE-12 was suppressed by knockdown of EDA2R. Inhibition of EDA2R down-regulated the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), up-regulated superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) in hyperoxia-induced MLE-12. Interference of EDA2R attenuated hyperoxia-induced increase in p-p65 in MLE-12., CONCLUSION: Knockdown of EDA2R exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects against hyperoxia-induced injury in lung epithelial cells through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated improvement in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and nosocomial infection among preterm infants at 12 neonatal units using the Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ). In the current study, we assessed the association of Canada-wide implementation of EPIQ with mortality and morbidity among preterm infants less than 29 weeks gestational age., METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 6026 infants admitted to 25 Canadian units between 2008 and 2012 (baseline year, n = 1422; year 1, n = 1611; year 2, n = 1508; year 3, n = 1485). Following a 1-year baseline period and 6 months of training and planning, EPIQ was implemented over 3 years. Our primary outcome was a composite of neonatal mortality and any of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe neurologic injury, severe retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis and nosocomial infection. We compared outcomes for baseline and year 3 using multivariable analyses., RESULTS: In adjusted analyses comparing baseline with year 3, the composite outcome (70% v. 65%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51 to 0.79), severe retinopathy (17% v. 13%; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.79), necrotizing enterocolitis (10% v. 8%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) and nosocomial infections (32% v. 24%; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82) were significantly reduced. The composite outcome was lower among infants born at 26 to 28 weeks gestation (62% v. 52%; OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78) but not among infants born at less than 26 weeks gestational age (90% v. 88%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20)., INTERPRETATION: EPIQ methodology was generalizable within Canada and was associated with significantly lower likelihood of the composite outcome, severe retinopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis and nosocomial infections. Infants born at 26 to 28 weeks gestational age benefited the most. Copyright © 2014 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactor chronic lung disease that mainly affects premature infants. In this study, we investigate the preventive effects of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) on BPD, and explore its potential molecular mechanisms., METHODS: Lung tissues of newborn Sprague-Dawley rats from the control group, the room air plus low-dose APS group, the room air plus high-dose APS group, the BPD model group, the low-dose APS group (20 mg/kg d), and the high-dose APS group (40 mg/kg d) were examined at the 4th, 10th, and 14th d of life. The pathomorphological change was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The content levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by the assay kit. Moreover, the protein and/or mRNA expression levels of NF-kappaBp65, CD31, ICAM-1, and TNF-alpha were also detected by corresponding methods., RESULTS: APS decreased the inflammatory cells infiltrating compared with the BPD group. For the APS group, the activity of SOD was increased and the content of MDA was reduced compared with the BPD group at any time point. The protein and mRNA expression levels of NF-kappaBp65, ICAM-1, and TNF-alpha were all decreased, while the protein expression level of CD31 was increased in the APS-treated group, with the most significant difference of the high-dose group (P < 0.01) compared with the BPD group after birth on the 4th, 10th, and 14th d., CONCLUSION: APS can reduce airway remodeling and alveolar damage by its modulation of inflammatory mediators and antioxidation, suggesting some protective effects on BPD of neonatal rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-dose dexamethasone (DXM) treatment of preterms at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia leads to a deterioration in quality of their general movements (GMs). It is unknown whether low-dose DXM affects GM quality similarly., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of low-dose DXM treatment on the quality of GMs and fidgety GMs (FMs)., METHODS: A prospective study of preterms admitted to our NICU between 2010 and 2012, and treated with DXM (starting dose 0.25 mg/kg/day). We assessed GM/FM quality and calculated their motor optimality score (MOS) before, during, and after treatment up to 3 months postterm. Neurological follow-up was performed between 12 and 36 months. We related risk factors with infants' GM trajectories and MOSs. At 3 months we compared the MOSs of low-dose DXM infants and a historical cohort of infants treated with high-dose DXM or hydrocortisone., RESULTS: 17 infants were included. GM/FM quality improved in 9 out of 13 initially abnormal infants (p = 0.004). Shorter periods of mechanical ventilation and higher birth weights were associated with better GM trajectories (p = 0.032 and p = 0.042, respectively). Infants starting treatment later had higher MOSs on day 7 (p = 0.047). Low-dose DXM infants had higher MOSs than high-dose DXM infants (beta = -0.535; 95% CI -0.594 to -0.132; p = 0.003). Out of 17 infants, 2 died, 14 developed normally, and 1 developed with mild neurodevelopmental impairments. Infants whose GMs/FMs remained normal or improved had better outcomes than infants whose GMs/FMs remained abnormal (p = 0.019)., CONCLUSIONS: Out of the 17 infants treated with low-dose DXM, 2 died. Of the surviving infants, neurological functioning improved with the majority having normal neurodevelopment at the age of 12-36 months. Copyright © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolar simplification with decreased numbers of alveoli and increased airspace. BPD, frequently suffered by very low birth weight infants, has been closely associated with intrauterine infection. However, the underlying mechanisms of BPD remain unclear. In the present study, it was identified that administration of intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to pregnant rats on embryonal day 16.5 (E16.5) induced significant alveolarization arrest similar to that of BPD in neonatal pups, and theophylline injected subcutaneously into the newborns improved the pathological changes. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of the morphogenesis amelioration of theophylline, cytokine antibody arrays were performed with the lung lysates of neonatal rats. The results indicated that LPS upregulated a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines and theophylline significantly attenuated the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-2, and markedly elevated the production of tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta family members TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3, which are anti-inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that theophylline may protect against BPD and improve chorioamnionitis-induced alveolar arrest by regulating the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of various disease processes and is a putative mechanism in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the most common complication of extreme preterm birth. Glutathione, a major endogenous antioxidant and redox buffer, also mediates cellular functions through protein thiolation. We sought to determine if post-translational thiol modification of hemoglobin F occurs in neonates by examining erythrocyte samples obtained during the first month of life from premature infants, born at 23 0/7 - 28 6/7 weeks gestational age, who were enrolled at our center in the Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we report the novel finding of in vivo and in vitro glutathionylation of gammaG and gammaA subunits of Hgb F. Through tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS), we confirmed the adduction site as the Cys-gamma94 residue and through high-resolution mass spectrometry determined that the modification occurs in both gamma subunits. We also identified glutathionylation of the beta subunit of Hgb A in our patient samples; we did not find modified alpha subunits of Hgb A or F. In conclusion, we are the first to report that glutathionylation of gammaG and gammaA of Hgb F occurs in premature infants. Additional studies of this post-translational modification are needed to determine its physiologic impact on Hgb F function and if sG-Hgb is a biomarker for clinical morbidities associated with oxidative stress in premature infants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The mammalian lung possesses the highest level of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) amongst all the organs. ACE is known to generate angiotensin (AT)-II from AT-I and to regulate serum bradykinin level, thereby controlling blood pressure. Recent data, however, indicate a role for ACE derived AT-II in angiogenesis, pulmonary hypertension, and neonatal lung disease. The ontogeny of ACE in humans has not been investigated. We studied pulmonary ACE expression during human lung development and in human bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human fetal autopsy lung tissue representing all three trimesters (12, 13, 16, 18, 24, 34, 39, and 40 weeks of gestational age (WGA)), as well as from 1 to 10 years of age with no significant lung pathology were used. In addition lung sections of patients with BPD (n = 5) were selected. The slides were immunostained using an anti-ACE monoclonal antibody. The temporal and spatial pattern of ACE expression was contrasted to that of the pan-endothelial marker CD31. Staining intensity was graded., RESULTS: Mildly diffuse and strong microvascular endothelial immunreactivity for ACE was seen in the human fetus as early as 12 WGA. ACE expression peaked at mid gestation and remained high throughout gestation and postnatally. In BPD lungs ACE endothelial staining was largely absent, and when focal staining was observed the intensity was weak., CONCLUSION: We established that ACE expression is present in the human fetal lung as early as 12 WGA, remains active pre- and postnatally, and ACE expression was downregulated in BPD lungs. We speculate that ACE may be involved in the process of lung development. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - High levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) are frequently used in critical care units and in conditions of respiratory insufficiencies in adults, as well as in infants. However, hyperoxia has been implicated in a number of pulmonary disorders including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hyperoxia increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria that could impair the function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We analyzed lung mitochondrial function in hyperoxia using the XF24 analyzer (extracellular flux) and optimized the assay for lung epithelial cells and mitochondria isolated from lungs of mice. Our data show that hyperoxia decreases basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), spare respiratory capacity, maximal respiration and ATP turnover in MLE-12 cells. There was significant decrease in glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve in MLE-12 cells exposed to hyperoxia. Using mitochondria isolated from lungs of mice exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia we have shown that hyperoxia decreased the basal, state 3 and state3 mu (respiration in an uncoupled state) respirations. Further, using substrate or inhibitor of a specific complex we show that the OCR via complex I and II, but not complex IV was decreased, demonstrating that complexes I and II are specific targets of hyperoxia. Further, the activities of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase, NADH-DH) and complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, SDH) were decreased in hyperoxia, but the activity of complex IV (cytochrome oxidase, COX) remains unchanged. Taken together, our study show that hyperoxia impairs glycolytic and mitochondrial energy metabolism in in tact cells, as well as in lungs of mice by selectively inactivating components of electron transport system.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common lung disease of premature infants, with devastating short- and long-term consequences. The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial, but all triggers cause pulmonary inflammation. No therapy exists; therefore, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) prevents murine BPD. We precipitated BPD by perinatal inflammation (lipopolysaccharide injection to pregnant dams) and rearing pups in hyperoxia (65% or 85% O2). Pups were treated daily with IL-1Ra or vehicle for up to 28 d. Vehicle-injected animals in both levels of hyperoxia developed a severe BPD-like lung disease (alveolar number and gas exchange area decreased by up to 60%, alveolar size increased up to fourfold). IL-1Ra prevented this structural disintegration at 65%, but not 85% O2. Hyperoxia depleted pulmonary immune cells by 67%; however, extant macrophages and dendritic cells were hyperactivated, with CD11b and GR1 (Ly6G/C) highly expressed. IL-1Ra partially rescued the immune cell population in hyperoxia (doubling the viable cells), reduced the percentage that were activated by up to 63%, and abolished the unexpected persistence of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta on day 28 in hyperoxia/vehicle-treated lungs. On day 3, perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia each triggered a distinct pulmonary immune response, with some proinflammatory mediators increasing up to 20-fold and some amenable to partial or complete reversal with IL-1Ra. In summary, our analysis reveals a pivotal role for IL-1alpha/beta in murine BPD and an involvement for MIP (macrophage inflammatory protein)-1alpha and TREM (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells)-1. Because it effectively shields newborn mice from BPD, IL-1Ra emerges as a promising treatment for a currently irremediable disease that may potentially brighten the prognosis of the tiny preterm patients.

AB  - Surfactant complex and its individual components decrease surface tension, silence inflammatory responses, bind and destroy air-borne microbes, facilitate phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages and bind endogenous and exogenous molecules. Surfactant components generally decrease harmful inflammatory responses. New exogenous surfactants and new indications for surfactant therapy remain to be studied. At term the pool of human surfactant from developing airways extends to the amniotic cavity and to the gastrointestinal tract. Preterm labor-inducing inflammatory ligands (interleukin-1 or lipopolysaccharide) cause a robust induction of surfactant complex and lower the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The effect of antenatal glucocorticoid therapy is complementary. According to transgenic experiments or genetic evidence in humans, surfactant proteins A, D or C (SP-A, SP-D, SP-C), expressed in fetal tissue, influence the onset of term or preterm labor. After birth, the surface tension-reducing and the inflammation-silencing effects of exogenous and endogenous surfactant are complementary. Surfactant proteins influence the genetic predisposition of RDS, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and airway infections in early infancy. Moderate to severe BPD has a strong genetic predisposition. Deleterious mutations of SP-B, ABCA3 or SP-C cause congenital interstitial lung disease that mimics the phenotype of established severe BPD. I propose that lung surfactant protects both the fetus and the newborn. Surfactant ameliorates inflammatory responses that are harmful to the mother, fetus and infant. In chorioamnionitis, inflammatory ligands are carried from the fetal membranes to the alveolar space via amniotic fluid and developing airways. They induce surfactant synthesis and secretion. Surfactant ameliorates severe inflammatory responses in fetal compartments and promotes spontaneous preterm birth. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common complications after preterm birth and is associated with intrauterine exposure to bacteria. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) is implicated in the development of BPD., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that different and/or multiple bacterial signals could elicit divergent TGFbeta signaling responses in the developing lung., METHODS: Time-mated pregnant Merino ewes received an intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or Ureaplasma parvum serovar 3 (UP) at 117 days' and/or 121/122 days' gestational age (GA). Controls received an equivalent injection of saline and or media. Lambs were euthanized at 124 days' GA (term = 150 days' GA). TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, TGFbeta3, TGFbeta receptor (R)1 and TGFbetaR2 protein levels, Smad2 phosphorylation and elastin deposition were evaluated in lung tissue., RESULTS: Total TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 decreased by 24 and 51% after combined UP+LPS exposure, whereas total TGFbeta1 increased by 31% after 7 days' LPS exposure but not after double exposures. Alveolar expression of TGFbetaR2 decreased 75% after UP, but remained unaltered after double exposures. Decreased focal elastin deposition after single LPS exposure was prevented by double exposures., CONCLUSIONS: TGFbeta signaling components and elastin responded differently to intrauterine LPS and UP exposure. Multiple bacterial exposures attenuated TGFbeta signaling and normalized elastin deposition. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Rationale: Very preterm infants may require dexamethasone (Dex) for facilitating extubation or treating bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, Dex may result in disturbance of metabolisms. This study was to investigate the effects of postnatal short course Dex exposure on brown adipose tissue (BAT) in neonatal rats. Method: Neonatal rats received either three consecutive doses of daily Dex (0.2 mg/kg/day) or saline from postnatal P1 to P3. We investigated the effects of Dex on BAT including thermogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy flux. We also compared diurnal temperature variation between preterm infants who received systemic corticosteroid and their treatment-naive controls. Results: Postnatal Dex treatment induced growth retardation, BAT whitening, UCP1 downregulation and cold intolerance in neonatal rats. BAT mitochondria were damaged, evident by loss of normal number, structure, and alignment of cristae. Mitochondrial fission-fusion balance was disrupted and skewed toward increased fusion, reflected by increased OPA1 and MFN2 and decreased DRP1, FIS1 and phosphorylated MFF protein levels. Autophagosome synthesis was increased but clearance was inhibited, indicated by accumulation of p62 protein after Dex treatment and no further increase of LC3-II after chloroquine co-treatment. While autophagy modulators, including chloroquine and rapamycin, did not improve UCP1 downregulation and BAT whitening, AMPK activators could partially rescue these damages. We also demonstrated that preterm infants had higher diurnal temperature variation during corticosteroid treatment. Conclusions: Postnatal short course Dex impaired BAT mitochondrial function and autophagy flux in rat pups. AMPK activators had the potential to rescue the damage. Copyright © The author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the role of astragalus polysaccharide (APS) in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm children using an established BPD cell model. EA.hy926 cell cultures were divided into three groups: the air group as the blank control, the hyperoxia group as the experimental control and the APS group (2.5 mg/ml). The production of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by biochemical assays. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect the RNA and protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-8, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65. Compared with the hyperoxia group, the ROS and MDA levels of the APS group were significantly reduced. By contrast, SOD production was significantly increased. The expression of IL-8, ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB p65 in the APS group was downregulated. APS acts as an antioxidant by stimulating SOD production while inhibiting lipid peroxidation in the EA.hy926 cells. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that APS retards the inflammatory response, as shown by the reduced expression of NF-kappaB p65, IL-8 and ICAM-1 when APS was added.

AB  - As well-known regulators of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role not only in cell proliferation and differentiation, but also in tumorigenesis and organ development. Furthermore, it is estimated that miRNAs may be responsible for regulating the expression of nearly one-third of the human genome. Simultaneously, in the clinic, with advances in neonatal care, a larger number of premature infants are being saved, and thus diseases of lung development, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have become more and more common. However, only a few miRNA studies have studied their connection with diseases of lung development. In our study, we used a miRNA microarray including more than 1891 capture probes to profile the expression of miRNAs at three time points of rat lung development [embryonic (E) Day 16 (E16), E19, E21]. miRNAs found to have consistent fold-changes (fold-change>2.0) during all three time points were selected and validated by real-time PCR. As a result, 167 differentially expressed miRNAs were found during rat lung organogenesis, including 81 upregulated and 86 downregulated miRNAs. Seven miRNAs were selected and characterized by having a consistent >2-fold changes between all three groups. Among these 7 miRNAs, except for let-7a, the other 6 miRNAs (miR-1949, miR-125b-5p, miR-296, miR-93, miR-146b, miR-3560) are all first reported for the first time in lung development. Finally, due to the fact that they demonstrated higher fold changes, from these 7 miRNAs we selected miR-125b-5p, miR-296, miR-93, miR-146b and miR-3560 for real-time PCR. We hypothesized that these newly identified miRNAs may play an important role in fetal lung development, and this experimental result could help us to further clarify the mechanism of normal lung development including the development of type II pneumocytes. This may provide a physiological basis for future research on diseases of lung development.

AB  - We have previously isolated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from the tracheal aspirates of premature neonates with respiratory distress. Although isolation of MSCs correlates with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the physiologic role of these cells remains unclear. To address this, we further characterized the cells, focusing on the issues of gene expression, origin, and cytokine expression. Microarray comparison of early passage neonatal lung MSC gene expression to cord blood MSCs and human fetal and neonatal lung fibroblast lines demonstrated that the neonatal lung MSCs differentially expressed 971 gene probes compared with cord blood MSCs, including the transcription factors Tbx2, Tbx3, Wnt5a, FoxF1, and Gli2, each of which has been associated with lung development. Compared with lung fibroblasts, 710 gene probe transcripts were differentially expressed by the lung MSCs, including IL-6 and IL-8/CXCL8. Differential chemokine expression was confirmed by protein analysis. Further, neonatal lung MSCs exhibited a pattern of Hox gene expression distinct from cord blood MSCs but similar to human fetal lung fibroblasts, consistent with a lung origin. On the other hand, limiting dilution analysis showed that fetal lung fibroblasts form colonies at a significantly lower rate than MSCs, and fibroblasts failed to undergo differentiation along adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. In conclusion, MSCs isolated from neonatal tracheal aspirates demonstrate a pattern of lung-specific gene expression, are distinct from lung fibroblasts, and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) deficiency syndrome is characterized by neurologic, thyroidal, and pulmonary dysfunction. Children usually have mild-to-severe respiratory symptoms and occasionally die of respiratory failure. Herein, we describe an infant with a constitutional 14q12-21.3 haploid deletion encompassing the TTF-1 gene locus who had cerebral dysgenesis, thyroidal dysfunction, and respiratory insufficiency. The clinical course was notable for mild hyaline membrane disease, continuous ventilatory support, and symmetrically distributed pulmonary cysts by imaging. He developed pneumonia and respiratory failure and died at 8 months. Pathologically, the lungs had grossly visible emphysematous changes with "cysts" up to 2 mm in diameter. The airway generations and radial alveolar count were diminished. In addition to acute bacterial pneumonia, there was focally alveolar septal fibrosis, pneumocyte hypertrophy, and clusters of airspace macrophages. Ultrastructurally, type II pneumocytes had numerous lamellar bodies, and alveolar spaces contained fragments of type II pneumocytes and extruded lamellar bodies. Although immunoreactivity for surfactant protein SP-A and ABCA3 was diminished, that for SP-B and proSP-C was robust, although irregularly distributed, corresponding to the distribution of type II pneumocytes. Immunoreactivity for TTF-1 protein was readily detected. In summation, we document abnormal airway and alveolar morphogenesis and altered expression of surfactant-associated proteins, which may explain the respiratory difficulties encountered in TTF-1 haploinsufficiency. These findings are consistent with experimental evidence documenting the important role of TTF-1 in pulmonary morphogenesis and surfactant metabolism.

AB  - Despite recent advances in neonatal intensive care and surfactant therapy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be one of the most common long-term pulmonary complications associated with preterm birth. Clinical efforts to prevent and treat BPD have been largely unsuccessful due to its multifactorial nature and poorly understood disease process. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a matricellular protein that plays an important role in tissue development and remodeling. Previous studies have demonstrated that hyperoxia exposure up-regulates CTGF expression in neonatal rat lungs. Whether CTGF overexpression plays a role in the pathogenesis of BPD, and whether CTGF antagonism has a therapeutic potential for BPD, are unknown. In the present study, we examined CTGF expression in lung autopsy specimens from patients with BPD and control subjects with no BPD. We assessed the effect of a CTGF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (CTGF Ab) on preventing hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats. Our study demonstrates that CTGF expression is increased in BPD lungs. In newborn rats, exposure to 90% oxygen for 14 days resulted in activation of beta-catenin signaling, decreased alveolarization and vascular development, and physiological and histological evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, treatment with CTGF Ab prevented beta-catenin signaling activation, improved alveolarization and vascular development, and attenuated PH during hyperoxia. These data indicate that CTGF-beta-catenin signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of experimental BPD. CTGF antagonism may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate BPD and PH in neonates.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), associated with chorioamnionitis, results from the simultaneous effects of disrupted lung development, lung injury, and repair superimposed on the developing lung. Caveolins (Cavs) are implicated as major modulators of lung injury and remodeling by multiple signaling pathways, although Cavs have been minimally studied in the injured developing lung. We hypothesized that chorioamnionitis-associated antenatal lung inflammation would decrease the expression of Cav-1 in preterm fetal lungs. We tested whether changes occurred in the transcription factors Smad2/3, Smad1/5, Stat3, and Stat1, and we also studied the activation of acid-sphingomyelinase (a-SMase) with the generation of ceramide, along with changes in the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as indicators of possible Cav-1-mediated effects. Fetal sheep were exposed to 10 mg of intra-amniotic endotoxin or saline for 2, 7, or 2 + 7 days before preterm delivery at 124 days of gestation. The expression of Cav-1 and HO-1 and the phosphorylation of Smad and Stat were evaluated by real-time PCR, Western blotting, and/or immunohistochemistry. The activity of a-SMase and the concentrations of ceramide were measured. Intra-amniotic endotoxin decreased Cav-1 mRNA and protein expression in the lungs, with a maximum reduction of Cav-1 mRNA to 50% +/- 7% of the control value (P < 0.05), and of Cav-1 protein expression to 20% +/- 5% of the control value (P < 0.05). Decreased concentrations of Cav-1 were associated with the elevated phosphorylation of Smad2/3, Stat3, and Stat1, but not of Smad1/5. The expression of HO-1, a-SMase activity, and ceramide increased. Antenatal inflammation decreased the expression of Cav-1 in the preterm fetal lung. The decreased expression of Cav-1 was associated with the activation of the Smad2/3, Stat, and a-SMase/ceramide pathways, and with the increased expression of HO-1. The decreased concentrations of Cav-1 and changes in other signaling pathways may contribute to BPD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIM: Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) occurs during the first year of life in 50% of children and 20%-40% of them have signs of lower respiratory tract infection (bronchiolitis or pneumonia). There is an increased risk for complicated course and death from RSV infection in premature infants, especially those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or congenital heart disease. The aim of our study was to analyze clinical characteristics of laboratory confirmed RSV infection in order to evaluate the need for preventive measures in neonates and young infants., METHODS: The prospective study included children under age of 12 months admitted to our hospital in the period November 2008-March 2009 who were positive for RSV by enzyme immunoassay membrane test. The course of disease was assessed by clinical score and radiographic findings., RESULTS: Infection with RSV was confirmed in 91 patients: 21 (23.0%) were under the age of 30 days, 37 (40.7%) were between 31-60 days, and 33 patients (36.3%) were older than 60 days (p > 0.05). The highest hospitalization rate was in January--33 patients (36.3%; p < 0.01). Disease severity score in these age groups (AG) were: 8.4 +/- 0.4 (AG 0-30 days); 9.0 +/- 0.3 (AG 31-60 days) and 8.3 +/- 0.3 (AG > 60 days), without statistically significant difference among the groups (p > 0.05). Clinical scores in patients with and without risk factors were 10.5 +/- 0.5 and 8.3 +/- 0.2, respectively (p < 0.01). Pathological radiographic findings were observed in 72 (79.1%) and complications (apnea, significant atelectasis, encephalopathy) occured in 15 (16.5%) patients. The average length of hospital stay in complicated and uncomplicated course of the disease was 9 days and 6 days, respectively (p < 0.01). Therapy in 85 (93.4%) patients included bronchodilators, while systemic glucocorticoids and oxygen therapy were used in 51 (56.0%) and 44 (48.4%) patients, respectively. Death occured in 2 (2.2%) patients, both from a high risk group (the patient with BPD and the other one with congenital heart disease and Down syndrome)., CONCLUSION: Infection with RSV in our settings showed marked seasonal characteristics with highest hospitalization rate in January. Although the course and outcome of the disease were favorable in the majority of our patients, the need for hospitalization and administration of therapy with possible side effects warrants that general measures for prevention of respiratory infections are followed especially in the first year of life. Severe disease and death are more probable in neonates and infants with risk factors. In these children passive immunisation with specific monoclonal antibody (e.g. palivizumab) during RSV season should be considered.

AB  - Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is synthesized by pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in inflammatory lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Many BPD infants develop asthma, a serious disorder of intermittent airway obstruction. Despite extensive research, early mechanisms of asthma remain controversial. The incidence of asthma is growing, now affecting >300 million people worldwide. To test the hypothesis that GRP mediates asthma, we used two murine models: ozone exposure for air pollution-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway disease. BALB/c mice were given small molecule GRP blocking agent 77427, or GRP blocking antibody 2A11, before exposure to ozone or OVA challenge. In both models, GRP blockade abrogated AHR and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages and granulocytes, and decreased BAL cytokines implicated in asthma, including those typically derived from Th1 (e.g., IL-2, TNFalpha), Th2 (e.g., IL-5, IL-13), Th17 (IL-17), macrophages (e.g., MCP-1, IL-1), and neutrophils (KC = IL-8). Dexamethasone generally had smaller effects on all parameters. Macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils express GRP receptor (GRPR). GRP blockade diminished serine phosphorylation of GRPR with ozone or OVA. Thus, GRP mediates AHR and airway inflammation in mice, suggesting that GRP blockade is promising as a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach to treat and/or prevent asthma in humans.

AB  - Inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) 4 and 5 regulate the inflammatory activity of macrophages. Whether FABPs 4 and 5 could play a role in the pathogenesis of BPD via the promotion of macrophage inflammatory activity is unknown. This study sought to examine whether the expression levels of FABP4 and FABP5 were altered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue in a baboon model of BPD. This study also sought to characterize the cell types that express these proteins. Real-time PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and double immunofluorescence were used to examine the expression of FABPs in samples of BPD. Morphometric analysis was used to quantify FABP4-positive peribronchial blood vessels in lung sections. FABP4 was primarily expressed in macrophages in samples of BPD. In addition, FABP4 was expressed in the endothelial cells of blood vessels in peribronchial areas and the vasa vasorum, but not in the alveolar vasculature in samples of BPD. FABP4 concentrations were significantly increased in lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples with BPD. An increased density of FABP4-positive peribronchial blood vessels was evident in both baboon and human BPD sections. FABP5 was expressed in several cell types, including alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. FABP5 concentrations did not show any significant alterations in BPD. In conclusion, FABP4 but not FABP5 levels are increased in BPD. FABP4 is differentially expressed in endothelial cells of the bronchial microvasculature, which demonstrates a previously unrecognized expansion in BPD.

AB  - Congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) is a rare but deleterious consequence of primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection during pregnancy. Typical CVS stigmata are cerebral abnormalities, eye diseases and segmentally distributed, cicatricial skin lesions. In this paper the authors report on a male preterm infant, born at 30 weeks of gestation, who developed pustular skin lesions at the age of 4 weeks. The mother had suffered from chickenpox at 14 weeks of gestation. Apart from skin manifestations, critical bronchopulmonary dysplasia made the infant conspicuous. The VZV genome was detected in blood, respiratory secretions and skin lesions. At age 10 weeks he presented with extensive intestinal wall perforation, considered to be related to CVS, which finally led to death. This case shows for the first time the clinical course of CVS in a preterm infant. It illustrates the need for discussion of comprehensive VZV vaccination for seronegative women of childbearing age.

AB  - PURPOSE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a long-term respiratory condition. More than a quarter of extremely premature newborns are harmed by BPD. At present, there are no apparent effective drugs or treatments for the condition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional role and mechanism of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (Lef1) in BPD in vitro., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from BPD patients and healthy volunteers were gathered, and an in vitro model of BPD was developed in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) MLE-12 induced by hyperoxia. Then expression of kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4/Klf4) and LEF1/Lef1 were evaluated. After Lef1 overexpressing plasmid and the vector were transfected into hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells, cell proliferation assays were carried out. Cell apoptosis was investigated by a flow cytometry assay, and apoptosis related proteins Bcl-2, cleaved-caspase 3 and 9 were analyzed by a western blot assay. The binding between Klf4 and Lef1 promoter predicted on the JASPAR website was verified using luciferase and ChIP assays. For further study of the mechanism of Klf4 and Lef1 in BPD, gain-of-function experiments were performed., RESULTS: The mRNA levels of KLF4/Klf4 and LEF1/Lef1 were diminished in clinical BPD serum samples and hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells. Overexpression of Lef1 stimulated AEC proliferation and suppressed AEC apoptosis induced by hyperoxia. Mechanically, Klf4 bound to Lef1's promoter region and aids transcription. Moreover, the results of gain-of-function experiments supported that Klf4 could impede AEC damage induced by hyperoxia via stimulating Lef1., CONCLUSION: Klf4 and Lef1 expression levels were declined in hyperoxia-induced AECs, and Lef1 could be transcriptionally activated by Klf4 and protect against hyperoxia-induced AEC injury in BPD. As a result, Lef1 might become a prospective therapeutic target for BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature birth and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) are risk factors for disturbed lung development and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The molecular mechanisms related to prematurity and BPD remain largely unknown. Epithelial expression of the transcription factor GATA-6 has been implicated in normal and abnormal murine lung development., OBJECTIVES: The possible involvement of GATA-6 in the normal development and in RDS and BPD was investigated in the human and baboon lung., METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression of GATA-6 and thyroid transcription factor 1 in lung specimens from different age groups of human and baboon fetuses and newborns with lung disease. Furthermore, the regulatory role of TGF-beta1 in GATA-6 expression was investigated in human pulmonary epithelial cell lines using RT-PCR., RESULTS: GATA-6 expression increased in the developing human airway epithelium along with advancing gestation, but diminished to negligible at birth. In RDS, GATA-6 expression was enhanced at 5-7 days after birth, and decreased thereafter. In BPD, the expression of GATA-6 in alveolar epithelial cells was low. These results were confirmed and extended using an established baboon model of prematurity. The in vitro experiments revealed that TGF-beta1 induces GATA-6 and thyroid transcription factor 1 expression in lung epithelial cells., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the expression of GATA-6 at the early stages of the preterm lung may be related to impaired postnatal alveolar development.

AB  - Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is an important cytokine and involved in the pathogenesis and genetics of many diseases. The authors studied two different populations of preterm infants to test whether polymorphisms within IL-18 are in association with prematurity itself or with typical pulmonary disease or measurements seen in preterm infants, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumothoraces and application of surfactant, inhalation or mechanical ventilation. Whereas the first population of 228 preterm infants showed strong association of IL-18 with preterm birth (p<0.001), this was not confirmed in the second population of 346 preterm infants. In addition, no association with any lung condition of prematurity was observed. The authors conclude that IL-18 does not play an important role in the genetics of preterm birth nor in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other lung complications in preterm infants. Caution must be taken in the interpretation of the results of genetic association studies performed in one population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the wide variation in the frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) between hospitals is due to differences in delivery room intubation rates., METHODS: Data on 1260 infants of birth weight <1500 g and 23-31 weeks gestational age, born in 1999-2002 and surviving to 36 weeks, were collected; 196 (15.6%) developed BPD defined as oxygen need at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Generalised estimating equations and conditional logistic models adjusting for centre, gestational age, propensity score for intubation, and other potential confounders were used., RESULTS: Rates of BPD, delivery room intubation and mechanical ventilation for >24 h differed significantly between hospitals. Centres with high delivery room intubation rates had higher ventilation and BPD rates. Hospitals ventilating more often also did so for a longer time. Although delivery room intubation was associated with BPD in unadjusted analyses, neither delivery room intubation nor brief (<24 h) mechanical ventilation were risk factors for BPD in multivariate analyses adjusting for gestational age, case mix and other pre- and perinatal factors, indicating no causal effect or unmeasured confounding. Significant risk factors for developing BPD were low gestational age, prolonged ventilation (>24 h: adjusted OR (aOR) 2.4; >7 days: aOR 14.9), male sex (aOR 1.7), being small for gestational age (SGA; aOR 4.3) and late-onset sepsis (aOR 2.2). After taking into account these variables/procedures, centre differences remained significant but explained only about 5% of variance., CONCLUSIONS: Differences in BPD frequency between hospitals are explained by differences in procedures, chiefly mechanical ventilation, rather than by differences in initial management or case mix. Delivery room intubation and brief mechanical ventilation did not increase BPD risk.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the main complication of extreme prematurity, resulting in part from mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. Currently, no specific treatment exists for BPD. BPD is characterized by an arrest in alveolar development and increased apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Type 2 AECs are putative distal lung progenitor cells, capable of regenerating alveolar homeostasis after injury. We hypothesized that the protection of AEC2 death via the activation of the prosurvival Akt pathway prevents arrested alveolar development in experimental BPD. We show that the pharmacologic inhibition of the prosurvival factor Akt pathway with wortmannin during the critical period of alveolar development impairs alveolar development in newborn rats, resulting in larger and fewer alveoli, reminiscent of BPD. Conversely, in an experimental model of BPD induced by oxygen exposure of newborn rats, alveolar simplification is associated with a decreased activation of lung Akt. In vitro studies with rat lung epithelial (RLE) cells cultured in hyperoxia (95% O(2)) showed decreased apoptosis and improved cell survival after the forced expression of active Akt by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. In vivo, adenovirus-mediated Akt gene transfer preserves alveolar architecture in the newborn rat model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. We conclude that inhibition of the prosurvival factor Akt disrupts normal lung development, whereas the expression of active Akt in experimental BPD preserves alveolar development. We speculate that the modulation of apoptosis may have therapeutic potential in lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage.

AB  - RATIONALE: Prolonged exposure to 100% O(2) causes hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI), characterized by alveolar epithelial cell injury and death. We previously demonstrated that the murine chitinase-like protein, breast regression protein (BRP)-39 and its human homolog, YKL-40, inhibit cellular apoptosis. However, the regulation and roles of these molecules in hyperoxia have not been addressed., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that BRP-39 and YKL-40 (also called chitinase-3-like 1) play important roles in the pathogenesis of HALI., METHODS: We characterized the regulation of BRP-39 during HALI and the responses induced by hyperoxia in wild-type mice, BRP-39-null (-/-) mice, and BRP-39(-/-) mice in which YKL-40 was overexpressed in respiratory epithelium. We also compared the levels of tracheal aspirate YKL-40 in premature newborns with respiratory failure., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: These studies demonstrate that hyperoxia inhibits BRP-39 in vivo in the murine lung and in vitro in epithelial cells. They also demonstrate that BRP-39(-/-) mice have exaggerated permeability, protein leak, oxidation, inflammatory, chemokine, and epithelial apoptosis responses, and experience premature death in 100% O(2). Lastly, they demonstrate that YKL-40 ameliorates HALI, prolongs survival in 100% O(2), and rescues the exaggerated injury response in BRP-39(-/-) animals. In accord with these findings, the levels of tracheal aspirate YKL-40 were lower in premature infants treated with hyperoxia for respiratory failure who subsequently experienced bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death compared with those that did not experience these complications., CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that hyperoxia inhibits BRP-39/YKL-40, and that BRP-39 and YKL-40 are critical regulators of oxidant injury, inflammation, and epithelial apoptosis in the murine and human lung.

AB  - OBJECT: Studies have shown decreased levels of nitric oxide (NO), the product of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene activity, in infants with respiratory conditions and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The authors evaluated the association of the eNOS gene promoter polymorphism T-786C with the cause of these conditions (respiratory conditions and IVH) in premature infants., METHODS: Blood samples from 124 African American premature infants were studied. The DNA was isolated and microplate polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was performed. Genotypes were scored as: TT homozygotes with 140 bp and 40 bp; CC homozygotes with 90 bp, 50 bp, and 40 bp; and TC heterozygotes with 140 bp, 90 bp, 50 bp, and 40 bp. Genotypes were stratified according to ethnicity, preterm status, and prematurity conditions., RESULTS: The mutant allele -786C was present in 15.3% of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and IVH, compared with 7.25% in those premature infants without these conditions. A significant 2-fold increase of the mutant allele in patients compared with controls (p = 0.04, OR 2.3) reveals that the eNOS -786C allele could be a significant risk factor in the origin of respiratory conditions and IVH in premature infants., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the mutant eNOS -786C allele is a significant risk factor in the origin of respiratory and IVH diseases, probably mediating an insufficient supply of endogenous NO in premature infants.

AB  - Pulmonary inflammation is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. We have previously shown that perinatal pulmonary expression of human IL-1beta is sufficient to cause a lung disease similar to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by inflammation, impaired alveolarization, poor postnatal growth, and increased mortality in infant mice. The alphavbeta6 integrin plays a critical role in regulating inflammation in the adult lung. To study the role of the beta6 integrin subunit in neonatal inflammatory lung disease, we compared the pulmonary development in IL-1beta-expressing infant mice with wild-type or null beta6 integrin loci. Absence of the beta6 integrin subunit decreased the mortality and improved the postnatal growth of IL-1beta-expressing pups. The disrupted alveolar development of IL-1beta-expressing mice was improved by beta6 integrin deficiency. IL-1beta-expressing beta6(-/-) pups had shorter alveolar chord length and thinner alveolar walls than IL-1beta-expressing beta6(+/+) pups. In addition, the absence of the beta6 integrin subunit reduced IL-1beta-induced neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the alveolar spaces. beta6 integrin subunit deficiency suppressed inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in the airways and alleviated airway remodeling in IL-1beta-expressing mice. The expression of the chemoattractant proteins, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, calgranulin A, and calgranulin B, of osteopontin, and of the chitinase-like lectins, Ym1 and Ym2, was lower in IL-1beta-expressing beta6(-/-) than in IL-1beta-expressing beta6(+/+) mice. We conclude that absence of the beta6 integrin subunit protects the infant murine lung against IL-1beta-induced inflammation and injury.

AB  - The transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of secreted growth factors consists of more than 40 members, including the TGF-beta isoforms themselves, bone morphogenetic proteins, and activins. Most of these factors have been shown to be essential for proper organ development, a process often recapitulated in chronic diseases. Importantly, TGF-beta superfamily members are key regulators of extracellular matrix composition and alveolar epithelial cell and fibroblast function in the lung. Both during lung development and disease, TGF-betas therefore control lung homeostasis by providing the structural requirements and functional micromilieu needed for physiological epithelial cell function and proper gas exchange. Prolonged alterations of TGF-beta signaling have been shown to result in structural changes in the lung that compromise gas exchange and lung function, as seen in arrested lung development, a feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, lung fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All these syndromes share a loss of functional alveolar structures, which ultimately leads to a decreased life expectancy. In this review, we cover our current understanding of the impact of TGF-beta signaling on chronic lung disease. We focus on distorted TGF-beta signaling in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as prototype diseases of the premature and matured lung, respectively, which are both characterized by functional and structural loss of alveolar units.

AB  - RATIONALE: Disordered extracellular matrix production is a feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The basis of this phenomenon is not understood., OBJECTIVES: To assess lysyl oxidase expression and activity in the injured developing lungs of newborn mice and of prematurely born infants with BPD or at risk for BPD., METHODS: Pulmonary lysyl oxidase and elastin gene and protein expression were assessed in newborn mice breathing 21 or 85% oxygen, in patients who died with BPD or were at risk for BPD, and in control patients. Signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) was preemptively blocked in mice exposed to hyperoxia using TGF-beta-neutralizing antibodies. Lysyl oxidase promoter activity was assessed using plasmids containing the lox or loxl1 promoters fused upstream of the firefly luciferase gene., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: mRNA and protein levels and activity of lysyl oxidases (Lox, LoxL1, LoxL2) were elevated in the oxygen-injured lungs of newborn mice and infants with BPD or at risk for BPD. In oxygen-injured mouse lungs, increased TGF-beta signaling drove aberrant lox, but not loxl1 or loxl2, expression. Lox expression was also increased in oxygen-injured fibroblasts and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells., CONCLUSIONS: Lysyl oxidase expression and activity are dysregulated in BPD in injured developing mouse lungs and in prematurely born infants. In developing mouse lungs, aberrant TGF-beta signaling dysregulated lysyl oxidase expression. These data support the postulate that excessive stabilization of the extracellular matrix by excessive lysyl oxidase activity might impede the normal matrix remodeling that is required for pulmonary alveolarization and thereby contribute to the pathological pulmonary features of BPD.

AB  - Exposure of preterm infants to hyperoxia impairs vascular growth, contributing to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. Disruption of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-nitric oxide (NO) signaling impairs vascular growth. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may play an important role in vascular growth. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), a type of EPC, from human preterm cord blood are more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced growth impairment than term ECFCs. Therefore, we hypothesized that hyperoxia disrupts VEGF-NO signaling and impairs growth in preterm ECFCs and that exogenous VEGF or NO preserves growth in hyperoxia. Growth kinetics of preterm cord blood-derived ECFCs (gestational ages, 27-34 wk) were assessed in room air (RA) and hyperoxia (40-50% oxygen) with or without VEGF, NO, or N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine. VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein expression and NO production were compared. Compared with RA controls, hyperoxia significantly decreased growth, VEGFR-2 and eNOS expression, and NO production. VEGF treatment restored growth in hyperoxia to values measured in RA controls and significantly increased eNOS expression in hyperoxia. NO treatment also increased growth in hyperoxia. N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine treatment inhibited VEGF-augmented growth in RA and hyperoxia. We conclude that hyperoxia decreases growth and disrupts VEGF-NO signaling in human preterm ECFCs. VEGF treatment restores growth in hyperoxia by increasing NO production. NO treatment also increases growth during hyperoxia. Exogenous VEGF or NO may protect preterm ECFCs from the adverse effects of hyperoxia and preservation of ECFC function may improve outcomes of preterm infants.

AB  - Background: Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a member of the insulin family, has a high degree of homology with insulin and exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress properties. However, the potential protective effect of IGF-1 on hyperoxia-induced lung injury remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects and mechanism of action of IGF-1 in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats. Materials and Methods: Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe pathological changes in lung tissue; transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the ultrastructure, and ELISA was used to detect the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Further, malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase activities in lung tissue were evaluated. TUNEL staining was used to detect cell apoptosis, and western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, p-PERK, p-eIF2alpha, ATF4, and CHOP in the lung tissue. Moreover, the wet/dry weight ratio of lung tissue was determined. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of IGF-1 effectively reduced lung tissue damage induced by hyperoxia; production of inflammatory cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. Further, IGF-1 down-regulated the expression of ATF4, CHOP, and Bax/Bcl-2, and inhibited the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2alpha. Conclusion:  The results suggest that IGF-1 reduces hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress in neonatal rats through the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway and inhibits cell apoptosis.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen therapy (hyperoxia) in preterm babies with respiratory stress is associated with lung injury and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis plays critical roles in maintaining cellular functions such as protein synthesis, folding, and secretion. Interruption of ER homeostasis causes ER stress and triggers the unfolded protein response, which can lead to apoptosis in persistently stressed cells. ERp57 is an ER protein and is associated with calreticulin and calnexin in protein glycosylation. In this study, we found hyperoxia downregulated ERp57 in neonatal rat lungs and cultured human endothelial cells. Transient transfection of ERp57 small interfering RNA significantly knocked down ERp57 expression and reduced hyperoxia- or tunicamycin-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Apoptosis was decreased from 26.8 to 9.9% in hyperoxia-exposed cells and from 37.8 to 5.0% in tunicamycin-treated cells. The activation of caspase-3 induced by hyperoxia or tunicamycin was diminished and immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein/glucose-regulated protein 78-kDa (BiP/GRP78) induction was increased in ERp57 knockdown cells. Overexpression of ERp57 exacerbated hyperoxia- or tunicamycin-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Apoptosis was increased from 10.1 to 14.3% in hyperoxia-exposed cells and from 14.0 to 21.2% in tunicamycin-treated cells. Overexpression of ERp57 also augmented tunicamycin-induced caspase-3 activation and reduced BiP/GRP78 induction. Our results demonstrate that ERp57 can regulate apoptosis in human endothelial cells. It appears that knockdown of ERp57 confers cellular protection against hyperoxia- or tunicamycin-induced apoptosis by inhibition of caspase-3 activation and stimulation of BiP/GRP78 induction.

AB  - Increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in newborn infants, but the role of MMP-9 in the pathophysiology of BPD is unclear. We have shown that perinatal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the lung is sufficient to cause a BPD-like illness in infant mice. To study the hypothesis that MMP-9 is an important downstream mediator in IL-1 beta-induced lung injury in the newborn, we compared the effects of IL-1 beta on fetal and postnatal lung inflammation and development in transgenic mice with regulatable pulmonary overexpression of human mature IL-1 beta with wild-type (IL-1 beta/MMP-9(+/+)) or null (IL-1 beta/MMP-9(-/-)) MMP-9 loci. IL-1 beta increased the expression of MMP-9 mRNA and amount of MMP-9 protein in the lungs of MMP-9(+/+) mice. IL-1 beta/MMP-9(-/-) mice had fewer neutrophils but more macrophages in the lungs than did IL-1 beta/MMP-9(+/+) mice. MMP-9 deficiency increased pulmonary cell death and macrophage clearance of dying cells in IL-1 beta-expressing mice. IL-1 beta/MMP-9(-/-) mice had more severe alveolar hypoplasia than IL-1 beta/MMP-9(+/+) mice, implying that IL-1 beta-induced lung disease was worsened in the absence of MMP-9. These results suggest that MMP-9 activity in the inflamed neonatal lung protects the lung against injury.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a frequent cause of morbidity in preterm infants that is characterized by prolonged need for ventilatory support in an intensive care environment. BPD is characterized histopathologically by persistently thick, cellular distal airspace walls. In normally developing lungs, by comparison, remodeling of the immature parenchymal architecture is characterized by thinning of the future alveolar walls, a process predicated on cell loss through apoptosis., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that minimizing lung injury, using high-frequency nasal ventilation to provide positive distending pressure with minimal assisted tidal volume displacement, would increase apoptosis and decrease proliferation among mesenchymal cells in the distal airspace walls compared with a conventional mode of support (intermittent mandatory ventilation)., METHODS: Accordingly, we compared two groups of preterm lambs: one group managed by high-frequency nasal ventilation and a second group managed by intermittent mandatory ventilation. Each group was maintained for 3 days., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Oxygenation and ventilation targets were sustained with lower airway pressures and less supplemental oxygen in the high-frequency nasal ventilation group, in which alveolarization progressed. Thinning of the distal airspace walls was accompanied by more apoptosis, and less proliferation, among mesenchymal cells of the high-frequency nasal ventilation group, based on morphometric, protein abundance, and mRNA expression indices of apoptosis and proliferation., CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that high-frequency nasal ventilation preserves the balance between mesenchymal cell apoptosis and proliferation in the distal airspace walls, such that alveolarization progresses.

AB  - Deficiency in the collectin mannose-binding lectin (MBL) increases the risk for pulmonary and systemic infections and its complications in children and adults. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to determine the genetic association of sequence variations within the MBL gene with systemic infections and pulmonary short- and long-term complications in preterm infants below 32 weeks gestational age (GA). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region and one SNP in the promotor region of MBL2 were genotyped by direct sequencing and with sequence-specific probes in 284 newborn infants <32 weeks GA. Clinical variables were comprehensively monitored. An association was found between two SNPs and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as persistent oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, adjusting for covariates GA, grade of respiratory distress syndrome and days on mechanical ventilation (rs1800450 (exon 1 at codon 54, B variant): odds ratio dominant model (OR)=3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.62-7.98; rs7096206 (-221, X variant): OR=2.40, 95% CI=1.16-4.96). Haplotype analyses confirmed the association to BPD, and a single haplotype (frequency 56%) including all SNPs in their wild-type form showed a negative association with the development of BPD. We detected no association between the MBL gene variations and the development of early-onset infections or further pulmonary complications. Frequent variants of the MBL gene, leading to low MBL concentrations, are associated with the diagnosis of BPD in preterm infants. This provides a basis for potential therapeutic options and further genetic and proteomic analysis of the function of MBL in the resistance against pulmonary long-term complications in preterm infants.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that adversely affects long-term pulmonary function as well as neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants. Elastolytic proteases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD. Cathepsin S (cat S) is a cysteine protease with potent elastolytic activity. Increased levels and activity of cat S have been detected in a baboon model of BPD., OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether deficiency of cat S alters the course of hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury in mice., METHODS: Newborn wild-type and cat S-deficient mice were exposed to 80% oxygen for 14 days. Histologic and morphometric analysis were performed and bronchoalveolar lavage protein and cells were analyzed. Lung elastin was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, desmosine analysis, and Hart's stain. Distribution of myofibroblasts was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Hydroxyproline content of lung tissues was measured., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hyperoxia-exposed cat S-deficient mice were protected from growth restriction and had improved alveolarization, decreased septal wall thickness, lower number of macrophages, and lower protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. alpha-Smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts accounted for at least some of the increased interstitial cellularity in hyperoxia-exposed mouse lungs and were significantly less in cat S-deficient lungs. Lung hydroxyproline content was increased in hyperoxia-exposed wild-type, but not in cat S-deficient lungs. Desmosine content was significantly reduced in both genotypes with hyperoxia., CONCLUSIONS: Cathepsin S deficiency improves alveolarization, and attenuates macrophage influx and fibroproliferative changes in hyperoxia-induced neonatal mouse lung injury.

AB  - RATIONALE: In mice, vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) plays an important role in development of the lymphatic system and in pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation. Its role in development of the lymphatic system in human lung and in lung injury in newborns remains unclear., OBJECTIVES: We studied the role of VEGF-C in developing human lung, and in acute and chronic lung injury in preterm infants., METHODS: Included in the immunohistochemistry study were 10 fetuses, 15 control neonates without primary lung disease, 15 preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, and 8 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Tracheal aspirate fluid samples of intubated very-low-birth-weight infants during Postnatal Weeks 1-5 were analyzed with ELISA., RESULTS: Bronchiolar staining for VEGF-C was observed in all 48 samples. Alveolar epithelial staining was seen in most fetuses (8/10). In addition, staining was observed in alveolar macrophages in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (4/8), and late respiratory distress syndrome (2/7). VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) staining was observed in lymphatic endothelium adjacent to vascular endothelium. VEGF-C was expressed consistently in tracheal aspirate fluid, being highest during the first 2 postnatal days. Antenatal administration of glucocorticoids was associated with higher VEGF-C in tracheal aspirate fluid., CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pulmonary VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 protein expression and consistent VEGF-C protein appearance in tracheal aspirate fluid in human preterm infants indicate a role for VEGF-C in the physiologic development of the lymphatic system of the lung.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of newborns triggered by oxygen and barotrauma, is characterized by arrested alveolarization. Increased levels of bombesin-like peptides shortly after birth mediate lung injury: anti-bombesin antibody 2A11 protects against BPD in two baboon models. The role of adaptive immunity in BPD has not been explored previously., OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to test the hypothesis that thymic architecture and/or T-cell function is altered with BPD, leading to autoimmunity and immunodeficiency., METHODS: Thymic structure was analyzed by histopathology of thymic architecture and immunohistochemistry for thymic maturation markers (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, CD4, and CD8). Thymic cortical epithelial cells (nurse cells) were studied using HLA-DR and protein gene product 9.5 as markers. Functional analysis was performed with "mixed lymphocyte reaction" of thymocyte or splenocyte responder cells with autologous lung cells as the stimulators., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 2A11 treatment attenuates thymic cortical involution in BPD animals, sustaining terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive prothymocytes and thymocyte proliferation. BPD animals have increased CD4(+) cells in thymic cortex and lung interstitium, which are reduced by 2A11. Conversely, cortical protein gene product 9.5/HLA-DR-positive thymic nurse cells are depleted in BPD animals, but are preserved by 2A11-treatment. Whereas fetal thymocytes and splenocytes respond to phythemagglutinin/ionomycin and to a lesser extent, to autologous lung, BPD thymocytes and splenocytes are phythemagglutinin/ionomycin-unresponsive, and yet react strongly to autologous lung. The 2A11 normalizes these responses., CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that bombesin-like peptides mediate premature thymic maturation and thymic nurse-cell depletion, leading to autoreactive T cells that could contribute to lung injury.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants is characterized by inhibited alveolarization and vasculogenesis. Our goal was to generate a mouse model of inhibited alveolarization by the administration of an inhibitor of angiogenesis. We then examined the effects of retinoic acid (RA) and erythropoietin (EPO) on alveolar development in this model. Three-day-old mice were injected with a single dose of SU1498 (30 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and either concomitant RA (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or EPO (2,000 IU/kg, subcutaneously) for 10 consecutive days, then harvested on Day 21. Morphometric and electron microscopic analysis, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) immunostaining of endothelial cells, were performed on the lung tissue. In vitro assays were also performed to characterize the effects of RA on endothelial cell growth. Alveolar development was attenuated in the SU1498-treated mice, and electron microscopy demonstrated dilated and dysmorphic capillaries in alveolar walls comparable to previous findings in lungs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. RA or EPO maintained mean alveolar volume, alveolar surface area, and endothelial cell volume density in the SU1498-treated animals. RA also increased the proliferation of human fetal lung capillary endothelial precursor cells in vitro. These results suggest that the maintenance or growth of the endothelial cell population of the distal lung plays a major role in postnatal alveolar development.

AB  - Two common lung-related complications in the neonate are respiratory distress syndrome, which is associated with a failure to generate low surface tension at the air-liquid interface because of pulmonary surfactant insufficiency, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung injury with reduced alveolarization. Surfactant phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species composition during alveolarization has not been examined. Mass spectrometry analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rodents and humans revealed significant changes in surfactant PC during alveolar development and BPD. In rats, total PC content rose during alveolarization, which was caused by an increase in palmitoylmyristoyl-PC (16:0/14:0PC) concentration. Furthermore, two animal models of BPD exhibited a specific reduction in 16:0/14:0PC content. In humans, 16:0/14:0PC content was specifically decreased in patients with BPD and emphysema compared with patients without alveolar pathology. Palmitoylmyristoyl-PC content increased with increasing intrinsic surfactant curvature, suggesting that it affects surfactant function in the septating lung. The changes in acyl composition of PC were attributed to type II cells producing an altered surfactant during alveolar development. These data are compatible with extracellular surfactant 16:0/14:0PC content being an indicator of alveolar architecture of the lung.

In the hyperoxic 140-day fetal baboon BPD model, p66(Shc) expression persisted, and its localization shifted from the epithelium of gestational controls to the mesenchyme of diseased lungs, coincident with expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cleaved poly(adenyl ribose) polymerase, a marker of apoptosis. Treatment with the antibombesin antibody 2A11 attenuated BPD, reduced cell proliferation, increased p66(Shc) expression 10.5-fold, and preserved epithelial p66(Shc) localization. p66(Shc) also decreased during normal human lung development, falling 87% between 18 and 24 weeks' gestation (p = 0.02). p66(Shc) was expressed throughout 18-week human lungs, became restricted to scattered epithelial cells by 24 weeks, and localized to isolated mesenchymal cells after term delivery. In contrast, p66(Shc) remained prominent in the epithelium of lungs with acute injury or mild BPD, and in the mesenchyme of lungs with severe disease. p66(Shc) localized to tissues expressing proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cleaved poly(adenyl ribose) polymerase., CONCLUSIONS: p66(Shc) expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis are concomitantly altered during lung development and in BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the patient population with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) requiring tracheostomy in a large tertiary level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to identify potential targets for improvement in the delivery of high-quality healthcare., METHODS: An IRB-exempt but IRB-registered retrospective review of medical records. Study inclusion criteria: patients treated for severe BPD with tracheostomy under 2 years of age in our tertiary referral center NICU. Control group criteria: 4-year aggregate NICU patient demographics. Basic demographics, maternal history, clinical data points, and outcomes variables were collected., RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in only one variable: racial identification (p-value = 0.036). All data points were then analyzed against racial identification, and statistically significant differences appeared in 4 categories: 1) illicit drug use, 2) birth head circumference and length, 3) days to readmission, and 4) child opportunity index scores. There was not a statistically significant difference in any other maternal characteristics or medical comorbidities, NICU length of stay, age at tracheostomy, or decannulation status., CONCLUSION: The incidence of our tracheostomy in infants with severe BPD was significantly higher (p = 0.036) in the subjects whose families identified as racially African American or Black, a marked contrast to our general NICU population and our overall tracheostomy population. The timing of the first readmission to the hospital was shorter for Caucasian or White infants compared to African American or Black infants. COI demonstrated statistically significantly poorer resources for African American or Black infants compared to White infants with tracheostomy. All other perinatal and outcome measurements did not differ significantly between the two racial groups. This suggests that this racial disparity is present and needs further investigation to better assess its impact on risk and outcomes as we develop pathways for high-quality healthcare delivery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prematurity is a main issue in modern obstetrical care. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the perinatal outcome of premature infants weighing less than 1500 g according to the mode of delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 122 patients with infants weighing less than 1500 g were enrolled in this retrospective study (26 to 32 weeks of gestation). The perinatal outcomes of 26 infants born by vaginal delivery were compared to 96 infants delivered by caesarean section., RESULTS: The rates of rupture of membranes, preterm labour and intravenous tocolysis were significantly increased in patients after vaginal delivery. Preeclampsia and pathological cardiotocograms were increased in patients after caesarean section. Infants born by vaginal delivery showed a significant increase of peri- and intraventricular haemorrhage grade III, periventricular leukomalacia, C-reactive protein 24 hours postpartum and mortality until the seventh day of life. However, the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly increased in infants born by caesarean section (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the mode of delivery affects the perinatal outcome of infants weighing less than 1500 g. Based on the results of the present study, it appears unclear which mode of delivery should be preferred, depending on particular material and fetal factors.

AB  - Embryonic stem (ES) cells are self-renewable and pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst-stage embryo. ES cell pluripotency is being investigated increasingly to obtain specific cell lineages for therapeutic treatments and tissue engineering. Type II alveolar epithelial cells have been derived from murine ES cells, but the capacity of the latter to generate differentiated airway epithelial tissue has never been reported. Herein, we show by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry that murine ES cells are able to differentiate into nonciliated secretory Clara cells, and that type I collagen induces this commitment. Moreover, when cultured at the air-liquid interface, ES cells give rise to a fully differentiated airway epithelium. By quantitative histologic examination, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy, we show that the bioengineered epithelium is composed of basal, ciliated, intermediate, and Clara cells, similar to those of native tracheobronchial airway epithelium. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting reveal that the generated epithelium also exhibits the ultrastructural features and secretory functions characteristic of airway epithelial tissue. These results open new perspectives for cell therapy of injured epithelium in airway diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiolitis obliterans.

AB  - Research interest in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has steadily increased, and numerous potential mediators have been implicated in the development of the disease. Among such mediators is transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Unfortunately, commonly utilized murine transgenic models are not optimal to investigate the effects of TGF-beta specifically during the 2-3 wk period of alveolar formation, the developmental stage that corresponds histologically to early alveolar development in humans, and the time frame during which BPD develops. In the current study, we utilized a triple-transgenic construct to overexpress bioactive TGF-beta1 in the neonatal mouse lung during the period of alveolar formation. Lungs were then examined by histologic, Western blot, and immunofluorescent methods. We found that overexpression of bioactive TGF-beta1 in neonatal mouse lungs resulted in structural changes that have been described in BPD. Included in those characteristics are abnormal alveolar structure, cellular composition, and vascular development. Our study indicates that TGF-beta1 overexpression in the neonatal mouse lung results in histologic alterations that have striking similarities to pathologic descriptions of BPD. We encourage the use of conditional transgenic models for the study of BPD, and hypothesize that the TGF-beta system is a central mediator for the histologic alterations described in association with the disease.

AB  - Chorioamnionitis is associated with preterm delivery and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by impaired alveolar and pulmonary vascular development and vascular dysfunction. To study the vascular effects in a model of chorioamnionitis, preterm lambs were exposed to 20 mg of intra-amniotic endotoxin or saline for 1, 2, 4, or 7 days and delivered at 122 days gestational age (term = 150 days). This intra-amniotic endotoxin dose was previously shown to induce lung maturation. The effect of intra-amniotic endotoxin on expression of endothelial proteins was evaluated. Muscularization of the media and collagen deposition in adventitia of small pulmonary arteries was used to assess vascular remodeling. Compared with controls, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein content was increased 2 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin exposure. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165 isoform mRNA decreased 2-4 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin. VEGF, VEGF receptor-2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and Tie-2 protein expression in the lung coordinately decreased 1-7 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin. Intra-amniotic endotoxin appeared to selectively decrease eNOS expression in small pulmonary vessels compared with large vessels. Medial smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased adventitial fibrosis were observed 4 and 7 days after intra-amniotic endotoxin. These results demonstrate that, in the preterm lamb lung, antenatal inflammation inhibits endothelial cell protein expression followed by vascular remodeling changes in small pulmonary arteries. Exposure to antenatal inflammation may cause vascular remodeling and contribute to the development of BPD.

AB  - VEGF plays a critical role during lung development and is decreased in human infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Inhibition of VEGF receptors in the newborn rat decreases vascular growth and alveolarization and causes pulmonary hypertension (PH). Nitric oxide (NO) is a downstream mediator of VEGF, but whether the effects of impaired VEGF signaling are due to decreased NO production is unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine whether impaired VEGF signaling downregulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression in the developing lung and whether inhaled NO (iNO) decreases PH and improves lung growth after VEGF inhibition. Newborn rats received a single dose of SU-5416 (a VEGF receptor inhibitor) or vehicle by subcutaneous injection and were killed up to 3 wk of age for assessments of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), radial alveolar counts (RAC), lung eNOS protein, and NOx production in isolated perfused lungs (IPL). Neonatal treatment with SU-5416 increased RVH in infant rats and reduced RAC. Compared with controls, SU-5416 reduced lung eNOS protein expression by 89% at 5 days (P < 0.01). IPL studies from day 14 rats demonstrated increased baseline pulmonary artery pressure and lower perfusate NOx concentration after SU-5416 treatment. Importantly, iNO treatment prevented the increase in RVH and improved RAC after SU-5416 treatment. We conclude that treatment of neonatal rats with SU-5416 downregulates lung eNOS expression and that iNO therapy decreases PH and improves lung growth after SU-5416 treatment. We speculate that decreased NO production contributes to PH and decreases distal lung growth caused by impaired VEGF signaling.

AB  - Until they are fully mature, the airways are highly susceptible to damage. Factors that may contribute to vulnerability of immature airways and the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm neonates include decreased contractility of smooth muscles of the airway, which leads to generation of lower forces, and immaturity of airway cartilage, leading to increased compressibility of developing airways. Mechanical ventilation has little effect on adult airways, but affects the dimensions and mechanical properties of preterm and newborn airways. Techniques for clinical evaluation of airway function include: (i). measurements of airway function during tidal breathing (airway resistance and reactivity are significantly elevated in infants with BPD); (ii). forced expiratory flow measurements [small-airway obstruction in infants with BPD is indicated by markedly reduced maximal volume measurements (Vmax)]; (iii). radiography procedures (plain radiographs, fluoroscopy, computed tomography and virtual bronchoscopy); and (iv). endoscopy procedures (rigid or flexible bronchoscopy, with or without measurement of oesophageal pressure). Imaging has demonstrated an excessively decreased airway cross-sectional area during exhalation in infants with BPD and acquired tracheomegaly in very preterm infants who had received mechanical ventilatory support. To further advance our understanding of how the airways develop, and to design less damaging protocols for mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates, basic laboratory studies of airway ultrastructure need to be performed and the results correlated with clinical pulmonary function studies.

AB  - Macrophage-derived cytokines may provoke the inflammatory response in lung injury. Because macrophage influx is a prominent feature of the cellular inflammatory response accompanying the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, we hypothesized that blocking macrophage influx would reduce overall cellular influx and oxidative damage. Newborn rats were exposed at birth to 95% O(2) or air for 1 wk, and hyperoxia-exposed pups were injected with anti-monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) or IgG control on days 3-5. MCP-1 was increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in histological sections from the 95% O(2)-exposed, IgG-injected pups compared with air-exposed controls. At 1 wk, anti-MCP-1-treated pups had reduced leukocyte numbers, both macrophages and neutrophils, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with IgG-treated controls. Cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1, the rat analog of IL-8, was not significantly decreased in lavage fluid but was reduced in lung cells in anti-MCP-1-treated pups. Tissue carbonyls, a measure of protein oxidation, were decreased in anti-MCP-1-treated pups. Anti-MCP-1 treatment prevented neutrophil influx and reduced protein oxidation in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats.

AB  - Chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory processes, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia in mechanically ventilated premature infants. We hypothesized that early expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), would be followed by later expression of the downstream chemokine, Grobeta, in the oxygen-injured newborn lung. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) were used to assess TNFalpha and Grobeta mRNA expression in lung RNA samples from newborn rabbits exposed to > 95% O2 for 8-9 days, followed by 60% O2 for a further 2-4 weeks or from control rabbits exposed to air. Four lung samples per condition were collected every 2 days from day 0 to day 14, and at days 22 and 36. Rabbit alveolar macrophages (AM) stimulated in vitro with bacterial lipopolysaccharide served as positive controls ( n = 8). Grobeta mRNA expression in rabbit lung samples increased with oxygen exposure until day 8, then returned toward baseline levels. This corresponded to previously described elevations in neutrophil number in the lungs. TNFalpha mRNA expression in lung samples was below the limit of detection by RPA and showed no upregulation in hyperoxic lung samples by RT-PCR. TNFalpha activity was assessed in lung lavage ( n = 2 samples per condition per time) using an L929 cell line bioassay and was not increased in hyperoxic animals. The expression of Grobeta mRNA without antecedent or concurrent TNFalpha mRNA expression or activity makes it unlikely that Grobeta in the hyperoxic newborn rabbit lung is elaborated in response to a stimulus by TNFalpha.

AB  - Perioperative management and complications during and after surgery were reviewed in a population of premature infants who received cryotherapy because of threshold retinopathy by retrospective analysis of medical, anaesthetic, and ophthalmologic files. Infants (n=31) who received cryotherapy between January 1, 1996 and January 1, 2001 and were treated during the neonatal period in the unit were included in the study. Cryotherapy was performed under general anesthesia on the neonatal ward. Neonatal and preoperative characteristics of this cohort point to a vulnerable group of infants with a preoperative weight of 1622 g (1519 to 1862 g), bronchopulmonary dysplasia criteria applying in 29 of 31 patients and methylxanthins prescribed in 26 of 31 patients. No single cryotherapy session had to be interrupted because of systemic complications. Still marked cardiorespiratory instability was documented until 36 hours postoperative in 8 patients. Performing surgical procedures on the neonatal ward is a feasible option. Perioperative management in infants who received cryotherapy is used as an illustration of this approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the preterm infant, lung injury can lead to irreversible tissue destruction and abnormal lung development. We examined whether pulmonary trypsin, a potent matrix-degrading serine proteinase and proteinase-cascade activator, is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants., METHODS: Samples of tracheal aspirate fluid were collected from 32 intubated preterm infants during their first 2 postnatal weeks. The presence and molecular forms of trypsin in tracheal aspirate fluid samples were analyzed by zymography and Western blotting. The concentrations of trypsinogen-1 and -2 and tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor were measured by immunofluorometry. For examining the expression of trypsin-2 in lung tissue, immunohistochemistry was performed on autopsy specimens of fetuses, of preterm infants who died from respiratory distress syndrome or BPD, and of term infants without lung injury., RESULTS: In infants who subsequently developed BPD (n = 18), we detected significantly higher concentrations of trypsinogen-2 during postnatal days 5 to 10 compared with those who survived without it. There was no difference in trypsinogen-1 concentrations. Tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor concentrations were significantly lower in infants who needed mechanical ventilation for >1 week. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that trypsin-2 was predominantly expressed in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium. In 2 preterm infants who died from prolonged respiratory distress syndrome, trypsin-2 was also expressed in vascular endothelium., CONCLUSIONS: The levels of trypsinogen-2 are higher during postnatal days 5 to 10 in infants who subsequently develop BPD. The results suggest that high levels of pulmonary trypsin-2 may be associated with the development of BPD. This raises the possibility that therapy with exogenous proteinase inhibitors might prevent the development of BPD in preterm infants with respiratory distress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants born extremely premature (EP) (<28 weeks gestational age) are at high risk of complications, particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which can develop into chronic lung disease (CLD)., METHODS: The burden of respiratory complications in EP infants up to 2 years corrected age (CA) was evaluated using real-world data from the US Medicaid program. Data recorded between 1997 and 2018 on EP infants without major congenital malformations were collected from Medicaid records of six states. EP infants were divided into three cohorts: BPD, CLD, and without BPD or CLD. The incidence of respiratory conditions, respiratory medication use, and healthcare resource utilization were compared between the BPD cohort and CLD cohort versus the cohort without BPD or CLD, using unadjusted and adjusted generalized linear models., RESULTS: A total of 4462 EP infants were identified (17.4% of all premature infants in the database). Of these, BPD and CLD were diagnosed in 61.9% and 72.1%, respectively, and 14.5% were diagnosed with neither BPD nor CLD. Compared with infants without BPD or CLD, infants with BPD or CLD had more complications and a longer length of birth hospitalization stay. Respiratory distress syndrome was the most frequently reported complication (94.6%, 92.5%, and 82.3% of EP infants in the BPD, CLD, and without BPD or CLD cohorts, respectively). After the birth hospitalization, respiratory conditions, respiratory medication use, and incidence rates of rehospitalizations, emergency room visits, and outpatient visits were higher for infants with BPD or CLD. Rehospitalization occurred in 50.5%, 51.6%, and 27.3% of EP infants with BPD, CLD, or without BPD or CLD, respectively; most hospitalizations occurred for respiratory-related reasons., CONCLUSION: In this analysis of a large population of EP infants up to 2 years CA, respiratory conditions were prevalent after the birth hospitalization and were associated with high rates of medication and healthcare resource utilization.

AB  - The risk of central nervous, visual, and auditory damage increases from 2/1000 live births in the normal birthweight to > 200/1000 as birthweight falls below 1500 g. Such babies are most likely to be born preterm. Advances in infant care have led to increasing numbers of very-low-birthweight, preterm infants surviving to school age with moderate to severe brain damage. Steroids are one of the current treatments, but they cause significant, long-term problems. The evidence reported here suggests an additional approach to protecting the very preterm infant by supporting neurovascular membrane integrity. The complications of preterm, very-low-birthweight babies include bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, all of which have a vascular component. Arachidonic acid (AA) and DHA are essential, structural, and functional constituents of cell membranes. They are especially required for the growth and function of the brain and vascular systems, which are the primary biofocus of human fetal growth. Molecular dynamics and experimental evidence suggest that DHA could be the ligand for the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in neural tissue. RXR activation is an obligatory step in signaling to the nucleus and in the regulation of gene expression. Very preterm babies are born with minimal fat stores and suboptimal circulating levels of these nutrients. Postnatally, they lose the biomagnification of the proportions of AA and DHA by the placenta for the fetus. No current nutritional management repairs these deficits. The placental biomagnification profile highlights AA rather than DHA. The resultant fetal FA profile closely resembles that of the vascular endothelium and not the brain. Without this nourishment, cell membrane abnormalities would be predicted. We present a scientific rationale for a common pathogenic process in the complications of prematurity.

AB  - Bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) are elevated in newborns who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In baboon models, anti-BLP blocking antibodies abrogate BPD. We now demonstrate hyperplasia of both neuroendocrine cells and mast cells in lungs of baboons with BPD, compared with non-BPD controls or BLP antibody-treated BPD baboons. To determine whether BLPs are proinflammatory, bombesin was administered intratracheally to mice. Forty-eight hours later, we observed increased numbers of lung mast cells. We analyzed murine mast cells for BLP receptor gene expression, and identified mRNAs encoding bombesin receptor subtype 3 and neuromedin-B receptor (NMB-R), but not gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. Only NMB-R-null mice accumulated fewer lung mast cells after bombesin treatment. Bombesin, gastrin-releasing peptide, NMB, and a bombesin receptor subtype 3-specific ligand induced mast cell proliferation and chemotaxis in vitro. These observations support a role for multiple BLPs in promoting mast cell responses, suggesting a mechanistic link between BLPs and chronic inflammatory lung diseases.

AB  - An increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and proinflammatory chemokines, such as IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP), are found in the airways during early stages of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We determined whether IL-10 produces a dose-related inhibition of proinflammatory chemokine release from stimulated neutrophils of the newborn and whether the mechanism involves the pivotal transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B. PMNs isolated from the cord blood of healthy newborns were stimulated submaximally with either lipopolysaccharide (n = 5) or tumor necrosis factor (n = 4), with and without IL-10 (0.01-1000 ng/mL). IL-8 and MIP release were measured in cell culture supernatants at 18 h. The presence or absence of nuclear factor-kappa B activity and inhibitor-kappa B alpha degradation was measured at 30 min and 3 h after PMN stimulation began. During lipopolysaccharide stimulation, IL-10 significantly reduced IL-8 levels from 50 +/- 16 ng/mL to 7 +/- 3 ng/mL, and MIP levels from 14 +/- 5 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 ng/mL (mean +/- SEM, p < 0.01). IL-10 produced an insignificant reduction in IL-8 and MIP levels after stimulation of PMNs with tumor necrosis factor. IL-10 did not inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B activation and inhibitor-kappa B alpha degradation in PMNs stimulated with tumor necrosis factor or lipopolysaccharide for 30 min. After PMN stimulation for 3 h, inhibitor-kappa B alpha cytoplasmic levels were restored; however, they were unaffected by IL-10. We conclude that IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated release of IL-8 and MIP from neutrophils of the newborn via a mechanism not involving nuclear factor-kappa B activity. Further work is needed to determine whether exogenous IL-10 may be useful for suppressing inflammation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - We used a prematurely born rat/hyperoxia model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to test whether keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) treatment would protect against the development of several serious (cardio-)pulmonary complications of early life exposure to hyperoxia. KGF significantly protected against hyperoxic lethality (13-day survival rate = 50/64 (78%) for the O(2)-KGF vs. 29/66 (44%) for the O(2)-saline group, p < 0.001). Although KGF failed to protect against hyperoxic inhibition of normal postnatal alveoli formation and early pulmonary fibrosis, KGF consistently had a significant protective/preventive effect against the development of pulmonary hypertension during hyperoxia as reflected in comparative right ventricular hypertrophy: mean increase = +35% above normal for the O(2)-saline group vs. +3% for the O(2)-KGF premature rat group (p < 0.01).

AB  - Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are peptide growth factors (PGF) mediating normal lung development, maturation, injury, and repair. These PGF may therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesized that elevated levels of these PGF in tracheal aspirates would be associated with a) BPD and/or death; b) markers of cell injury and apoptosis; and c) chorioamnionitis, a risk factor for BPD. Tracheal aspirates collected in 29 preterm (<34 wk gestation, 500-2000 g birth weight), mechanically ventilated infants on d 1 of life were assayed for PGF and histone-associated DNA fragments by ELISA and for LDH by enzyme assay. Clinical and pathologic examination was performed for chorioamnionitis. BPD was defined as oxygen requirement/mechanical ventilation at 28 d postnatal age. The birth weight (mean +/- SE) was 1009 +/- 85 g and median gestational age was 26 wk (range, 22-33). Eighteen infants died or developed BPD. bFGF levels were elevated in infants who died or developed BPD [median (25%,75%) level of 36 (23, 44) pg/mL versus 14 (6, 30) in the survivors without BPD, p = 0.01]. bFGF levels correlated with apoptosis (r = 0.73, p < 0.001) and LDH levels (r = 0.59, p < 0.001). VEGF and ET-1 levels were not associated with apoptosis or with BPD/death. PGF levels were not associated with chorioamnionitis. We conclude that elevated bFGF levels in the preterm trachea correlate with BPD/death and markers of cell injury and apoptosis but not with chorioamnionitis. We speculate that bFGF may play a role in the development of BPD.

AB  - Antenatal betamethasone (Beta) is widely used in women with asymptomatic chorioamnionitis at risk for preterm delivery, but its effects on fetal inflammation are unstudied. Groups of ewes at 109 +/- 1 days of gestation received the following treatments: intra-amniotic (IA) saline (control), 0.5 mg/kg intramuscular Beta, 10 mg IA endotoxin (Endo), and Beta + 2 h later Endo (Beta + Endo). Beta suppressed Endo-induced lung inflammation at 1 day. However, compared with Endo 5 days after treatment, Beta + Endo lambs had increased alveolar neutrophils, proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression, and serum amyloid A3 (SAA3) mRNA expression. IL-1beta mRNA expression was localized to the inflammatory cells, whereas SAA3 mRNA expression was induced in the bronchial epithelium and the inflammatory cells. Compared with Endo, Beta + Endo lambs had increased lung inflammation but equivalent lung volumes 15 days after treatment. The late increase in inflammation in the Beta + Endo animals suggests that glucocorticoids impair the ability of the preterm lung to downregulate Endo-induced inflammation after fetal clearance of the glucocorticoids. These results have implications for lung inflammation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis and maternal glucocorticoids.

AB  - Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) is expressed abundantly within the conducting airway epithelium and is thought to have immunoregulatory functions. Differences in the localization of CCSP between mouse and human airways led us to hypothesize that functional homologues of CCSP may compensate for the lack of CCSP expression in proximal airway locations. We previously identified an expressed sequence tag (W82219) whose expression is induced within Clara cells of CCSP knockout mice. Expressed sequence tag W82219 is distantly related to CCSP and represents a member of a new subfamily of secretoglobins (MmSCGB3A2). Another member of the mouse SCGB3 family (MmSCGB3A1) as well as human orthologues (HsSCGB3A1 and HsSCGB3A2) that possess structural homology to CCSP were identified, suggesting they may share common functional properties. SCGB3A1 messenger RNA localizes to a subset of SCGB3A2-expressing cells within bronchi of both mouse and neonatal human lungs. CCSP, SCGB3A1, and SCGB3A2 were decreased in airways of neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in mice after airway injury. We conclude that secretory cells of the conducting airway epithelium express distinct members of the secretoglobin family in a partially overlapping fashion. Altered expression of secretoglobins in airway disease may contribute to immunoregulatory perturbations commonly seen in chronic airway disease.

AB  - Increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) content is characteristic of infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity/bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oxygen therapy, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and immature antioxidant defenses are major risk factors in chronic lung disease of prematurity/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but their interrelationship is unclear. The direct effects of raised Po2 and modulation of ROS were examined on proliferation of cultured fetal human ASM cells. A bell-shaped relationship was found between Po2 and DNA synthesis induced by fetal bovine serum, platelet-derived growth factor, and basic fibroblastic growth factor, with peak responses occurring at 10-kPa Po2. Changes in DNA synthesis by Po2 did not occur in the absence of mitogen. ROS generation, estimated by dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation, was increased by mitogens but was unaffected by nonmitogens (bradykinin, histamine). There was an inverse relationship between ROS generation and Po2, and mitogen-induced ROS generation was substantially potentiated as the Po2 fell. H2O2 mimicked the effect of Po2 on fetal bovine serum-stimulated proliferation, whereas treatment with antioxidants (GSH, N-acetylcysteine) reduced it. These data demonstrate that increases in Po2 above levels found in utero modulate proliferation of fetal ASM cells but only in the presence of growth factors. They also strongly suggest that, under these conditions, proliferation is mediated in part by generation of ROS.

AB  - Ureaplasma urealyticum respiratory tract colonization in preterm infants has been associated with a high incidence of pneumonia and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, study of this human pathogen has been hampered by the absence of animal models. We have developed the first juvenile mouse model of Ureaplasma pneumonia and characterized the histopathology during the month following inoculation. C3H/HeN mice were inoculated intratracheally with a mouse-adapted clinical Ureaplasma isolate (biovar 2) or sham inoculated with 10B broth. Culture of lung homogenates and PCR of DNA from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) confirmed the presence of Ureaplasma in 100% of inoculated animals at 1 day, 60% at 2 days, 50% at 3 days, and 25% at 7 and 14 days. Ureaplasma was undetectable 28 days postinoculation. There were marked changes in BAL and interstitial-cell composition with increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes 1 to 2 days and 14 days postinoculation and macrophages at 2 and 14 days postinoculation. The Ureaplasma infection caused a persistent focal loss of airway ciliated epithelium and a mild increase in interstitial cellularity. There were no differences in BAL protein concentration during the first 28 days, suggesting that pulmonary vascular endothelial barrier integrity remained intact. Comparison of BAL cytokine and chemokine concentrations revealed low levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) at 3 days and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 at 7 days in Ureaplasma-infected mice but a trend toward increased TNF-alpha at 14 days and increased granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-10 at 28 days. These data suggest that Ureaplasma alone may cause limited inflammation and minimal tissue injury in the early phase of infection but may promote a mild chronic inflammatory response in the later phase of infection (days 14 to 28), similar to the process that occurs in human newborns.

AB  - A heparin-binding growth factor, midkine, is the product of a retinoic acid-responsive gene. Since retinol plays critical roles in lung development and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and midkine has been implicated in the maturation of lung explants and in cytoprotection, we herein examined midkine expression during postnatal development of the lungs and hyperoxic lung injury. Midkine protein transiently increased to a maximum level at around 4 days postnatal. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the amounts of midkine increased in resident alveolar cells, but not in smooth muscle cells or the large airway epithelium. If neonatal mice were exposed to >95% oxygen, lung development was impaired and midkine expression was suppressed. In contrast, when adult mouse lungs as well as in vitro cultured lung adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to hyperoxia, midkine expression was not affected. Furthermore, a pronounced induction of midkine by retinoic acid was observed in neonatal lungs. The results indicate that midkine expression is associated with postnatal lung development, but not necessarily with hyperoxic cell damage.

AB  - Alteration of gut microbiota can affect chronic lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, through abnormal immune and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown a feasible connection between gut microbiota and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. However, whether BPD can be ameliorated by restoring the gut microbiota remains unclear. In preterm infants with BPD, we found variance in the diversity and structure of gut microbiota. Similarly, BPD rats showed gut dysbiosis, characterized by a deficiency of Lactobacillus, which was abundant in normal rats. We therefore explored the effect and potential mechanism of action of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum L168, in improving BPD. The BPD rats were treated with L. plantarum L168 by gavage for 2 weeks, and the effect was evaluated by lung histopathology, lung function, and serum inflammatory markers. Subsequently, we observed reduced lung injury and improved lung development in BPD rats exposed to L. plantarum L168. Further evaluation revealed that L. plantarum L168 improved intestinal permeability in BPD rats. Serum metabolomics showed altered inflammation-associated metabolites following L. plantarum L168 intervention, notably a marked increase in anti-inflammatory metabolites. In agreement with the metabolites analysis, RNA-seq analysis of the intestine and lung showed that inflammation and immune-related genes were down-regulated. Based on the information from RNA-seq, we validated that L. plantarum L168 might improve BPD relating to down-regulation of TLR4 /NF-kappaB /CCL4 pathway. Together, our findings suggest the potential of L. plantarum L168 to provide probiotic-based therapeutic strategies for BPD. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease in premature infants, and its pathogenesis has not been clarified. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have important functions in cell bioactivity. However, their role in developmental lung disease remains unclear., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of lncRNA SNHG6 (SNHG6) in BPD and its underlying mechanisms., METHODS: The blood of patients with BPD were collected, and BPD model of BEAS-2B cells was established by hyperoxia method. SNHG6, miR-335 and KLF5 mRNA expression were detected by RT-qPCR. Western blot was conducted to measure the levels of apoptosis-related proteins' expression and NF-kappaB pathway related proteins. BEAS-2B cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Assay Kit was applied to detect ROS, MDA and SOD levels, respectively. ELISA was performed to assess the levels of inflammatory factors. The binding site of miR-335 with SNHG6 or KLF5 were predicted by using DIANA or TargetScan, and which was verified by double luciferase reporter assay., RESULTS: Firstly, SNHG6 was highly expressed and miR-335 was lowly expressed in BPD model, SNHG6 knockdown and miR-335 mimics both alleviated hyperoxia-induced lung cell injury, and SNHG6 targeted miR-335. Subsequently, KLF5 was targeted by miR-335, and KLF5 promoted lung cell injury via activating NF-kappaB pathway. Furthermore, SNHG6 mediated lung cell injury via regulating the miR-335/KLF5/NF-kappaB pathway., CONCLUSION: Our research confirmed that SNHG6 mediated hyperoxia-induced lung cell injury via regulating the miR-335/KLF5/NF-kappaB pathway. These findings suggest that SNHG6 serves as promising targets for the treatment of newborns with BPD. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the doses of dexamethasone (DEX), betamethasone (BET), and hydrocortisone (HC) that effectively inhibit the release of two potent proinflammatory chemokines, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein alpha (MIP), from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) of the newborn. Human PMNs were isolated from cord blood (n = 18). Chemokines were measured from PMN cell culture supernatants after 18 h of stimulation using tumor necrosis factor (1 ng/ml), with and without pretreatment by DEX (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) versus HC or BET (10(-10) to 10(-5) M). Maximal inhibitions of IL-8 release by BET, DEX, and HC were 97, 91, and 91%, respectively. For MIP, the maximal inhibitions by BET, DEX, and HC were 88, 69, and 70%, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentrations by DEX, BET, and HC for IL-8 release were 3.4 +/- (SE) 1.6 x 10(-9), 1.8 +/- 7.4 x 10(-8), and 1.8 +/- 0.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentrations by DEX, BET, and HC for MIP release were 1.0 +/- (SE) 0.5 x 10(-8), 3.8 +/- 3.1 x 10(-8), and 4.8 +/- 1.6 x 10(-7) M, respectively. In vitro, these corticosteroids effectively inhibited the release of two structurally different chemokines that are found in the airway lavage fluids of infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. When compared to plasma DEX levels previously reported during the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, our results suggest that the doses of DEX, and potentially BET, needed to treat chronic lung disease may be more than five to ten times lower than those of current DEX regimens.

AB  - Chorioamnionitis is frequent in preterm labor and increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that intra-amniotic endotoxin injures the lung in utero, causing a sequence of inflammation and tissue injury similar to that which occurs in the injured adult lung. Preterm lamb lungs at 125 days gestational age were evaluated for indicators of inflammation, injury, and repair 5 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days after 4 mg of intra-amniotic endotoxin injection. At 5 h, the epithelial cells in large airways expressed heat shock protein 70, and alveolar interleukin-8 was increased. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) decreased in alveolar type II cells at 5 h, and SP-B in lung tissue and alveolar lavage fluid increased by 72 h. By 24 h, neutrophils were recruited into the large airways, and cell death was the highest. Alveolar type II cells decreased by 25% at 24 h, and proliferation was highest at 72 h, consistent with tissue remodeling. Intra-amniotic endotoxin caused surfactant secretion, inflammation, cell death, and remodeling as indications of lung injury. The recovery phase was accompanied by maturational changes in the fetal lung.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in paediatric intensive care have reduced mortality but, unfortunately, one of the consequences is an increase in the number of patients with chronic diseases. It is generally agreed that home care of children requiring ventilatory support improves their outcomes and results in cost saving for the National Health Service., METHODS: Since 1985, the Children's Hospital Bambino Gesu of Rome has developed a program of paediatric home care. The program is performed by a committed Home Health Care Team (HHCT) which selects the eligible patients for home care and trains the families to treat their child. During the period January 1985 to January 2001, 53 children with chronic respiratory failure were included in the home care program. Of these, seven patients were successively excluded and six died in our intensive care unit (ICU), while one still lives in our ICU since 1997. The results obtained in the remaining 46 children are reported., RESULTS: The pathologies consisted of disorders of respiratory control related to brain damage (26%), upper airways obstructive disease (26%), spinal muscular atrophy (22%), myopathies and muscular dystrophies (6.5%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (6.5%), tracheomalacia (6.5%), central hypoventilation syndrome (4.3%) and progressive congenital scoliosis (2.2%). Of these 46 patients, 34 children are mechanically ventilated and the median of their ICU stay was 109.5 days (range 54-214 days), while the remaining 12 children were breathing spontaneously and the median of their ICU stay was 90.5 days (range 61-134 days). We temporarily readmitted six patients to our ICU to perform scheduled otolaryngological surgery, eight patients for acute respiratory infections and two patients for deterioration of their neurological status due to high pressure hydrocephalus for placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt; these 16 patients were discharged back home again. Two other patients were readmitted for deterioration of their chronic disease and died in our ICU, while seven patients died at home., CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-seven children are still alive at home and four of them improved their respiratory condition so that it was possible to remove the tracheostomy tube. Our oldest patient has now achieved 15 years of mechanical ventilation at home.

AB  - Proper formation of the pulmonary microvasculature is essential for normal lung development and gas exchange. Lung microvascular development may be disrupted by chronic injury of developing lungs in clinical diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We examined microvascular development, angiogenic growth factors, and endothelial cell receptors in a fetal baboon model of chronic lung disease (CLD). In the last third of gestation, the endothelial cell marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 increased 7.5-fold, and capillaries immunostained for PECAM-1 changed from a central location in airspace septa to a subepithelial location. In premature animals delivered at 67% of term and supported with oxygen and ventilation for 14 days, PECAM-1 protein and capillary density did not increase, suggesting failure to expand the capillary network. The capillaries of the CLD animals were dysmorphic and not subepithelial. The angiogenic growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (Flt-1) were significantly decreased in CLD. Angiopoietin-1, another angiogenic growth factor, and its receptor tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains were not significantly changed. These data suggest that CLD impairs lung microvascular development and that a possible mechanism is disruption of VEGF and Flt-1 expression.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease first described in 1967 as a complication of therapy for premature infants with hyaline membrane disease, and treatment with high concentrations of oxygen was thought to be a major contributor to its development. Thus, interventions to enhance lung antioxidants to prevent the development of BPD were considered appropriate therapeutic strategies. In the last decades, advances in the acute care of premature infants has reduced the reliance on therapy with high concentrations of supplemental oxygen. However, the incidence of BPD has not changed significantly. The changing clinical context in which BPD develops begs the question of whether oxidation is important in the development of BPD and, therefore, whether designing interventions enhancing lung antioxidants is still warranted. This review presents evidence that premature infants that will develop BPD have qualitative and quantitative differences in oxidation of lipids and proteins when compared to infants that do not develop BPD. Such differences in oxidation patterns are the most obvious in the first few days of life. The emerging evidence thus supports the concept that the lung injury process leading to the development of BPD occurs within hours to days of delivery and that oxidation is a major contributor to this pathological process. Unfortunately, early attempts at delivery of antioxidants to the lung have not been successful, perhaps because of an inability to deliver antioxidants in a timely manner to the areas in the lung in which deleterious oxidations are occurring. Further research is necessary to determine both the nature and the location of the oxidative events that lead to the development of early lung injury, so that more appropriate and specific antioxidant interventions can be designed.

AB  - Ex-premature infants, before 45 weeks postconceptional age, are at high-risk of apnoea after surgery. General anaesthesia increases the risk of apnoea. We evaluated the tolerance and the efficiency of caudal anaesthesia performed in 25 consecutive conscious ex-premature infants for inguinal herniotomies. N2O/O2 and EMLA cream are used to facilitate caudal puncture. Anaesthesia procedure, patient comfort and complications following the 24 postoperative hours were studied. We report good anaesthesia conditions without compromising the baby's comfort and few perioperative complications. Only two infants with a prior history of apnoea or bronchopulmonary dysplasia had apnoea during and after surgery. A total spinal anaesthesia was the major complication in one infant and prolonged surgery requiring general anaesthesia was the main limitation of this technique in another child. The principal advantage of the procedure is to facilitate and simplify the postoperative management of the babies. The anaesthetic technique does not alter surgical conditions. Caudal epidural anaesthesia performed in awake high-risk preterm infants is beneficial for these infants but requires experienced operators.

AB  - Hereditary surfactant protein B (SP-B) deficiency is an uncommon autosomal recessive lung disorder that causes hypoxemic respiratory failure in mature, morphologically normal infants. Recognition and diagnosis of this condition is of paramount importance, as it has significant implications for future pregnancies with a recurrence risk of 25%. In a family with three neonatal deaths over 20 years, SP-B deficiency was diagnosed following the death of the fourth affected infant. Previous deaths were mistakenly attributed to hyaline membrane disease (HMD), congenital Mycoplasma hominis infection, and pulmonary hypertension, however, following the diagnosis in the proposita, SP-B deficiency was also confirmed in her deceased siblings by immunohistochemical staining of autopsy specimens. This case highlights the presentation, postnatal course, diagnosis, and therapeutic options of SP-B deficiency in addition to the mode of inheritance and the possibility of antenatal diagnosis. Genetic consultation is imperative in the investigations of recurrent neonatal deaths, especially in cases of remote events. The recent enormous advances in human genetics have shown that many conditions previously ascribed to environmental agents have a genetic basis.

AB  - Subclinical genital tract infection has been clearly established as a significant cause of spontaneous preterm birth, particularly in early gestations. Bacterial vaginosis organisms rank highly among the pathogens involved in preterm labour and there is considerable beneficial evidence from the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women at high risk of preterm birth. The pathogenesis involves activation of macrophages and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is seen in the most immature of survivors and appears to be secondary to interruption of normal development and maturation of the lungs. The link between chorioamnionitis and lung injury in utero and subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has now been substantiated. Exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines is implicated in the impairment of the fetal lung. A significant body of evidence supports the association between chorioamnionitis, periventricular leukomalacia and cerebral palsy. Biological mechanisms that explain the association between chorioamnionitis and fetal brain injury involve pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarity in the pattern of expression of cytokines suggests a common pathway for the initiation of preterm labour and also injury to the lung and the central nervous system of the fetus.

AB  - Chronic lung disease of early infancy, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is a frequent complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation after premature birth. Pulmonary hypertension and edema are common features of this condition, which is often attributed to long-term, repetitive overinflation of incompletely developed lungs. The overall objective of this work was to examine the effects on the pulmonary circulation and lung fluid balance of different ventilation strategies using large versus small inflation volumes in an animal model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We studied 16 newborn lambs that were delivered prematurely (124+/-3 d gestation, term = 147 d) by cesarean section and mechanically ventilated for 3 to 4 wk. Ten lambs were ventilated at 20 breaths/min, yielding a tidal volume of 15+/-5 mL/kg, and six lambs were ventilated at 60 breaths/min, yielding a tidal volume of 6+/-2 mL/kg. All lambs received surfactant at birth and had subsequent surgery for closure of the ductus arteriosus and catheter placement to allow serial measurements of pulmonary vascular resistance and lung lymph flow. Chronic lung injury, documented by serial chest radiographs and postmortem pathologic examination, developed in all lambs irrespective of the pattern of assisted ventilation. Pulmonary vascular resistance, which normally decreases during the month after birth at term, did not change significantly from the first to the last week of study. Lung lymph flow, an index of net transvascular fluid filtration, increased with time in lambs that were ventilated at 20 breaths/min, but not in lambs ventilated at 60 breaths/min. Lymph protein concentration decreased with time, indicative of increased fluid filtration pressure, without evidence of a change in lung vascular protein permeability. Postmortem studies showed interstitial lung edema, increased pulmonary arteriolar smooth muscle and elastin, decreased numbers of small pulmonary arteries and veins, and decreased capillary surface density in distal lung of chronically ventilated lambs compared with control lambs that were killed either 1 d (same postconceptional age) or 3 wk (same postnatal age) after birth at term. Thus, chronic lung injury from prolonged mechanical ventilation after premature birth inhibits the normal postnatal decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and leads to lung edema from increased fluid filtration pressure. These abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation may contribute to the abnormal respiratory gas exchange that often exists in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cathelicidin/LL-37 plays a significant role in the human immune defense reaction. Preterm human immature organs being exposed to inflammation-induced injury was the critical denominator leading to the common preterm associated complications. Previous study showed LL37 concentration in preterm neonates was lower in tracheal aspirates and breast milk as compared to term infants. An adults study showed decreased LL-37 levels was a risk factor for patients in developing severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, little is known about the regulation of human cord blood LL37 in preterm neonates and the association with preterm complications. This study was designed to investigate the concentration of LL37 in cord blood of preterm infants and correlation with preterm complications., METHODS: Singleton infants born in June 2017 to August 2021 in the study hospital were enrolled. Maternal and neonatal clinical characteristics were collected. LL37 levels, pro-inflammatory factor interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in cord blood and LL37 levels in serum 48-72 hours after birth were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum level of LL37 in preterm and term neonates were compared, the perinatal factors possibly affecting the LL37 levels were investigated and the relationship between LL37 level and preterm outcomes were analyzed., RESULTS: Cord blood LL37 levels in preterm infants were lower than that in term neonates. Cord blood LL37 level was positively correlated with gestational age in preterm. Prenatal steroid administration in preterm neonates decreased cord blood LL37 level. LL37 level was obviously lower in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Multiple line regression analysis showed higher LL37 level in cord blood was an independent protective factor for BPD. The concentration of pro-inflammatory factor IL-6 was negatively correlated with LL37., CONCLUSION: Cord blood LL37 levels increased during gestation and decreased after perinatal steroid usage. Very preterm infants who displayed higher cord blood LL37 level had reduced risk of developing BPD. Regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 may be associated with the protective effect of LL37 on BPD. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether infants with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) superimposed on immature lung disease (ILD) have more abnormal lung function and respiratory drive during the evolution of chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD) in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW; <1000 g)., METHODS: We measured lung mechanics (respiratory frequency, tidal volume, minute ventilation, lung resistance, lung compliance, lung impedance, and work of breathing per minute) and respiratory drive (airway opening pressure 100 milliseconds after initiation of breath [P(0.1)] and maximal inspiratory pressure generated during airway occlusion) on 3 occasions before term in 24 ELBW infants., RESULTS: Ten infants with ILD (mean [95% CI] gestation: 24.3 weeks [23.1,25.4]; birth weight: 675 g [553,798]) were studied at 27, 31, and 35 weeks of postconceptional age and 14 infants with HMD superimposed on ILD (gestation: 25.1 weeks [24.4,25.9]; birth weight: 687 g [601,773]) were studied at 28, 32, and 35 weeks of postconceptional age. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for respiratory frequency, tidal volume, minute ventilation, lung resistance, lung compliance, lung impedance, work of breathing per minute, P(0.1), and maximal inspiratory pressure generated during airway occlusion. With increasing age, both groups demonstrated increased respiratory drive as measured by P(0.1) without significant changes in respiratory frequency or CO(2). Work of breathing per minute increased in the HMD group with age and was higher in extubated subjects. A similar trend with age was demonstrated in ILD infants. Regardless of whether the initial lung disease was ILD alone or HMD + ILD, ELBW infants developed a mildly reduced lung compliance/kg (.8-1.1 mL/cm.H(2)O/kg) and high lung resistance (75-125 cm.H(2)O/L/second) pattern of CNLD, which changed little after 3 weeks of age. Survival to 6 months was 23/24 (96%). Oxygen dependency was 16/24 (67%) at 35 weeks, yet only 5/23 (22%) survivors required oxygen at discharge from the neonatal unit (43 weeks)., CONCLUSIONS: The visco-elastic and flow-resistive properties of the lungs in ELBW infants with CNLD remain only mildly abnormal, suggesting a more favorable prognosis for lung function in later years than previously reported.

AB  - Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) therapy is currently used clinically to selectively dilate the pulmonary vasculature and to help treat persistent pulmonary hypertension and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the neonate. However, in the presence of oxygen or superoxide, nitric oxide forms potentially harmful reactive nitrogen species. Using an experimental mice model, we examined the effects of concurrent hyperoxia and INO on protein tyrosine nitration and cysteine S-nitrosylation in pulmonary tissue. Data showed enhanced 3-nitrotyrosine staining within the airway epithelium and alveolar interstitium of mice lungs treated with hyperoxia, which did not increase significantly with INO administration. Within the alveolar interstitium, 3-nitrotyrosine staining was localized to macrophages. S-Nitrosocysteine staining in airway epithelium was significantly enhanced with INO administration regardless of oxygen content. These data suggest that the formation of protein S-nitrosocysteine is the major protein modification during administration of INO.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR)-associated factors 1 and 2 (TRAF1 and TRAF2) and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins cIAP1 (MIHB) and cIAP2 (MIHC) were recently identified as proteins that associate with the TNF-alpha receptors TNFRI (p55) and TNFRII (p75) and inhibit TNF-alpha-induced programmed cell death or apoptosis. In the original reports, TRAF1 expression, unlike the ubiquitous TRAF2, was restricted to specific tissues in the lung, spleen, and testis. TNF-alpha is increased in the lung in many forms of pulmonary disease. In the current study, Western analysis, immunohistochemistry, and ribonuclease protection assays were used to determine whether TNF-alpha regulates the expression of these TNFR-associated proteins in lung cells. We demonstrate for the first time TNF-alpha dose-dependent induction of TRAF1 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) in human H441 and A549 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines, as well as in lung cells of C57BL/6J mice after intratracheal administration of TNF-alpha. In contrast to the epithelial cells, TRAF1 was not induced by TNF-alpha in U937 cells, a human monocytic cell line, suggesting cell type-specific regulation. Similarly, cIAP2 mRNA was induced by TNF-alpha in both H441 and A549 pulmonary epithelial cells but not in U937 cells. TNF-alpha is a primary mediator of acute pulmonary inflammation and contributes to the pathophysiology of chronic lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a fibrotic disease of prematurely born infants. Immunohistochemical staining of human neonatal lung tissue demonstrated increased TRAF1 in lungs of infants dying of pneumonia or BPD in comparison with those dying of congenital malformation. These studies support the hypothesis that the TRAF1 and cIAP2 genes are highly regulated in pulmonary cells and may play a role in human lung disease.

AB  - Surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) are believed to participate in the pulmonary host defense and the response to lung injury. In order to understand the effects of prematurity and lung injury on these proteins, we measured the amounts of SP-A and SP-D and their mRNAs in three groups of animals: (1) nonventilated premature baboon fetuses; (2) neonatal baboons delivered prematurely at 140 d gestation age (ga) and ventilated with PRN O(2); (3) animals of the same age ventilated with 100% O(2) to induce chronic lung injury. In nonventilated fetuses, tissue and lavage SP-A were barely detectable in baboons of 125 and 140 d ga, but they equaled or exceeded adult SP-A concentrations (g/g lung dry wt) at 175 d (term gestation, 185 d). In contrast, SP-D was readily detectable in tissue and lavage at 125 and 140 d ga. When the baboons of 140 d ga were ventilated for 10 d with 100% oxygen to produce chronic lung injury, the tissue concentration of SP-A was five times greater than that of normal adults; SP-D 16-times greater. Despite the sizable tissue pools of SP-A and SP-D, however, lavage SP-A was only 7% of that of normal adults and lavage SP-D just equaled the amount in normal adults. Nevertheless, because SP-D is normally in much lower concentration than is SP-A, their total comprised less than 12% of the SP-A and SP-D found in the lavage of a healthy adult. The results indicate that in chronic lung injury, SP-A is significantly reduced in the alveolar space. SP-D concentration in lavage is about equal to that in normal adults, possibly because of the 16-fold excess in tissue, but the total collectin pool in lavage is still significantly reduced. Because these collectins may bind and opsonize bacteria and viruses, decrements in their amounts may present additional risk to those premature infants who require prolonged periods of ventilatory support.

AB  - Excessive transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling has been implicated in pulmonary hypoplasia associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease of human prematurity featuring pulmonary fibrosis. This implies that inhibitors of TGF-beta could be useful therapeutic agents. Because exogenous TGF-beta ligands are known to inhibit lung branching morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation in mouse embryonic lungs in ex vivo culture, we examined the capacity of a naturally occurring inhibitor of TGF-beta activity, the proteoglycan decorin, to overcome the inhibitory effects of exogenous TGF-beta. Intratracheal microinjection of a recombinant adenovirus containing decorin cDNA resulted in overexpression of the exogenous decorin gene in airway epithelium. Although exogenous TGF-beta efficiently decreased epithelial lung branching morphogenesis in control cultures, TGF-beta-induced inhibition of lung growth was abolished after epithelial transfer of the decorin gene. Additionally, exogenous TGF-beta-induced antiproliferative effects as well as the downregulation of surfactant protein C were abrogated by decorin in cultured embryonic lungs. Moreover, lung branching inhibition by TGF-beta could be restored by the addition of decorin antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in culture, indicating that decorin is both specifically and directly involved in suppressing TGF-beta-mediated negative regulation of lung morphogenesis. Our findings suggest that decorin can antagonize bioactive TGF-beta during lung growth and differentiation, establishing the rationale for decorin as a candidate therapeutic approach to ameliorate excessive levels of TGF-beta signaling in the developing lung.

AB  - Complementary molecular and genetic approaches are yielding information about gain- versus loss-of-function phenotypes of specific genes and gene families in the embryonic, fetal, neonatal, and adult lungs. New insights are being derived from the conservation of function between genes regulating branching morphogenesis of the respiratory organs in Drosophila and in the mammalian lung. The function of specific morphogenetic genes in the lung are now placed in context with pattern-forming functions in other, better understood morphogenetic fields such as the limb bud. Initiation of lung morphogenesis from the floor of the primitive foregut requires coordinated transcriptional activation and repression involving hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta, Sonic hedgehog, patched, Gli2, and Gli3 as well as Nkx2.1. Subsequent inductive events require epithelial-mesenchymal interaction mediated by specific fibroblast growth factor ligand-receptor signaling as well as modulation by other peptide growth factors including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-A and transforming growth factor-beta and by extracellular matrix components. A scientific rationale for developing new therapeutic approaches to urgent questions of human pulmonary health such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia is beginning to emerge from work in this field.

AB  - Although hyperoxic exposure is an important contributor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the pulmonary response to oxygen, the role of NO in mediating chronic neonatal lung injury is unclear. Therefore, rat pups were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (>95% O2) from d 21 to 29. After the rats were killed, their lungs were removed for analysis of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression, NO activity as measured by 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) assay, and lung pathology. Hyperoxia caused 5-fold and 2-fold increases in inducible (i) NOS and endothelial (e) NOS levels, respectively. NO activity was assessed by measuring cGMP levels after normoxic or hyperoxic exposure in the presence and absence of NOS blockade with either aminoguanidine (AG) or Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA). cGMP levels were elevated in hyperoxic versus normoxic rats (287+/-15 versus 106+/-9 pmol/mg protein, respectively, p < 0.001), and this increase in cGMP was attenuated after NOS blockade with either AG or L-NNA. Hyperoxic exposure significantly increased lung/body weight ratios and induced histologic changes of interstitial and alveolar edema; however, these hyperoxia-induced histologic changes were not altered by NOS blockade with AG or L-NNA. We conclude that hyperoxic exposure of rat pups up-regulated both iNOS and eNOS and increased NO activity as measured by cGMP levels derived from both iNOS and eNOS. Blockade of NOS reduced cGMP levels in the hyperoxic rat pups; however, it did not seem to reverse the pathologic consequences of hyperoxic exposure.

AB  - We investigated the effects of gestational age and oxygen exposure on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in distal fetal lung tissue in primate models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. During the final third of fetal life, lung coppper-zinc SOD (Cu,ZnSOD) specific activity decreased, whereas lung manganese SOD (MnSOD) specific activity tended to increase. In the premature newborn (140 days, 78% of term gestation), lung total SOD and Cu,ZnSOD specific activities decreased after 6-10 days of ventilation with as needed [pro re nada (PRN)] or 100% oxygen compared with fetal control animals. Neither Cu,ZnSOD mRNA nor protein expression changed after either oxygen exposure at this gestation (140 days) relative to fetal control animals. At this age (6-10 days), lung MnSOD specific activity did not change in oxygen-exposed relative to fetal control animals, even though lung expression of MnSOD mRNA and protein increased after PRN or 100% oxygen exposure. In the very premature 125-day newborn (69% of term), lung Cu,ZnSOD specific activity and protein decreased, whereas Cu,ZnSOD mRNA increased, after 6-10 days of ventilation with PRN oxygen compared with fetal control animals. In fetal lung explants, hyperoxia also decreased expression of SOD activity acutely (16-h exposure, 125 and 140 days gestation). To conclude, expression of SOD activity in the premature primate lung did not increase in response to elevated oxygen tension, apparently due to effects occurring subsequent to the expression of these mRNAs.

AB  - Depletion of glutathione, a key antioxidant, accelerates lung injury. Glutathione concentrations are reduced significantly in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome, leaving them at greater risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. A study was designed to verify if the increased glutathione synthetic activity observed in oxygen-dependent and ventilated newborn infants was caused by their postsurgical state. Our objective was to evaluate the role of a general surgical procedure as a factor affecting lung glutathione. One-day-old guinea pig pups, a well characterized animal model for the study of neonatal lung disease, were divided between those undergoing a standardized surgical procedure and those that did not. The pups were fed by their mother. After 4 days the lungs were sampled to determine total glutathione content, activities of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, glutathione peroxidase, and reductase as well as the glutathione synthetic activity. The surgical procedure was associated with a specific stimulatory effect limited to glutathione synthetic activity (p < 0.02) leading to an increased (p < 0.02) pulmonary glutathione content. Glutathione concentration was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.67) with the synthetic activity. We concluded that in this animal model an invasive procedure such as a general surgical procedure affects lung glutathione metabolism in a fashion similar to that of hyperoxia. In the lungs, the synthetic activity is a stronger determinant of glutathione concentrations than the activities of the other enzymes involved in maintaining glutathione levels.

AB  - Ventilated preterm infants prone to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have been shown to have increased inflammatory mediators in their tracheal aspirates. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is thought to be less traumatic than intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) in premature infants with surfactant deficiency, and therefore may reduce the inflammatory response in tracheobronchial aspirates. We randomized 76 premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation (birth weight 420-1830 g, median 840 g, gestational age 23 3/7 to 29 2/7 wk, median 26 4/7 to receive either an IPPV with a high rate (60-80/min) and low peak pressures, or an HFOV aiming at an optimization of lung volume, within 1 h of intubation. Tracheal aspirates were systematically collected during the first 10 d of life and analyzed for albumin, IL-8, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and the secretory component (SC) for IgA as a reference protein. Bacterially colonized samples were excluded. On the treatment d 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10, the resulting median values of albumin (milligrams/mg of SC) were 28, 23, 24, 18, and 10, in IPPV-ventilated infants, and 33, 28, 18, 25, and 39 in HFOV-ventilated infants, respectively. Median IL-8 values (nanograms/mg of SC) were 671, 736, 705, 1362, and 1879 (IPPV) and 874, 1713, 1029, 1426, and 1823 (HFOV), respectively, and median LTB4 values (nanograms/mg of SC) were 26, 13, 27, 22, and 11 (IPPV) and 15, 12, 7, 12, and 16 (HFOV), respectively. Values were similar in IPPV- and HFOV-ventilated infants, and no significant differences were noted. We conclude that HFOV, when compared with a high rate low pressure IPPV, does not reduce concentrations of albumin, IL-8, and LTB4 in tracheal aspirates of preterm infants requiring mechanical ventilation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) represents a multifactorial chronic pulmonary pathology and a major factor causing premature illness and death. The therapeutic role of exosomes in BPD has been feverishly investigated. Meanwhile, the potential roles of exosomal circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in umbilical cord blood (UCB) serum have not been studied. This study aimed to detect the expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs in UCB-derived exosomes of infants with BPD. Microarray analysis was performed to compare the RNA profiles of UCB-derived exosomes of a preterm newborn with (BPD group) and without (non-BPD, NBPD group) BPD. Then, circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression networks were built to determine their association with BPD. In addition, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta in LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells and HUVECs were assessed through Western blot analysis. Then, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay was used to evaluate the expression levels of four differentially expressed circRNAs (hsa_circ_0086913, hsa_circ_0049170, hsa_circ_0087059, and hsa_circ_0065188) and two lncRNAs (small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20) and LINC00582) detected in LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells or HUVECs. A total of 317 circRNAs, 104 lncRNAs, and 135 mRNAs showed significant differential expression in UCB-derived exosomes of preterm infants with BPD compared with those with NBPD. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were conducted to examine differentially expressed exosomal circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs. The results showed that the GO terms and KEGG pathways mostly involving differentially expressed exosomal RNAs were closely associated with endothelial or epithelial cell development. In vitro, CCK-8 and Western blot assays revealed that LPS remarkably inhibited the viability and promoted inflammatory responses (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) of BEAS-2B cells or HUVECs. The expression levels of circRNAs hsa_circ_0049170 and hsa_circ_0087059 were upregulated in LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells; the expression level of hsa_circ_0086913 was upregulated and that of hsa_circ_0065188 was downregulated in LPS-induced HUVECs. Moreover, the expression level of lncRNA SNHG20 was upregulated and that of LINC00582 was downregulated in LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells. Further, 455 circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction networks were predicted, including hsa_circ_0086913/hsa-miR-103a-3p/transmembrane 4 L six family member 1 (TM4SF1) and lncRNA-SNHG20/hsa-miR-6720-5p/spermine synthase (SMS) networks, which may take part in BPD., CONCLUSION: This study provided a systematic perspective on UCB-derived exosomal circRNAs and lncRNAs and laid an important foundation for further investigating the potential biological functions of exosomal circRNAs and lncRNAs in BPD., WHAT IS KNOWN: * BPD represents a multifactorial chronic pulmonary pathology and a major factor causing premature illness and death. * The therapeutic role of exosomes in BPD has been feverishly investigated, and exosomal RNAs were ignored., WHAT IS NEW: * The profiles of UCB-derived exosomal circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were performed. * Several differentially expressed circRNAs and lncRNAs were identified in LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells and HUVECs.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) commonly develops in premature infants. An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of BPD requires better models. In this study, neonatal FVB/N mice were exposed to room air or 85% oxygen for 28 days. Neonatal hyperoxia resulted in decreased alveolar septation, increased terminal air space size, and increased lung fibrosis. These changes were evident after 7 days and more pronounced by 28 days. Decreased alveolarization was preceded by decreased proliferation of lung cells. After 3 days of hyperoxia, cell proliferation was decreased compared with room air littermates. Cell proliferation continued to be decreased in the first 2 wk but normalized by 4 wk. Hyperoxia caused an increased number of inflammatory cells in lung tissue and in lung lavage fluid. Analysis of lung tissue RNA by RT-PCR showed that hyperoxia increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha. Prolonged neonatal hyperoxia caused functional changes, decreasing lung volume and pulmonary compliance. We conclude that prolonged exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia creates a lesion that is very similar to human BPD and suggests that altered cell proliferation may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic neonatal lung disease.

AB  - Respiratory distress syndrome is characterized by fibrin deposition in the lung. Fibrin adversely affects surfactant function and stimulates proliferation of fibroblasts. There is evidence that these properties may be important to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Despite successful initial treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome with surfactant, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has not decreased. In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that rat fetal distal lung epithelium (FDLE) possesses both procoagulant and anticoagulant properties. In this report, we have demonstrated (using factor VII-deficient plasma) that tissue factor is expressed on the FDLE surface and promotes thrombin generation. To regulate thrombin within this procoagulant environment, we have developed a novel anticoagulant, antithrombin-heparin covalent complex (ATH) that can be retained within the lung after intrapulmonary instillation. We have demonstrated that ATH was superior to antithrombin plus standard heparin in suppressing thrombin generation (P < 0.001) and prothrombin consumption (P < 0.01) in recalcified defibrinated plasma on the surface of FDLE. Further studies with ATH in vivo need to be performed.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether inhaled nitric oxide (NO) may alter oxidative stress parameters and induce lung inflammation in moderate hyaline membrane disease (HMD). Eighteen moderately premature lambs (130 days gestation, term = 147 days) were randomly assigned to treatment with 20 ppm inhaled NO (n = 8) from the onset of ventilation or used as control (n = 10). Except inhaled NO, treatments were intentionally similar to those applied in clinical situations. The main studied parameters were oxidative stress index measurements on lung parenchyma and in circulating blood, lung parenchyma microscopic examination and bronchoalveolar lavage cell count. We found that 20 ppm of inhaled NO for 5 h did not change significantly either malondialdehyde and total antioxidant status levels in circulating blood, or malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in lung parenchyma. Amino-imino-propene bond generation, which are lipoperoxidation markers, was similar in both groups. Furthermore, no significant changes in the number of inflammatory cells in lung lavage products and in lung parenchyma microscopic examination could be found. Therefore, these data do not support the hypothesis that short-term NO inhalation increases oxidative stress and lung inflammation in an experimental model of moderate HMD.

AB  - Mechanisms that regulate cytokine-mediated inflammation in the lungs of preterm infants, including factors which regulate production of the chemokine IL-8, remain poorly defined. Sequential bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained from preterm newborns with hyaline membrane disease over a 28-day period. Bronchoalveolar lavage cell cytokine relationships were evaluated and the differential regulation of IL-8 by IL-1beta and TNFalpha was studied in a short-term culture system. In vivo, IL-8 and IL-1beta protein levels correlated closely with each other and with macrophage counts. In cell culture, exogenous anti-IL-1beta antibody led to a 40% maximum inhibition (approximately) of IL-8 production by lipopolysaccharide stimulated lung inflammatory cells. Comparable amounts of exogenous anti-TNFalpha antibodies achieved a 15% maximum inhibition (approximately) of IL-8 production. Anti-IL-1beta and anti-TNFalpha antibodies in combination did not inhibit IL-8 production beyond that achieved by anti-IL-1beta antibody alone. These results, in preterm newborns, support the concept of lung inflammation mediated in part by a macrophage, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cell cytokine pathway. The results also suggest that factors other than IL-1beta and TNFalpha regulate IL-8 expression in the lungs of preterm infants.

AB  - Sophisticated neonatal transport has improved the safety of transporting preterm infants, but may not substitute for the benefits of in utero transport. To describe gestational age trends and assess differences in complications between maternal (in utero) and neonatal transports, we analyzed maternal and neonatal transports, over 3 years, to the only tertiary center in the region. Those who delivered between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation were included in the analysis. Gestational age trends for each complication are described, showing, in general, decreasing morbidity with gestational age in both groups. These trends were usually parallel, but not equal. A significantly greater mean neonatal intensive care unit (p = 0.003) and total length of stay (p = 0.006) as well as longer ventilator time (p = 0.01) and oxygen therapy exposure (p = 0.018) were noted in those transported neonatally. The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (p < 0.001), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p = 0.027), intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.041), intraventricular hemorrhage grades III and IV (p = 0.008), patent ductus arteriosus (p = 0.032), and mortality (p = 0.001) were all significantly greater among the neonatal transports. The differences were not significant for retinopathy of prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, and culture proven sepsis. Specialized neonatal transport and advanced neonatology techniques have not removed the significant advantage of decreased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital intervention resulting from maternal (in utero) transport.

AB  - Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are airway epithelial cells that are capable of secreting a variety of neuropeptides. PNECs are scattered throughout the bronchial tree either as individual cells or clusters of cells termed neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs). PNECs and their secretory peptides have been considered to play a role in fetal lung development. Although the normal physiological function of PNECs and neuropeptides in normal adult lungs and in repair from lung injury is not known, PNEC hyperplasia has been associated with chronic lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and with chronic exposures, such as hypoxia, tobacco smoke, nitrosamines, and ozone. To evaluate changes in PNEC number and distribution after acute airway injury, FVB/n mice were treated with either naphthalene or vehicle. Naphthalene is an aromatic hydrocarbon that, at the dose used in this study, selectively destroys nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells (Clara cells) through cytochrome P-450-mediated metabolic activation into cytotoxic epoxides. PNECs were identified by immunohistochemical analysis of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR). Proliferating cells were marked with [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. Acute naphthalene toxicity results in PNEC hyperplasia that is detectable after 5 days of recovery. PNEC hyperplasia is characterized by increased numbers of NEBs without significant changes in the number of isolated PNECs and by increased [(3)H]thymidine labeling of CGRP-IR cells. These data show that cell proliferation contributes to PNEC hyperplasia after acute airway injury and suggest that PNECs may be capable of more rapidly increasing their number in response to injury than previously recognized.

AB  - Prolonged mechanical ventilation of premature neonates is often associated with abnormal morphological development of the lung and chronic lung disease, sometimes called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Impaired alveolar development is a hallmark of this disease. To better understand the effects of mechanical ventilation on lung elastin expression, we studied lung tissue from 10 preterm lambs (gestation = 125 days; term = 148 days) mechanically ventilated for 3-4 wk at a respirator rate of 20 breaths/min and tidal volume of 15 +/- 5 ml/kg (n = 5) or 60 breaths/min and tidal volume of 5 +/- 2 ml/kg (n = 5). Histopathology showed increased elastin accumulation and abnormal morphological development in the ventilated groups. Postmortem lung desmosine content was increased significantly in the 20 breaths/min group. Tropoelastin mRNA expression was increased in both ventilated groups. In situ hybridization localized increased tropoelastin mRNA expression to sites of accumulated elastin in extended alveolar walls with scant, attenuated secondary crests. Lung collagen content, as assessed by the amount of hydroxyproline in lung tissue, was similar to controls. These data suggest that excessive production and accumulation of elastin is associated with chronic lung injury from prolonged mechanical ventilation after premature birth.

AB  - The expression of lung manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mRNA and protein were examined in a premature baboon model of hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and BPD superimposed with bacterial infection. When 140-d gestation baboons were delivered by hysterotomy and treated for 16 d with appropriate ventilatory and oxygen support (pro re nada controls), there was an increase in both MnSOD mRNA and protein compared with 140-d or 156-d gestation, nonventilated controls. The concentration of MnSOD protein was also elevated when the prematurely delivered baboons were ventilated with a high fraction of inspired O2 to produce a primate homolog of BPD, but there was a significant decrease in the concentration of MnSOD mRNA in BPD animals compared with pro re nada controls. In the lungs of premature baboons in which Escherichia coli infection was superimposed on hyperoxia-induced BPD, MnSOD mRNA was diminished to approximately the same extent as in BPD alone, but MnSOD protein was significantly increased compared with all other groups. Taken together these data indicate that the premature baboon is capable of mounting an antioxidant response and that increased MnSOD protein expression in BPD and BPD-infected premature baboons is regulated, at least in part, at a posttranscriptional level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists as to the risk for postoperative apnea in former preterm infants. The conclusions of published studies are limited by the small number of patients., METHODS: The original data from eight prospective studies were subject to a combined analysis. Only patients having inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia were included; patients receiving caffeine, regional anesthesia, or undergoing other surgical procedures were excluded. A uniform definition for apnea was used for all patients. Eleven risk factors were examined: gestational age, postconceptual age, birth weight, history of respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neonatal apnea, necrotizing enterocolitis, ongoing apnea, anemia, and use of opioids or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants., RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-five of 384 patients from eight studies at four institutions fulfilled study criteria. There was significant variation in apnea rates and the location of apnea (recovery room and postrecovery room) between institutions (P < 0.001). There was considerable variation in the duration and type of monitoring, definitions of apnea, and availability of historical information. The incidence of detected apnea was greater when continuous recording devices were used compared to standard impedance pneumography with alarms or nursing observations. Despite these limitations, it was determined that: (1) apnea was strongly and inversely related to both gestational age (P = 0.0005) and postconceptual age (P < 0.0001); (2) an associated risk factor was continuing apnea at home; (3) small-for-gestational-age infants seemed to be somewhat protected from apnea compared to appropriate- and large-for-gestational-age infants; (4) anemia was a significant risk factor, particularly for patients > 43 weeks' postconceptual age; (5) a relationship to apnea with history of necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal apnea, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or operative use of opioids and/or muscle relaxants could not be demonstrated., CONCLUSIONS: The analysis suggests that, if it is assumed that the statistical models used are equally valid over the full range of ages considered and that the average rate of apnea reported across the studies analyzed is accurate and representative of actual rates in all institutions, the probability of apnea in nonanemic infants free of recovery-room apnea is not less than 5%, with 95% statistical confidence until postconceptual age was 48 weeks with gestational age 35 weeks. This risk is not less than 1%, with 95% statistical confidence, for that same subset of infants, until postconceptual age was 56 weeks with gestational age 32 weeks or postconceptual age was 54 weeks and gestational age 35 weeks. Older infants with apnea in the recovery room or anemia also should be admitted and monitored. The data do not allow prediction with confidence up to what age this precaution should continue to be taken for infants with anemia. The data were insufficient to allow recommendations regarding how long infants should be observed in recovery. There is additional uncertainty in the results due to the dramatically different rates of detected apnea in different institutions, which appear to be related to the use of different monitoring devices. Given the limitations of this combined analysis, each physician and institution must decide what is an acceptable risk for postoperative apnea.

AB  - Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (an enzyme capable of generating superoxide radicals following hypoxiaischaemia), was investigated in preterm infants to determine its ability to prevent the complications of neonatal intensive care which may be associated with oxidative injury. Four hundred infants of between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to receive enteral allopurinol (20 mg/ml) or an equivalent dose of placebo for seven daily doses. At admission, plasma hypoxanthine concentrations were significantly higher in infants who subsequently developed periventricular leucomalacia (PVL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), but there was no difference in the primary endpoint (PVL) between the treated and control groups. The failure of allopurinol prophylaxis in this group of infants is probably related to the complex nature of the pathological processes and to the timing of treatment. If oxidant injury is an important mechanism of cellular injury in these preterm infants, an alternative biochemical modulator would be required, or a combination of agents might be effective.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) extracellular vesicles (EVs) have beneficial effects in preclinical bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) models. The optimal source, dosing, route, and duration of effects are however unknown. The objectives of this study were to (a) compare the efficacy of GMP-grade EVs obtained from Wharton's Jelly MSCs (WJ-MSCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs), (b) determine the optimal dosing and route of administration, (c) evaluate its long-term effects, and (d) determine how MSC EVs alter the lung transcriptome. Newborn rats exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P)1-P14 were given (a) intra-tracheal (IT) BM or WJ-MSC EVs or placebo, (b) varying doses of IT WJ-MSC EVs, or (c) IT or intravenous (IV) WJ-MSC EVs on P3. Rats were evaluated at P14 or 3 months. Early administration of IT BM-MSC or WJ-MSC EVs had similar beneficial effects on lung structure and PH in hyperoxia-exposed rats. WJ-MSC EVs however had superior effects on cardiac remodeling. Low, medium, and high dose WJ-MSC EVs had similar cardiopulmonary regenerative effects. IT and IV WJ-MSC EVs similarly improved vascular density and reduced PH in hyperoxic rats. Gene-set enrichment analysis of transcripts differentially expressed in WJ-MSC EV-treated rats showed that induced transcripts were associated with angiogenesis. Long-term studies demonstrated that a single early MSC EV dose has pulmonary vascular protective effects 3 months after administration. Together, our findings have significant translational implications as it provides critical insight into the optimal source, dosing, route, mechanisms of action, and duration of effects of MSC-EVs for BPD-PH.

AB  - Previous studies demonstrated that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) begun at birth limits the development of alveolar proteinaceous edema in premature monkeys at risk for hyaline membrane disease (HMD). We hypothesized that exogenous surfactant combined with HFOV would lead to even further reductions in edema. Twenty Macaca nemestrina monkeys were delivered at 134 d gestation (term = 168 d) and treated with either HFOV or conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) from the first breath; modified bovine surfactant (Survanta [beractant]) was introduced into the trachea over the first few minutes of life. These animals were compared with 20 animals treated with either CMV or HFOV but without surfactant. At 6 h the lung was rapidly frozen in situ during inflation for determination of the volume fraction of alveolar edema. The combined use of surfactant and HFOV from the first breath reduced alveolar proteinaceous edema (3 +/- 1%; mean +/- SEM) from that seen with CMV alone (27 +/- 3%, p < 0.0001), CMV after surfactant (21 +/- 3%, p < 0.0001), and HFOV alone (13 +/- 3%, p < 0.015). We conclude that the use of surfactant with HFOV after premature birth is superior to either surfactant or HFOV alone in reducing lung injury during the first few hours of life. We speculate that this reduction in lung injury may reduce the incidence or severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of immature rats induces airway smooth muscle layer thickening and cell turnover parallel to that found in the airways of patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic, severe asthma. We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species could promote the observed airway remodeling by directly stimulating signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth. To test this hypothesis in cultured cells, we assessed the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation in bovine tracheal myocytes. The MAP kinases are a family of 40 to 46 kD cytosolic serine/threonine kinases that participate in the transduction of mitogenic signals to the cell nucleus. Quiescent cells were exposed to H2O2 (25 to 200 microns; 2 to 60 min), after which SDS-PAGE of cell extracts was performed. Western analysis using an anti-MAP kinase antiserum revealed a decrease in the mobility of the 42 and 44 kD MAP kinase bands after H2O2 exposures of 5 to 30 min, reflecting the phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine residues required for enzymatic activity. MAP kinase activation was demonstrated by kinase renaturation assays, which showed an almost 4-fold increase in 42 and 44 kD MAP kinase activity. Down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) partially reduced H2O2-stimulated MAP kinase activity, suggesting that H2O2 induces MAP kinase activation via both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways. Western analysis using a phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody revealed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with approximate molecular weights of 72 and 125 kD after H2O2 exposure, demonstrating that H2O2 can stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cytosolic proteins, including MAP kinase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - This study addresses the mental and motor development of 78 low birth weight infants (LBW) classified into five groups according to early medical complications: (1) respiratory distress syndrome (RDS); (2) intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH Grades I-II); (3) IVH (Grade III); (4) IVH (Grade IV) with hydrocephalus; and (5) bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with or without IVH. Each child received an assessment of mental and motor development at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of age. Results of mental scores revealed clear effects of group and age, but no interaction of group and age. The RDS and IVH (Grades I-III) groups generally had higher scores on indices of mental development than did IVH (Grade IV) and BPD infants with or without IVH. Although most groups had higher mental scores at the older ages, rates of growth were essentially parallel across the five groups. There was some support for differential rates of motor development, with the IVH (Grade IV) group showing acceleration between 24 and 36 months of age while the BPD group continued to show motor delay at 36 months. These results call into question the common practice of correcting psychology test scores of LBW infants for gestational age.

AB  - Fifteen premature newborns with hyaline membrane disease causing acute respiratory distress were evaluated for complement activation. A high intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt and marked arterial-alveolar oxygen difference indicated the severity of the respiratory failure. Twenty preterm healthy infants served as controls. Total haemolytic activity, plasma concentrations of complement components and regulatory proteins (C3, C4, C1-inhibitor, factors H and I) as well as activation products (C3a, C3dg, C1rsC1-inhibitor, C3b(Bb)P) gave no evidence of significant complement activation. Functional activity of the ubiquitous regulatory protein C1-inhibitor was significantly reduced without impact on classical pathway activation. These data suggest that, in contrast to the adult form of respiratory distress syndrome, the low-pressure pulmonary oedema characterising hyaline membrane disease is not mediated by activation of the complement system.

Congenital deficiency of Surfactant Protein-B (SPB) has recently been documented for the first time in two siblings. The pathologic findings in these infants was that of congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and the radiographic manifestations were strikingly similar to hyaline membrane disease.

AB  - Steady-state levels of mRNAs for the three surfactant-associated proteins, SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C, were measured in a primate model of premature birth and survival. These values were determined by Northern and quantitative slot blot analyses of total lung RNA during both in utero and extrauterine development of the fetus as well as in response to hyperoxic exposure. The composition and surface properties of surfactant were also analyzed to determine the effect of differential expression of the surfactant proteins on the overall composition and function of surfactant. The data clearly demonstrate that the regulation of surfactant mRNA levels in the premature fetus is under complex physiological control. Interruption of in utero development by premature birth results in increased levels of all three surfactant mRNAs, presumably in response to precocious initiation of air breathing. Within the first 24 h after parturition both SP-B and SP-C mRNA levels are increased beyond the levels found in the full-term fetal controls. Expression of mRNA for these genes peaks on day 2 and thereafter drops to levels below that found on day 1. However, response of the SP-A gene to premature birth is slow and transcripts from this gene lag considerably behind values found in the full-term fetus. Furthermore, exposure of the premature fetus to hyperoxia results in an increase in the steady-state levels of SP-B and SP-C mRNA without significant changes in SP-A. Defects in the ability of the SP-A gene to respond to extrauterine exposure and hyperoxia may be contributing to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a common clinical complication of premature birth in humans.

AB  - We measured then compared the dynamic lung mechanics of spontaneous breaths and mechanical breaths in 9 mechanically ventilated neonates with hyaline membrane disease. All were receiving intermittent mandatory ventilation. All breathed spontaneously between ventilator breaths. Tidal volume, transpulmonary pressure, dynamic lung compliance, airways resistance, and peak inspiratory and peak expiratory gas flows were determined for both the mechanical and the spontaneous breaths. The mechanical breaths consistently had larger tidal volumes, higher transpulmonary pressures, higher airway resistance, and lower lung compliance values (P less than 0.05). Peak inspiratory and expiratory gas flows were also higher (P less than 0.01) during mechanical breathing. The spontaneous breaths generated by patients and the mechanical breaths generated by mechanical ventilators are different. The lung mechanics measurements of these two different types of breathing should be collected, analyzed, and reported separately.

AB  - The prenatal relationships between surfactant disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and surfactant-associated proteins of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) have not been well documented. In the present study we measured the concentration of DSPC, surfactant glycoproteins (GP), and surfactant proteolipids (PLP) in amniotic fluids obtained within 6 hours prior to delivery of 16 newborn infants with gestational ages between 27 and 32 weeks. In control infants of 27-32 weeks gestation without RDS, the values of DSPC, GP, and PLP per milliliter of amniotic fluid were 20 +/- 2.9 micrograms, 684 +/- 115.3 ng and 289 +/- 62.5 ng, respectively. These values were significantly higher, threefold for PLP, fourfold for DSPC, and fivefold for GP, than amniotic fluid levels in infants with RDS. The findings support the concept that immaturity of surfactant in RDS involves both phospholipids and surfactant-associated proteins. Measurements of surfactant lipid-protein complex appear to enhance the reliability for identifying prenatally, infants at risk of developing hyaline membrane disease. More extensive studies are warranted to assess the usefulness of these assays for clinical application.

AB  - Forty children who had had artificial ventilation during the neonatal period were studied at the age of 8-10 years with spirometry, the nitrogen washout test, bicycle exercise test, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, vectorcardiogram, and chest radiography. The median gestational age at birth was 29 weeks, and the median birth weight was 1310 g. Hyaline membrane disease was the indication for neonatal ventilation in 25 children. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed from radiographs in 11 infants (27%). Airway obstruction was observed in 10 of 11 children who had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in nine of 29 children who had not. After inhalation of terbutaline, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was significantly increased. General hyperinflation was found in 16 of 17 children with abnormal chest radiographs (eight who had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and nine who had not). Functional residual capacity was significantly higher in children with abnormal radiographs. Each child had a normal maximum working capacity and a normal electrocardiogram, and all but two had normal vectorcardiograms. Oxygen saturation at maximum work load decreased significantly in both groups of children. The risk of future respiratory problems calls for further follow up of lung function and chest radiography.

AB  - The interrupter technique involves measuring pressure changes at the airway opening following abrupt interruption of airflow, and relies on rapid equilibration of alveolar and airway opening pressures. Following airway occlusion one generally sees a rapid change in airway opening pressure, Pinit, which reflects the resistive pressure drop across the system, followed by a secondary, slower pressure change, Pdif, which reflects the tissue visco-elastic properties together with any redistribution of gases occurring between lung units at different pressure at the time of interruption. Physical factors in the measuring equipment, i.e., the time taken for valve closure and the presence of a proximal compliant compartment, can cause errors in the calculation of resistance and elastance using the interrupter technique. A computer model was used to determine the effects of these factors on the calculation of resistance and elastance in normal infants, premature infants, and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The elastance from 25 ml of dead space gas did not introduce significant errors into the measurements in any group of infants, but the presence of an unsupported upper airway caused errors of up to 245%. Increasing valve closure time introduced progressively larger errors into the calculation of resistance and elastance. To keep these errors acceptably small, an occlusion valve should close in 20 ms or less.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical efficacy and the cost of treatment between the newborns who received either a natural or a protein-free synthetic surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of prematurity., METHODS: This is a retrospective analytical study incorporating comparisons of clinical parameters and cost in newborns having RDS of prematurity who received either Survanta (bovine lung extract), a natural surfactant or Surfact (protein-free colfosceril palmitate), a synthetic surfactant., RESULTS: There were 100 newborns who received either of the natural (n = 52) or synthetic (n = 48) surfactant with mean (SD) gestational age and mean (SD) birth weight of 31.5 (2.6) wk, 1425 (461) g and 32.2 (2.2) wk, 1519 (413) g, respectively. Majority of the newborns (> 90%) received endotracheal surfactant within the first 24 h of life and had similar baseline characteristics in either group. No differences were noted in ventilator settings on admission and 24 h after surfactant/admission. Oxygen requirement, extubation age, complications, hospital stay, and mortality were similar across groups, except that the necrotizing enterocolitis was noted only in natural surfactant group. There was a significant pharmacy cost savings in synthetic surfactant group., CONCLUSION: Synthetic surfactant was comparable to natural surfactant with regard to outcomes, like ventilator settings, hospital stay, and mortality. Pharmacy cost was less in synthetic surfactant group. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.

AB  - Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) was measured serially in 81 critically ill neonates with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) during the first five days of life, and these changes were correlated with the birth weight, gestational age, serum protein level, clinical status, and outcome. Colloid osmotic pressure correlated better with the total protein level (n = 81; r = 0.54) than with birth weight (r = 0.23) and gestational age (r = 0.31; n = 81). Seventy-one of 81 neonates survived. Among the survivors, COP increased significantly by day 5, whereas changes in the total protein level were not significant during the same period. Colloid osmotic pressure decreased significantly in nine of ten nonsurvivors (mean +/- SE, 11 +/- 0.5 to 8 +/- 0.55 mm Hg), whereas the total protein level did not show a similar change. Thus, COP cannot be accurately predicted by measuring serum protein during acute illness. Serial measurement of COP was a better prognostic indicator than the total protein level in infants with HMD.

The present study established the COP changes in healthy term and preterm infants and in critically ill neonates. COP in healthy term (16.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg) and preterm (15.4 +/- 1.3) infants was significantly lower than adults (21.6 +/- 3.6). Even in sick neonates, COP correlated with gestational age (n = 78, r = 0.63, p less than 0.001 , birth weight (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001) and total protein (n = 71, r = 0.58, p less than 0.001). Critically ill preterm infants with hyaline membrane disease had the lowest COP (11.5 +/- 1.2). Administration of 10% albumin failed to increase the COP significantly. In critically ill preterm infants who survived, the COP increased during the first postnatal week, whereas in nonsurvivors COP decreased significantly to less than 10 mm Hg.

AB  - The hospital records of 7 patients with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were reviewed. All patients were ventilator dependent for prolonged periods (mean duration intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) 14.3 +/- 3.5 months) but eventually were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and sent home. The early phase of the disease was characterized by excessive CO2 retention, tachypnea, and inability to tolerate reductions in IMV. A turning point was reached halfway through the course of mechanical ventilation (7.3 +/- 1.4 months) which was identified by a persistent and significant reduction in PaCO2 and spontaneous respiratory rate. Thereafter, gradual reductions in IMV were generally well tolerated. Average monthly weight gain was less prior to the turning point it was subsequently.

AB  - A systematic study on the location and intensity of the fibrinolytic activity in more than 500 samples of human arteries and veins from 50 routine necropsies and 35 blood vessel biopsies was performed. Data were obtained for an overall comparison of the fibrinolytic activity along and across the walls of human blood vessels by the use of a standardized fibrin slide technique. Arteries generally showed little or no fibrinolytic activity in the intima and media but strong activity in the adventitia. Veins showed a comparable strong fibrinolytic activity in the external layer of loose connective tissue. Fibrinolytic activity in the venous intima, media and adventitia was generally weaker but varied greatly according to position in the body. Veins situated in the lower parts of the body had less fibrinolytic activity than the veins at the upper levels. Fibrinolytic activity was found to be related to the endothelium of the vasa vasorum and/or of the main lumen of the vascular wall. Increased fibrinolytic activity was observed in arteries and veins in cases of sudden death, vasogenic shock, cerebral hemorrhage and cirrhosis. Decreased fibrinolytic activity was encountered in blood vessels in cases of endotoxin shock, hyaline membrane disease and a case of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common complications of premature birth. The current definition of BPD is based on the duration of oxygen therapy and/or respiratory support. Among the pitfalls of all the diagnostic definitions, the lack of a proper pathophysiologic classification makes it difficult to choose an appropriate drug strategy for BPD. In this case report, we describe the clinical course of four premature infants, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, for whom the use of lung and cardiac ultrasound was an integral part of the diagnostic and therapeutic process. We describe, for the first time to our knowledge, four different cardiopulmonary ultrasound patterns of evolving and established chronic lung disease of prematurity and the consequent therapeutic choices. This approach, if confirmed in prospective studies, may guide the personalized management of infants suffering from evolving and established BPD, optimizing the chances of success of the therapies and at the same time reducing the risk of exposure to inadequate and potentially harmful drugs.Copyright 2023 Bruno, Chioma, Storti, De Luca, Fantinato, Antonazzo and Pierro.

AB  - Many studies have shown a positive association between nutritional intake during the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay and the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months of corrected age (CA) and beyond in preterm infants. The association is, however, confounded by several factors, including maternal nutrition and socioeconomic status, obstetric conditions like gestational diabetes and hypertension, fetal genetic potential, and, importantly, neonatal morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and preterm brain injury. These factors are likely to play a more critical role in delineating the association between early nutrition and long-term outcomes in preterm infants from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with suboptimal antenatal and neonatal care practices and high prevalence of intrauterine growth restriction. For example, the growth trajectory from birth to term corrected age in preterm infants in LMIC settings is quite different from those born in highincome countries. In a study involving about 400 preterm neonates born before 34 weeks of gestation, we found a considerable drop in weight-for-age z-scores from around -0.8 zscore at birth to -2.8 z-score at term corrected age despite receiving adequate parenteral and enteral nutrition at a level-3 NICU in India. Despite some catch-up during infancy, the median z-score was -1.6 at 12 months of CA. In another study of 195 very preterm or very low birth weight infants, we observed no association between the average energy and protein intake during the NICU stay and the weight-for-age z-scores at 18 months' CA. Though there was a weak positive correlation between the weight-for-age z-scores at term corrected age and the motor and mental developmental quotients (MoDQ and MeDQ) at 18 months' CA, the multivariable regression did not demonstrate any association between the two variables after adjusting for gender and gestation. The effect of nutritional intake before discharge from the NICU on the risk of metabolic syndromes in later life is largely unknown in preterm infants from LMICs. The paucity of information underscores the need for large observational studies with well-defined protocols and methodologies to examine the association between early nutrition and long-term growth and development and the risk of adult-onset diseases after accounting for all relevant confounding factors in preterm infants from both high-income and low and middle-income countries.

AB  - Background: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) signalling involves the interplay between IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and soluble gp130 (sgp130). IL-6 activity is modulated by the soluble receptors to produce both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in human diseases and animal models. The expression and functional activity of these molecules in lungs of preterm ventilated infants is unknown. Objective(s): We investigated this pathway in preterm infants who were at risk of developing chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD). Method(s): Cytokines and soluble receptors were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from ventilated preterm infants <=32 weeks of gestation who did or did not develop CLD. B9 cells, which specifically proliferate to IL-6, were used to assess BALF IL-6 functional activity. Result(s): Inflammatory cells, IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were increased in BALF from the CLD group when compared to the No CLD group (p < 0.05). BALF IL-6 and sIL-6R were similar in both groups. In contrast, BALF sgp130 and sgp130/sIL-6R were greater in the CLD group when compared to the No CLD group (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). However, the increased BALF sgp130 did not appear to modulate the BALF IL-6 functional activity. Conclusion(s): Lung inflammation was observed in the CLD group. Increased BALF sgp130 was noted in the CLD group but it did not appear to modulate the pulmonary IL-6 bioactivity. Further research is needed to investigate the potential modulatory activity of sgp130 in the preterm lung. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) is generally treated with surfactant by intubation-surfactant-extubation (InSurE) technique, an invasive method of surfactant administration. Surfactant without endotracheal tube intubation (SurE) is a noninvasive technique that avoids intubation and has been found to have improved the delivery of exogenous surfactants, thereby decreasing lung damage in neonates. This systematic review aimed to provide insights into the efficacy of SurE over InSurE in neonates who received respiratory support and to evaluate the progression and onset of concurrent diseases after treatment. The CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched for data collection. In all, 21 research articles were eligible, comprising 19,976 study participants. The data showed a significant reduction in the composite outcome of stage 2 necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and onset of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus when treated with SurE. The trend towards lower pneumothorax rates with SurE was also evident. These findings were robust due to the sensitivity analyses performed. There were no differences in the outcome of death or rates of other neonatal morbidities. Overall, SurE was identified as a better substitute for InSurE to treat neonates with RDS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common and serious chronic lung disease in preterm infants with pathological characteristics of arrested lung development. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a serious manifestation of oxidative stress damage, but little is known about the role of DSBs in BPD. The current study set out to detect DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest in BPD and study the expression of genes related to DNA damage and repair in BPD through DNA damage signaling pathway-based PCR array to determine a suitable target to improve arrested lung development associated with BPD., METHODS: DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest were detected in a BPD animal model and primary cells, then a DNA damage signaling pathway-based PCR array was used to identify the target of DSB repair in BPD., RESULTS: DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest were shown in BPD animal model, primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) and cultured cells after exposure to hyperoxia. Of the 84 genes in the DNA damage-signaling pathway PCR array, eight genes were overexpressed and 11 genes were repressed. Rad1, an important protein for DSB repair, was repressed in the model group. Real-time PCR and western blots were used to verify the microarray results. Next, we confirmed that silencing Rad1 expression aggravated the accumulation of DSBs and cell cycle arrest in AECII cells, whereas its overexpression alleviated DSB accumulation and cell cycle arrest., CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of DSBs in AECII might be an important cause of alveolar growth arrest associated with BPD. Rad1 could be an effective target for intervention to improve this arrest in lung development associated with BPD. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risks of mortality, morbidity and postnatal characteristics associated with extreme preterm fetal growth restriction (EP-FGR)., DESIGN: The EVERREST (Do e s v ascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy saf e ly imp r ove outcome in seve r e e arly-onset fetal growth re st riction?) prospective multicentre study of women diagnosed with EP-FGR (singleton, estimated fetal weight (EFW) <3rd percentile, <600 g, 20+0-26+6 weeks of gestation). The UK subgroup of EP-FGR infants (<36 weeks) were sex-matched and gestation-matched to appropriate for age (AGA) infants born in University College London Hospital (1:2 design, EFW 25th-75th percentile)., SETTING: Four tertiary perinatal units (UK, Germany, Spain, Sweden)., MAIN OUTCOMES: Antenatal and postnatal mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), sepsis, surgically treated necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), treated retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)., RESULTS: Of 135 mothers recruited with EP-FGR, 42 had a stillbirth or termination of pregnancy (31%) and 93 had live births (69%). Postnatal genetic abnormalities were identified in 7/93 (8%) live births. Mean gestational age at birth was 31.4 weeks (SD 4.6). 54 UK-born preterm EP-FGR infants (<36 weeks) were matched to AGA controls. EP-FGR was associated with increased BPD (43% vs 26%, OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 9.4, p=0.01), surgical NEC (6% vs 0%, p=0.036) and ROP treatment (11% vs 0%, p=0.001). Mortality was probably higher among FGR infants (9% vs 2%, OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 25.8, p=0.054). FGR infants more frequently received invasive ventilation (65% vs 50%, OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.1, p=0.03), took longer to achieve full feeds and had longer neonatal stays (median difference 6.1 days, 95% CI 3.8 to 8.9 and 19 days, 95% CI 9 to 30 days, respectively, p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Mortality following diagnosis of EP-FGR is high. Survivors experience increased neonatal morbidity compared with AGA preterm infants., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02097667. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIDEA (hypotonia, hypoventilation, intellectual disability, dysautonomia, epilepsy and eye abnormalities) syndrome is a rare and novel disease. We describe a premature patient who required extensive work up for his hypoventilation with a diagnosis of HIDEA syndrome., CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was born to a pair of consanguineous parents at 32-week gestation. His intermittent bradypnoea requiring significant respiratory support during his postnatal clinical course was atypical for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and this required further extensive work up to look for a cause for his hypoventilation. A trio whole exon sequencing was done which identified homozygous variants in P4HTM, in keeping with the diagnosis of autosomal recessive HIDEA syndrome. He is currently doing well on BiPAP 18 cm H2O / 8 cm H2O, Rate 30 breaths per minute in room air and full nasogastric feeding. He also has cortical blindess and severe global developmental delay., CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis is crucial to optimise adequate ventilatory management including early tracheostomy as many require lifelong continuous or intermittent ventilation. This minimises the complications of chronic hypoxia and reduces mortality risk. Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic postnatal corticosteroid use in extremely preterm infants poses a risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study explores their use beyond seven days of age with early neurodevelopmental assessments during the fidgety period (9-20 weeks postterm age)., METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study included inborn extremely preterm infants from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018. Outborn infants, those with congenital or genetic abnormalities, and those who received postnatal corticosteroids for nonrespiratory reasons were excluded. The cohort was dichotomized based on the status of corticosteroid receipt. Early neurodevelopmental outcomes were reported using Prechtl's General Movements Assessment., RESULTS: Of the 282 infants, 67 (23.75%) received corticosteroids. Of these, 34 (50.75%) received them for dependency on invasive ventilation (intermittent positive-pressure ventilation), and the remainder received them for dependency on non-invasive ventilation continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Abnormal or absent fidgety movements were observed in 13% of infants (7/54) who received corticosteroids compared to 2% of infants (3/146) who did not. An increased odds for an abnormal general movements assessment from corticosteroid use after adjusting for gestational age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-26.56] was observed. The motor optimality scores differed between the two groups [corticosteroid group: 25.5 (23-26) versus no-corticosteroid group: 26 (24-28); z = - 2.02]. A motor optimality score < 20 was observed in 14.8% of infants (8/54) in the corticosteroid group compared to 2% of infants (3/146) in the noncorticosteroid group. This difference was significant after adjustment for gestational age (aOR 5.96, 95% CI 1.28-27.74)., CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal early neurodevelopment was observed in infants who received systemic postnatal corticosteroids. The relationship between these findings and other factors influencing early neurodevelopment needs further exploration. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - AIMS: Oxygen therapy plays a vital role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is the independent risk factor for neurodevelopment deficits in premature infants. However, the effect of hippocampal cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) on BPD-associated neurodevelopment deficits is not fully understood., METHODS: Mice were placed in a hyperoxia chamber from postnatal Day 1 to Day 7. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate the lung histomorphological characteristics. Learning and memory functions of mice were detected by Morris water maze. TUNEL staining was applied to measure the number of apoptotic cells. The expression of CDK5, apoptosis-related protein, and neuroplasticity-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Golgi staining was used to assess the structure of dendritic spines., RESULTS: Hyperoxia-induced BPD mice showed a long-term learning and memory dysfunction, more severe neuronal apoptosis, and a decline of synaptic plasticity. Inhibition of CDK5 overactivation ameliorated cognitive deficits, neuronal apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity disorders in BPD mice., CONCLUSIONS: This study first found a vital role of CDK5 in BPD-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Inhibition of CDK5 overexpression could effectively improve cognitive dysfunctions in BPD mice, which indicated that hippocampal CDK5 may be a new target for prevention and treatment in learning and memory dysfunction of BPD.

AB  - Pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells represent a small population in the airway epithelium, but despite this, hyperplasia of NE cells is associated with several lung diseases, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The molecular mechanisms causing the development of NE cell hyperplasia remains poorly understood. Previously, we showed that the SOX21 modulates the SOX2-initiated differentiation of epithelial cells in the airways. Here, we show that precursor NE cells start to develop in the SOX2 + SOX21 + airway region and that SOX21 suppresses the differentiation of airway progenitors to precursor NE cells. During development, clusters of NE cells start to form and NE cells mature by expressing neuropeptide proteins, such as CGRP. Deficiency in SOX2 resulted in decreased clustering, while deficiency in SOX21 increased both the numbers of NE ASCL1 + precursor cells early in development, and the number of mature cell clusters at E18.5. In addition, at the end of gestation (E18.5), a number of NE cells in Sox2 heterozygous mice, did not yet express CGRP suggesting a delay in maturation. In conclusion, SOX2 and SOX21 function in the initiation, migration and maturation of NE cells. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a healthcare system with finite resources, hospital organisational factors may contribute to patient outcomes. We aimed to assess the association of nurse staffing and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) occupancy with outcomes of preterm infants born <33 weeks' gestation., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Four level III NICUs., PATIENTS: Infants born 23-32 weeks' gestation 2015-2018., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nursing provision ratios (nursing hours worked/recommended nursing hours based on patient acuity categories) and unit occupancy rates were averaged for the first shift, 24 hours and 7 days of admission of each infant. Primary outcome was mortality/morbidity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe neurological injury, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis and nosocomial infection). ORs for association of exposure with outcomes were estimated using generalised linear mixed models adjusted for confounders., RESULTS: Among 1870 included infants, 823 (44%) had mortality/morbidity. Median nursing provision ratio was 1.03 (IQR 0.89-1.22) and median unit occupancy was 89% (IQR 82-94). In the first 24 hours of admission, higher nursing provision ratio was associated with lower odds of mortality/morbidity (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98), and higher unit occupancy was associated with higher odds of mortality/morbidity (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.36). In causal mediation analysis, nursing provision ratios mediated 47% of the association between occupancy and outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: NICU occupancy is associated with mortality/morbidity among very preterm infants and may reflect lack of adequate resources in periods of high activity. Interventions aimed at reducing occupancy and maintaining adequate resources need to be considered as strategies to improve patient outcomes. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease in extremely preterm neonates. The outcome and clinical burden vary dramatically according to severity. Although some prediction tools for BPD exist, they seldom pay attention to disease severity and are based on populations in developed countries. This study aimed to develop machine learning prediction models for BPD severity based on selected clinical factors in a Chinese population., METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included patients with a gestational age < 32 weeks who were diagnosed with BPD in our neonatal intensive care unit from 2016 to 2020. We collected their clinical information during the maternal, birth and early postnatal periods. Risk factors were selected through univariable and ordinal logistic regression analyses. Prediction models based on logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting decision tree, XGBoost (XGB) and random forest (RF) models were implemented and assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)., RESULTS: We ultimately included 471 patients (279 mild, 147 moderate, and 45 severe cases). On ordinal logistic regression, gestational diabetes mellitus, initial fraction of inspiration O2 value, invasive ventilation, acidosis, hypochloremia, C-reactive protein level, patent ductus arteriosus and Gram-negative respiratory culture were independent risk factors for BPD severity. All the XGB, LR and RF models (AUC = 0.85, 0.86 and 0.84, respectively) all had good performance., CONCLUSIONS: We found risk factors for BPD severity in our population and developed machine learning models based on them. The models have good performance and can be used to aid in predicting BPD severity in the Chinese population. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Delayed-interval delivery (DID) is the delivery of the first fetus in a multiple gestation pregnancy without prompt delivery of the remaining fetus(es). We aimed to assess infant outcomes of DID., STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants born 22-28 weeks' gestation or weighing 401-1500 g. DID was defined as a passage of >24 h between the birth of firstborn and retained infants. Rates of mortality, morbidity, and developmental outcomes were compared within DID multiples, to other multiples not born by DID, and all infants in the Generic Database and follow-up datasets (excluding DID-born)., RESULTS: DID-born multiples were younger and smaller than other multiples. Retained infants had no significantly different rates of mortality and morbidities compared to their firstborn counterparts, apart from less bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSIONS: DID showed no evidence of harm and a potential benefit of decreased bronchopulmonary dysplasia mediated by increased gestational age and birthweight.

AB  - The hyperoxia-induced pro-inflammatory response and tissue damage constitute pivotal steps leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the immature lung. The pro-inflammatory cytokines are considered attractive candidates for a directed intervention but the complex interplay between inflammatory and developmental signaling pathways requires a comprehensive evaluation before introduction into clinical trials as studied here for the death inducing ligand TRAIL. At birth and during prolonged exposure to oxygen and mechanical ventilation, levels of TRAIL were lower in tracheal aspirates of preterm infants <29 weeks of gestation which developed moderate/severe BPD. These findings were reproduced in the newborn mouse model of hyperoxic injury. The loss of TRAIL was associated with increased inflammation, apoptosis induction and more pronounced lung structural simplification after hyperoxia exposure for 7 days while activation of NFkappaB signaling during exposure to hyperoxia was abrogated. Pretreatment with recombinant TRAIL rescued the developmental distortions in precision cut lung slices of both wildtype and TRAIL-/- mice exposed to hyperoxia. Of importance, TRAIL preserved alveolar type II cells, mesenchymal progenitor cells and vascular endothelial cells. In the situation of TRAIL depletion, our data ascribe oxygen toxicity a more injurious impact on structural lung development. These data are not surprising taking into account the diverse functions of TRAIL and its stimulatory effects on NFkappaB signaling as central driver of survival and development. TRAIL exerts a protective role in the immature lung as observed for the death inducing ligand TNF-alpha before. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal lung disease developing in premature babies characterized by arrested alveologenesis and associated with decreased Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression. One-week hyperoxia (HYX) exposure of newborn mice leads to a permanent arrest in alveologenesis. To test the role of Fgf10 signaling to promote de novo alveologenesis following hyperoxia, we used transgenic mice allowing inducible expression of Fgf10 and recombinant FGF10 (rFGF10) protein delivered intraperitoneally. We carried out morphometry analysis, and IF on day 45. Alveolospheres assays were performed co-culturing AT2s from normoxia (NOX) with FACS-isolated Sca1Pos resident mesenchymal cells (rMC) from animals exposed to NOX, HYX-PBS, or HYX-FGF10. scRNAseq between rMC-Sca1Pos isolated from NOX and HYX-PBS was also carried out. Transgenic overexpression of Fgf10 and rFGF10 administration rescued the alveologenesis defects following HYX. Alveolosphere assays indicate that the activity of rMC-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by HYX and partially rescued by rFGF10 treatment. Analysis by IF demonstrates a significant impact of rFGF10 on the activity of resident mesenchymal cells. scRNAseq results identified clusters expressing Fgf10, Fgf7, Pdgfra, and Axin2, which could represent the rMC niche cells for the AT2 stem cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that rFGF10 administration is able to induce de novo alveologenesis in a BPD mouse model and identified subpopulations of rMC-Sca1Pos niche cells potentially representing its cellular target.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common challenge in preterm neonates. Retardation of alveolar development characterizes the pulmonary pathology in BPD. In the present study, we explored the roles of the CD146-HIF-1alpha axis in BPD. We demonstrated that the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and soluble CD146 (sCD1146) were increased in the peripheral blood of preterm neonates with BPD. In alveolar epithelial cells, hyperoxia promoted the expression of HIF-1alpha and CD146, which reinforced each other. In a mouse model of BPD, by exposing pups to 65% hyperoxia, HIF-1alpha and CD146 were increased in the pulmonary tissues. Mechanistically, CD146 hindered the migration of alveolar epithelial cells; in contrast, movement was significantly enhanced in CD146-knockout alveolar epithelial cells. As expected, CD146-knockout ameliorated alveolarization and improved BPD disease severity. Taken together, our findings imply that the CD146-HIF-1alpha axis contributes to alveolarization and that CD146 may be a novel candidate in BPD therapy. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Although aberrant alveolar myofibroblasts (AMYFs) proliferation and differentiation are often associated with abnormal lung development and diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), epigenetic mechanisms regulating proliferation and differentiation of AMYFs remain poorly understood. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is the only reported type III enzyme responsible for monomethylation of arginine residue on both histone and nonhistone substrates. Here we provide evidence for PRMT7's function in regulating AMYFs proliferation and differentiation during lung alveologenesis. In PRMT7-deficient mice, we found reduced AMYFs proliferation and differentiation, abnormal elastin deposition, and failure of alveolar septum formation. We further shown that oncogene forkhead box M1 (Foxm1) is a direct target of PRMT7 and that PRMT7-catalyzed monomethylation at histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3me1) directly associate with chromatin of Foxm1 to activate its transcription, and thereby regulate of cell cycle-related genes to inhibit AMYFs proliferation and differentiation. Overexpression of Foxm1 in isolated myofibroblasts (MYFs) significantly rescued PRMT7-deficiency-induced cell proliferation and differentiation defects. Thus, our results reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism through which PRMT7-mediated histone arginine monomethylation activates Foxm1 transcriptional expression to regulate AMYFs proliferation and differentiation during lung alveologenesis and may represent a potential target for intervention in pulmonary diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify neonatal risk for severe adverse perinatal outcomes across birth weight centiles in two Dutch and one international birth weight chart., BACKGROUND: Growth restricted newborns have not reached their intrinsic growth potential in utero and are at risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. There is no golden standard for the confirmation of the diagnosis of fetal growth restriction after birth. Estimated fetal weight and birth weight below the 10th percentile are generally used as proxy for growth restriction. The choice of birth weight chart influences the specific cut-off by which birth weight is defined as abnormal, thereby triggering clinical management. Ideally, this cut-off should discriminate appropriately between newborns at low and at high risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and consequently correctly inform clinical management., METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Newborns (n = 12 953) of women with a low-risk status at the start of pregnancy and that received primary antenatal care in the Netherlands were included. We examined the distribution of severe adverse perinatal outcomes across birth weight centiles for three birth weight charts (Visser, Hoftiezer and INTERGROWTH) by categorizing birth weight centile groups and comparing the prognostic performance for severe adverse perinatal outcomes. Severe adverse perinatal outcomes were defined as a composite of one or more of the following: perinatal death, Apgar score < 4 at 5 min, impaired consciousness, asphyxia, seizures, assisted ventilation, septicemia, meningitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, or necrotizing enterocolitis., RESULTS: We found the highest rates of severe adverse perinatal outcomes among the smallest newborns (< 3rd percentile) (6.2% for the Visser reference curve, 8.6% for the Hoftiezer chart and 12.0% for the INTERGROWTH chart). Discriminative abilities of the three birth weight charts across the entire range of birth weight centiles were poor with areas under the curve ranging from 0.57 to 0.61. Sensitivity rates of the various cut-offs were also low., CONCLUSIONS: The clinical utility of all three charts in identifying high risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes is poor. There is no single cut-off that discriminates clearly between newborns at low or high risk., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NTR4367 . Registration date March 20th, 2014.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an inflammation-related respiratory disorder in infants. MiR-382-5p has displayed low expression in developing lungs with BPD, while the effect of miR-382-5p on BPD remains elusive. Here, a hyperoxia (85% oxygen)-induced BPD model in neonatal mice was established. On postnatal days 10 and 15, hyperoxia reduced miR-382-5p expression in lungs of mice. Besides, CDK8, CD68 and CD86 levels were elevated on day 15 after birth, implying the involvement of CDK8 in M1 macrophage polarization. In addition, in vitro injury in RAW264.7 macrophages was induced by IFN-gamma and LPS stimulation. Lentivirus-encoding miR-382-5p decreased CDK8 expression, alleviated the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, and restricted the levels of CD40 and CD86 in response to IFN-gamma and LPS. Moreover, miR-382-5p inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1. Luciferase reporter assay verified that miR-382-5p might target the 3'UTR of CDK8. Rescue assays revealed that CDK8 reversed the mitigating roles of miR-382-5p in inflammatory response and M1 macrophage polarization, as reflected by increased IL-6 and CD40 levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-382-5p may suppress M1 macrophage activation and inflammatory response via inhibiting CDK8, thereby regulating the development of BPD, which is possibly mediated by STAT1 signaling.

AB  - The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) is a pattern recognition receptor that signals for inflammation via the NF-kappaB pathway. RAGE has been pursued as a potential target to suppress symptoms of diabetes and is of interest in a number of other diseases associated with chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Screening and optimization have previously produced small molecules that inhibit the activity of RAGE in cell-based assays, but efforts to develop a therapeutically viable direct-binding RAGE inhibitor have yet to be successful. Here, we show that a fragment-based approach can be applied to discover fundamentally new types of RAGE inhibitors that specifically target the ligand-binding surface. A series of systematic assays of structural stability, solubility, and crystallization were performed to select constructs of the RAGE ligand-binding domain and optimize conditions for NMR-based screening and co-crystallization of RAGE with hit fragments. An NMR-based screen of a highly curated ~14 000-member fragment library produced 21 fragment leads. Of these, three were selected for elaboration based on structure-activity relationships generated through cycles of structural analysis by X-ray crystallography, structure-guided design principles, and synthetic chemistry. These results, combined with crystal structures of the first linked fragment compounds, demonstrate the applicability of the fragment-based approach to the discovery of RAGE inhibitors.

AB  - Chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD) is defined as continued need for any form of respiratory support (supplemental oxygen and/or assisted ventilation) beyond 36 weeks PMA. Low-flow supplemental oxygen facilitates discharge from hospital of infants with CNLD who are hypoxic in air and is widely used despite lack of evidence on the most appropriate minimum mean target oxygen saturations. Furthermore, there are minimal data to guide the home monitoring, titration or weaning of supplemental oxygen in these infants. The purpose of this position statement is to provide a guide for the respiratory management of infants with CNLD, with special emphasis on role and logistics of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond the NICU stay. Reflecting a variety of clinical practices and infant comorbidities (presence of pulmonary hypertension, retinopathy of prematurity and adequacy of growth), it is recommended that the minimum mean target range for SpO2 during overnight oximetry to be 93-95% with less than 5% of total recording time to be below 90% SpO2 . Safety of short-term disconnection from supplemental oxygen should be assessed before discharge, with majority of infants with CNLD not ready for discharge until supplemental oxygen requirement is <=0.5 L/min. Sleep-time assessment of oxygenation with continuous overnight oximetry is recommended when weaning supplemental oxygen. Palivizumab is considered safe and effective for the reduction of hospital admissions with RSV infection in this group. This statement would be useful for paediatricians, neonatologists, respiratory and sleep physicians and general practitioners managing children with CNLD. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has generated considerable interest in neonatal care, but its comparative effectiveness compared with other forms of CPAP, especially in developed countries, remains unclear., OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyse short-term clinical outcomes among preterm infants treated with bubble CPAP vs all other forms of CPAP., METHODS: Prospective experimental studies published from 1995 onward until October 2018 comparing bubble versus other CPAP forms in preterm neonates <37 weeks' gestational age were included after a systematic review of multiple databases using pre-specified search criteria., RESULTS: A total of 978 articles were identified, of which 19 articles were included in meta-analyses. Of these, 5 had a high risk of bias, 8 had unclear risk and 6 had low risk. The risk of the primary outcome (CPAP failure within 7 days) was lower with bubble CPAP (0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98; 12 studies, 1194 subjects, I2=21%). Among secondary outcomes, only nasal injury was higher with use of bubble CPAP (risk ratio (RR) 2.04, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.14; 9 studies, 983 subjects; I2=42%) whereas no differences in mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.92; 9 studies, 1212 subjects, I2=20%) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21; 8 studies, 816 subjects, I2=0%) were noted., CONCLUSION: Bubble CPAP may lead to lower incidence of CPAP failure compared with other CPAP forms. However, it does not appear to translate to improvement in mortality or BPD and potential for nasal injury warrants close monitoring during clinical application., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019120411.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple measures. This can prevent synthesis of trial results in meta-analyses, and selected outcomes may not be relevant to former patients, parents and health professionals., OBJECTIVE: To define a core outcome set (COS) for research involving infants receiving neonatal care in a high-income setting., DESIGN: Outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative studies were systematically reviewed. Stakeholders were recruited for a three-round international Delphi survey. A consensus meeting was held to confirm the final COS, based on the survey results., PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and fourteen former patients, parents, healthcare professionals and researchers took part in the eDelphi survey; 173 completed all three rounds. Sixteen stakeholders participated in the consensus meeting., RESULTS: The literature reviews identified 104 outcomes; these were included in round 1. Participants proposed 10 additional outcomes; 114 outcomes were scored in rounds 2 and 3. Round 1 scores showed different stakeholder groups prioritised contrasting outcomes. Twelve outcomes were included in the final COS: survival, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, general gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life, adverse events, visual impairment/blindness, hearing impairment/deafness, retinopathy of prematurity and chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A COS for clinical trials and other research studies involving infants receiving neonatal care in a high-income setting has been identified. This COS for neonatology will help standardise outcome selection in clinical trials and ensure these are relevant to those most affected by neonatal care.

AB  - KEY POINTS: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a disease of extreme prematurity that occurs when the immature lung is exposed to gas ventilation. We designed a novel 'artificial womb' system for supporting extreme premature lambs (called EXTEND) that obviates gas ventilation by providing oxygen via a pumpless arteriovenous circuit with the lamb submerged in sterile artificial amniotic fluid. In the present study, we compare different arteriovenous cannulation strategies on EXTEND, including carotid artery/jugular vein (CA/JV), carotid artery/umbilical vein (CA/UV) and umbilical artery/umbilical vein (UA/UV). Compared to CA/JV and CA/UV cannulation, UA/UV cannulation provided significantly higher, physiological blood flows to the oxygenator, minimized flow interruptions and supported significantly longer circuit runs (up to 4 weeks). Physiological circuit blood flow in UA/UV lambs made possible normal levels of oxygen delivery, which is a critical step toward the clinical application of artificial womb technology., ABSTRACT: EXTEND (EXTra-uterine Environment for Neonatal Development) is a novel system that promotes physiological development by maintaining the premature lamb in a sterile fluid environment and providing gas exchange via a pumpless arteriovenous oxygenator circuit. During the development of EXTEND, different cannulation strategies evolved with the aim of improving circuit flow. The present study examines how different cannulation strategies affect EXTEND circuit haemodynamics in extreme premature lambs. Seventeen premature lambs were cannulated at gestational ages 105-117 days (term 145-150 days) and supported on EXTEND for up to 4 weeks. Experimental groups were distinguished by cannulation strategy: carotid artery outflow and jugular vein inflow (CA/JV; n = 4), carotid artery outflow and umbilical vein inflow (CA/UV; n = 5) and double umbilical artery outflow and umbilical vein inflow (UA/UV; n = 8). Circuit flows and pressures were measured continuously. As we transitioned from CA/JV to CA/UV to UA/UV cannulation, mean duration of circuit run and weight-adjusted circuit flows increased (P < 0.001) and the frequency of flow interruptions declined (P < 0.05). Umbilical vessels generally accommodated larger-bore cannulas, and cannula calibre was directly correlated with circuit pressures and indirectly correlated with flow:pressure ratio (a measure of post-membrane resistance). We conclude that UA/UV cannulation in fetal lambs on EXTEND optimizes circuit flow dynamics and flow stability and also supports circuit flows that closely approximate normal placental flow.

AB  - The generation, maturation and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are essential for the formation of alveoli during lung development. Alveoli formation is disturbed in preterm infants that develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), where collagen fibres are malformed, and perturbations to lung ECM structures may underlie BPD pathogenesis. Malformed ECM structures might result from abnormal protein cross-linking, in part attributable to the increased expression and activity of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) that have been noted in affected patient lungs, as well as in hyperoxia-based BPD animal models. The objective of the present study was to assess whether TGM2 plays a causal role in normal and aberrant lung alveolarization. Targeted deletion of Tgm2 in C57BL/6J mice increased septal thickness and reduced gas-exchange surface area in otherwise normally developing lungs. During aberrant lung alveolarization that occurred under hyperoxic conditions, collagen structures in Tgm2-/- mice were partially protected from the impact of hyperoxia, where normal dihydroxylysinonorleucine and hydroxylysylpiridinoline collagen cross-link abundance was restored; however, the lung alveolar architecture remained abnormal. Inhibition of transglutaminases (including TGM2) with cysteamine appreciably reduced transglutaminase activity in vivo, as assessed by Nepsilon -(gamma-l-glutamyl)-l-lysine abundance and TGM catalytic activity, and restored normal dihydroxylysinonorleucine and hydroxylysylpiridinoline collagen cross-link abundance under pathological conditions. Furthermore, a moderate improvement in alveoli size and gas-exchange surface density was noted in cysteamine-treated mouse lungs in which BPD was modelled. These data indicate that TGM2 plays a role in normal lung alveolarization, and contributes to the formation of aberrant ECM structures during disordered lung alveolarization.

AB  - The L-arginine/NO pathway is an important regulator of pulmonary hypertension, the leading cause of mortality in patients with the chronic lung disease of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia. L-arginine can be metabolized by NO synthase (NOS) to form L-citrulline and NO, a potent vasodilator. Alternatively, L-arginine can be metabolized by arginase to form urea and L-ornithine, a precursor to collagen and proline formation important in vascular remodelling. In the current study, we hypothesized that C3H/HeN mice exposed to prolonged hyperoxia would have increased arginase expression and pulmonary vascular wall cell proliferation. C3H/HeN mice were exposed to 14 days of 85% O2 or room air and lung homogenates analyzed by western blot for protein levels of arginase I, arginase II, endothelial NOS (eNOS), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Hyperoxia did not change arginase I or eNOS protein levels. However, arginase II protein levels were 15-fold greater after hyperoxia exposure than in lungs exposed to room air. Greater protein levels of ODC and OAT were found in lungs following hyperoxic exposure than in room air animals. alpha-SMA protein levels were found to be 7-fold greater in the hyperoxia exposed lungs than in room air lungs. In the hyperoxia exposed lungs there was evidence of greater pulmonary vascular wall cell proliferation by alpha-SMA immunohistochemistry than in room air lungs. Taken together, these data are consistent with a more proliferative vascular phenotype, and may explain the propensity of patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia to develop pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - Life-saving mechanical ventilation can also cause lung injury through the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-like symptoms in preterm infants. It is reported that the autophagic protein microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain (LC)-3B can confer protection against hyperoxia-induced DNA damage in lung alveolar epithelium. However, its role in the transdifferentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) to type I cells (AECIs) is unclear and requires further investigation. In this study, newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 90% oxygen for up to 14 days to mimic BPD in human infants, with neonatal pups exposed to room air (21% oxygen) as controls. Primary rat AECIIs were cultured under hyperoxic conditions for up to 24 hours to further investigate the underlying mechanisms. This study found that hyperoxia promoted a significant and time-dependent increase of AECII marker surfactant protein (SP)-C in the lung. The increase of AECI marker T1alpha was repressed by hyperoxia during lung development. These results indicated an impaired AECII transdifferentiation. Pulmonary ROS concentration and expression of autophagic protein LC-3B were increased gradually in response to hyperoxia exposure. Furthermore, AECIIs produced more ROS when cultured under hyperoxic conditions in vitro. Both the LC3B expression and the conversion from LC3BI to LC3BII were enhanced in hyperoxic AECs. Interestingly, inhibition of LC3B either by ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) or adenovirus-mediated LC3B shRNA could partly restore AECII transdifferentiation under hyperoxia condition. In summary, the current study reveals a novel role of activated LC3B induced by hyperoxia in AECII transdifferentiation. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Infants with a history of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia have a high risk of asthma and viral-induced exacerbations later in life. We hypothesized that hyperoxic exposure, a predisposing factor to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, modulates the innate immune response, producing an exaggerated proinflammatory reaction to viral infection. Two- to 3-d-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 d. Mice were infected intranasally with rhinovirus (RV) immediately after O2 exposure. Lung mRNA and protein expression, histology, dendritic cells (DCs), and airway responsiveness were assessed 1-12 d postinfection. Tracheal aspirates from premature human infants were collected for mRNA detection. Hyperoxia increased lung IL-12 expression, which persisted up to 12 d postexposure. Hyperoxia-exposed RV-infected mice showed further increases in IL-12 and increased expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, as well as increased airway inflammation and responsiveness. In RV-infected, air-exposed mice, the response was not significant. Induced IL-12 expression in hyperoxia-exposed, RV-infected mice was associated with increased IL-12-producing CD103(+) lung DCs. Hyperoxia also increased expression of Clec9a, a CD103(+) DC-specific damaged cell-recognition molecule. Hyperoxia increased levels of ATP metabolites and expression of adenosine receptor A1, further evidence of cell damage and related signaling. In human preterm infants, tracheal aspirate Clec9a expression positively correlated with the level of prematurity. Hyperoxic exposure increases the activation of CD103(+), Clec9a(+) DCs, leading to increased inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness upon RV infection. In premature infants, danger signal-induced DC activation may promote proinflammatory airway responses, thereby increasing respiratory morbidity.

AB  - Oxygen supplementation in preterm infants disrupts alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cell proliferation through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, newborn mice are used to understand how hyperoxia stimulates an early aberrant wave of AT2 cell proliferation that occurs between Postnatal Days (PNDs) 0 and 4. RNA-sequencing analysis of AT2 cells isolated from PND4 mice revealed hyperoxia stimulates expression of mitochondrial-specific methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 and other genes involved in mitochondrial one-carbon coupled folate metabolism and serine synthesis. The same genes are induced when AT2 cells normally proliferate on PND7 and when they proliferate in response to the mitogen fibroblast growth factor 7. However, hyperoxia selectively stimulated their expression via the stress-responsive activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Administration of the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia suppressed ATF4 and thus early AT2 cell proliferation, but it had no effect on normative AT2 cell proliferation seen on PND7. Because ATF4 and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase are detected in hyperplastic AT2 cells of preterm infant humans and baboons with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, dampening mitochondrial oxidative stress and ATF4 activation may provide new opportunities for controlling excess AT2 cell proliferation in neonatal lung disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of tracheally delivered mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on lung pathology in a hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) model in neonatal rats., METHODS: For the HILI model, rat pups were exposed to 85-95% oxygen during the first 10 days of life. Rats were divided into six groups: room-air normoxia (n = 11); room air, sham (n = 11); hyperoxia exposed with normal saline as placebo (n = 9); hyperoxia exposed with culture medium of MSC (n = 10); hyperoxia exposed with medium remaining after harvesting of MSC (n = 8); and hyperoxia exposed with MSC (n = 17). Pathologic changes, number and diameter of alveoli, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and localization of MSC in the lungs were assessed., RESULTS: Number of alveoli increased and alveolar diameter decreased in the mesenchymal stem cell group so that there were no differences when compared with the normoxia group (P = 0.126 and P = 0.715, respectively). Expression of alpha-SMA decreased significantly in the mesenchymal stem cell group compared with the placebo group (P < 0001). Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were found in lung tissue from all rats given MSC. Some green fluorescent protein-positive MSC also expressed surfactant protein-C., CONCLUSION: Mesenchymal stem cells became localized in damaged lung tissue, and recovery approximated the room air control.

AB  - AIM: The role of inflammation in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) survivors is indistinct. We evaluated lung function in relation to inflammatory markers in plasma, exhaled breath condensate and exhaled air in school-aged very low birthweight (VLBW) survivors with and without radiographic BPD., METHODS: Pre- and postbronchodilator impulse oscillometry were performed by 21 six to 14-year-old VLBW children with radiographic BPD, 19 VLBW children without radiographic BPD and 19 age-matched nonasthmatic term controls. Eosinophilic cationic protein, interleukins 6 and 8, adiponectin, adipsin, leptin and resistin in plasma, leukotriene B4 and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate, and bronchial and alveolar nitric oxide output were measured., RESULTS: Abnormal lung function was found in 12.5% of the former VLBW children. Airway resistance at 5 Hz was highest in the radiographic BPD, but bronchodilator responses were most prominent in the non-BPD group. Plasma adiponectin had a modest positive correlation with obstruction and with bronchodilator responses, and alveolar nitric oxide and plasma interleukin 6 with bronchodilator responses., CONCLUSION: Very low birthweight children with radiographic BPD had poorest lung function. The most pronounced bronchodilator responses were found in VLBW children without radiographic BPD. Current detected inflammatory markers had only a minor association with lung function in school-aged BPD survivors. Copyright ©2014 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Maternal food restriction (MFR) causes intrauterine growth restriction, a known risk factor for developing chronic lung disease. However, it is unknown whether this negative outcome is gender specific or preventable by blocking the MFR-induced hyperglucocorticoidism. Using a well-established rat model, we used metyrapone (MTP), an inhibitor of glucocorticoid synthesis, to study the MFR-induced lung changes on postnatal day (p) 21 in a gender-specific manner. From embryonic day 10 until delivery, pregnant dams were fed either an ad libitum diet or a 50% caloric restricted diet with or without MTP supplementation. Postnatally, the offspring were fed ad libitum from healthy dams until p21. Morphometric, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis of the lungs demonstrated that MTP mitigated the MFR-mediated decrease in alveolar count, decrease in adipogenic protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, increase in myogenic proteins (fibronectin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and calponin), increase in Wnt signaling intermediates (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 and beta-catenin), and increase in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels. The MFR-induced lung phenotype and the effects of MTP were similar in both genders. To elucidate the mechanism of MFR-induced shift of the adipogenic-to-myogenic phenotype, lung fibroblasts were used to independently study the effects of (1) nutrient restriction and (2) excess steroid exposure. Nutrient deprivation increased myogenic proteins, Wnt signaling intermediates, and GR, all changes blocked by protein supplementation. MTP also blocked, likely by normalizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate levels, the corticosterone-induced increase in myogenic proteins, but had no effect on GR levels. In summary, protein restriction and increased glucocorticoid levels appear to be the key players in MFR-induced lung disease, affecting both genders. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Pulmonary vascular diseases of the newborn comprise a wide range of pathological conditions with developmental abnormalities in the pulmonary vasculature. Clinically, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) is characterized by persistent increased resistance of the vasculature and abnormal vascular response. The classification of PH is primarily based on clinical parameters instead of morphology and distinguishes five groups of PH. Congenital lung anomalies, such as alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD) and PH associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), but also bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are classified in group three. Clearly, tight and correct regulation of pulmonary vascular development is crucial for normal lung development. Human and animal model systems have increased our knowledge and make it possible to identify and characterize affected pathways and study pivotal genes. Understanding of the normal development of the pulmonary vasculature will give new insights in the origin of the spectrum of rare diseases, such as CDH, ACD, and BPD, which render a significant clinical problem in neonatal intensive care units around the world. In this review, we describe normal pulmonary vascular development, and focus on four diseases of the newborn in which abnormal pulmonary vascular development play a critical role in morbidity and mortality. In the future perspective, we indicate the lines of research that seem to be very promising for elucidating the molecular pathways involved in the origin of congenital pulmonary vascular disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma gelsolin is a circulating actin-binding protein that has a protective role against tissue injuries. Our aim was to compare the baseline levels of gelsolin in premature infants with neonatal outcomes., METHODS: A total of 32 preterm neonates born at 23-32 weeks of gestation were enrolled in the study., RESULTS: Plasma gelsolin levels at 72 h were significantly lower in patients with respiratory distress syndrome, in patients who were administered surfactant therapy and in patients who developed sepsis (P < 0.05). Plasma gelsolin levels at 28 days were significantly lower in patients who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Low plasma gelsolin levels in the first postnatal month may be associated with poor outcomes in premature infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the clinical importance of chorionicity in twin pregnancies has been studied widely, the significance of perinatal determination of zygosity using molecular genetic analyses remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and clinical significance of twin gestations according to zygosity and chorionicity in a Korean population., METHODS: We enrolled 569 women who delivered twin newborns (> 24 weeks) at Seoul National University Hospital between 1999 and 2008. Chorionicity was established by histologic examination of placentae. Zygosity was determined with sex of neonates, chorionicity, and DNA analysis of umbilical cord blood., RESULTS: The frequency of dizygotic (DZ) twins was 71.0% (404/569 pairs) based on the opposite sex (238/404 [58.9%]) and DNA analyses (166/404 [41.1%]); that of monozygotic (MZ) twins was 29.0% (165/569), including monochorionic (MC) (72.1% [119/165]) and dichorionic (DC) twins (27.9% [46/165]), which was confirmed by DNA analyses. Among spontaneously conceived twins, the frequency of MZ twins was more than twice that of DZ twins. The risk of low birth weight was 1.8-fold higher among MZDC twins and 1.9-fold higher among MZMC twins than among DZDC twins (p < .05). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurred more frequently among MZMC twins than among DZDC twins (adjusted OR 8.42, 95% CI 1.82-39.08, p < .01). However, the frequencies of other neonatal morbidities were not significantly higher in the MZMC group than in the MZDC and DZDC groups. The perinatal mortality rate was 15 per 1000 total births in the DZDC twins, 20 per 1000 total births in the MZDC and 56 per 1000 total births in the MZMC (p < .01)., CONCLUSIONS: Although monozygosity was shown to be a risk factor for perinatal death and accurate determination of zygosity plays a great role in the future consideration of organ transplantation and twin studies, the value of zygosity determination along with chorionicity in relation to overall neonatal morbidity was not definite.

AB  - Paracrine signaling from lung epithelium to the surrounding mesenchyme is important for lung SMC development and function and is a contributing factor in an array of pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. Wnt7b, which is exclusively expressed in the lung epithelium, is important for lung vascular smooth muscle integrity, but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates lung SMC development is unclear. In this report, we have demonstrated that Wnt7b regulates a program of mesenchymal differentiation in the mouse lung that is essential for SMC development. Genetic loss-of-function studies showed that Wnt7b and beta-catenin were required for expression of Pdgfralpha and Pdgfrbeta and proliferation in pulmonary SMC precursors. In contrast, gain-of-function studies showed that activation of Wnt signaling increased the expression of both Pdgfralpha and Pdgfrbeta as well as the proliferation of SMC precursors. We further showed that the effect on Pdgfr expression was, in part, mediated by direct transcriptional regulation of the ECM protein tenascin C (Tnc), which was necessary and sufficient for Pdgfralpha/beta expression in lung explants. Moreover, this pathway was highly upregulated in a mouse model of asthma and in lung tissue from patients with pulmonary hypertension. Together, these data define a Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr signaling axis that is critical for smooth muscle development and disease progression in the lung.

AB  - Despite a shift to noninvasive respiratory support, mechanical ventilation remains an essential tool in the care of critically ill neonates. The availability of a variety of technologically advanced devices with a host of available modes and confusing terminology presents a daunting challenge to the practicing neonatologist. Many of the available modes have not been adequately evaluated in newborn infants and there is paucity of information on the relative merits of those modes that have been studied. This review examines the special challenges of ventilating the extremely low birth weight infants that now constitute an increasing proportion of ventilated infants, attempts to provide a simple functional classification of ventilator modes and addresses the key aspects of synchronized ventilation modes. The rationale for volume-targeted ventilation is presented, the available modes are described and the importance of the open-lung strategy is emphasized. The available literature on volume-targeted modalities is reviewed in detail and general recommendations for their clinical application are provided. Volume guarantee has been studied most extensively and shown to reduce excessively large tidal volumes, decrease incidence of inadvertent hyperventilation, reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines. It remains to be seen whether the demonstrated short-term benefits translate into significant reduction in chronic lung disease. Avoidance of mechanical ventilation by means of early continuous positive airway pressure with or without surfactant administration may still be the most effective way to reduce the risk of lung injury. For babies who do require mechanical ventilation, the combination of volume-targeted ventilation, combined with the open-lung strategy appears to offer the best chance of reducing the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Increased activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB in the neutrophils has been associated with the pathogenesis of sepsis, acute lung injury (ALI), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and other neutrophil-mediated inflammatory disorders. Despite recent progress in analyzing early NFkappaB activation in human neutrophils, activation of NFkappaB in persistently stimulated neutrophils has not been previously studied. Because it is the persistent NFkappaB activation that is thought to be involved in the host response to sepsis and the pathogenesis of ALI and BPD, we hypothesized that continuously stimulated human neutrophils may exhibit a late phase of NFkappaB activity. The goal of this study was to analyze the NFkappaB activation and expression of IkappaB and NFkappaB proteins during neutrophil stimulation with inflammatory signals for prolonged times. We demonstrate that neutrophil stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) induces, in addition to the early activation at 30-60 min, a previously unrecognized late phase of NFkappaB activation. In LPS-stimulated neutrophils, this NFkappaB activity typically had a biphasic character, whereas TNFalpha-stimulated neutrophils exhibited a continuous NFkappaB activity peaking around 9 h after stimulation. In contrast to the early NFkappaB activation that inversely correlates to the nuclear levels of IkappaBalpha, however, in continuously stimulated neutrophils, NFkappaB is persistently activated despite considerable levels of IkappaBalpha present in the nucleus. Our data suggest that NFkappaB is persistently activated in human neutrophils during neutrophil-mediated inflammatory disorders, and this persistent NFkappaB activity may represent one of the underlying mechanisms for the continuous production of proinflammatory mediators.

AB  - Understanding how lung progenitor cells balance proliferation against differentiation is relevant to clinical disorders such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia of premature babies and lung cancer. Previous studies have established that lung development is severely disrupted in mouse mutants with reduced levels of the proto-oncogene Nmyc, but the precise mechanisms involved have not been explored. We show here that Nmyc expression in the embryonic lung is normally restricted to a distal population of undifferentiated epithelial cells, a high proportion of which are in the S phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of NmycEGFP in the epithelium under the control of surfactant protein C (Sftpc) regulatory elements expands the domain of S phase cells and upregulates numerous genes associated with growth and metabolism, as shown by transcriptional microarray. In addition, there is marked inhibition of differentiation, coupled with an expanded domain of expression of Sox9 protein, which is also normally restricted to the distal epithelial compartment. By contrast, conditional deletion of Nmyc leads to reduced proliferation, epithelial differentiation and high levels of apoptosis in both epithelium and mesenchyme. Unexpectedly, about 50% of embryos in which only one copy of Nmyc is deleted die perinatally, with similarly abnormal lungs. We propose a model in which Nmyc is essential in the developing lung for maintaining a distal population of undifferentiated, proliferating progenitor cells.

AB  - The lung alveolus is lined with alveolar type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells. During alveologenesis, increasing demand associated with expanding alveolar numbers is met by proliferating progenitor AT2s (pAT2). Little information exists regarding the identity of this population and their niche microenvironment. We show that during alveologenesis, Hedgehog-responsive PDGFRa(+) progenitors (also known as SCMFs) are a source of secreted trophic molecules that maintain a unique pAT2 population. SCMFs are in turn maintained by TGFbeta signaling. Compound inactivation of Alk5 TbetaR2 in SCMFs reduced their numbers and depleted the pAT2 pool without impacting differentiation of daughter cells. In lungs of preterm infants who died with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, PDGFRa is reduced and the number of proliferative AT2s is diminished, indicating that an evolutionarily conserved mechanism governs pAT2 behavior during alveologenesis. SCMFs are a transient cell population, active only during alveologenesis, making them a unique stage-specific niche mesodermal cell type in mammalian organs. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Recent data suggest that exogenous retinoic acid (RA), the biologically active derivative of vitamin A, can induce alveolar regeneration in a rat model of experimental emphysema. Here, we describe a mouse model of disrupted alveolar development using dexamethasone administered postnatally. We show that the effects of dexamethasone are concentration dependent, dose dependent, long lasting and result in a severe loss of alveolar surface area. When RA is administered to these animals as adults, lung architecture and the surface area per unit of body weight are completely restored to normal. This remarkable effect may be because RA is required during normal alveolar development and administering RA re-awakens gene cascades used during development. We provide evidence that RA is required during alveologenesis in the mouse by showing that the levels of the retinoid binding proteins, the RA receptors and two RA synthesizing enzymes peak postnatally. Furthermore, an inhibitor of RA synthesis, disulphiram, disrupts alveologenesis. We also show that RA is required throughout life for the maintenance of lung alveoli because when rats are deprived of dietary retinol they lose alveoli and show the features of emphysema. Alveolar regeneration with RA may therefore be an important novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of respiratory diseases characterized by a reduced gas-exchanging surface area such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema for which there are currently no treatments.

AB  - Recent data suggests that exogenous retinoic acid (RA) can induce alveolar regeneration in a mouse and a rat model of experimental emphysema and disrupted alveolar development. This may be because RA is required during normal alveolar development and the subsequent provision of RA reawakens the gene cascades used during development. Here, additional evidence that RA is required during alveologenesis in the mouse is provided by showing that disulphiram disrupts this process. A further model of disrupted alveolar development using dexamethasone administered postnatally is then described, and it is further shown that RA administered to these adult mice restores the lung architecture to normal. Alveolar regeneration with retinoic acid may therefore be an important novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of respiratory diseases characterised by a reduced gas-exchanging surface area, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature infants, which results in substantial morbidity. The pathophysiology of BPD includes oxidant injury, baro/volutrauma, and disordered lung repair. As lung development, differentiation, and repair require cell division, we hypothesized dysregulation of the cell cycle in oxygen exposure of premature infants that may contribute to the evolution of BPD. In this investigation, we studied the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) that regulate transition from G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. We report here that expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin A is modulated in premature baboons in respiratory distress. In addition, the expression of cdk1 or cdk4 was also modulated in these premature animals. The phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein was progressively decreased in 125-day animals and in 140-day animals exposed to 6 or 14 days of PRN oxygen. These results indicate that due to altered cyclin and cdk expression, the repair of injured epithelium may proceed in a disordered manner that is characteristic of BPD. Thus, altered cell cycle regulation may be an important factor in the evolution of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of premature infants who receive prolonged ventilatory support. The pathophysiology of BPD involves oxidant injury, baro/volutrauma, and disordered lung repair. Exposure of premature lung that is poorly adapted for air breathing (>3% oxygen in fetal lung) to a higher concentration of oxygen can cause significant oxidant injury. Cell growth and differentiation of the developing lung require selective and ordered cell division. As hyperoxia can increase the expression of cell-cycle checkpoints that can cause growth arrest of lung cells, in this report we examined the expression of checkpoint proteins p53 and p21 in a premature infant the baboon model of BPD. Additionally, we also determined whether enhanced apoptosis occurs in baboon BPD model. We have shown that p53 and p21 expression are increased in 125-day as well as 140-day premature baboons with BPD. We also demonstrate increased apoptosis in lung tissue of premature baboons with BPD. These results demonstrate that cell growth inhibition is a likely factor in the evolution of BPD. Additionally, lung cells may undergo increased apoptosis that can impair the repair process in the postventilatory recovery period.

AB  - Neuroendocrine cells (NEC) are abundant in fetal and neonatal lungs, but reduced in infants with hyaline membrane disease. Perinatal neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (NCH) has been reported in the hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and Wilson-Mikity syndrome. Since we are unaware of any reports on NCH in fetal inflammatory conditions, this report addresses the NEC in fetuses with congenital pneumonia. Twenty-one fetuses/neonates with congenital pneumonia, autopsied between 1995 and 2001, were compared to 21 fetuses without a congenital infection matched for gestational age. Lung sections were immunostained for chromogranin, bombesin, calcitonin, and synaptophysin. Proportions of immunopositive cells lining 20 consecutive bronchioles calculated from digital images were significantly higher in the study than the control group for chromogranin (1.8 vs. 0.8%, P = 2.4 E-06), calcitonin (1.2 vs. 0.7%, P = 0.005), and bombesin (1.1 vs. 0.7%, P = 0.005). There was no difference in synaptophysin (11.7% vs. 12.6%, P = 0.07). The absence of significant differences in the synaptophysin ratio excludes simple NCH in the study group. The synchronous increase in three neurohormones is indicative of NEC hyperfunction, due to either altered enzymatic inactivation by neutral endopeptidase, known to be reduced in adult lung inflammation, or by an increase in expression of the neurohormone genes. These data indicate that NEC hyperfunction may be responsible for the deranged fetal/neonatal lung function and circulatory adaptation, and contribute to the lethality of the amniotic sac infection syndrome.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease of premature human infancy that shows pathological features comprising varying sized areas of interstitial fibrosis in association with distorted large alveolar spaces. We have previously shown that transfer of active transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 (AdTGF beta 1(223/225)) genes by adenovirus vector to embryonic lungs results in inhibition of branching morphogenesis and primitive peripheral lung development, whereas transfer to adult lungs results in progressive interstitial fibrosis. Herein we show that transfer of TGF-beta1 to newborn rat pups results in patchy areas of interstitial fibrosis developing throughout a period of 28 days after transfer. These areas of fibrosis appear alongside areas of enlarged alveolar spaces similar to the prealveoli seen at birth, suggesting that postnatal lung development and alveolarization has been inhibited. In rats treated with AdTGF beta 1(223/225), enlarged alveolar spaces were evident by day 21, and by 28 days, the mean alveolar cord length was nearly twice that in control vector or untreated rats. Hydroxyproline measurements confirmed the presence of fibrosis. These data suggest that overexpression of TGF-beta 1 during the critical period of postnatal rat lung alveolarization gives rise to pathological, biochemical, and morphological changes consistent with those seen in human bronchopulmonary dysplasia, thus inferring a pathogenic role for TGF-beta in this disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vitamin A supplementation reduces bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)/death in extremely low birth weight neonates. It was hypothesized that compared with the standard regimen of 5000 IU 3 times per week for 4 weeks, (1) a higher dose (10,000 IU 3 x per week) would increase serum retinol and retinol binding protein (RBP) and lower relative dose responses (RDR), and (2) once-per-week dosing (15,000 IU once per week) would lead to equivalent levels, RBP, and RDR., STUDY DESIGN: Extremely low birth weight neonates (n = 120) receiving O(2)/mechanical ventilation at 24 hours were randomly assigned to (1) standard, (2) higher dose, or (3) once-per-week regimens. Measures of vitamin A deficiency were serum retinol <20 microg/dL, RBP <2.5 mg/dL, and/or RDR >10% on day 28. BPD was defined as O(2)/mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age., RESULTS: Groups were similar at enrollment (median gestational age, 25 weeks; birth weight, 689 g). Possible toxicity was seen in <5%. The higher dose regimen did not increase retinol or RBP, decrease RDR, or improve outcomes. Infants in the once-per-week regimen had lower retinol levels and higher RDR without an effect on outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the standard regimen, once-per-week dosing worsened, and higher doses did not reduce, vitamin A deficiency. Therefore, the standard regimen is recommended.

AB  - Immunoreactive surfactant protein-D (SP-D) was assessed in human fetal, newborn, and adult tissues. In the fetal lung, SP-D was detected on airway surfaces by 10 weeks' gestation, staining increasing in the distal airways, decreasing in the proximal conducting airways with advancing gestation. In lungs from near-term infants and adults, SP-D was detected in Type II cells, serous cells of tracheobronchial glands, and subsets of cells lining peripheral airways. Immunostaining was decreased or absent in areas of lungs of neonates after injury to Type II cells, infection, or hemorrhage and was decreased in collapsed or unseptated airways from older infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. SP-D was also detected in many organs at all ages. SP-D was readily detected in epithelial cells and luminal material in lacrimal glands, salivary glands, pancreas, bile ducts, renal tubules, esophageal muscle and glands, parietal cells of the stomach, crypts of Lieberkuhn, sebaceous and eccrine sweat glands, Von Ebner's glands, endocervical glands, seminal vesicles, adrenal cortex, myocardium, and anterior pituitary gland. SP-D is a widely distributed member of the "collectin" family of polypeptides secreted onto luminal surfaces by epithelial cells lining ducts of many organs, where it likely plays a role in innate host defense.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes serious respiratory illness in preterm children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial, 21 children received one dose of PFP-2 (purified fusion [F] protein) vaccine or influenza vaccine (placebo). Children were followed for adverse reactions and RSV illness over two respiratory seasons. Sera were obtained for determination of IgG titers to RSV F protein and neutralizing antibody titers before and 1, 6, and 12 months after vaccination. Adverse reactions were few. Four-fold F protein rises occurred in 9 of 10 PFP-2 and 0 of 11 placebo recipients. Six PFP-2 recipients had low prevaccination neutralizing antibody titers (< 1:450); all had 4-fold rises. By 12 months, F protein and neutralizing antibody titers in all 21 children were similar. RSV illness occurred in 6 of 11 placebo versus 1 of 10 PFP-2 recipients (P = .06); 1 placebo child required hospitalization. PFP-2 vaccine appears safe and immunogenic and may protect children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia against serious RSV disease on reinfection.

AB  - The efficacy of antioxidant enzymes to limit oxidant lung injury by instillation with surfactant mixtures in preterm infants with hyaline membrane disease is under investigation. However, there is concern that instillation of proteins in the alveolar space may inactivate pulmonary surfactant. We studied the effects of bovine copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) on the biophysical properties of two distinct surfactant preparations. Incubation of calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE, 1 mg phospholipid/ml) and Exosurf (0.1 mg phospholipid/ml) with CuZn-SOD (1-10 mg/ml) prevented the fall of surface tension at minimal bubble radius (Tmin) to low values with dynamic compression in a pulsating bubble surfactometer. CuZn-SOD also enhanced the sensitivity to inactivation by albumin, normal human serum, and after treatment with peroxynitrite. The inhibitory effects of CuZn-SOD on CLSE, but not Exosurf, were abolished at high lipid concentrations (3 mg/ml) and after the addition of human surfactant protein A (by weight). We conclude that CuZn-SOD may interfere with the surface activity of surfactant mixtures, leading to decreased effectiveness of surfactant replacement therapy.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious chronic respiratory disease that predominates in the neonatal period. Currently, efficacious and effective specific treatments are lacking. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has emerged as a promising option for treating BPD. However, the lower cell survival rate limits its therapeutic efficacy. Hypoxic preconditioning is a direct and effective strategy for promoting MSCs survival, proliferation, and paracrine secretion in the recipient after transplantation, which is greatly important to tissue engineering. We investigated whether hypoxia-pretreated MSCs (HPMSCs) confer superior benefit in an experimental BPD rat model. Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 80-85% O2 for 14 days. Before tracheal transplantation, the MSCs were pretreated for 48 h with deferoxamine, a chemical hypoxia-mimicking agent. In vitro, the HPMSCs reduced the apoptosis rare, caspase-3 expression, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and promoted proliferation, hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression, VEGF secretion, and human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation (p < 0.05). In vivo, the HPMSCs restored alveolar structure and lung function, ameliorated pulmonary hypertension, increased vessel density in the BPD rat model (p < 0.05). This work demonstrates for the first time that HPMSCs could have a markedly improved therapeutic effect in BPD, presenting a new potential strategy for the clinical implementation of stem cell biotechnology.

AB  - Pulmonary oxygen injury is classified by the development of tissue and alveolar edema, surfactant dysfunction, lung inflammation, and decreased pulmonary compliance. In neonates prolonged oxygen therapy is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Recombinant DNA technology makes it possible to experimentally explore the role of specific proteins in the development of pulmonary oxygen injury. However, in vivo experiments require sensitive ways of identifying pulmonary oxygen injury early in its development. We therefore compared the sensitivities of several experimental assays used to assess pulmonary injury. We found that changes in pulmonary compliance were the most sensitive and showed significant differences after 72 hr of exposure to normobaric hyperoxia (FiO2 = 0.95), which correlated with a small change in the histology of the mice lungs. The concentration of protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was less sensitive and did not differ significantly until after 96 hr of exposure. The survival in hyperoxia also did not worsen until after 96 hr. The lung wet/ dry weight ratios was the least sensitive assay and did not increase until after 5 days of exposure to normobaric hyperoxia. We conclude that a decrease in pulmonary compliance is an early indicator of pulmonary oxygen injury and may be a better way to study the mechanisms and mediators of pulmonary oxygen injury.

AB  - A premature boy who had suffered from IRDS, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity developed massive hypertriglyceridemia (48.1 mmol/L) together with moderate hypercholesterolemia (12.6 mmol/L) at 5 months of age. Lipoprotein electrophoresis revealed a marked elevation of the level of the very low density lipoprotein fraction. There was a moderate decrease in the activity of a lipolytic enzyme, lipoprotein lipase (LPL). The child had neither liver or renal disorder nor any inflammatory disease. The hyperlipidemia disappeared spontaneously at the age of 3 years. The cause of the decreased LPL activity could not be established. A partial genetic deficiency in lipoprotein lipase appears the most likely explanation, since no signs of secondary lowering of LPL activity could be found.

AB  - To evaluate the catabolic effects of dexamethasone therapy on protein metabolism, amino acid concentrations and urinary 3-methylhistidine (3MH) were measured in 28 premature infants who were included in a double-blind controlled study using early dexamethasone therapy in the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Fifteen infants received dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg/day i.v.) and 13 infants received normal saline as control. Heparinized venous blood samples for amino acid analysis were obtained before the study and again at day 5 after starting the study. Urinary 3MH was measured on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatment. A substantial increase in amino acid concentrations was observed in infants receiving dexamethasone. Alanine, glutamine, citrulline, ornithine and cystine concentrations increased twofold or more. The 3MH:creatinine ratio was increased in the treated group. These metabolic effects were most likely due to an increase in protein catabolism.

AB  - Clara cell-specific 10-KD protein (CCSP) is an abundant product of nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells in the lung. We have determined the temporal-spatial distribution of CCSP and its mRNA in developing human lung and in neonatal lung disease, using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. CCSP immunoreactivity was found in nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells from 12 weeks of gestation onward. Tracheal and bronchial epithelia showed positive immunoreactivity at each gestational week after 15 weeks and 14 weeks, respectively. CCSP mRNA was seen in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia from 16 weeks onward and was detected in the trachea from 19 through 23 weeks of gestation. CCSP immunoreactivity and mRNA were present in nonciliated single cells of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia in fetuses and in infants with and without lung disease. CCSP- and CCSP mRNA-containing epithelial cells also formed dusters around neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), especially at airway branch points, suggesting that NEBs and Clara cells might interact during development and during pulmonary regeneration. Because of evidence of overlapping of some but not all cells expressing CCSP, SP-A, and pro-SP-B during lung development, a common cell lineage is proposed, with subsequent divergence of phenotypes.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced lung disease is associated with prominent intraalveolar fibrin deposition. Fibrin turnover is tightly regulated by the concerted action of proteases and antiproteases, and inhibition of plasmin-mediated proteolysis could account for fibrin accumulation in lung alveoli. We show here that lungs of mice exposed to hyperoxia overproduce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and that PAI-1 upregulation impairs fibrinolytic activity in the alveolar compartment. To explore whether increased PAI-1 production is a causal or only a correlative event for impaired intraalveolar fibrinolysis and the development of hyaline membrane disease, we studied mice genetically deficient in PAI-1. We found that these mice fail to develop intraalveolar fibrin deposits in response to hyperoxia and that they are more resistant to the lethal effects of hyperoxic stress. These observations provide clear and novel evidence for the pathogenic contribution of PAI-1 in the development of hyaline membrane disease. They identify PAI-1 as a major deleterious mediator of hyperoxic lung injury.

AB  - We attempted to clarify the possible pathophysiological significance of eosinophilia in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The subjects studied were 17 premature infants, i.e. seven with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) followed by bronchopulmonary dysplasia (the BPD group: four with stage IV and three with stage III BPD) and 10 infants without BPD (the non-BPD group), who comprised seven with RDS, two with meconium aspiration syndrome and one with transient tachypnea of the newborn. Peripheral eosinophil counts, the number of nuclei of eosinophils and serum eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) levels, and ECP and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) elastase levels of intratracheal aspirates (TA) were determined once a week during the first 4 weeks of life. Peripheral eosinophil counts were higher in infants with BPD than those in the non-BPD group. Hypersegmented nuclei of peripheral eosinophils with more than four nuclei were more frequently present in the infants with BPD. A good correlation was observed between peripheral eosinophil counts and serum ECP levels. ECP levels of the TA in the infants with BPD were significantly elevated. There was a good correlation between ECP and PMN elastase levels of the TA. Lung tissue specimens of two infants of the BPD group, both of whom had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), were obtained from the lower portion of the left lung when they underwent an operative procedure for PDA at 24 and 25 days of life, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining of eosinophil-derived granular major basic protein (MBP) was performed on the lung tissue specimens. Infiltration of a few MBP-staining eosinophils was observed on the specimens from both infants. Our results suggest that peripheral eosinophils in sick premature infants may be activated and appear to be correlated with the severity of BPD. Further studies will be needed to more clarify the physiological role of eosinophils in premature infants.

AB  - Despite inguinal hernia being both common and problematic in a significant proportion of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), there has been a reluctance to intervene surgically for fear of exacerbating the underlying lung disease. We report our experience of early operation in 12 consecutive infants with varying degrees of oxygen-dependent BPD and investigate the effect of general anaesthesia and herniotomy on pulmonary function by measuring oxygen requirements prior to and following operation. Two infants who required oxygen in a concentration in excess of 95% failed to improve and died from the pulmonary disease 6 and 8 weeks following their operation. The remaining infants all showed a reduction in mean oxygen requirements in the weeks following operation. We conclude that, in the short term, hernia repair performed under general anaesthesia in infants with BPD of varying severity had no adverse effects on respiratory function, as determined by oxygen requirements. We suggest that in certain infants early repair may have been beneficial--potential mechanisms are explored.

AB  - An imbalance of proteolytic enzymes and protease inhibitors may contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We studied secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (not previously addressed), and alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and elastase. Albumin was used as an internal reference. Infants with pneumonia had higher concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (p = 0.02) and elastase (p = 0.04) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than those with respiratory distress syndrome; those who also developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia had intermediate values. A decreased concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin was found in the second and third postnatal weeks (p = 0.002). Further detailed studies of the balance between proteases and protease inhibitors and of the importance of pulmonary infections in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia are suggested. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor is important both as an elastase inhibitor of bronchial mucus and as a marker of infection in the bronchi.

AB  - Twenty-three pulmonary pseudocysts were identified in 20 preterm neonates undergoing mechanically assisted ventilation. Most of the pseudocysts occurred in a right parahilar location; cysts were either single (13) or multiple/multilocular (10). The pseudocysts persisted from less than 2 days to longer than 3 months (modal duration, 7 days), and they were commonly associated with generalized pulmonary interstitial emphysema (18 of 20), pneumothorax (18 of 20), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (16 of 20), and pneumomediastinum (six of 20). The reason for the predominantly right parahilar location of these pseudocysts remains uncertain. Pulmonary pseudocysts are almost always right-sided and are associated with pulmonary interstitial emphysema and pneumothoraces; complete resolution usually occurs.

AB  - The ontogeny of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR) was evaluated immunohistochemically in 67 human fetal or newborn lungs previously analyzed for calcitonin immunoreactivity (CT-IR). CGRP-IR was present by 10 weeks of gestation in rare, solitary neuroendocrine (NE) cells of developing conducting airways in two of eight first-trimester lungs. During the second trimester, cells with CGRP-IR were found consistently (21/23 fetuses). However, the numbers of positively staining cells did not appear to increase in these fetuses or in third-trimester infants dying of non-pulmonary causes. The highest concentrations of CGRP-IR cells were seen in lungs of premature infants with advancing chronic lung disease associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). CGRP-IR was seen earlier in gestation and in greater numbers of NE cells than was calcitonin immunoreactivity (CT-IR) reported previously in these same fetal lungs (Lab Invest 52:52, 1985). Its presence paralleled that of CT-IR in postnatal chronic lung disease.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that specifically affects preterm infants. Oxygen therapy administered to treat BPD can lead to hyperoxia-induced lung injury, characterized by apoptosis of lung alveolar epithelial cells. Our epitranscriptomic microarray analysis of normal mice lungs and hyperoxia-stimulated mice lungs revealed elevated RNA expression levels of IL-33, as well as increased m6A RNA methylation levels of IL-33 and PVT1 in the hyperoxia-stimulated lungs. This study aimed to investigate the role of the PVT1/IL-33 axis in BPD. A mouse model of BPD was established through hyperoxia induction, and lung histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Parameters such as radial alveolar count and mean chord length were measured to assess lung function. Mouse and human lung alveolar epithelial cells (MLE12 and A549, respectively) were stimulated with hyperoxia to create an in vitro BPD model. Cell apoptosis was detected using Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis. Our results demonstrated that silencing PVT1 suppressed apoptosis in MLE12 and A549 cells and improved lung function in hyperoxia-stimulated lungs. Additionally, IL-33 reversed the effects of PVT1 both in vivo and in vitro. Through online bioinformatics analysis and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays, YTHDC1 was identified as a RNA-binding protein (RBP) for both PVT1 and IL-33. We found that PVT1 positively regulated IL-33 expression by recruiting YTHDC1 to mediate m6A modification of IL-33. In conclusion, silencing PVT1 demonstrated beneficial effects in alleviating BPD by facilitating YTHDC1-mediated m6A modification of IL-33. Inhibition of the PVT1/IL-33 axis to suppress apoptosis in lung alveolar epithelial cells may hold promise as a therapeutic approach for managing hyperoxia-induced lung injury in BPD.

AB  - Arterial PO2 and PCO2 obtained with 2 modes of mechanical ventilation were compared in 5 premature monkeys with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) during the first 7 h of life. High-frequency oscillation (HFO) (10 Hertz) was compared with conventional positive-pressure ventilation (CMV) by matching the mean airway pressure generated by the 2 systems. Each animal served as its own control; HFO sustained an improved PaCO2 (39 +/- 8 versus 25 +/- 7 mmHg). An insignificant improvement in arterial PO2 was noted. The improved CO2 exchange occurred with a lower peak airway pressure (35 +/- 4 versus 23 +/- 11 cm H2O). Comparison of the postmortem pressure-volume curves and lung and lavage phospholipid concentrations from the animals treated with HFO in the current study to a matched set of animals treated exclusively with CMV in a previous study failed to reveal any differences. We conclude that HFO is effective in eliminating CO2 in experimental HMD without apparently altering lung biochemical or mechanical properties in a manner different from that found with CMV.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This work was splitted in two parts: the first one was the study of retinopathy incidence in premature infants less than 33 weeks gestation, born between 1988 and 1997; the second one is the identification of severe retinopathy different risk factors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study was retrospective over ten years. All premature infants less than 33 weeks gestation born between January 1, 1988 and December 31 1997, admitted to the Strasbourg neonatal intensive care unit with retinopathy, were included (164 children). First we studied the incidence evolution of retinopathy over these ten years; then by a statistical study (univaried and multivaried) we looked for a significant difference for several factors between the infants with mild retinopathy and the group with severe ocular disease., RESULTS: Retinopathy incidence decreased in ten years from 13.7 to 6.7% for the moderate forms (P < 0.001) and from 3.7 to 1.7% for severe stage (non significant). A significant difference was found for various factors after comparison between both groups. The birth weight (P = 5 x 10(-4)), the gestational age (P = 4 x 10(-6)), were weaker in the group with severe retinopathy. A maternofetal or nosocomial infection (P = 0.009; P = 0.002), hemodynamic shock (P = 10(-6)), patent ductus arteriosus (P = 10(-6)), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P = 3 x 10(-6)), postnatal steroid treatment (P = 0.007), respiratory distress syndrome (P = 0.01), were all more frequent in the severe retinopathy sample. The number of days with oxygenotherapy (P = 10(-6)) and mechanical ventilation (P = 10(-6)) the number of blood transfusion (P = 10(-5)) were higher in this group than in the other. The logistic regression analysis showed that the hemodynamic parameters influence mostly on the risk of severe ocular disease, like an hemodynamic shock syndrome (OR = 16.94; CI = 2.12-135.77) or a patent ductus arteriosus (OR = 5.36; CI = 1.53-18.74)., CONCLUSION: A decrease of the retinopathy incidence in premature infants was observed in ten years, probably due to better care in the neonatal period. An unstable hemodynamic state would be one prominent risk factor in the genesis of severe retinopathy of prematurity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this population-based study was firstly to compare the neuro-developmental outcome at one and two years of very preterm infants, and secondly, to identify the risk factors for a misdiagnosis of cerebral impairment at the age of one year., POPULATION AND METHODS: The preterm cohort included 203 infants born between 25 and 32 weeks of gestational age in the region of Franche-Comte (France) during a two-year period. The control group included 196 full-term infants born in the same maternity wards. Neuro-developmental assessments were performed by pediatricians or physicians, both at one and two years of age, on 94% (161/171) surviving preterms and 89% (173/195) full-terms., RESULTS: There is a fair correlation between the two neurological evaluations of the control group (170/173, 98% have the same classification at the age of one and two). There is a weak correlation (kappa = 0.37) between the two neurological evaluations of the preterm group. Sixteen preterms (10%) had been classified more abnormal at one year than they were at two years. The presence of a broncho-pulmonary dysplasia, linked to male sex and extreme prematurity, was statistically linked to this first kind of misclassification. Seventeen preterms (10%) had been considered more normal at one year than they were at two years. The presence of a diplegia, family precariousness and the examination at one year of age by a general practitioner were statistically linked to this second kind of misclassification., CONCLUSION: This prospective population-based study identifies structural situations (bronchopulmonary dysplasia linked to extreme prematurity) and environmental situations (family precariousness, examiner's qualifications) linked to a misclassification of the neurological status of one-year-old former preterm infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Very low-birth-weight newborns (birth weight < or = 1500 g) experience serious neonatal complications, but long-term outcomes are not completely known. Most studies reflect an era of neonatal care that was fundamentally different from the present., OBJECTIVES: To compare the functional level of very low-birth-weight children before and after surfactant introduction and to relate functional level to clinical and socioeconomic factors., DESIGN: Inception cohort followed up from birth to an average age of 5 years., SETTING: Six regional neonatal intensive care units in a contiguous geographic area., PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred twenty-five very low-birth-weight children, born between August 1, 1988, and June 30, 1991, of 438 located among 626 whose parents provided follow-up information before neonatal intensive care unit discharge., INTERVENTIONS: None., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of cerebral palsy and standardized scores for self-care, mobility, and social function from the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory., RESULTS: Cerebral palsy was present in 12.6% of the children, with no change after surfactant introduction. Intraventricular hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.3 per grade; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-2.8) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.6) were independently predictive of cerebral palsy and of functional outcome. For self-care, mobility, and social function, 11.7%, 29.5%, and 10.7% of the children, respectively, scored at least 2 SDs below the normative means. Social function was 0.25 to 0.50 normative SDs lower after general surfactant availability than before general surfactant availability., CONCLUSIONS: While there was no increase in major disability after surfactant introduction, there may have been a decrease in social function associated with the lower neonatal mortality. Most very low-birth-weight children functioned within the normal range in everyday tasks. Several predictors of outcome were identified.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of carbon dioxide (CO2) broncholaser for treating acquired proximal tracheo-bronchial stenosis in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia., DESIGN: Retrospective study from June 1987 through August 1995, with 39 months follow-up., PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the study, 65 children were treated for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Eight of those (average age: 42.6 months) had symptomatic tracheo-bronchial stenosis; they were treated with CO2 broncholaser and represented 23.5% of all broncholaser applications. All patients presented multiple lesions. Ten symptomatic well-organized lesions (obstructive bridles or diaphragms), all accessible to broncholaser, were treated. Broncholaser was the primary treatment used, except in one case where it was used following balloon dilatation failure. An adaptable rigid fibroscope combined with a CO2 Sharplan laser was used. All interventions were performed under general anesthesia., RESULTS: Lesions not reaching the trachea's bifurcation (eight cases) disappeared following one laser session with significant clinical improvement. Lesions extending to the trachea's bifurcation (two cases) only showed partial improvement despite three laser sessions. The results remained stable throughout the follow-up period. There were no major complications., CONCLUSIONS: Broncholaser is a safe and efficient method of treating stenoses occurring in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasias. Obstructive lesions (such as bridles or diaphragms) and those which do not reach the trachea's bifurcation, give the best results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CV) are ARN-containing agents that are responsible for mild upper respiratory tract infections in adults and children. Their pathogenicity in neonates is not wellknown., POPULATION AND METHODS: Eighty five samples of tracheal or nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained from January to October 1991 from 53 children (29 less than 1 month of age; 19 from 1 month to 1 year; five older than 1 year). They were examined for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, myxovirus influenza and parainfluenza and coronavirus by immunofluorescence (IF)., RESULTS: Nineteen samples from nine newborns and three infants were positive for coronavirus. The mean birth weight of the nine neonates was 2100 +/- 840 g; their mean gestational age was 34 +/- 5 weeks and their mean age at diagnosis was 21 +/- 9 days. Apnea and bradycardia were the main symptoms in this group. Blood C-reactive protein was not elevated and blood cultures were sterile. One infant was admitted for near-miss; the two others were admitted at birth because they suffered from chronic lung disease (pulmonary hypoplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia). An acute episode of pulmonary deterioration occurred at the time of coronavirus infection. Both died one at 4 months and the other at 10 months., CONCLUSION: Coronaviruses seem to be responsible for respiratory tract infections in hospitalized neonates and chronically ventilated infants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The current evidence indicates that the severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lower in the pediatric population but local data are still limited. Objective: To characterize the clinical and epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 infection in patients younger than 18 years in Argentina., POPULATION AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational, and analytical study of confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 0-18 years seen between March 2020 and March 2021 at 19 referral children's hospitals of Argentina. A multivariate analysis was done to identify predictors of severe cases., RESULTS: A total of 2690 COVID-19 cases were included: 77.7% lived in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires; 50.1% were males; patients' median age was 5.6 years. Of them, 90% were seen during epidemiological weeks 20-47 of 2020; 60.4% had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients; and 96.6% in their family setting. Also, 51.4% had respiratory symptoms; 61.6%, general symptoms; 18.8%, gastrointestinal symptoms; 17.1%, neurological symptoms; 7.2%, other symptoms; and 21.5% were asymptomatic. In addition, 59.4% of patients were hospitalized and 7.4% had a severe or critical course. A total of 57 patients developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome. A history of asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, moderate to severe malnutrition, obesity, chronic neurological disease and/or age younger than 6 months were independent predictors of severity. Living in a vulnerable neighborhood was a protective factor., CONCLUSIONS: More than half of cases referred a history of contact with COVID-19 patients in the family setting. Hospitalization was not based on clinical criteria of severity. Severity was associated with the presence of certain comorbidities.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has the main manifestations of pulmonary edema in the early stage and characteristic alveolar obstruction and microvascular dysplasia in the late stage, which may be caused by structural and functional destruction of the lung epithelial barrier. The Claudin family is the main component of tight junction and plays an important role in regulating the permeability of paracellular ions and solutes. Claudin-18 is the only known tight junction protein solely expressed in the lung. The lack of Claudin-18 can lead to barrier dysfunction and impaired alveolar development, and the knockout of Claudin-18 can cause characteristic histopathological changes of BPD. This article elaborates on the important role of Claudin-18 in the development and progression of BPD from the aspects of lung epithelial permeability, alveolar development, and progenitor cell homeostasis, so as to provide new ideas for the pathogenesis and clinical treatment of BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity. The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes., OBJECTIVES: Primary objective To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates. Secondary objectives 1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity). 2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age. 3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance. 4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2ViewTM), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014., SELECTION CRITERIA: Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group., MAIN RESULTS: One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n =12)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether outcome improvements achieved by neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ) trial could be reproduced in other NICUs by providing quality improvement (QI) training and practice change guidelines developed during the EPIQ trial; and to examine whether the results of the EPIQ trial were sustained., METHODS: The present prospective before-after study included 5812 infants born at <=32 weeks' gestation and admitted to 19 level 3 NICUs in the Canadian Neonatal Network between October 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007. During a three-month baseline period, multi-disciplinary teams received general training in QI techniques at a two-day workshop, and practice change guidelines targeting nosocomial infection (NI) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) developed during the EPIQ trial were provided to all participants. Outcome data collected during the intervention period were compared with data from the baseline period and reported quarterly., RESULTS: In NICUs that had not previously participated in the EPIQ trial (non-EPIQ NICUs), there were no significant changes in the incidence trends of NI or BPD. However, within NICUs that had previously participated in the EPIQ trial (EPIQ NICUs) there was a continued reduction in the incidence trend of NI and BPD among EPIQ NICUs randomized during the trial to reduce NI and BPD, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Providing NICUs with QI training and practice change guidelines developed during a successful QI initiative in other units is not effective. The authors speculate that successful practice change involves organizational culture and behaviour change, and should be driven by context-specific evidence.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic respiratory condition originating from preterm birth, is associated with abnormal neurodevelopment. Currently, there is an absence of effective therapies for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and its associated brain injury. In preclinical trials, mesenchymal stromal cell therapies demonstrate promise as a therapeutic alternative for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Objectives: To investigate whether a multifactorial neonatal mouse model of lung injury perturbs neural progenitor cell function and to assess the ability of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles to mitigate pulmonary and neurologic injury. Methods: Mice at Postnatal Day 7 or 8 were injected intraperitoneally with LPS and ventilated with 40% oxygen at Postnatal Day 9 or 10 for 8 hours. Treated animals received umbilical cord-mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles intratracheally preceding ventilation. Lung morphology, vascularity, and inflammation were quantified. Neural progenitor cells were isolated from the subventricular zone and hippocampus and assessed for self-renewal, in vitro differentiation ability, and transcriptional profiles. Measurements and Main Results:  The multifactorial lung injury model produced alveolar and vascular rarefaction mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Neural progenitor cells from lung injury mice showed reduced neurosphere and oligodendrocyte formation, as well as inflammatory transcriptional signatures. Mice treated with mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles showed significant improvement in lung architecture, vessel formation, and inflammatory modulation. In addition, we observed significantly increased in vitro neurosphere formation and altered neural progenitor cell transcriptional signatures. Conclusions: Our multifactorial lung injury model impairs neural progenitor cell function. Observed pulmonary and neurologic alterations are mitigated by intratracheal treatment with mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles.

AB  - The knowledge on the pathogenetic mechanisms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has increased considerably over recent years. However, the incidence of the disease has not substantially been changed by our therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the existing evidence for a number of respiratory and medical strategies to prevent or ameliorate the disease and gives recommendations for clinical practice. Oxygen plays an important pathogenetic and therapeutic role for BPD. Targeting infants at lower oxygen saturation levels than traditionally used seems to confer major advantages. There is no sufficient evidence for a routine use of respiratory strategies like permissive hypercapnia or inhaled nitric oxide to prevent BPD. Diuretics can ameliorate lung function transiently. High intramuscular doses of vitamin A can reduce the risk of BPD. Early or prophylactic surfactant might also be advantageous. Postnatal corticosteroids are effective but, due to their severe side effects, should be restricted to the severest cases. Alpha1-proteinase inhibitor and superoxide dismutase have no proven benefits for BPD. The role of erythromycin has not been completely elucidated yet. Innovative strategies like Clara Cell 10 kD protein still have to be assessed in future trials.

AB  - The possibility that a family history of asthma may have a role in susceptibility to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) had been raised in several reports, and there was evidence of a strong association between transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1) polymorphism and asthma in Taiwanese population. To test whether TAP polymorphism has a role in the BPD, we investigated the association between TAP1 polymorphism and BPD by analyzing the results of genotype distribution. The study included 224 ventilated preterm infants (<30 weeks) who had respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and needed intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) during Jan. 1999 to July 2003. The typing of TAP1 polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction analysis. The demography between two groups of these ventilated preterm infants was not different. We observed no significant differences in genotype distribution or allele frequency of the TAPI polymorphisms between BPD and their respective control infants. There was also no significant difference in genotype distribution of the TAP1 polymorphism with duration of IMV. Therefor, we conclude that TAP1 polymorphism is not a useful marker for predicting the susceptibility or severity to BPD for Taiwanese.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is a common cause of hospitalizations in children and has been increasingly identified as a risk factor in the development of asthma. Little is known about what determines the severity of RSV bronchiolitis, which may be helpful in the initial assessment of these children., DESIGN: We evaluated a variety of environmental and host factors that may contribute to the severity of RSV bronchiolitis in the RSV Bronchiolitis in Early Life prospective cohort study. Severity of bronchiolitis was based on the quantization of lowest O(2) saturation and the length of stay. These factors included the child's and family's demographics, presence of household allergens (dust mite, cat, dog, and cockroach), peripheral blood eosinophil count, immunoglobulin E level, infant feeding, prior illnesses, exposure to intrauterine and postnatal cigarette smoke, and family history of atopy., PATIENTS: We prospectively enrolled 206 hospitalized infants, all under 12 months old (4.0 +/- 3.3 months old), with their first episode of severe RSV bronchiolitis (mean O(2) saturation: 91.6 +/- 7.3%; length of stay: 2.5 +/- 2.5 days; presence of radiographic opacities: 75%). Patients were excluded for a variety of reasons including previous wheezing, regular use of bronchodilator or antiinflammatory medications, any preexisting lung disease including asthma, chronic lung disease of prematurity/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or cystic fibrosis; gastroesophageal reflux disease on medical therapy; or congenital anomalies of the chest or lung., RESULTS: Age was found to be a significant factor in the severity of infection. The younger an infant was, the more severe the infection tended to be as measured by the lowest oxygen (O(2)) saturation. We also found that infants exposed to postnatal cigarette smoke from the mother had a lower O(2) saturation than those not exposed. However, there was no significant difference in RSV bronchiolitis severity between infants exposed only to intrauterine smoke and those infants never exposed to cigarette smoke. Infants with a family history of atopy, especially a maternal history of asthma or hay fever, had a higher O(2) saturation. Although a history of maternal atopy seemed to be protective, there was no association between allergens and bronchiolitis severity, although 25% of households had elevated allergen levels. Black infants demonstrated less severe RSV bronchiolitis than their white counterparts. Multivariate analysis revealed age, race, maternal atopy, and smoking to be associated with severity of RSV bronchiolitis., CONCLUSION: The severity of RSV bronchiolitis early in life seems modified by postnatal maternal cigarette smoke exposure and atopy and age of the infant, not by levels of allergens in the home environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) exhibit prolonged elevation of inflammatory indices in their tracheal aspirates. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a central mediator of the inflammatory response. The adenine-containing alleles of TNF-alpha-308 and lymphotoxin-alpha+250 have been associated with increased levels of TNF-alpha, whereas the adenine allele of TNF-alpha-238 produces lower levels of TNF-alpha after stimulation. High levels of TNF-alpha may promote chronic inflammation by overwhelming counter-regulatory mechanisms and may lead to the development of BPD. Low levels of TNF-alpha may decrease the risk and/or severity of BPD., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether alleles of TNF-alpha play a role in the susceptibility and/or severity of BPD among very low birth weight infants., METHODS: Infants with birth weights of 0.21, n = 51) had a younger gestational age (mean +/- SD: 27 +/- 4 vs 29 +/- 2 weeks) and lower birth weight (853 +/- 184 vs 997 +/- 193 g) than did infants without BPD (n = 69). The genotypic distributions of lymphotoxin-alpha+250 and TNF-alpha-308 were comparable among the groups of infants. However, the AA and GA TNF-alpha-238 genotypes were much less likely to occur among infants with BPD than among infants without BPD. The adenine allele of TNF-alpha-238 was absent among infants with severe BPD and occurred significantly less often among infants with moderate or severe BPD, compared with infants with mild BPD. The number of adenine alleles of TNF-alpha-238 was correlated inversely with the severity of BPD (r = -.341)., CONCLUSION: The adenine allele of TNF-alpha-238 may reduce the risk and severity of BPD.

AB  - We report on a female preterm infant with hepatic failure and neonatal tissue siderosis of hemochromatotic type diagnosed by using both histochemistry and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The infant presented with meconium ileus, signs of rapidly progressive hepatic failure, and hyperferritinemia (7132 ng/ml). Despite surgery and intensive care the infant died 32 days after birth. Postmortem examination showed a wrinkled liver with extensive collapse of the hepatic architecture and regenerating nodules as well as hepatic and extrahepatic iron accumulation of hemochromatotic type, sparing the reticuloendothelial system. Atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed an increase in the iron content of various organs: liver, heart, pancreas, oral salivary gland, kidney, and adrenal gland. The increase in the iron content of various organs was determined by comparing the analysis of the propositus with those of 5 gestationally age-related preterm infants who had died in the intensive care unit: 2 died of meconium aspiration syndrome, the other 3 of hyaline membrane disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and immaturity, respectively. We also compared the analysis of 15 fetuses having a a condition predisposing to iron accumulation (trisomy 21, trisomy 18, cytomegalovirus, amnion infection syndrome, Rhesus- and ABO-incompatibility, congenital hemolysis, anti-phospholipid syndrome, congenital heart disease). Delta F508, the most frequent mutation seen in cystic fibrosis patients, was excluded by gene sequencing. Different noxae causing iron accumulation in the neonatal period have led to the statement that neonatal hemochromatosis may collect different etiologies, such as metabolic disorders, infections, chromosomal aberrations, and immunological disorders. In this study, we report the singular evidence of neonatal iron accumulation of hemochromatotic type in an infant presenting with meconium ileus and propose a classification of the neonatal disorders associated with iron accumulation.

AB  - Artificial surfactant therapy in hyaline membrane disease started in 1980 (Fujiwara). We used it in 10 children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in 12 newborns suffering from massive aspiration syndrome (MAS). In ARDS, indication was PEEP > or = 8 cmH2O, PaO2  or = 0.6. Results were rapid. A steady improvement of PaO2 was obtained in 24 hours, generally after a single administration. Three children needed additional doses. In MAS (n = 12) with PaO2 > or = 70 mmHg for FiO2 > 0.6, improvement was obtained very rapidly. Only one newborn received a second dose of surfactant 12 hours after the first one. In MAS as in ARDS all children survived.

AB  - Despite four decades of investigation, the function of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (NEC) remains unclear. Since NEC secretory products may influence airway growth or differentiation or alter airway smooth muscle tone, increased numbers of NEC seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) may be partially responsible for the genesis of the structural and pathophysiological alterations seen in this disease state. Changes in airway structure were studied in six infants dying with BPD and six conceptional age-matched control infants dying of noncardiopulmonary disease. Changes in bombesin-, calcitonin-, and serotonin-immunoreactive NEC were quantified in lung specimens from three infants who died at 2 months of age with severe BPD and three conceptional age-matched controls. There were no differences in either bronchiolar or bronchial airway epithelial areas, but significant increases in bronchiolar (1.8-fold) (P < 0.001) and especially bronchial smooth muscle (2.5-fold) (P < 0.001) were documented in infants with BPD. Few bombesin-, calcitonin-, and serotonin-immunoreactive cells were identified in cartilaginous airways; however, there was a clear increase in the total number of bronchiolar immunoreactive cells in infants with severe BPD (28.5 +/- 11.2 cells/mm airway epithelium) compared to control infants (4.5 +/- 4.9) (P < 0.05). Our results confirm that airway wall composition does change in BPD, but there is either no or an inverse correlation between NEC number and airway epithelial and smooth muscle areas and cell numbers. The role of NEC secretory products in airway smooth muscle growth and function requires further investigation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common pulmonary complication in preterm infants that leads to fibrosis of the bronchoalveolar walls and often to severe clinical consequences. Type III collagen is deposited early in progressive fibrosis. Because the N-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP), a by-product of type III collagen synthesis, reflects the degree of pulmonary fibrosis in adults, we hypothesized that PIIINP in tracheal aspirates and/or serum may be a useful early marker of developing BPD in neonates. We serially measured PIIINP in tracheal fluid and serum samples during the first weeks of life in 41 consecutive respirator-treated preterm infants (mean birth weight 1067 g, mean gestational age 28.3 wk). Eight of the infants died and 22 infants fulfilled the criteria for BPD at age 28 d. The mean level of PIIINP decreased with advancing postnatal age in tracheal fluid but not in serum. The mean tracheal fluid PIIINP during d 1 and 2 of life, respectively, was 175 and 200 ng/mg protein in infants who were still in a respirator at age 28 d (n = 13), 122 and 97 ng/mg protein in those who were weaned earlier (n = 20), and 50 and 30 ng/mg protein in those who died before age 28 d (n = 8). These differences are not statistically significant, and the variability of the values was large. The PIIINP concentrations in tracheal aspirates of infants subsequently developing BPD did not differ from those without BPD. Neither did the levels correlate with the degree of BPD or radiologically defined fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current techniques to diagnose and/or monitor critically ill neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) require invasive sampling of body fluids, which is suboptimal in these frail neonates. We tested our hypothesis that it is feasible to use noninvasively collected urine samples for proteomics from extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs) at risk for BPD to confirm previously identified proteins and biomarkers associated with BPD., METHODS: We developed a robust high-throughput urine proteomics methodology that requires only 50 muL of urine. We utilized the methodology with a proof-of-concept study validating proteins previously identified in invasively collected sample types such as blood and/or tracheal aspirates on urine collected within 72 h of birth from ELGANs (gestational age [26 +/- 1.2] weeks) who were admitted to a single Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), half of whom eventually developed BPD (n = 21), while the other half served as controls (n = 21)., RESULTS: Our high-throughput urine proteomics approach clearly identified several BPD-associated changes in the urine proteome recapitulating expected blood proteome changes, and several urinary proteins predicted BPD risk. Interestingly, 16 of the identified urinary proteins are known targets of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration., CONCLUSION: In addition to validating numerous proteins, previously found in invasively collected blood, tracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage, that have been implicated in BPD pathophysiology, urine proteomics also suggested novel potential therapeutic targets. Ease of access to urine could allow for sequential proteomic evaluations for longitudinal monitoring of disease progression and impact of therapeutic intervention in future studies.

AB  - Measurements of thyroxin (T4), thyroxin-binding globulin (TBG) and TSH were carried out in 34 full-term newborns, 21 prematures and 11 neonates with respiratory distress (6 with hyaline membrane disease) at 5 days of age. In cases with neonatal respiratory distress and to a lesser extent in prematures, low T4 due to a decrease of TBG was found, TSH being identical in all groups. The positive correlation between TBG and transferrin suggests a disturbance in hepatic synthesis. The authors conclude that, in cases with neonatal respiratory distress, low T4 does not mean hypothyroidism and does not require a treatment, provided TSH remains within normal limits.

AB  - Despite advances in the management of preterm infants, neonatal infections and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remain important causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Over one-fifth (21%) of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants have at least one episode of late-onset culture-proven sepsis. These infants require prolonged hospital stay and have significantly higher chances of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia and adverse neurodevelopmental complications during infancy and early childhood. Preterm infants with NEC also have 3-fold increased risks of mortality compared with those who did not have the disease. However, early clinical features of infection and NEC are often subtle, non-specific and difficult to recognise. Further, non-infected infants such as those with apnoea of prematurity, acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease, functional gastrointestinal dysmotility and ileus are often clinically indistinguishable from infants who are in the early stages of sepsis or NEC. Hence, there is considerable interest in studying biomarkers of infection that can reliably differentiate between infected and non-infected infants. With increasing understanding of the inflammatory cascade of sepsis and rapid advances in diagnostic technologies, many potential infection markers have been investigated. We examine the research in this area and focus on major developments in recent years. Recent research has led to the discovery of cell surface antigens, chemokines, cytokines and acute phase proteins that can potentially be used to 'rule in' or 'rule out' neonatal sepsis and sinister intra-abdominal pathologies. The diagnostic values of key inflammatory mediators, including neutrophil CD64, IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10, are promising and likely to become increasingly used as biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. It is unlikely that a single compound can possess all the characteristics of an 'ideal' diagnostic biomarker. Serial measurements and the use of combination of biomarkers have been reported to improve sensitivity and negative predictive value of these tests. Although current biomarkers are not infallible, judicious selection of a panel of mediators with complementary properties could greatly increase the ability of neonatal clinicians and microbiologists to diagnose infection and NEC, and discern valuable prognostic information. New techniques such as proteomic and nucleic acid studies may also be used to discover new inflammatory mediators for diagnosis of sepsis and NEC.

AB  - There were 357 sets of twins in 27,914 deliveries or one in every 782 deliveries over a 5 yr period at the District of Columbia General Hospital. The diagnosis of twins was made at the time of delivery in 90i of patients. 27*4 of patients were primigravidas and 73'i were multipares. All maternal complications occurred with a higher frequency in multipares except for preeclampsia and eclampsia and complications occurred at a higher rate in twin than singleton gestation. The mothers in this series were exposed to higher risks because of poverty, poor nutrition, poor hygiene and lack of prenatal care. 22*4 of infants died. The leading causes of fetal demise were prematurity, immaturity, atelectasis and hyaline membrane disease. The increased risk to the fetus is further borne out by the fact that prematurity, fetal death rate and neonatal death rates were all approximately 3 times as common in twin as compared to singleton gestation.

AB  - The studies reported include measurements thymus and pancreas of babies with HMDand control infants. The lymphatic vessels in the lungs of babies who have died from HMD show a markedly increased surface area, when compared to a control group of newborn infants survival time. The difference is significant (.02 P .01), though only a restricted number of cases were studied. These p I anime trie measurements of the lymphatic surface area essentially confirm measuring the cross sectional diameters of the pulmonary lymphatics. On the contrary, the lymphatics in the thymus, kidneys and liver of the same groups of babies do not reveal this lymphangiectasis, as their surface area on the tissue sections of these organs is not significantly been planimetrically recorded. The difference between the HMD cases and the control group is of borderline significance in the pancreas. Assuming that the various organs (liver, kidney, thymus and pancreas) in this study should reflect any changes if the claimed generalized disturbance of total body water regulation occurred in the disease, one is still left with the puzzling problem nf explaining the pulmonary lymphangiectasis.

AB  - Hyaline membrane disease is a frequent cause of death in the newborn with encephalopathy of the premature infant. The ciinica] picture is that of acute respiratory insufficiency to which signs of a meningocerebral hemorrhage may be added. Radiologicaily, 3 stages are recognized according tu severity; stage I: less dense; stage II: with parenchymutous micronodular images and stage III: a true pulmonary hepatization. Biologically, mixed, gaseous and metabolic acidosis are found. The evolution of the disease may be pernicious, death occurring within the first 48 hr, or it may be favorable. The treatment has 3 essential aspects: oxygentherapy. administration of buffer substances, and the provision of adequate energizing nutriment. Hyaline membrane disease is an illness in which cooperation between obstetricians and pediatricians must be complete.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the association of early nutrition intake with the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and Weipu Periodical Database were searched for the observational studies on the association between early nutrition intake and BPD. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform a Meta analysis of eligible studies., RESULTS: Eight observational studies were included, with 548 infants with BPD and 522 infants without BPD. The Meta analysis showed that the BPD group had a significantly lower caloric intake than the non-BPD group within the first week after birth and in the first 2 weeks after birth (P < 0.05). The BPD group had a significantly lower enteral nutrition intake than the non-BPD group (WMD=-18.27, 95%CI:-29.70 to -6.84, P < 0.05), as well as a significantly lower intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein (P < 0.05). The BPD group had a significantly longer duration of parenteral nutrition than the non-BPD group (WMD=14.26, 95%CI:13.26-15.25, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Early nutrition deficiency may be associated with the development of BPD, and more attention should be paid to enteral feeding of infants at a high risk of BPD to achieve total enteral feeding as soon as possible.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features of very preterm small-for-gestational-age infants born by cesarean section due to severe preeclampsia., METHODS: Forty-two small-for-gestational-age infants who were admitted from August 2017 to July 2018 and were born due to severe preeclampsia were enrolled as the observation group. Forty very preterm infants who were born to healthy mothers since uterine contractions could not be suppressed were enrolled as the control group. Perinatal features, clinical manifestations of infection, complications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed for the two groups., RESULTS: Within 6 hours and 2-3 days after birth, the observation group had significantly lower white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and platelet count (PLT) than the control group (P < 0.05). At 5-7 days after birth, there was no significant difference in WBC between the two groups (P > 0.05), while the observation group still had significantly lower ANC and PLT than the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level than the control group at 2-3 days and 5-7 days after birth (P < 0.05). The observation group had a significantly higher proportion of infants with severe infections than the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group had a significantly higher hemoglobin level than the control group within 6 hours after birth (P < 0.05). The observation group had a significantly higher incidence rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia than the control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of pulmonary hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and the rate of use of invasive ventilation, and clinical outcomes (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Very preterm small-for-gestational-age infants born due to severe preeclampsia have a high incidence rate of infection and severe conditions. Early manifestations include reductions in the infection indicators WBC, ANC, and PLT, and CRP does not increase significantly in the early stage and gradually increases at 2-3 days after birth. Most of these infants require invasive ventilation after birth, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia as the main complication. Clinical changes should be closely observed and inflammatory indicators should be monitored for early identification of infection, timely diagnosis, and timely adjustment of antibiotic treatment, so as to improve the outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A wide variety of surfactant preparations have been developed and tested including synthetic surfactants and surfactants derived from animal sources. Although clinical trials have demonstrated that both synthetic surfactant and animal derived surfactant preparations are effective, comparison in animal models has suggested that there may be greater efficacy of animal derived surfactant products, perhaps due to the protein content of animal derived surfactant., OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of animal derived surfactant to protein free synthetic surfactant preparations in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)., SEARCH METHODS: Searches were updated of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2014), PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE (1975 through November 2014). All languages were included., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing administration of protein free synthetic surfactants to administration of animal derived surfactant extracts in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome were considered for this review., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data collection and analysis were conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group., MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that the use of animal derived surfactant rather than protein free synthetic surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax [typical relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.77; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 11 studies, 5356 infants] and a marginal reduction in the risk of mortality (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.00; NNTB 50; 13 studies, 5413 infants). Animal derived surfactant was associated with an increase in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis [typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 50; 8 studies, 3462 infants] and a marginal increase in the risk of any intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; 10 studies, 5045 infants) but no increase in Grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 9 studies, 4241 infants). The meta-analyses supported a marginal decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality associated with the use of animal derived surfactant preparations (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 6 studies, 3811 infants). No other relevant differences in outcomes were noted., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Both animal derived surfactant extracts and protein free synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. Animal derived surfactant may be associated with an increase in necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, though the more serious hemorrhages (Grade 3 and 4) are not increased. Despite these concerns, animal derived surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available protein free synthetic surfactants.

AB  - An increasing incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants has been reported in recent years. In the present study we analyzed the risk factors for BPD. It was revealed that the most significant factors are the low gestational age and birth weight, as well as prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and late neonatal infection. Polymorphism of studied genes and various combinations of polymorphic variants did not affect the risk of BPD developing. The influence of genetic polymorphisms on the duration of mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of late neonatal infection. For proper evaluation of the contribution of genetic polymorphism is necessary to conduct a preliminary analysis of all possible clinical and laboratory parameters to identify strong independent predictors and then analyze the indirect effects of genetic factors. Further research and development of new approaches to ventilation mode in preterm infants, based on the genetic polymorphism, will create a set of preventive measures and reduce the incidence of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Extremely preterm infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung injury that lacks effective treatment. TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) is an antiangiogenic protein that activates TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1), a cytokine strongly linked to both experimental and human BPD. Objectives: 1) To examine effects of inhibiting TSP-1-mediated TGF-beta1 activation (LSKL [leucine-serine-lysine-leucine]) in neonatal rats with bleomycin-induced lung injury; 2) to examine effects of a TSP-1 mimic (ABT-510) on lung morphology; and 3) to determine whether TSP-1 and related signaling peptides are increased in lungs of human preterm infants at risk for BPD. Methods: From Postnatal Days 1 to 14, rat pups received daily intraperitoneal bleomycin (1 mg/kg) or vehicle and were treated with daily subcutaneous LSKL (20 mg/kg) or vehicle alone. Separate animals were treated with vehicle or ABT-510 (30 mg/kg/d). Paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 47 autopsies (controls; death <28 d, n = 30 and BPD at risk; death 28 d, n = 17) performed on infants born <29 completed weeks' gestation were semiquantified for injury markers (collagen, macrophages, and 3-nitrotyrosine), TSP-1, and TGF-beta1. Measurements and Main Results:  Bleomycin or ABT-510 increased lung TGF-beta1 activity and macrophage influx, caused pulmonary hypertension, and led to alveolar and microvascular hypoplasia. Treatment with LSKL partially prevented abnormal lung morphology secondary to bleomycin. Lungs from human infants at risk for BPD had increased contents of TSP-1 and TGF-beta1 when compared with controls. TGF-beta1 content correlated with markers of lung injury. Conclusions: TSP-1 inhibits alveologenesis in neonatal rats, in part via the upregulated activity of TGF-beta1. Observations in human lungs suggest a similar pathogenic role for TSP-1 in infants at risk for BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of the course of nosocomial bronchiolitis respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) etiology and effectiveness of the therapy in preterm infants in the neonatal hospital conditions., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed case histories of 10 hospitalized patients who had RSV etiology bronchiolitis established by RIF/PCR in neonatal Moscow hospitals in 2011-2013., RESULTS: RSV infection in hospitalized preterm infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia runs hardly, requiring treatment in the intensive care unit, oxygen therapy and lungs mechanical ventilation. The respiratory failure is the symptom of the of RSV bronchiolitis severity. X-ray picture of the disease is characterized by peribronchial changes, emphysematous swelling, segmental infiltration and bronchial obstruction (atelectasis, hypoventilation). The frequency of bacterial complications of RSV bronchiolitis is low. In clinical practice newborns with severe RSV bronchiolitis are treated with antibiotics, bronchodilators, steroids. The timely isolation of patients can prevent the extention of the infection in the hospital,, CONCLUSIONS: The preventive measures are needed to prevent the extention of RSV in neonatal hospitals, including specific immune prophylaxis of RSV infection in children at risk.

The sample of 106 premature newborns of gestational age 26-32 weeks and body mass at birth 660-1500 g was examined. The concentration of Clara's cells protein in bronchoalveolar liquid and blood serum was higher in patients with inborn pneumonia as compared with children with respiratory distress syndrome. The low content Clara's cells protein in highly premature newborns with pneumonia was related with subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - The objectives of our study were to describe the epidemiology of child-health indicator diseases in western Jamaica, examine differences in indicator diseases between sex and age, and generate hypotheses about causes of disease burden. International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, coded discharge diagnoses were collected from consecutive admissions for 2003-2005 from a public tertiary care hospital. Mortality data were not coded. Perinatal disease was the most common cause of mortality, with hyaline membrane disease the primary cause. Younger children, particularly males, are disproportionately affected by all indicator diseases (P < 0.001) and more likely to die from acute respiratory tract infections and infectious diseases (P < 0.05). Sickle cell disease was the fourth most common diagnosis. Children in western Jamaica are most affected by diseases of prematurity. These children experience disease burden similar to that of children in other developing countries, but fewer neonatal sepsis and insect-borne infections, and more hematologic illness.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening disease process that affects adults and children. Pediatric patients with lung diseases that can be complicated by alveolar hypoxia, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension, which leads to right heart failure and greatly increases morbidity and mortality. We review the evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by pulmonary vascular wall cells in response to a hypoxic exposure, and that this response contributes to chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. We summarize the accumulating data implicating NADPH oxidase as a major source of O2 responsible for vascular remodeling and hypertension. We also consider the effects of chronic hypoxia on the clearance of O2 by superoxide dismutases, specifically extracellular superoxide dismutase, which is highly expressed in the pulmonary artery. We review the role of the activated vascular adventitial fibroblast in the generation of ROS and in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling, and provide a rationale to consider the role of the activated fibroblast and ROS in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension using a clinically relevant bovine model of neonatal chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - The psychomotor development of 171 preterm very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants (birthweight < or = 1500 g) at 10 months of corrected age was assessed by the Griffiths' Mental Developmental Scale. The developmental score was related to the prenatal and obstetric risk factors and to the neonatal health status of each infant. These results, in turn, were compared to findings for a reference group of full-term infants. This analysis revealed that prolonged ventilator treatment, patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, brain haemorrhage with ventricle dilatation, white matter lesions, low birthweight and low gestational age influenced psychomotor development in an unfavourable manner. Multiple regression analysis confirmed most of these correlations. Preterm birth per se (when children with risk factors were excluded) in general had no significant effect on psychomotor development. However, the early development of preterm infants with several neonatal risk factors was adversely affected.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine in a rural black population the incidence of common forms of respiratory distress (RD) and low birth weight (LBW), the mortality from RD and the perinatal mortality rate (PMR)., DESIGN: A prospective study in a context in which about 90% of the community's births take place within the health service and unwell neonates are transferred to hospital., SETTING: The Donald Fraser health ward, Northern Province (then Venda), which serves a population of about 180,000 through 21 clinics and health centres and a 450-bed hospital., SUBJECTS: 7,539 infants born alive between 1 February 1992 and 31 January 1993, of whom 48 developed RD., OUTCOME MEASURES: Hjalmarson's classification of RD, modified for local conditions. Criteria depended on clinical signs, chest radiography, neutrophil count in blood and gastric aspirate, blood cultures and postmortem examination., RESULTS: RD 6.4/1,000 livebirths (95% CI 4.6-8.2); infection 2.6/1,000 livebirths (95% CI 1.4-3.7); hyaline membrane disease (HMD) 0.9/1,000 livebirths (95% CI 0.2-1.6); pulmonary maladaptation (transient tachypnoea) 0.8/1,000 livebirths (95% CI 0.2-1.4); mortality from RD 2.1/1,000 livebirths (95% CI 1.1-3.2); incidence of LBW 7.9% (95% CI 7.3-8.5); PMR 19.8/1,000 livebirths (95% CI 17-23)., CONCLUSION: A strikingly low incidence of neonatal RD in general and of HMD in particular was found in a rural black population, probably related to a low LBW incidence. Infection was the commonest cause of RD.

AB  - Retinol, or one of its metabolites such as retinoic acid (RA), is an important factor in the differentiation and maintenance of integrity of lung epithelium. Retinol deficiency in rats induces morphologic changes in respiratory tract epithelial cells that are histologically similar to those found in human premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The exact mechanism of retinoid action in cellular growth and differentiation is not understood, but recently investigators have focused on mechanisms mediated by nuclear RA receptors (RAR). The role of these RAR as regulators of retinoid function is being studied in adult animal tissues and malignant cell lines, but little is known about RAR in developing fetal lung tissue. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of gestational age and vitamin A deficiency on fetal rat lung nuclear RAR. RAR were also assayed in vitamin A control and vitamin A-deficient adult rat lung. A competitive binding assay and size exclusion HPLC separation were used to quantitate total RAR-specific binding. Binding analysis revealed a single class of receptor binding sites with high affinity (kd approximately 10(-9) M) for RA and RAR saturation at 2-5 nM RA. Specific binding of lung RAR in rat fetuses at 18 d gestation was two to three times greater than in fetuses at 20-21 d gestation, newborn pups, or adults. Western blot analysis revealed a predominance of RAR-beta receptors in fetal lung. Lungs from vitamin A-deficient fetuses demonstrated up-regulation of nuclear RAR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a distortion of postnatal lung development induced by ventilator treatment for respiratory distress syndrome or other forms of respiratory failure in the newborn. This paper reviews established and proposed mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of BPD including severe surfactant deficiency, ventilation with high insufflation pressure and high oxygen concentrations, protein leakage and low levels of antioxidants in the immature lung, and a protease-antiprotease imbalance interfering with the layout of elastin and leading to growth without proper alveolarisation. Since the primary insult occurs during the first few days after birth, prophylaxis is highly important. Promising attempts have been made to prevent, or curb, the evolution of BPD by administration of antioxidants, corticosteroids, or exogenous surfactant.

AB  - Artificial surfactant (ALEC), when used in a crystalline state, has physical properties similar to natural surfactant. It is composed of two phospholipids with no protein. When placed in the trachea of ventilated premature rabbits it significantly increased the lung compliance. In three prophylactic clinical trials with babies under 30 weeks gestation this surfactant has been shown to reduce the neonatal mortality by about half and to significantly decrease the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia without any increase in the incidence of subsequent handicap.

AB  - Serum factors related to oxygen exposure were studied in 56 full-term cord blood samples and in 69 newborn infants of varying gestational age (GA). Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), which reflects membrane lipid peroxidation, was elevated during the first 2 d of life and rose to a peak at 3-5 d of life. This peak value was unrelated to GA or to assisted ventilation. The serum antioxidant, vitamin E, showed a significant rise by 6-10 d, and came into the adult range after d 11. Vitamin E levels did not correlate with GA, assisted ventilation, or the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Serum ceruloplasmin, another antioxidant, was measured both by activity assay and by protein concentration assay. Little activity was found in cord blood. Ceruloplasmin activity increased during the first 48 h of life, and both activity and protein concentration correlated with GA at that time. Infants who subsequently developed BPD had a less active protein than infants on ventilators who did not develop BPD. In addition, activity and protein levels on 3-5 d were lower in infants on ventilators than in those not requiring assisted ventilation. Serum levels of alpha-1-AP activity and protein concentration were also correlated with GA during the first 48 h of life. The less mature infants had levels of activity and protein which were significantly less than the more mature infants and significantly less than the full-term cord values. The proportion of active protein correlated with GA at 3-5 d, indicating that the less mature infants had a lower proportion of active protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a respiratory dysfunction caused by poor lung bronchial development, which may lead to long-term lung disease, threatening the lives of children. Studies have shown that premature infants with low vitamin D are highly associated with BPD. In this study, we aim to obtain insights into whether early vitamin D supplementation could prevent BPD in preterm infants., METHODS: A total of 112 preterm infants were randomly divided into two groups: the control and vitamin D supplementation (VD) group. The VD group received vitamin D (800 IU/day) within 48 h at birth for consecutively 28 days. The serum levels of 25(OH)D3 and C-reactive protein (CRP), IL6, and TNF-alpha were measured using ELISA assay. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2 ) was measured using an i-STAT analyzer., RESULTS: The occurrence of BPD was decreased in the VD group compared with the control. The decreased serum 25(OH)D3 was significantly elevated by supplementation with vitamin D. In addition, the serum inflammation factors (CRP, IL6, and TNF-alpha) were significantly reduced by vitamin D supplementation., CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that early vitamin D supplementation could significantly reduce BPD incidence in preterm infants. We showed that early vitamin D supplementation could significantly increase serum level of 25(OH)D3 and reduce inflammatory response thereby preventing and reducing neonatal BPD., LIMITATION: Firstly, a larger sample size will be needed to be included to gain a comprehensive understanding of the protective effects of vitamin D and BPD mechanistically in preterm infants. Secondly, the pathophysiological process of BPD will need to be studied. In addition, the pathways that vitamin D is responsible for, need to be further researched.

AB  - Red cell superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity was determined in 58 cord blood specimens obtained from infants over a range of gestational ages. An inverse relationship between red cell SOD activity and gestational age was demonstrated. Red cell SOD activity showed a progressive fall from 263.1 +/- 30.5 units/mg non-hemoglobin protein (NHP) in infants of less than 29 weeks of gestation to 168.9 +/- 21.3 units/mg NHP in infants of more than 36 weeks of gestation (P less than 0.05). Infants treated for RDS showed an increase in red cell SOD activity which reached significance at 72 hr when compared to cord blood levels from the same population (P less than 0.05). No similar significant difference could be demonstrated in gestational age-matched control subjects over the same time period. However, initial cord blood SOD enzyme levels were lower in premature infants with RDS (229.5 +/- 30.6 units/mg NHP) than in premature infants without RDS (264.0 +/- 38.0 units/mg NHP). When infants with RDS were examined for oxygen toxicity and survival, red cell SOD levels were noted to decrease over 24 hr in four of five infants who died, three of whom developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the surviving infants, red cell SOD levels showed a significant increase by 48 hr (P less than 0.05). None developed bronchopulmonary dyplasia and all survived.

AB  - Introduction The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is ideal for assessing lung function in young children. It is currently unknown which FOT outcomes are most clinically relevant in the management of childhood lung disease. We aimed to determine which FOT outcomes were most sensitive at detecting altered lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic lung disease of prematurity and asthma. Methods Respiratory impedance was measured in children, aged 3-7 years, diagnosed with CF (N= 84), asthma (N=99) or who were born preterm (N=114), of which 70 received a neonatal classification of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Z-scores were calculated for respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at 6, 8 and 10 Hz, area under the reactance curve (AX), resonant frequency (fres) and frequency dependence (fdep4-24). The most relevant FOT variables were determined by pairwise comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each FOT outcome using 1.64 Z-score cut off. Results All FOT variables were abnormal in respiratory disease when compared to the healthy population (p<0.012), except Rrs8 and Xrs10 in asthma and Xrs10 in CF. ROC analysis demonstrated that fres (16.7% with abnormal Z-score) and Xrs8 (15.5%) were better predictors of CF lung disease than Rrs8 (6%) and fdep (7.1%) (p<0.032), while in preterm children with BPD, AX (30%), Fres (20%) and Xrs8 (32.9%) were more appropriate than Rrs8 (7.1%) and Fdep (12.9%), (p<0.009). Similarly, in asthmatic children AX (13.9%) and Fres (11.95%) were more sensitive than Rrs8 (3%), (p<0.014). Conclusions Children with respiratory disease have altered FOT outcomes which were generally best described by changes in resonant frequency, reactance at 8Hz and the area under the reactance curve.

AB  - The most common form of newborn chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is thought to be caused by oxidative disruption of lung morphogenesis. Although cellular redox status is known to regulate proliferation and differentiation, the redox-sensitive pathways associated with these processes in developing pulmonary epithelium are unknown. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), a thiol oxidoreductase, regulates redox homeostasis by modifying the activity of redox-sensitive signaling pathways in response to alterations in oxygen tension (such as during birth or newborn oxidative injury). Thioredoxin-interaction protein (Txnip) is known to inhibit the redox activity of Trx1, resulting in growth arrest and cell death. The goal of these studies was to evaluate hyperoxic alterations in Trx1 status. Exposure of lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells to oxygen reduced free thiol content which may be attributable to increased expression of Txnip. Trx1 protein levels were unchanged; however, hyperoxic oxidation of Trx1 significantly reduced its redox potential. Inducible expression of Trx1 in stably transfected cells increased free thiol content and cell survival during hyperoxia. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of Trx1 during oxygen treatment reduced numbers of free thiols and decreased cell viability. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that hyperoxic impairment of Trx1 function alters activation of redox-sensitive pathways and negatively impacts cell survival.

AB  - One hundred and sixty infants with hyaline membrane disease were treated in an intensive care unit. Sixty-six infants received intermittent positive pressure ventilation; 22 survived. With improved management techniques and the routine use of a pressure-cycled flow generator, 53 per cent survived with assisted ventilation. The indications for intermittent positive pressure ventilation were asphyxia on admission, a single asphyxial attack, or a PaO2  value below 50 mm. Hg while receiving intensive therapy. Infection was the most serious complication. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation is thought to be a life-saving procedure in experienced hands.Copyright © 1970 The C. V. Mosby Company

AB  - A histochemical investigation was made in infants with hyaline membrane disease and in guinea pigs which had been submitted to oxygen poisoning under normal atmospheric conditions and to bilateral vagotomy. It could be confirmed that both the hyaline membranes of the newborn and those obtained experimentally have a glycoproteinic substrate. The protein component of this glycoprotein complex contains tyrosine and arginine, the latter being responsible for the eosinophilia of the membrane. Fibrin is probably not one of the fundamental components of the membranes. Sudan Black and Phosphin 3R staining suggest that the lipoprotein layer which normally lines the lung alveoli disappears when hyaline membranes are formed.

AB  - A healthy multigravida had an uneventful gestation and went into labor during the 41st wk of pregnancy. She received no analgesia and had a 5 hr labor with epidural anesthesia. A 2.50 kg female infant was delivered without difficulty and did well thereafter. Eight minutes later another female infant was also delivered spontaneously without difficulty. The second twin was flaccid, neither breathed nor cried, and had meconium stained amniotic fluid. Unaided breathing was established after 3 hr of assisted respiration and oxygen administration. Heart action had been strong since birth but muscle tone remained poor. Respirations were never well established and retractions developed. There was progressive deterioration of respiratory and heart action and death occurred 25 hr after birth. The infant was mature, well developed and weighed 3.32 kg. The skin was not meconium stained. The lungs were dark, atelectatic, and would not float in water; there were no other remarkable gross findings. Microscopically, the lungs showed the pattern of hyaline membrane disease with resorption atelectasis, congestion, focal hemorrhages, and early formation of eosinophilic membranes. Aspirated amniotic debris had not caused obstruction of air passages and pneumonia was not present. Cryostat sections of lung were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy and the hyaline membranes contained both fibrin and unpolymerized fibrinogen, since saline washing prior to fixation decreased the extent of specific staining. Autofluorescence microscopy showed almost no evidence of pulmonary surfactant. The most striking evidence of neuronal damage in the brain occurred in the dorsal vagal nuclei. There were no other remarkable microscopic findings. The monochorionic, diamniotic placenta weighed 1.01 kg and showed no lesions except meconium staining of the amnion of the dead infant with phagocytosis of meconium pigment. Intrauterine hypoxia caused brain damage that was evident at birth and preceded the development of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Postmortem examination revealed both brainstem injury and the lung lesions of hyaline membrane disease. The presence of a healthy identical twin who did not develop (RDS) allows the elimination of genetic and many environmental factors from consideration in a search for the cause of (RDS) in this case.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest that the disruption of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) functions plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of VEGF and eNOS expression in the lungs of premature rats exposed to moderate hyperoxia in order to explore possible relationships with BPD., METHODS: Premature rats delivered by hysterotomy at 21 days gestation were randomly continuously exposed to moderate hyperoxia (60% FiO2) and room air. The rats were sacrificed at 1, 4, 7, 11 and 14 days of exposure (6 rats at each time point). Lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Expression of VEGF and eNOS proteins and mRNA were assayed using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR., RESULTS: After 4 days of hyperoxia, lungs developed interstitial fibrosis, abnormal vascular patterns and decreased alveolar septation. These changes became more obvious with more prolonged hyperoxia exposure. The expression of VEGF protein after 4 and 7 days of exposure decreased significantly in the hyperoxia group compared with controls. The expression of VEGF mRNA in the hyperoxia group was also lower after 4 and 7 days of exposure. Both VEGF protein and mRNA levels decreased with increasing hyperoxia exposure time. The expressions of eNOS protein and mRNA also progressively decreased with increasing hyperoxia exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxia caused progressive reduction in lung VEGF and eNOS expression as well as abnormalities of lung structures, including decreased vascular growth and impaired alveolarization. These histologic changes are similar to those of BPD. The data support a link between BPD and decreased expression of VEGF and eNOS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation in premature infants may be reduced by initiating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in delivery room., POPULATION AND METHODS: Immediately after birth, respiratory support with CPAP was given to all infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks. In case of apnea or progressing symptoms with hypoxemia or carbonic acidosis, with PCO2 increasing to more than 60 mmHg, infants were treated with nasotracheal intubation and ventilation., RESULTS: One hundred and fifty one infants, with mean gestational age 29.6 +/- 1.9 weeks and mean birth weight 1,326 +/- 378 g were delivered in the obstetrical department of Marseille. In delivery room, 63% were treated with CPAP, and only 13% with nasotracheal intubation. The need for subsequent mechanical ventilation was reduced to 40% of the population. Surfactant therapy was used in 17% of this cohort. Two infants were given surfactant and extubated. Three of 14 deaths (9.2%) were caused by respiratory disease., CONCLUSIONS: Early CPAP reduces the indication of mechanical ventilation in premature infants. Incidence of pulmonary complications such as pneumothorax or bronchopulmonary dysplasia is low among those infants who require mechanical ventilation later. Early CPAP takes place in a general policy to decrease neonatal morbidity.

AB  - During three and a half years we observed 83 single pregnancies all delivered by caesarean section. All of them had a mild (systolic blood pressure > 140, diastolic > 90 and proteinuria > 0.5 g/dl) or a severe preeclampsia (systolic blood pressure > 160, diastolic > 100 and proteinuria > 3.0 g/dl). We found significantly twice as many abnormal uteroplacental blood flow velocities in the severe preeclampsia group than in the mild one. These results draw us to the conclusion that possible pathological changing of the vessels is due to preeclampsia which does not need to correlate with a placental insufficiency and fetal growth retardation. An abnormal uteroplacental blood flow velocity connected with an abnormal umbilical blood flow velocity raises the fetal morbidity and the early childhood morbidity. Fetal outcome in mild compared to severe preeclampsia definitively shows a worse prognosis for those fetuses whose mother developed a prepartal severe preeclampsia. A distinctly increased rate of cerebral haemorrhages, abnormal neurological signs, acute respiratory distress syndromes and bronchopulmonary dysplasia was found. Finally we show an additional risk for fetal outcome in absent or reverse enddiastolic flow velocity (AREDFV) in the severe preeclampsia group. We observed in the AREDFV group with severe preeclampsia in comparison to a group of AREDFV without maternal preeclampsia more than twice as many cerebral haemorrhages, abnormal neurological signs and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious respiratory complication in premature infants and moderate-to-severe BPD may affect the long-term quality of life and lack of specific treatment once it happened. Therefore, it is necessary to identify early diagnostic biomarkers for moderate-to-severe BPD., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all premature infants with birth weight <1500 g from March 1, 2015 to June 30, 2017. Patients were categorized into mild BPD, moderate-to-severe BPD and non BPD groups. Data collected included patient characteristics, C-reactive protein (CRP) tested at six time points, including 1d (2 h after birth and before the first feeding), 3d, 7d, 2w, 3w, and 4w after birth, and maternal factors. Ordinal regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of moderate-to-severe BPD and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the value of CRP as an early diagnostic marker for moderate-to-severe BPD., RESULTS: A total of 831 patients were recruited. BPD occurred in 156/831 premature infants with birth weight less than 1500 g. Lower birth weight (OR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.997-0.999, P = 0.004), higher CRP level 3 days after birth (OR = 1.287, 95% CI 1.195-1.384, P = 0.000), and hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HsPDA) (OR = 12.256, 95% CI 3.766-39.845, P = 0.000) were independent risk factors for moderate-to-severe BPD. The area under curve of the CRP level 3 days after birth for diagnosing moderate-to-severe BPD was 0.867 (95% CI, 0.823-0.912, P = 0.000). The sensitivity was 83.0% and the specificity was 78.3% when the cut-off value was set at 4.105 mg/L., CONCLUSION: The CRP level 3 days after birth may be used as an early diagnostic marker for moderate-to-severe BPD in preterm infants who have the risk factors for BPD with birth weight less than 1500 g.

AB  - Elastase, a neutral protease stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, is immediately released during the process of phagocytosis and rapidly bound and inactivated by alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. This complex (E-alpha 1-PI) is highly stable and can be identified by ELISA-technique. In our study 95% of all infants with neonatal septicemia and/or meningitis had significantly increased plasma levels of E-alpha 1-PI at the time of diagnosis (n = 37). After initiation of therapy normalization of E-alpha 1-PI levels was observed in all neonates who recovered from infection. These data suggest that E-alpha 1-PI is a sensitive and rapidly responsive indicator of neonatal septicemia. In addition E-alpha 1-PI may be helpful in monitoring the course of the disease. However, the specificity of E-alpha 1-PI is rather low: in patients with local infections and inflammatory processes such as neonatal pneumonia, enterocolitis and meconium aspiration E-alpha 1-PI levels were also shown to be increased. In contrast, all patients with hyaline membrane disease had E-alpha 1-PI levels within the normal range.

AB  - The lungs of 184 dead neonates and babies who were from birth on artificial ventilation with rough parameters and hyperoxygenation were found to have peculiar pathohistological changes that were used to work out an illustrated algorithm for the morphological diagnosis of neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (NBPD). An immunohistochemical study was used to identify the cell renewal markers Ki67, Bcl2, P53, and CPP32. In NBPD, there was an extremely high expression of all the markers in the cells of the bronchial, alveolar epithelium and lung interstitium as compared with the control group. It is concluded that cell renewal is accelerated in the lung in NBPD and the disease progresses until death occurs in infants.

Ten children had neuromuscular disease (infantile spinal amyotrophy 6, Duchenne myopathy 3, and mitochondrial myopathy 1) or other conditions including central hypoventilation (n = 2), traumatic tetraplegia (n = 2), encephalopathy with chronic bronchitis (n = 1) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 1). Only 5 children had a tracheotomy, the others were treated successfully with non-invasive ventilatory assistance. Initialization of non-invasive ventilatory assistance had been planned before development of respiratory failure in 4 of the 11 children, but generally was indicated after an episode of acute respiratory distress. Home ventilation, particularly with non-invasive assistance is a reliable method for long-term treatment of chronic alveolar hypoventilation in children. The appropriate time for initiating this therapy should be better defined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin (RSVIG) in the prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants born prematurely with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Data from a prospective, blinded, randomized, multicenter trial during three consecutive RSV seasons involving 249 children. This analysis comprises 162 preterm children, of whom 102 had BPD. The 87 children with congenital heart disease (CHD) were excluded from this analysis. Children were randomized to receive monthly infusions of RSVIG 750 mg/kg (high dose), RSVIG 150 mg/kg (low dose), or no RSVIG: Results from the preterm infants with and without BPD who received RSVIG 750 mg/kg are contrasted with control infants who did not receive RSVIG:, RESULTS: As compared with controls, high-dose RSVIG administration significantly reduced the incidences of RSV LRTI (P = .01) and moderate-to-severe LRTI (P = .006). RSV-associated hospitalization also was decreased (P = .06) as well as were total RSV-associated days in the intensive care unit (P = .05). Significantly fewer preterm infants developed severe RSV LRTI in the RSVIG group compared with controls (4/58 [7%] vs 14/58 [24%], respectively; P = .01). Adverse reactions occurred in 5% of RSVIG infusions. These were generally mild and included reversible fluid overload, transient fever, and decreases in oxygen saturation. There was one death unrelated to either RSV or RSVIG administration., CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis with RSVIG is safe and is currently the only effective means to prevent severe RSV LRTI in high-risk preterm infants.

AB  - We studied the effects of prolonged pancuronium administration in 10 neonates under assisted ventilation for hyaline membrane disease. Pancuronium bromide was administered from the time of intubation with a load dose of 0.1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.03-0.07 mg/kg/h. Tolerance, especially cardiovascular, was excellent after 72 to 525 h of therapy (mean 173 h). Oxygen needs, incidence of mechanical complications and the general evolution of idiopathic respiratory distress were not significantly affected by muscle relaxation. The benefits of systematic pancuronium administration during respiratory intensive care in neonates with hyaline membrane disease appear to be of little value when considering the necessary constraints (corneal, cutaneous, vesical and tracheal supervision).

AB  - Pulmonary angiogenesis drives alveolarization, but the transcriptional regulators directing pulmonary angiogenesis remain poorly defined. Global, pharmacological inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) impairs pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolarization. However, establishing a definitive role for NF-kappaB in pulmonary vascular development has been hindered by embryonic lethality induced by constitutive deletion of NF-kappaB family members. We created a mouse model allowing inducible deletion of the NF-kappaB activator, IKKbeta, in endothelial cells (ECs) and assessed the effect on lung structure, endothelial angiogenic function, and the lung transcriptome. Embryonic deletion of IKKbeta permitted lung vascular development but resulted in a disorganized vascular plexus, while postnatal deletion significantly decreased radial alveolar counts, vascular density, and proliferation of both endothelial and nonendothelial lung cells. Loss of IKKbeta impaired survival, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in primary lung ECs in vitro, in association with decreased expression of VEGFR2 and activation of downstream effectors. Loss of endothelial IKKbeta in vivo induced broad changes in the lung transcriptome with downregulation of genes related to mitotic cell cycle, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, and vascular development, and the upregulation of genes related to inflammation. Computational deconvolution suggested that loss of endothelial IKKbeta decreased general capillary, aerocyte capillary, and alveolar type I cell abundance. Taken together, these data definitively establish an essential role for endogenous endothelial IKKbeta signaling during alveolarization. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms directing this developmental, physiological activation of IKKbeta in the lung vasculature may provide novel targets for the development of strategies to enhance beneficial proangiogenic signaling in lung development and disease. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study highlights the cell-specific complexity of nuclear factor kappa B signaling in the developing lung by demonstrating that inducible loss of IKKbeta in endothelial cells impairs alveolarization, disrupts EC angiogenic function, and broadly represses genes important for vascular development.

AB  - Endothelial cell apoptosis is an early event in the development of acute lung injury (ALI). We have previously found that the Src family tyrosine kinase (STK) Yes activates caspase-3, whereas the STK Fyn inhibits caspase-3 activation in cultured pulmonary endothelial cells. We hypothesized that deficiency in Yes or Fyn in mice would have differential effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Mice were treated with LPS (10 mg/kg ip) for 24 h. Histological evidence of lung injury was greater in LPS-treated wild-type mice than in vehicle-treated wild-type mice, and the LPS-induced histological evidence of lung injury was attenuated in yes-/- mice and enhanced in fyn-/- mice. In wild-type or fyn-/- mice, LPS resulted in greater lung wet-to-dry weight ratios than in controls, whereas in yes-/- mice lung, wet-to-dry weight was similar between LPS and controls. LPS-exposed fyn-/- mice had greater respiratory system resistance and lower respiratory system compliance than did LPS-exposed wild-type mice. TUNEL positive cells in the lung following LPS treatment were greater in the fyn-/- mice and lower in the yes-/- mice compared with that in the wild-type mice. Following LPS treatment lung protein levels of PECAM-1 were lower in fyn-/- mice than in controls or yes-/- mice. LPS treatment increased cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in wild-type mice, whereas LPS-induced caspase-3 activation was attenuated in yes-/- mice and enhanced in fyn-/- mice. These results indicate that LPS-induced ALI is positively mediated via Yes-related mechanisms and negatively mediated by Fyn-related mechanisms.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease in premature infants, and alveolar dysplasia and pulmonary vascular development disorders are the predominant pathological features. Apoptosis of lung epithelial cells is a key factor in the pathological process of alveolar developmental arrest. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-associated apoptosis is a noncanonical apoptotic pathway involved in the development of several pulmonary diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and activating transcription factor 6 can initiate the apoptosis signaling pathway mediated by ERS and induce apoptosis of injured cells. Among them, the IRE1alpha pathway is the most conservative pathway in the unfolded protein response, which serves an important role in a number of pathological environments, to the extent of determining cell fate; however, it is rarely reported in BPD. Based on the establishment of a rat BPD model, the present study verified the activation of ERS in BPD and further confirmed that prolonged ERS inhibited the protective pathway, IRE1alpha/X-box binding proteins, and activated the proapoptotic pathway, IRE1alpha/c-Jun N-terminal kinase, to induce the apoptosis of lung epitheliums.

AB  - BACKGROUND Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease mostly affecting premature infants. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) X inactive specific transcript (Xist) is actively involved in pulmonary disease development. The present study explored the potential mechanism of Xist in BPD development. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, newborn BPD mouse models were successfully established. lncRNAs and genes with differential expression were identified using microarray analysis. Various injuries and radial alveolar counts of lung tissues of BPD mice were detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Functional assays were utilized to detect alterations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), vascular endothelial growth factor, collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle Actin, TGF-s1, and Smad3. Then, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down assay were performed to clarify the targeting relationship between Xist and miR-101-3p and between miR-101-3p and high-mobility group protein B3 (HMGB3). RESULTS In BPD mice, radial alveolar counts value and SOD activity declined while MDA level increased. Results of microarray analysis found that Xist and HMGB3 were highly expressed in BPD mice. Next, silenced Xist alleviated lung damage in BPD mice. Xist competitively bound to miR-101-3p to activate HMGB3, and overexpressed miR-101-3p mitigated lung damage in BPD mice. Additionally, silenced Xist downregulated the TGF-s1/Smad3 axis. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that silencing of Xist suppressed BPD development by binding to miR-101-3p and downregulating HMGB3 and the TGF-b1/Smad3 axis. Our results may provide novel insights for BPD treatment.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are released into the airways of preterm infants following lung injury. These cells display a proinflammatory phenotype and are associated with development of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We aimed to characterize the functional properties of MSCs obtained from tracheal aspirates of 50 preterm infants who required invasive ventilation. Samples were separated by disease severity. The increased proliferative capacity of MSCs was associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and higher severity of BPD. Augmented growth depended on nuclear accumulation of NFkappaBp65 and was accompanied by reduced expression of cytosolic alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). The central role of NF-kappaB signaling was confirmed by inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. The combined score of proliferative capacity, accumulation of NFkappaBp65, and expression of alpha-SMA was used to predict the development of severe BPD with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.847. We mimicked the clinical situation in vitro, and stimulated MSCs with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Both cytokines induced similar and persistent changes as was observed in MSCs obtained from preterm infants with severe BPD. RNA interference was employed to investigate the mechanistic link between NFkappaBp65 accumulation and alterations in phenotype. Our data indicate that determining the phenotype of resident pulmonary MSCs represents a promising biomarker-based approach. The persistent alterations in phenotype, observed in MSCs from preterm infants with severe BPD, were induced by the pulmonary inflammatory response. NFkappaBp65 accumulation was identified as a central regulatory mechanism. Future preclinical and clinical studies, aimed to prevent BPD, should focus on phenotype changes in pulmonary MSCs.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most important respiratory morbidity of preterm infants with few effective preventive strategies. Administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was considered effective to prevent BPD via paracrine extracellular vesicles (EVs), while appropriate regimens of MSC-EVs and the mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we established a hyperoxia-induced rat BPD model, and examined the effect of early intraperitoneal MSC-EVs with different doses on BPD. We found that MSC-EVs ameliorated hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a dose-dependent manner, and high-dose MSC-EVs ameliorated alveolar simplification and fibrosis. Also, MSC-EVs showed its beneficial effects on vascular growth and pulmonary hypertension. Primary AT2 cells were observed to transdifferentiate into AT1 cells when exposure to hyperoxia in vitro. Administration of MSC-EVs at the first-day culture significantly delayed the transdifferentiation of AT2 cells induced by hyperoxia. We further found that exposure to hyperoxia led to elevated expression of WNT5a mRNA and protein, a key agent in AT2 transdifferentiation, while MSC-EVs administration decreased it. Further study is warranted that MSC-EVs may delay the transdifferentiation of AT2 cells via WNT5a. These studies provide key preclinical evidence of MSC-EVs therapeutics on BPD and highlight the effect of MSC-EVs on suppressing the transdifferentiation of AT2 cells and its possible mechanism through downregulation of WNT5a.

AB  - Arginase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) share a common substrate, l-arginine, and have opposing effects on vascular remodeling. Arginase is the first step in polyamine and proline synthesis necessary for cellular proliferation, while NO produced from NOS promotes apoptosis. Previously, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the arginase-1 (ARG1) gene, rs2781666 (T-allele) that was associated with a decreased risk for developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) in a cohort of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In this study, we utilized lymphocytes from neonates (the only readily available cells from these patients expressing the two genotypes of interest) with either the rs2781666 SNP (TT) or wild type (GG) to test the hypothesis that the protection of the ARG1 SNP against the development of PH in BPD would involve augmented NO production leading to more apoptosis. Lymphocytes were stimulated with IL-4, IL-13, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We found that TT lymphocytes had similar levels of arginase I and arginase II expression, but there was a tendency for lower urea production (a surrogate marker of arginase activity), than in the GG lymphocytes. The TT lymphocytes also had significantly greater NO production than did GG lymphocytes despite no differences in iNOS expression between genotypes. Furthermore, the TT lymphocytes had lower numbers of viable cells, and higher levels of cleaved caspase-3 than did GG lymphocytes. Inhibiting NOS activity using Nomega-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME) significantly decreased cleaved caspase-3 levels in the TT lymphocytes. These data demonstrate that the TT genotype results in greater levels of NO production leading to more apoptosis, which is consistent with the concept that BPD patients with the TT genotype are protected against the development of PH by producing greater basal levels of endogenous NO.

Postnatal survival depends on the successful transition of the pulmonary circulation to undergo a remarkable change from its high resistance and low flow state in utero to a low resistance and high flow circulation at birth. Mechanisms that contribute to the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) include the loss of fetal lung liquid, rhythmic distension of the lung and increased alveolar oxygen tension. The effects of these factors are largely based on stimulating the release of potent endogenous vasodilators, including nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PgI2), and attenuating production of the potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1 (ET-1) [1-3]. After the first days of life, PVR progressively decreases over the following weeks to achieve postnatal values that remain similar during infancy, childhood and into adulthood. Some newborns, however, fail to achieve this rapid decline in PVR during the first days of life, which leads to the syndrome known as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN is characterized by the failure of this normal transition which causes severe hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting of blood away from the lung circulation through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. Over the past few decades, preclinical studies have explored diverse mechanisms that lead to high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in PPHN, which include the inability to generate or sustain production of NO and PgI2 and upregulation of ET-1 (1-3) enhanced myogenic tone that opposes vasodilation, and in some cases, impaired lung vascular growth and striking hypertensive arterial remodeling. Insights into basic mechanisms that regulate pulmonary vascular tone, vasoreactivity and growth during the perinatal period, as well as mechanisms that impair the transition, have contributed to the development of current PH-targeted drug therapies, including inhaled NO, sildenafil, ET receptor antagonists (ERA), prostacyclin analogues, and other treatments. When combined with a physiological approach that integrates optimal ventilator strategies, cardiac support and systemic hemodynamics, these drugs can improve oxygenation by reducing the extrapulmonary shunt due to high PVR, enhancing right ventricular function and avoid the need for more invasive therapies, especially extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in term newborns with hypoxemic respiratory failure with PPHN physiology [4,5). Term newborns with PPHN who fail these PH-targeted therapies often have underlying problems such as impaired left ventricular performance that may be associated with systemic hypotension and high pulmonary venous pressures, an inability to optimize lung volumes and ventilation due to the severity of underlying lung disease (e.g., severe RDS, lung hypoplasia or others), or the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities of lung structure (such as alveolar capillary dysplasia, TBX4, NKX 2.1, surfactant protein disorders, and others). Although most commonly-recognized in term infants, the presence and management of PPHN and other issues as related to pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) in the preterm infant remain even more challenging. Although the abnormal transition of the lung with preterm birth is focused on the management of fundamental problems related to surfactant insufficiency, the need to support respiratory effort and achieve sufficient lung recruitment without inducing ventilator-induced lung injury and other respiratory complications, it is also clear that the failure of adaptation of the pulmonary circulation can further impair transition in preterm newborns as readily as in term newborns. In fact, recent epidemiological and physiological studies have shown a far higher incidence of PPHN in preterm infants which has been strongly associated with the severity of prematurity [6]. Historically, experimental studies have suggested that pulmonary vasoreactivity in response to high and low levels of oxygen to induce vasodilation or constriction, respectively, increase with advancing gestational age. However, even extremely preterm lambs are already capable of regulating basal and stimulated pulmonary vascular tone through production of NO during mid-gestation and are highly responsive to inhaled NO during mechanical ventilation after preterm delivery. Clinical studies have further demonstrated that human preterm newborns often improve oxygenation in the setting of hypoxemic respiratory failure with PPHN during acute treatment with inhaled NO, especially in the setting of oligohydramnios and lung hypoplasia, supporting a key role for high vascular tone playing a central role in mediating elevated PVR. In addition, lung pathology of preterm infants who die shortly after birth has shown that the respiratory severity score is strongly associated with hypertensive pulmonary vascular remodeling, further illustrating the potential contributions of early pulmonary vascular disease to severe RDS. However, not all preterm infants with severe hypoxemia have demonstrable PPHN physiology as its underlying cause, suggesting that routine administration of pulmonary vasodilator therapies, including inhaled NO, without clear demonstration of underlying PPHN physiology is unlikely to be helpful in the management of hypoxemic infants. Multiple case series report marked improvement in oxygenation in preterm infants with PPHN, leading to consensus recommendations for inhaled NO use in preterms with PPHN physiology from a joint American Heart Association (AHA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines working group, especially in the setting of oligohydramnios and prolonged preterm rupture of membranes and the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet) [7,8]. However, our understanding of the potential benefits of inhaled NO or other PH-targeted drug therapies for the management of severe hypoxemia in preterm infants remains limited by the lack of relevant controlled trials that randomize subjects based on the presence of PPHN, as past studies that have used inhaled NO for the prevention of BPD did not differentiate between preterm infants with or without PPHN as part of their study design. A retrospective study compared the outcomes of preterm infants who were identified as having the diagnosis of lung hypoplasia through a search of diagnostic codes through medical records at multiple institutions [9]. Overall, these infants had a high mortality rate with no effect on survival in subjects treated with inhaled NO. When further stratified as having lung hypoplasia with or without PPHN, however, these investigators reported that the use of inhaled NO led to a nearly 30% improvement in survival [9]. This subgroup analysis did not achieve statistical significance partly due to the small patient numbers or by sufficient verification of PPHN by echocardiogram in these subjects. Nevertheless, these interesting findings support the speculation that early identification and intervention, specifically in babies who have PPHN physiology who are prematurely-born, can improve survival in this subpopulation. In addition to PPHN, work over the past decades has led to a growing understanding that PH, or more broadly, PVD in preterm infants presents at different postnatal ages with variable severity, which has distinct implications for clinical management and risks for short and long-term outcomes. These can be partially characterized by the differences in postnatal timing and severity of PH, including early, late and chronic disease, which represent diverse pulmonary vascular phenotypes of preterm infants. Insights into these different phenotypes is needed to better understand mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of PH in these infants and the impact of PVD on disease course and outcomes, as based on the clinical setting and context in which PH has been diagnosed. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows preterm birth, is characterized by an arrest of vascular and alveolar growth and high risk for PH, which is strongly associated with higher mortality and late morbidities. In the original description of BPD in 1967, Northway and colleagues report that " (of infants with late deaths) all patients had striking cardiomegaly and right ventricular hypertrophy (and that) the pathogenesis of cor pulmonale is puzzling.

AB  - Chronic acquired lung disease in childhood is not a clearly defined entity but covers a wide spectrum of different disorders that may affect lung parenchyma and/or the airways and are not related to a well-defined and genetically determined disease such as Cystic Fibrosis (CF) or Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), both of which are covered separately. Chronic acquired lung disease may have its origin perinatally (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia following premature birth), during early childhood (e.g. severe pneumonia, missed foreign body with dependent bronchiectasis) or at any time later (e.g. following hematopoetic stem cell transplantation or autoimmune systemic diseases) and may be characterized by a restrictive, an obstructive or a mixed ventilatory pattern. Of this wide spectrum, non-CF and non-PCD bronchiectasis, postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO) and chronic lung disease in children and adolescents with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection will be discussed here. Pediatric bronchiectasis (BE) is a descriptive term for airway dilatation which has been thought to be irreversible. However, with earlier detection of characteristic airway changes e.g. using highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) and better understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms, the vicious circle of infection, neutrophilic inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance and airway wall destruction may be interrupted, existing changes reversed and irreversible changes prevented. It is therefore essential to promptly start a diagnostic process if chronic suppurative lung disease and bronchiectasis are suspected in a child or adolescent to identify treatable factors and start treatment as soon as possible (1). A likely precursor of pediatric BE is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) which is defined as chronic productive cough which resolves with two weeks of appropriate antibiotic treatment. If PBB does not resolve (extended PBB) or needs repeated courses of antibiotics (recurrent PBB), bronchiectasis may develop. Recurrent PBB and Hemophilus influenzae have been identified to be risk factors for developing bronchiectasis; more recently, abnormalities in the innate immune system have been described (e.g. (2)). General treatment recommendations for pediatric BE include regular application of airway clearance techniques, antibiotic treatment for exacerbations and consideration of long-term macrolide treatment in those with frequent exacerbations (1). Post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO) is a rare disease following a usually severe lower respiratory tract infection. PIBO has a different prevalence in different parts of the world, suggesting that genetic predisposing factors are involved. Severe adenovirus infection carries the greatest risk of developing PIBO and PIBO should be suspected in a child with bronchiolitis not improving after 3 to 4 weeks. Other infectious causes include e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, measles, and human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1. PIBO is characterized by a severe inflammatory host response with predominant neutrophils and histologically by a constrictive BO pattern with peribronchiolar fibrosis and lumen obstruction. Lung function shows a predominantly obstructive pattern with usually little or no bronchodilator reversibility. Definite diagnosis would require lung biopsy, but history of severe AV (or other lower respiratory tract) infection, the clinical picture of persistent airway obstruction unresponsive to inhaled treatment and a typical mosaic pattern or air trapping on HRCT should prompt initiation of treatment (3). Treatment is mainly supportive, but early during the disease, suppression of the inflammatory process with pulsed corticosteroids and azithromycin may limit the effect of the inflammation but controlled studies are lacking. A patient with BO needs regular follow-up by a multiprofessional team including pediatric cardiologists to monitor development of pulmonary hypertension (4). Long-term follow-up studies show some catch-up growth of lung volumes but a premature decline in FEV1/FVC. Although lung and airway growth during childhood and adolescence will lead to clinical improvement in most patients, it is likely that a significant proportion of patients diagnosed with PIBO during childhood will meet the criteria of COPD in adulthood. BO is one of many faces of chronic lung disease (CLD) in children and adolescents with HIV (5). Ninety percent of more than 3 Mill children infected with HIV live in Sub-Saharan Africa. Before ART became widely available and programs were installed to prevent perinatal transmission of the virus, acute pulmonary infections and specific entities such as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) during infancy were major determinants of morbidity and mortality. With the widespread roll-out of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention programs, the burden of HIV-associated lung disease has shifted towards adolescence. The term HIV-associated CLD covers a spectrum of lung diseases including bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans. There is no universal definition of HIV-CLD but usually it includes chronic respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea, reduced lung function and an abnormal HRCT (6). Altered respiratory microbiota with a predominance of Haemophilus, Moraxella and Neisseria may be associated with a higher risk of HIV-CLD. The incidence of tuberculosis disease and lower respiratory tract infections with other pathogens is increased in children and adolescents with HIV-infection, potentially leading to bronchiectasis if the infection is not treated successfully. However, it has also been suggested that the increased prevalence of BE in this population is explained by the altered innate immunity and resulting neutrophilic inflammation. BO has been found in more than 50% of adolescents despite ART and therefore represents a major cause of HIV-associated CLD. Interestingly, BO has not been reported in HIV-infected children in high-income settings. Furthermore, the reported prevalence of bronchiectasis in the US is lower than in studies from Africa even before the introduction of ART, suggesting that other factors such as availability of health care services and nutritional status will influence the outcome. There is no established algorithm for diagnosing HIV-associated CLD, but where available HRCT will be part of the work-up (7). Lung function has been shown to be reduced in children and adolescents with HIV-infection (8) and has been shown to be associated with reduced granulocyte telomere length especially in children in whom ART was not initiated early. A role of co-infection with cytomegalovirus in the pathogenesis of HIV-CLD has been suggested (9). Recently, the results of a clinical trial (Bronchopulmonary Function in Response to Azithromycin Treatment for Chronic Lung Disease in HIV-infected Children BREATHE) failed to show improvement in lung function from the immunmodulatory and antimicrobial activity in the azithromycin group, but resulted in a reduction in acute respiratory exacerbations and hospitalizations (10).

AB  - Anemia is a usual complication of preterm birth, with severity also depending on concomitant morbidities and the frequency of blood withdrawal for tests. Since prematurity anemia is scarcely responsive to medical therapies, neonates born at gestation age <28 weeks are usually heavily transfused during their hospitalization. The association between repeated transfusions and the poor outcome in this setting has been long acknowledged. Detrimental effects of transfusions can be ascribed to components released during the storage, eliciting the activation of the innate immune system and the inflammatory response. Indeed, the increase of many of these mediators as well as markers of oxidative stress has been documented in preterms. Various diseases complicating the clinical course after preterm birth rely on oxidative damage as the underlying pathogenic mechanism. Among them, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) particularly influence the neurodevelopmental outcomes of affected patients and lifelong affect their quality of life. A body of growing evidence from retrospective and prospective studies suggests a direct connection between the severity of ROP or BPD and low levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), especially when experienced during the earlyweeks of life.Nevertheless, RBC transfusions remain unavoidable in the majority of patients. HbF and adult Hb (HbA) have a similar three-dimensional structure, but different chemical and physical properties. The distinctive HbF characteristics, besides the higher oxygen affinity, include a higher efficiency in maintaining its tetrameric integrity, preventing the release of toxic free heme groups, and a critical redox effect due to its pseudo peroxidase activity. In addition, HbF exerts a greater ability than HbA in vessel tone regulation. Therefore, transfusing to preterm neonates RBC concentrated obtained from cord instead of adult blood, might be advantageous. For this purpose, we set up the fractionation of units solidary donated at our public cord blood bank, which could not be used for transplant due to the low total nucleated cell content. We first assessed the feasibility of using these allogeneic RBC concentrates to transfuse preterm newborns, reporting no adverse events and similar hematocrit increments as standard transfusions. In a subsequent proof-of-concept study, we also demonstrated that transfusing cord-RBC prevents the HbF depletion observed after standard transfusions. Overall this approach seems to be safe and feasible, but many questions remain to be answered before it may be widely adopted. The first relevant point is to prove that cord-RBC reduce ROP and/or BPD severity in a properly designed randomized trial, which is conceivable only in face of extensive availability of cord blood units. It deserves to be mentioned that using cord blood for transfusion implies further additional concerns: to find rapid and dependable methods for bacterial testing, to assess the rate of hemolysis in stored units, to identify optimal additive solutions and acceptable storage duration. Moreover, there is a rather scarce availability of dedicated fractionation devices. However, despite all these drawbacks, the cord-RBC concentrates might represent a unique opportunity to preterm neonates for the high HbF content. Therefore, new researches in this area are warranted.

AB  - Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterised by arrested alveolarisation and lifelong lung function impairment. There are no treatments that can reactivate normal alveologenesis. Alveolarisation involves tightly regulated signalling between several cell types. Pericytes are mesenchymal cells that drive many developmental processes, particularly by differentiating into myofibroblasts. Transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) regulates cellular differentiation and is important in alveologenesis, but must be activated to exert any effects. Signalling by the G protein a subunit Gaq/11 activates TGFb in epithelial cells. However, the role of mesenchymal cell Gaq/11 in TGFb signalling and alveolarisation is unknown. Aim Understand how mesenchymal Gaq/11 influences TGFb signalling in alveologenesis. Methods Pdgfrb-Cre+/- and Gnaqfl/fl;Gna11-/-mice were crossed, producing Pdgfrb-Cre+/-;Gnaqfl/fl;Gna11-/-offspring which lack Gaq/11 in pericytes, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. Lungs were collected for histology. Breathing-related cyclical mechanical stretch (CMS) was applied to wild-type (WT) and Gnaq-/-;Gna11-/-murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) using Flexcell apparatus. Integrin (av and b1), ROCK (Y27632) and serine protease (AEBSF) inhibitors were used. TGFb signalling was assessed by Smad2 phosphorylation. Gene expression was assessed using qPCR. Results Pdgfrb-Cre+/-;Gnaqfl/fl;Gna11-/-lungs had a BPD-like appearance, with enlarged airspaces, thickened alveolar walls, and reduced cellular proliferation and secondary septation compared with controls (p<0.05). Pdgfrb-Cre+/-;Gnaqfl/fl; Gna11-/-lungs contained thickened peripheral pulmonary vessels, suggesting impaired pericyte migration. Pdgfrb-Cre+/-;Gnaqfl/fl;Gna11-/-lungs contained less a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA), elastin and collagen than controls. Furthermore, Gnaq-/-;Gna11-/-MEFs expressed less Acta2, Col1a1, Col3a1, and Eln mRNA compared with WT MEFs (p<0.05). CMS-induced TGFb signalling was reduced in MEFs and HLFs lacking Gaq/11 (p<0.05), but was unaffected by ROCK and integrin inhibition. Serine protease inhibition reduced CMS-induced TGFb signalling (p<0.05), implicating TGFb2, which undergoes integrin-independent activation. Pdgfrb-Cre+/-; Gnaqfl/fl;Gna11-/-lungs contained less TGFb2 than controls (p<0.05), and HLFs lacking Gaq/11 expressed less TGFb2 than controls (p<0.05). Conclusion These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of breathing-related CMS-induced TGFb2 activation. This Gaq/11- A nd serine protease-dependent pathway controls essential processes in alveolarisation, including pericyte-to-myofibroblast differentiation, myofibroblast function, and pericyte migration. This is the first study to identify an isoform-specific role for TGFb2 in alveologenesis. Further study of this pathway may identify novel therapeutic targets for BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disorder most common in low birth weight premature infants. Originally described in 1967, the characteristic clinical and radiographic features of BPD have evolved over time with increased viability of very premature infants and changes in therapy, including exogenous surfactant administration and less aggressive positive pressure ventilation and oxygen supplementation. So-called "new" BPD, although first described over 20 years ago, is primary related to acinar underdevelopment with alveolar enlargement and simplification, and is subsumed under the category of alveolar growth disorders in the standard classification scheme for pediatric diffuse lung disease1. While BPD associated with prematurity is the most common alveolar growth disorder, alveolar growth abnormality is also the characteristic feature of certain other neonatal lung disorders. These include Wilson-Mikity syndrome, occurring in low birth weight infants with slowly progressing respiratory distress in the first few weeks of life despite minimal respiratory support at birth, and pulmonary hypoplasia related to limited intrathoracic space in utero from congenital diaphragmatic hernia, oligohydramnios, congenital lung malformation, or skeletal dysplasia. Alveolar growth abnormality also occurs in association with congenital cardiovascular disease, trisomy 21, and as an idiopathic condition1. Patients with an alveolar growth abnormality typically present with neonatal respiratory distress, and either improve or worsen depending on the extent of catch-up growth of the alveoli and whether or not pulmonary hypertension ensues. The chest radiographic (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) findings in infants with BPD and other alveolar growth abnormalities range from nearly normal to markedly abnormal, with distorted pulmonary lobules, perilobular reticular opacities, ground-glass opacities, and lucencies resembling emphysema or "cysts".2 The lucencies are attributable to enlarged alveoli with reduced alveolar septation and vascularization, and quantitative CT scoring based on these findings correlates with the clinical severity, level of respiratory support, and risk of rehospitalization.3 Overdistention of the airways and airspaces, especially in the setting of positive pressure ventilation and noncompliant lungs, can result in pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), air leak and cardiorespiratory compromise. To avoid these complications, it is important not to confuse PIE with the "cysts" commonly observed in alveolar growth disorders. Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG), previously known as infantile cellular interstitial pneumonitis, should be suspected in neonates and young infants with respiratory distress out of proportion to their gestational age. PIG is characterized by infiltration of the pulmonary interstitium by glycogen-laden lipofibroblasts, resulting in restrictive lung disease with impaired gas diffusion. PIG is associated with alveolar growth abnormality, pulmonary hypertension and congenital cardiovascular disease, and the ultimate clinical outcome primarily depends upon the severity of these comorbidities. CT findings reported in PIG include ground-glass opacities and cysts, but these are nonspecific and possibly attributable to the underlying alveolar growth abnormality, and definitive diagnosis is not possible without biopsy. Corticosteroid therapy may hasten the resolution of PIG, possibly due to acceleration of lung maturation, but should be used judiciously since this disorder is selflimited and typically resolves by late infancy4. A genetic disorder of surfactant metabolism should be considered in the setting of unexplained severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in a late preterm or term neonate. Usual histological findings are pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with diffuse alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and foamy macrophages without hyaline membrane formation. Neonates unable to produce surfactant protein B (SP-B) due to disease-causing biallelic inherited autosomal recessive SP-B gene mutations typically develop severe RDS within hours of birth, and diffuse hazy granular pulmonary opacification similar to RDS of prematurity is shown on CXR. In contrast to RDS of prematurity, infants with genetic SP-B deficiency progress to respiratory failure that is unresponsive to exogenous surfactant administration. Without lung transplantation, most die within a few months after birth. Acute severe RDS in neonates or chronic diffuse lung disease in older infants can be associated with spontaneous or inherited autosomal dominant surfactant protein C (SP-C) gene mutations or biallelic autosomal recessive ATP binding cassette A3 (ABCA3) gene mutations. 5 Monoallelic ABCA3 mutations are present in 3%-4% of infants of European descent and are overrepresented in infants of > 33 weeks gestational age with RDS.6 CXRs of infants with diseasecausing SP-C or ABCA3 gene mutations demonstrate hazy granular pulmonary opacities, while CT scans show ground-glass opacities, consolidation, septal thickening, or crazy-paving.2 NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1), also known as thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), is expressed in the lung, thyroid, and forebrain, and regulates transcription of the genes for surfactant proteins and Clara cell secretory protein. Disease-causing sporadic or inherited autosomal dominant NKX2-1 gene mutations or deletions lead to maldevelopment of the basal ganglia and thyroid and decreased production of surfactant proteins, resulting in ''brain-lung-thyroid syndrome'' characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, hypotonia, chorea, and lung disease. Clinical manifestations of the lung disease are varied, with neonatal RDS being the presenting pulmonary phenotype in most cases7. Recognition of clinical and imaging findings suggestive of a genetic disorder of surfactant metabolism is crucial for guiding genetic testing and possibly avoiding lung biopsy. Lung biopsy may still be appropriate if genetic testing is non-diagnostic or if awaiting the results of genetic testing would unduly delay the diagnosis in patients with rapidly progressive disease requiring lung transplantation for survival. Occasional cases are encountered in which imaging and pathological features are suggestive of a surfactant disorder but genetic testing for known disease-causing mutations is negative. These cases are likely related to uncharacterized genetic defects of surfactant metabolism, especially those with a family history of unexplained childhood-onset diffuse lung disease5. Although very rare, the diffuse developmental disorders of the lung are associated with markedly impaired alveolar gas exchange, resulting in respiratory failure and severe pulmonary hypertension within days of birth in the absence of the usual causative conditions of prematurity, meconium aspiration, congenital heart disease, perinatal asphyxia, or sepsis. Acinar dysplasia is characterized by developmental arrest of the lungs in the pseudoglandular or early canalicular phase, resulting in a paucity of alveolar spaces, while congenital alveolar dysplasia is characterized by arrest in the late canalicular/early saccular phase, resulting in incomplete alveolarization. Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is characterized by reduced alveolar capillary density, pulmonary lobular maldevelopment, and anastomotic bronchial veins (previously mischaracterized as misaligned pulmonary veins) with intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting that bypasses the alveolar capillary bed.8 ACD/MPV is also associated with malformations of the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal or urinary tracts, and some cases are related to sporadic or familial autosomal dominant FOXF1 gene mutations. Although the initial CXRs may be unimpressive, follow-up CXRs may show progressive hazy opacification of the lungs, resembling the findings of RDS of prematurity or genetic surfactant disorders. Air leak is common and likely related to barotrauma.2 Death usually ensues within a few weeks, unless the lung involvement is patchy rather than diffuse, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is available as a bridge to lung transplantation. Pulmonary lymphangiectasia is characterized by dilation of lymphatics draining the interstitial and subpleural spaces and can be a primary disorder or secondary to lymphatic congestion from conditions such as congestive heart failure or obstructed pulmonary veins.

AB  - Background and aims: Continuous caudal anesthesia (CCA) has been commonly used in pediatric practice. This technique has been applied to abdominal and chest surgery in young children providing safe and effective analgesiawhile decreasing the anesthetic requirement and the risk of nerve injury. However, the risks associated with placement of the caudal catheters (CC) and with the toxicity of anesthetic, must be appreciated and all steps to maximize safety of the technique must be taken. Method(s): We report a case of continuous caudal analgesia in a former preterm infant. Result(s): We present a case of radical left nephrectomy under combined epidural- general anesthesia in a 8-months-old preterm male with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and large for gestational age (LGA). The caudal catheter placement was performed before the surgery, under general anesthesia. Pre emptive analgesia with a single bolus injection of ropivacaine was performed. At the end of surgery, ropivacaine 0,05% was started for continuous analgesia, at a rate of 0,2mg/kg/h. The surgery and the perioperative period were uneventful. The catheter remain in place for 48 h. No respiratory or neurologic disorders, infections or other complications were recorded. Conclusion(s): Caudal catheter placement (CCP) is easy and provides excellent analgesia without depressing respiration. In this report, we illustrate the overall feasibility and effectiveness of this technique in a former preterm infant. Caudal anesthesia may be a challenging technique in pediatric population that should be managed at centers with the appropriate resources and experience.

AB  - Background. Quantity children's milk formulas used for feeding of the premature infants, including with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), recently has increased. All adapted milk formulas are high grade and are balanced on fibers, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Besides, last years widely also it is in time addition of biological active additives with antioxidizing properties (taurine, choline, lecithine, carnitine,biotin, selenium, nucleotides, etc.) is used. As it is known, oxidants stress development of many diseases, including such serious pathology as BPD. One of important sections of nursing premature infants with BPD is adequate nutrition. Data about antioxidizing activity of milk formulas and chest milk are small and inconsistent. Aim. Studying of antioxidizing activity of human milk and preterm infant formulas for feeding babies with BPD. Patients and methods. We have undertaken comparative studies by chemiluminescence method on antioxidant activity of preterm milk formulas for infants with BPD and breast milk with nutritional substances in a model schedule, simulating the most common body reactions - generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation processes. We used: PreNutrilon 0, PreNutrilon 1, FrisoPre, PreNAN, Similac Special Care, Similac NeoSure and also the female milk taken from 10 women in 14 days after deliveries (mature milk). Results. Addition of preterm infant formulas caused a depend of dose reduction chemiluminescence modelling system. The various antioxidizing activity of formulas depending on their structure is noted. Antioxidative activity of breast milk has been shown to be more reliable than that of infants' milk formulas despite their structural adaptedness to breast milk and added dietary supplements. Nutritional substances of breast milk improve antioxidative properties of milk. Among preterm infant formulas the greatest antioxidative activity had the specialised formula after an extract infants with BPD from a hospital, not containing palm-oil, with the raised maintenance of vitamins, nucleotides, biologically active additives (from 22 to 87% from control). Conclusion. Thus, chest milk and preterm milk formulas for infants with BPD influence on processes of free radical oxidation. Monitoring the infant's nutrition during the first year of life regarding antioxidant activity of breast milk and milk formulas should be done using the method of chemoluminiscence as an express method. While choosing a milk formula, the infant's body free-radical oxidation state particularly in the presence of pathologic disorders should be taken into account.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Hyperoxia causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We showed that adult mice deficient in aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) are more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than wild type (WT) controls due to marked decreases in the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A enzymes. Whether AhR protects newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that AhR dysfunctional newborn mice have increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification compared to WT newborn mice upon exposure to hyperoxia. Methods Used: One-day old C57BL/6J (WT) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor dysfunctional (AhRd) mice were exposed to air or hyperoxia (FiO2 85%) for 14 d. Following exposure to air or hyperoxia, the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the mice were collected to determine AhR activation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolarization. Pulmonary AhR activation was assessed by analyzing the expression of pulmonary CYP 1A1 NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and microsomal glutathione Stransferase 1. Lung inflammation was determined by macrophage infiltration and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression, and alveolarization was determined by lung morphometry. Oxidative stress was determined by analyzing protein carbonyls expression in the BALF. Summary of Results: In both newborn WT and AhRd mice, exposure to hyperoxia increased lung inflammation and oxidative stress. However, hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress was significantly increased in AhRd mice compared to WT mice. Likewise, hyperoxia increased alveolar simplification in both newborn WTand AhRd mice with the latter being more significantly affected than the former. Interestingly, activation of the AhR was inversely related to hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification. Conclusion(s): AhRd newborn mice have increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification compared to WT newborn mice upon exposure to hyperoxia. Our data suggest that strategies directed towards increasing the functional activation of the AhR would be effective in the prevention and treatment of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Background: The temporo-spatial development of pulmonary lymphatic vessels (PLVs) in the growing human fetus is not well established and it is unknown if this process is affected in neonatal lung disorders (NLD). We aimed to establish normal pattern of distribution and morphology of PLVs through gestation and compare to those of selected NLD. Design(s): Human fetal autopsy lung tissue representing all three trimesters (12, 13, 16, 18, 34, 39 and 40 weeks of gestational age WGA), as well as from 1 and 10 years of age with no significant lung pathology were used. In addition lung sections of patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH, n=5) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, n=5) were selected. The sections were stained with HE, trichrome, and with antibodies against smooth muscle actin (SMA) and D2-40. Result(s): The usual anatomical distribution (septal, pleural, and bronchovascular) of D2-40 positive PLVs was established as early as 12 WGA, and the PLVs between these compartments became more prominent as lung maturation evolved. PVLs were observed as distal as the terminal bronchiole level in perinatal and postnatal lungs, but none was seen in the alveolar walls. PVLs did not show the presence of smooth muscle at any age or in any anatomical compartments. In NLD, PLVs were generally dilated, especially in the septae, without smooth muscle. Frequent PVLs with small caliber were observed in the alveolar walls of all cases of both CDH and BPD. Conclusion(s): The usual temporo-spatial distribution of PVLs observed in mature lung is established by 12 WGA in the human fetus. The lymphatic endothelial specific marker D2-40 is excellent in highlighting maturing PLVs. In NLD such as CDH and BPD there is excess of PVLs in the alveolar septa with no smooth muscle accumulation. This likely represents disordered vascular development rather than a reactive phenomenon because both CDH and BPD are known to manifest vascular developmental aberrations.

AB  - Oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation are widely used to treat and manage neonatal emergencies in critically ill newborns. However, they are often associated with adverse effects and result in conditions such as chronic lung disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Hence, aclear understanding of the mechanisms underlying hyperoxia-induced lung damage is crucial in order to mitigate the side effects of oxygen-based therapy. Here, we have established an in vitro model of hyperoxia-induced lung damage in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) and delineated the molecular basis of oxygen therapy-induced impaired alveolar development. Thus, AECIIs were exposed to a hyperoxic environment and their cell viability, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, mitochondrial integrity and dynamics, and energy metabolism were assessed. The results showed that hyperoxia has no significant effect as an inhibitor of SMAD3 and ERK1/2 in AECIIs, but leads to significant inhibition of cell viability. Further, hyperoxia was found to promote AECII apoptosis and mitochondrial, whereas chemical inhibition of SMAD3 or ERK1/2 further exacerbated the detrimental effects of hyperoxia in AECIIs. Overall, these findings presented herein demonstrate the critical role of SMAD/ERK signaling in the regulation of AECII behavior in varying oxygen environments. Thus, this study offers novel insights for the prevention of neonatal lung dysfunction in premature infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal betamethasone is recommended before preterm delivery to accelerate fetal lung maturation. However, reports of growth and neurodevelopmental dose-related side-effects suggest that the current dose (12 mg plus 12 mg, 24 h apart) might be too high. We therefore investigated whether a half dose would be non-inferior to the current full dose for preventing respiratory distress syndrome., METHODS: We designed a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial in 37 level 3 referral perinatal centres in France. Eligible participants were pregnant women aged 18 years or older with a singleton fetus at risk of preterm delivery and already treated with the first injection of antenatal betamethasone (11.4 mg) before 32 weeks' gestation. We used a computer-generated code producing permuted blocks of varying sizes to randomly assign (1:1) women to receive either a placebo (half-dose group) or a second 11.4 mg betamethasone injection (full-dose group) 24 h later. Randomisation was stratified by gestational age (before or after 28 weeks). Participants , clinicians, and study staff were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the need for exogenous intratracheal surfactant within 48 h after birth. Non-inferiority would be shown if the higher limit of the 95% CI for the between-group difference between the half-dose and full-dose groups in the primary endpoint was less than 4 percentage points (corresponding to a maximum relative risk of 1.20). Four interim analyses monitoring the primary and the secondary safety outcomes were done during the study period, using a sequential data analysis method that provided futility and non-inferiority stopping rules and checked for type I and II errors. Interim analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02897076., FINDINGS: Between Jan 2, 2017, and Oct 9, 2019, 3244 women were randomly assigned to the half-dose (n=1620 [49.9%]) or the full-dose group (n=1624 [50.1%]); 48 women withdrew consent, 30 fetuses were stillborn, 16 neonates were lost to follow-up, and 9 neonates died before evaluation, so that 3141 neonates remained for analysis. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 313 (20.0%) of 1567 neonates in the half-dose group and 276 (17.5%) of 1574 neonates in the full-dose group (risk difference 2.4%, 95% CI -0.3 to 5.2); thus non-inferiority was not shown. The per-protocol analysis also did not show non-inferiority (risk difference 2.2%, 95% CI -0.6 to 5.1). No between-group differences appeared in the rates of neonatal death, grade 3-4 intraventricular haemorrhage, stage >=2 necrotising enterocolitis, severe retinopathy of prematurity, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia., INTERPRETATION: Because non-inferiority of the half-dose compared with the full-dose regimen was not shown, our results do not support practice changes towards antenatal betamethasone dose reduction., FUNDING: French Ministry of Health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical features of preterm infants with a birth weight less than 1 500 g undergoing different intensities of resuscitation., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the preterm infants with a birth weight less than 1 500 g and a gestational age less than 32 weeks who were treated in the neonatal intensive care unit of 20 hospitals in Jiangsu, China from January 2018 to December 2019. According to the intensity of resuscitation in the delivery room, the infants were divided into three groups:non-tracheal intubation (n=1 184), tracheal intubation (n=166), and extensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR; n=116). The three groups were compared in terms of general information and clinical outcomes., RESULTS: Compared with the non-tracheal intubation group, the tracheal intubation and ECPR groups had significantly lower rates of cesarean section and use of antenatal corticosteroid (P < 0.05). As the intensity of resuscitation increased, the Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes gradually decreased (P < 0.05), and the proportion of infants with Apgar scores of 0 to 3 at 1 minute and 5 minutes gradually increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the non-tracheal intubation group, the tracheal intubation and ECPR groups had significantly higher mortality rate and incidence rates of moderate-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and serious complications (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of grade III-IV intracranial hemorrhage and retinopathy of prematurity (stage III or above) in the tracheal intubation group were significantly higher than those in the non-tracheal intubation group (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: For preterm infants with a birth weight less than 1 500 g, the higher intensity of resuscitation in the delivery room is related to lower rate of antenatal corticosteroid therapy, lower gestational age, and lower birth weight. The infants undergoing tracheal intubation or ECRP in the delivery room have an increased incidence rate of adverse clinical outcomes. This suggests that it is important to improve the quality of perinatal management and delivery room resuscitation to improve the prognosis of the infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of twin pregnancy by assisted reproductive technology (ART) versus twin pregnancy by spontaneous conception (SC) on neonatal outcomes., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 3 356 live twins with a gestational age of >=24 weeks who were born in Nanjing Maternal and Child Health Hospital from 2017 to 2019, with 2 006 twins (1 003 pairs) in the ART group and 1 350 (675 pairs) in the SC group. The two groups were compared in terms of the mother's general information and pregnancy comorbidities and the general information, diseases, and outcomes of neonates., RESULTS: Compared with the SC group, the ART group had a significantly higher maternal age (P < 0.05) and significantly higher rates of primiparity, cesarean section, and cervical cerclage (P < 0.05). Compared with the SC group, the ART group had significantly higher incidence rates of maternal pregnancy comorbidities including hypertension, gestational diabetes, and postpartum hemorrhage (P < 0.05). Compared with the SC group, the ART group had a significantly lower mean gestational age of neonates (P < 0.05) and a significantly higher proportion of very-low-birth-weight infants (6.8% vs 5.8%, P < 0.05), while ART did not increase the risks of preterm birth and low Apgar score. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the mortality rate of neonates and the incidence rates of neonatal diseases including respiratory distress syndrome, stage II/III necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and grade III-IV intracranial hemorrhage (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with twin pregnancy by SC, twin pregnancy by ART does not increase the neonatal mortality rate and risk of adverse outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of interleukin-33 (IL-33) in the development and progression of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants., METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed on 128 preterm infants with a gestational age of <=32 weeks and/or a birth weight of <=1 500 g. They were classified to a non-BPD group with 50 infants, a mild BPD group with 32 infants, a moderate BPD group with 30 infants, and a severe BPD group with 16 infants. Related data were collected, including antepartum factors of mothers (antepartum hormone and chorioamnionitis), intrapartum factors of preterm infants (sex, gestational age, birth weight, mode of birth, and birth asphyxia), treatment after birth (pulmonary surfactant, duration of invasive ventilation, duration of noninvasive ventilation, duration of parenteral nutrition, and length of hospital stay). The high-risk factors for BPD were analyzed. ELISA was used to measure the serum level of IL-33 in preterm infants on days 1, 14, and 28 after birth. The serum level of IL-33 was compared between groups at different time points after birth. The preterm infants with moderate or severe BPD were treated with conventional corticosteroid therapy (DART regimen), and the serum level of IL-33 was measured before and after treatment., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the preterm infants with BPD and those without BPD in the incidence of maternal chorioamnionitis, gestational age, birth weight, the incidence of birth asphyxia, duration of invasive ventilation, duration of noninvasive ventilation, duration of parenteral nutrition, and total length of hospital stay (P<0.05). There were significant differences in the above indices among the preterm infants with different severities of BPD (P<0.05). On days 1, 14, and 28 after birth, the infants with BPD had a significantly higher serum level of IL-33 than those without BPD, and the serum level of IL-33 tended to increase with the severity of BPD and over the time after birth (P<0.05). The preterm infants with moderate or severe BPD had a significant reduction in the serum level of IL-33 after the treatment with DART regimen (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-33 is closely associated with the development and severity of BPD. Anti-inflammatory therapy with DART regimen can decrease the serum level of IL-33.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of the dynamic changes of peripheral blood human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (YKL-40) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants., METHODS: Preterm infants, with a gestational age of 28-32 weeks and a birth weight of <1 500 g, who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from July 2017 to August 2019 were prospectively selected and divided into a BPD group with 35 infants and a non-BPD group with 51 infants. ELISA was used to measure the serum concentrations of YKL-40 and HMGB1 in preterm infants on days 3, 7, and 14 after birth., RESULTS: The BPD group had a significantly lower serum YKL-40 concentration and a significantly higher serum HMGB1 concentration than the non-BPD group on days 3, 7, and 14 (P<0.001). The serum concentrations of YKL-40 and HMGB1 on days 7 and 14 were significantly higher than those on day 3 in both groups (P<0.017). In the BPD group, HMGB1 concentration on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 (P<0.017), while there was no significant change in YKL-40 concentration from day 7 to day 14 (P>0.017). In the non-BPD group, YKL-40 concentration on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 (P<0.017), while there was no significant change in HMGB1 concentration from day 7 to day 14 (P>0.017)., CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the levels of YKL-40 and HMGB1 in peripheral blood between the preterm infants with BPD and those without BPD on days 3, 7, and 14 after birth, suggesting that YKL-40 and HMGB1 might be associated with the development of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of asiaticoside against hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonatal rats based on the microRNA-155 (miR-155)/suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) axis., METHODS: Neonatal rats were randomly divided into a control group, a model group, a low-dose asiaticoside group (10 mg/kg), a middle-dose asiaticoside group (25 mg/kg), a high-dose asiaticoside group (50 mg/kg), and a budesonide group (1.5 mg/kg), with 12 rats in each group. All rats except those in the control group were exposed to a high concentration of oxygen for 14 days to establish a neonatal rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The low-, middle-, and high-dose asiaticoside groups were given asiaticoside at different doses by gavage, and those in the budesonide group were given budesonide aerosol treatment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe lung tissue development and measure radial alveolar count (RAC) and mean linear intercept (MLI). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) detection kits were used to measure the levels of SOD and MDA in lung tissue. ELISA was used to measure the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression of miR-155 and SOCS1 in lung tissue. Western blotting was used to measure the protein expression of SOCS1 in lung tissue., RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the model group had the symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia such as a disordered structure of lung tissue, enlargement of alveolar fusion, uneven alveolar septa, enlargement of average alveolar space, and a reduction in alveolar number. The model group also had significant increases in MLI, MDA level in lung tissue, serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and miR-155 level in lung tissue (P<0.05) and significant reductions in RAC, SOD level, and mRNA and protein expression of SOCS1 in lung tissue (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the low-, middle-, and high-dose asiaticoside groups and the budesonide group had significant improvement in the above symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, significant reductions in MLI, MDA level in lung tissue, serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and miR-155 level in lung tissue (P<0.05), and significant increases in RAC, SOD level, and mRNA and protein expression of SOCS1 in lung tissue (P<0.05). Asiaticoside improved the above symptoms and indices in a dose-dependent manner. There were no significant differences in the above indices between the high-dose asiaticoside and budesonide groups (P>0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Asiaticoside can alleviate inflammation injury induced by hyperoxia in neonatal rats and improve the symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in a dose-dependent manner, possibly by down-regulating the expression of miR-155 and up-regulating the expression of SOCS1.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of microRNA-495-5p (miRNA-495-5p) in the serum of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) based on a bioinformatics analysis, and to provide a theoretical basis for further research on the association between miRNA-495-5p and BPD., METHODS: A total of 40 preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from January 2015 to December 2016 were enrolled. Among these infants, 20 with early clinical manifestations of BPD were enrolled as the BPD group, and 20 without such manifestations were enrolled as the control group. Peripheral blood samples were collected. The miRNA microarray technique was used to screen out differentially expressed miRNAs in serum between the two groups. RT-PCR was used for validation of results. TargetScan, miRDB, and miRWalk databases were used to predict the target genes of miRNA-495-5p. The DAVID database was used to perform gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the target genes., RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the BPD group had a significant increase in the expression of miRNA-495-5p in serum (P<0.05). A total of 117 target genes of miRNA-495-5p were predicted by the above three databases and they were involved in several molecular functions (including transcriptional regulatory activity, transcriptional activation activity, and transcription cofactor activity), biological processes (such as metabolic regulation, DNA-dependent transcriptional regulation, and vascular pattern), and cell components (including nucleoplasm, membrane components, and insoluble components) (P<0.05). As for signaling pathways, these genes were significantly enriched in the mTOR signaling pathway (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA-495-5p may be involved in the development and progression of BPD by regulating angiogenesis, stem cell differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy, which provides clues for further research on the role and functional mechanism of miRNA-495-5p in BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maximal expiratory airflow peaks early in the third decade of life, then gradually declines with age. The pattern of airflow through adulthood for individuals born very preterm (at <32 weeks' gestation) or with very low birthweight (<1501 g) is unknown. We aimed to compare maximal expiratory airflow in these individuals during late adolescence and early adulthood with that of control individuals born with normal birthweight (>2499 g) or at term., METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of individual participant data from cohort studies, mostly from the pre-surfactant era. Studies were identified through the Adults born Preterm International Collaboration and by searching PubMed and Embase (search date May 25, 2016). Studies were eligible if they reported on expiratory flow rates beyond 16 years of age in individuals born very preterm or with very low birthweight, as well as controls born at term or with normal birthweight. Studies with highly selected cohorts (eg, only participants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) or in which few participants were born very preterm or with very low birthweight were excluded. De-identified individual participant data from each cohort were provided by the holders of the original data to a central site, where all the data were pooled into one data file. Any data inconsistencies were resolved by discussion with the individual sites concerned. Individual participant data on expiratory flow variables (FEV1, forced vital capacity [FVC], FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC [FEF25-75%]) were converted to Z scores and analysed with use of generalised linear mixed models in a one-step approach., FINDINGS: Of the 381 studies identified, 11 studies, comprising a total of 935 participants born very preterm or with very low birthweight and 722 controls, were eligible and included in the analysis. Mean age at testing was 21 years (SD 3.4; range 16-33). Mean Z scores were close to zero (as expected) in the control group, but were reduced in the very preterm or very low birthweight group for FEV1 (-0.06 [SD 1.03] vs -0.81 [1.33], mean difference -0.78 [95% CI -0.96 to -0.61], p<0.0001), FVC (-0.15 [0.98] vs -0.38 [1.18], -0.25 [-0.40 to -0.10], p=0.0012), FEV1/FVC ratio (0.14 [1.10] vs -0.64 [1.35], -0.74 [-0.85 to -0.64], p<0.0001), and FEF25-75% (-0.04 [1.10] vs -0.95 [1.47], -0.88 [-1.12 to -0.65], p<0.0001). Similar patterns were observed when we compared the proportions of individuals with values below the fifth percentile., INTERPRETATION: Individuals born very preterm or with very low birthweight are at risk of not reaching their full airway growth potential in adolescence and early adulthood, suggesting an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in later adulthood., FUNDING: National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), University of Bergen, Western Norway Regional Authority, National Institute for Health Research (UK), Stichting Astmabestrijding, St Olav's Hospital's Research Fund, Academy of Finland, European Commission, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (USA), Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effect of early or late administration of caffeine citrate in the prevention and treatment of apnea in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants., METHODS: A total of 82 VLBW infants who were hospitalized and treated in the neonatal intensive care unit between June 2015 and May 2017 were enrolled. According to the age in days when caffeine citrate treatment was started, they were divided into early treatment group (<3 days) with 22 infants and late treatment group (3 - <10 days) with 60 infants. A retrospective analysis was performed for their clinical data. The two groups were compared in terms of general information during the perinatal period, treatment process, and clinical outcome., RESULTS: Compared with the late treatment group, the early treatment group had a significantly lower birth weight (P=0.004), significantly shorter durations of mechanical ventilation and oxygen inhalation (P<0.05), and a significantly lower incidence rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P=0.032). There were no significant differences in other general information, treatment process, and clinical outcome between the two groups (P>0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of caffeine citrate can improve the prognosis of VLBW infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of rhubarb on neonatal rats with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) induced by hyperoxia., METHODS: A total of 64 rats (postnatal day 4) were randomly divided into four groups: air control, rhubarb control, hyperoxia model, and hyperoxia+rhubarb (n=16 each). The rats in the hyperoxia model and hyperoxia+rhubarb groups were exposed to hyperoxia (60% O2) to establish a BPD model. The rats in the rhubarb control and hyperoxia+rhubarb groups were given rhubarb extract suspension (600 mg/kg) by gavage daily. The pathological changes of lung tissue were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining on postnatal days 14 and 21. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured by spectrophotometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively., RESULTS: The hyperoxia model group showed reduced alveolar number, increased alveolar volume, and simplified alveolar structure, which worsened over the time of exposure to hyperoxia. These pathological changes were significantly reduced in the hyperoxia+rhubarb group. On postnatal days 14 and 21, compared with the air control and rhubarb control groups, the hyperoxia model group had significantly reduced radical alveolar count (RAC), significantly reduced activity of SOD in the lung tissue, and significantly increased content of MDA and mRNA and protein expression levels of TNF-a and IL-6 (P<0.05). Compared with the hyperoxia model group, the hyperoxia+rhubarb group had significantly increased RAC, significantly increased activity of SOD in the lung tissue, and significantly reduced content of MDA and mRNA and protein expression levels of TNF-a and IL-6 (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Rhubarb may play a protective role in rats with BPD induced by hyperoxia through inhibiting inflammatory response and oxidative stress.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) tends to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great promise in alleviating lung injury. This study explored the mechanism of ADMSC-EVs in HILI. ADMSC-EVs were isolated and identified. The murine and cell models of HILI were established. HILI mice and cells were pre-treated with ADMSC-EVs. The lung dry/wet ratio, pathological structure, apoptosis, and inflammation of HILI mice were measured. The viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress of HILI cells were measured. The internalization of EVs in lung and cells was observed by fluorescence labeling. The binding relationships between miR-21-5p and SKP2, and Nr2f2 and C/EBPalpha were analyzed. The binding of SKP2 and Nr2f2 and the Nr2f2 ubiquitination level were detected. ADMSC-EVs exerted preventive effects on HILI mice, evidenced by reduced lung dry/wet ratio, inflammation, and apoptosis in HILI mice. In vitro, EVs enhanced HILI cell viability and reduced apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. EVs carried miR-21-5p into lung cells to upregulate miR-21-5p expression and thereby target SKP2. SKP2 bound to Nr2f2 and promoted its ubiquitination degradation. EVs inhibited the binding of Nr2f2 and C/EBPalpha and further suppressed C/EBPalpha transcription. Collectively, ADMSC-EVs carrying miR-21-5p alleviated HILI via the SKP2/Nr2f2/C/EBPalpha axis. Role and mechanism of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in hyperoxia-induced lung injury. ADMSC-EVs upregulated miR-21-5p expression in cells by carrying miR-21-5p into lung cells, thereby promoting the binding of miR-21-5p and SKP2 mRNA, inhibiting the expression of SKP2, reducing the ubiquitination level of Nr2f2, increasing the expression of Nr2f2, promoting the binding of Nr2f2 and the C/EBPalpha promoter, upregulating C/EBPalpha mRNA level, and eventually alleviating HILI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the treatment and prognosis of pulmonary hemorrhage in preterm infants., METHODS: A total of 106 preterm infants diagnosed with pulmonary hemorrhage, who were hospitalized in the neonatal ward of Peking University Third Hospital between 2007 and 2016, were enrolled. These patients were divided into 2007-2011 group (34 cases) and 2012-2016 group (72 cases) according to the time of hospitalization, divided into conventional-frequency ventilation group (43 cases) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) group (63 cases) according to the respiratory support method used after the development of pulmonary hemorrhage, and divided into non-operation group (34 cases) and operation group (14 cases) according to whether PDA ligation was performed for the unclosed PDA before pulmonary hemorrhage. The general data, treatment, and prognosis were compared between different groups., RESULTS: Compared with the 2007-2011 group, the 2012-2016 group had higher rates of HFOV and PDA ligation (P<0.05), a lower mortality rate during hospitalization (P<0.05), a longer length of hospital stay (P<0.05), and higher incidence rates of intracranial hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P<0.05). Compared with the conventional-frequency ventilation group, the HFOV group had a lower mortality rate during hospitalization (P<0.05), a longer length of hospital stay (P<0.05), and higher incidence rates of intracranial hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P<0.05). Compared with the non-operation group, the operation group had a lower mortality rate during hospitalization (P<0.05), a longer length of hospital stay (P<0.05), and higher incidence rates of intracranial hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The application of HFOV and PDA ligation can improve the survival rate of preterm infants with pulmonary hemorrhage, but the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia is also increased.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced gestational age and low birthweight are associated with an increased risk of neonatal infections. However, the long-term risk of infection, especially in late preterm infants or those at near-normal birthweight, is unknown. We estimated whether rates of infection-related admissions to hospital for children in Western Australia were associated with age, gestational age, birthweight, and birth length., METHODS: We did a population-based, data-linkage study using total-linked, registry data from the Western Australia Birth Register of all liveborn, non-Indigenous Australian singleton births recorded from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 31, 2010. We followed up individuals from birth-related hospital discharge to age 18 years, death, or end of 2010, and linked to data about subsequent admissions to hospital or death registrations. Gestational age was assessed from both the last menstrual period and from estimates based on ultrasonography. We categorised birthweight by 500 g bands and birth length by 5 cm bands, and approximated the reference ranges for both to the 50th percentile. Because size at birth and gestational age are strongly associated, we calculated Z scores for gestational-specific and sex-specific birthweight, birth length, and ponderal index. Our primary outcomes were the number and type of infection-related admissions to hospital. We used multilevel negative binomial regression to generate rate ratios (RR) for such admissions, identified by codes from the International Classification of Diseases, versions 9 and 10-AM. We adjusted the RRs for maternal age at delivery, birth year, birth season, parity, sex, 5-min Apgar score, delivery method, socioeconomic status, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia., FINDINGS: Of 719 311 liveborn singletons included in the analysis and followed up for 8 824 093 person-years, 365 867 infection-related admissions to hospital occurred for 213 683 (30%) children. Of the 719 311 children included in the analysis, 137 124 (19%) had one infection-related admission to hospital, 43 796 (6%) had two, 16 679 (2%) had three, and 16 084 (2%) had four or more. The 365 867 admissions to hospital included a diagnosis of infection of the upper respiratory tract for 174 653 (48%), the lower respiratory tract for 74 297 (20%), the gastrointestinal tract for 44 755 (12%), and a viral infection for 37 213 (10%). Infection-related rates of admissions to hospital increased by 12% for each week reduction in gestational age less than 39-40 weeks (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.12-1.13), by 19% for each 500 g reduction in birthweight less than 3000-3500 g (1.19, 1.18-1.21), and by 41% for each 5 cm reduction in birth length less than 45-50 cm (1.41, 1.38-1.45). Gestational age-specific and sex-specific birthweight Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile and birth length Z scores lower than the 10th to 25th percentile were associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital (eg, 1st-5th percentile RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.12-1.19, and 1.11, 1.07-1.14, respectively). Ponderal index Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile were also associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions (eg, 1st-5th percentile RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12). A gestational age of 41 weeks or later, a birthweight or birth length Z score above the 50th percentile, or a ponderal index Z score between the 75th and 95th percentile, were associated with modestly reduced rates of infection-related admissions to hospital., INTERPRETATION: Children who were born with reduced gestational age, birthweight, and birth length have persistently increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital until age 18 years. Pregnancy outcomes should be optimised to prevent infection occurring in this population, especially in resource-limited settings where suboptimum intrauterine growth and moderate prematurity are common., FUNDING: Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.

AB  - The study of the immune system in 131 children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia at the time of remission and exacerbation. Found that children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia inherent low absolute number of lymphocytes, accompanied by increased cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8, CD 16), oxygendependence ability of granulocytes, and activation of the acute phase of immunoglobulin (IgM), in the absence of clinical signs of exacerbation. In acute respiratory disease, a somewhat paradoxical, cellular immune response with decreased lymphocyte activation against cytotoxic cells. While the dynamics of increase of cytotoxic markers in acute respiratory disease is unsatisfactory, indicating that the depletion of cellular reactivity circuit immunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In women with a multiple pregnancy, spontaneous preterm delivery is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Interventions to reduce preterm birth in these women have not been successful. We assessed whether a cervical pessary could effectively prevent poor perinatal outcomes., METHODS: We undertook a multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial in 40 hospitals in the Netherlands. We randomly assigned women with a multiple pregnancy between 12 and 20 weeks' gestation (1:1) to pessary or control groups, using a web-based application with a computer-generated list with random block sizes of two to four, stratified by hospital. Participants and investigators were aware of group allocation. For women in the pessary group, a midwife or obstetrician inserted a cervical pessary between 16 and 20 weeks' gestation. Women in the control group did not receive the pessary, but otherwise received similar obstetrical care to those in the pessary group. The primary outcome was a composite of poor perinatal outcome: stillbirth, periventricular leucomalacia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, proven sepsis, and neonatal death. Analyses were by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR1858., FINDINGS: Between Sept 21, 2009, and March 9, 2012, 813 women underwent randomisation, of whom 808 were analysed (401 in the pessary group; 407 in the control group). At least one child of 53 women (13%) in the pessary group had poor perinatal outcome, compared with 55 (14%) in the control group (relative risk 0.98, 95% CI 0.69-1.39)., INTERPRETATION: In unselected women with a multiple pregnancy, prophylactic use of a cervical pessary does not reduce poor perinatal outcome., FUNDING: The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.

AB  - De novo heterozygous mutations in HRAS cause Costello syndrome (CS), a condition with high mortality and morbidity in infancy and early childhood due to cardiac, respiratory, and muscular complications. HRAS mutations predicting p.Gly12Val, p.Gly12Asp, and p.Gly12Cys substitutions have been associated with severe, lethal, CS. We report on molecular, clinical, and pathological findings in patients with mutations predicting HRAS p.Gly12Val that were identified in our clinical molecular genetic testing service. Such mutations were identified in four patients. Remarkably, three were deletion/insertion mutations affecting coding nucleotides 35 and 36. All patients died within 6 postnatal weeks, providing further evidence that p.Gly12Val mutations predict a very poor prognosis. High birth weight, polyhydramnios (and premature birth), cardiac hypertrophy, respiratory distress, muscle weakness, and postnatal growth failure were present. Dysmorphism was subtle or non-specific, with edema, coarsened facial features, prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nares, and low-set ears. Proximal upper limb shortening, a small bell-shaped chest, talipes, and fixed flexion deformities of the wrists were seen. Neonatal atrial arrhythmia, highly suggestive of CS, was also present in two patients. One patient had congenital alveolar dysplasia, and another, born after 36 weeks' gestation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia. A rapidly fatal disease course, and the difficulty of identifying subtle dysmorphism in neonates requiring intensive care, suggest that this condition remains under-recognized, and should enter the differential diagnosis for very sick infants with a range of clinical problems including cardiac hypertrophy and disordered pulmonary development. Clinical management should be informed by knowledge of the poor prognosis of this condition. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of prolonged 85% oxygen exposure on lung vascular development and the expression of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in the neonatal rat lungs., METHODS: Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomly exposed to air (control group) and 85% oxygen (experimental group) 6 hrs after birth. The rats were sacrificed 3, 7 and 14 days after exposure and their lungs were sampled. The lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation and analysis of vessel volume density. Expressions of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in lung tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. Expression of Ang-1 protein and mRNA was detected by Western Blot and Real time-PCR., RESULTS: After being exposed to 85% oxygen for 14 days, lung tissues had pathological changes as "new" bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The RAC on day 7 and day 14 in experimental group decreased significantly as compared with the control group [(10.55 +/- 0.13) vs. (11.74 +/- 0.19), (12.47 +/- 0.05) vs. (15.03 +/- 0.16), P < 0.05]. The X-ray showed that the diameter of lung vessel was much smaller and the vessels had less branches in experimental group compared with the control group on day 14. The vessel volume density on day 14 in experimental group decreased significantly as compared with the control group [(3.55 +/- 0.09) vs. (6.03 +/- 0.16), P < 0.05]. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed that the expressions of Ang-1 protein on day 7 and day 14 in the experimental group decreased significantly as compared with the control group [(4.27 +/- 0.34) vs. (3.10 +/- 0.29), P < 0.05, (5.65 +/- 0.49) vs. (3.21 +/- 0.28), P < 0.01], [(0.88 +/- 0.31) vs. (0.41 +/- 0.12), P < 0.05, (0.90 +/- 0.29) vs. (0.21 +/- 0.06), P < 0.01]. The expressions of Ang-1 mRNA on day 7 and day 14 in the experimental group also decreased significantly as compared with the control group [(0.85 +/- 0.14) vs. (0.44 +/- 0.21), P < 0.05, (0.87 +/- 0.24) vs. (0.24 +/- 0.05), P < 0.01]., CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exposure of high concentration of oxygen may cause impairment of lung vascular development by inhibiting expression of Ang-1 in neonatal rats, which is likely to contribute to pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oxygen toxicity is thought to be a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Animal experiments reveal that erythropoietin (EPO) may have protective effects against hyperoxic lung injury, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of hyperoxia on erythropoietin receptor expression in lung development of neonatal rats., METHODS: Several litters of Wistar pups were pooled together within 12 hours after birth and randomly divided into two groups (n = 24 in each): air-exposed control group and hyperoxia-exposed group. In hyperoxia-exposed group, the rats were exposed to 85% oxygen. Pups (n = 8) from each group were sacrificed on postnatal days 3, 7, and 14. The pulmonary histological and morphometric changes were observed after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining under light microscope. Radical alveolar counts (RAC) were compared between the two groups to evaluate the differences of alveolarization. Expressions of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) in lung tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. Expressions of EPOR mRNA and EPOR protein were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting., RESULTS: In hyperoxia-exposed group, there were a few inflammatory cells infiltration in interstitium on day 3 and inflammatory response worsened on day 7. Alveolar and capillary hypoplasia and interstitial fibrosis were evident on day 14. RAC increased in air-exposed control group along with the age in days. RAC decreased from day 7 in hyperoxia-exposed group compared with air-exposed control group [(6.85 +/- 1.04) vs. (7.33 +/- 1.0), P < 0.01], which was more evident on day 14 [(6.20 +/- 1.58) vs. (9.07 +/- 0.69), P < 0.001]. Expression of PECAM-1 protein increased in air-exposed control group along with the age in days. But in hyperoxia-exposed group, it decreased on day 7 and 14 [(15.14 +/- 1.51) vs. (31.47 +/- 2.43), (11.04 +/- 1.76) vs. (41.41 +/- 3.83), P < 0.001] compared with air-exposed control group. Expression of EPOR on day 3 in air-exposed control group was the strongest and weakened gradually with the increase of postnatal days. Expression of EPOR in hyperoxia-exposed group decreased on day 3 and became more evident on day 7 and day 14 compared with air-exposed control group [(1.62 +/- 0.04) vs. (1.82 +/- 0.06), P < 0.05; (0.48 +/- 0.01) vs. (1.10 +/- 0.07), (0.39 +/- 0.04) vs. (0.87 +/- 0.03), P < 0.001]. Expression of EPOR mRNA on day 3 in air-exposed control group was the strongest and was decreased significantly in hyperoxia-exposed group compared with air-exposed control group at all time points [(0.87 +/- 0.07) vs. (1.1 +/- 0.17), (0.18 +/- 0.07) vs. (0.36 +/- 0.08), P < 0.01;(0.14 +/- 0.05) vs. (0.36 +/- 0.09), P < 0.001]., CONCLUSIONS: EPOR may participate in the modulation of normal lung development. Depressed expression of EPOR and PECAM-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of alveolar and capillary hypoplasia induced by hyperoxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In animal models, inhaled nitric oxide improved gas exchange and lung structural development, but its use in premature infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains controversial. We therefore tested the hypothesis that inhaled nitric oxide at a low concentration, started early and maintained for an extended period in babies with mild respiratory failure, might reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: 800 preterm infants with a gestational age at birth of between 24 weeks and 28 weeks plus 6 days (inclusive), weighing at least 500 g, requiring surfactant or continuous positive airway pressure for respiratory distress syndrome within 24 h of birth were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to inhaled nitric oxide (5 parts per million) or placebo gas (nitrogen gas) for a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 21 days in a double-blind study done at 36 centres in nine countries in the European Union. Care providers and investigators were masked to the computer-generated treatment assignment. The primary outcome was survival without development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at postmenstrual age 36 weeks. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00551642., FINDINGS: 399 infants were assigned to inhaled nitric oxide, and 401 to placebo. 395 and 400, respectively, were analysed. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and placebo did not result in significant differences in survival of infants without development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (258 [65%] of 395 vs 262 [66%] of 400, respectively; relative risk 1.05, 95% CI 0.78-1.43); in survival at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (343 [86%) of 399 vs 359 [90%] of 401, respectively; 0.74, 0.48-1.15); and in development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (81 [24%] of 339 vs 96 [27%] of 358, respectively; 0.83, 0.58-1.17)., INTERPRETATION: Early use of low-dose inhaled nitric oxide in very premature babies did not improve survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia or brain injury, suggesting that such a preventive treatment strategy is unsuccessful., FUNDING: INO Therapeutics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8), surfactant protein-A (SP-A) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Thirty neonates with BPD and 30 gestational age-, gender-, and birth weight-matched neonates without BPD (control group) were enrolled from December 2007 to October 2009. Non-brochoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. The levels of IL-8, SP-A and TGF-beta1 in BALF were measured using ELISA., RESULTS: The levels of TGF beta1 (47+/-15 microg/mL vs 34+/-13 microg/mL) and IL-8 (54+/-16 microg/mL vs 28+/-13 microg/mL) in the BPD group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.01). In contrast, the contents of SP-A in the BPD group were significantly lower than those in the control group (35+/-16 microg/mL vs 42+/-14 microg/mL;P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression of TGF-beta1 and IL-8 in BALF may be involved in abnormal lung development and maturation in neonates with BPD. The low expression of SP-A in the BPD group suggests that the exogenous SP-A administration may be an option for the treatment of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of hyperoxia exposure on high mobility group protein-B1 (HMGB1) expression in neonatal mice and the role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were randomly exposed to 60% O2 or air 1 day after birth. BPD was induced by 60% O2 exposure. The pulmonary tissue samples were harvested 3, 7 and 14 days after exposure. The pathologic changes of pulmonary tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson staining and radical alveolar count. The expression of HMGB1 protein in lungs was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of HMGB1 mRNA was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR., RESULTS: In the BPD group, the lungs developed decreased alceolar septation, swollen alveolar epithelium, stroma edema, interstitial fibrosis and developmental lag when compared with the control group. These changes became more obvious with more prolonged hyperoxia exposure. The expression of HMGB1 protein and mRNA 7 and 14 days after exposure increased significantly in the BPD group compared with that in the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxia exposure results in an increase in lung HMGB1 expression. The increased HMGB1 expression may be associated with the development of BPD.

AB  - In preeclamptic pregnancies, a variety of intrauterine alterations lead to abnormal placentation, release of inflammatory and/or antiangiogenic factors, and subsequent fetal growth restriction with significant potential to cause a primary insult to the developing fetal lung. Thus, modulation of the maternal intrauterine environment may be a key therapeutic avenue to prevent preeclampsia-associated developmental lung injury. A biologic therapy of interest is mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MEx), which we have previously shown to ameliorate preeclamptic physiology through intrauterine immunomodulation. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of MEx to improve developmental lung injury in experimental preeclampsia, using the heme oxygenase-1-null mouse (Hmox1-/-) model, preeclamptic pregnant dams were administered intravenous antenatal MEx treatment during each week of pregnancy followed by analysis of fetal and postnatal lung tissues, amniotic fluid protein profiles, and lung explant and amniotic fluid cocultures in comparison with control and untreated preeclamptic pregnancies. We first identified that a preeclamptic intrauterine environment had a significant adverse impact on fetal lung development, including alterations in fetal lung developmental gene profiles in addition to postnatal alveolar and bronchial changes. Amniotic fluid proteomic analysis and fetal lung explant and amniotic fluid cocultures further demonstrated that maternally administered MEx altered the expression of multiple inflammatory mediators in the preeclamptic intrauterine compartment, resulting in the normalization of fetal lung branching morphogenesis and developmental gene expression. Our evaluation of fetal and postnatal parameters overall suggests that antenatal MEx treatment may provide a highly valuable preventative therapeutic modality for amelioration of lung development in preeclamptic disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of prolonged 75% oxygen exposure on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) in the neonatal rat lungs and to elucidate the effects of prolonged exposure of high concentration of oxygen on lung vascular development and its relationship with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Forty eight Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomly exposed to air (control group) and 75% oxygen (experimental group) 12 hrs after birth. The rats were sacrificed 7, 14 and 21 days after exposure and their lungs were sampled. The lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation. Expression of VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 protein and mRNA was detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR., RESULTS: After being exposed to 75% oxygen for 21 days, lung tissues had pathological changes as 'new' BPD. Expressions of VEGF protein (10.9 + or - 2.7 vs 30.8 + or - 6.4), VEGFR1 protein (5.4 + or - 1.4 vs 15.6 + or - 3.4) and VEGFR2 protein (11.3 + or - 2.6 vs 21.7 + or - 4.5) on day 21 in the experimental group decreased significantly as compared with the control group (p<0.05). The expression of VEGF mRNA (1.6 vs 3.3), VEGFR1 mRNA (0.4 vs 6.6) and VEGFR2 mRNA (0.5 vs 4.9) on day 21 in the experimental group also decreased significantly as compared with the control group (p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exposure of high concentration of oxygen may cause BPD possibly by inhibiting lung vascular development in neonatal rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apoptosis has been shown to be involved in lung remodeling in both rat lung and human fetal lung explants. Mounting evidence suggests the pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family exert most of their function at the mitochondrial level and play pivotal roles in the process of apoptosis. Molecules such as Bax (death agonist) and Bcl-2 (death antagonist) act in competition, and their relative abundance and dimerization can determine cell death or cell survival. It is not known whether apoptosis is in part responsible for the impaired lung growth found in preterm developing lung exposed to intra-amniotic endotoxin priming plus hyperoxia, and imbalance of Bax/Bcl-2 contributes to it. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression apoptosis index (AI), Bax and Bcl-2 in premature lungs of rats with intra-amniotic endotoxin priming and/or exposed to 60% O(2) and to elucidate the relationship between intrauterine inflammatory/chronic O(2) exposure and the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into two groups: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group and saline group. LPS or saline were intra-amniotically injected into the sacs on gestational age day 15 (70% of term). Six days after intra-amniotic injection, the preterm rats were delivered and randomized to put in 60% O(2) exposure or in room air. On days 1, 7 and 14 after birth, the lungs were removed and dissected from the main bronchi for analysis. Total RNA were extracted from the right frozen lung tissues. Lung AI was measured by terminal transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)., RESULTS: (1) To quantify the proliferation of preterm lungs after intra-amniotic endotoxin priming and/or exposed to 60% O(2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the four experimental groups were measured: PCNA increased along with the lung development from d1 to d14 in both control and endotoxin alone groups. However, in endotoxin alone group, PCNA was significantly lower than that of controls from d1 to d14. In hyperoxia alone group, PCNA begun to decreased on day 7, and became significantly lower than that of the control group on day 14 (P < 0.05). In endotoxin plus hyperoxia group, PCNA was significantly lower than that of controls on days 1 and 7. (2) To quantify the apoptosis of immature lungs after intra-amniotic endotoxin priming and/or exposed to 60% O(2), AI increased along with the lung development from d 1 to d 7 in both control group and endotoxin alone group. However, in endotoxin alone group, AI was significantly higher than that of controls from d1 to d7. In hyperoxia alone group, AI begun to increased on day 7, and became significantly lower than that of the control group on day 14 (P < 0.05). In endotoxin plus hyperoxia groups, AI was higher than controls on days 1 and 7, and became significantly higher than those of the other 3 groups on day 14. (3) RT-PCR showed that mRNA of Bax decreased while Bcl-2 mRNA increased from day 1 to day 14 in endotoxin alone group, and they were significantly higher than those of controls on day 1 (P < 0.05). Conversely, Bax mRNA increased while Bcl-2 mRNA decreased from day 1 to day 7 in hyperoxia treated groups, and was significantly different from that of the control group on days 7 and 14 in both hyperoxia treated groups., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intra-amniotic endotoxin presensitization and exposure to hyperoxia may inhibit proliferation of lung cells. Increased expression of Bax and Bcl-2 may be related to the evolution of lung injury and may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease resulting from the impact of injury (including oxygen toxicity, barotrauma, volutrauma, and infection) on the immature lung. Oxygen toxicity is thought to be a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis in BPD. Previous animal studies have shown that exposure to hyperoxia in the neonatal period causes lung structural changes that are similar to the histology seen in human infants with BPD. Erythropoietin (EPO) has pleiotropic actions including antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. Animal experiments reveal that EPO may have protective effects on hyperoxic lung injury, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects and understand mechanism of action of EPO on the hyperoxia-induced BPD in newborn rats., METHOD: Several litters of Wistar pups were pooled together within 12 hours after birth and randomly divided into four groups: I. air-exposed control group, II. air-exposed human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO)-treated group, III. hyperoxia-exposed placebo group and IV. hyperoxia-exposed rhEPO-treated group . Group III and IV rats were exposed to 85% oxygen. Group II and IV rats received rhEPO (1200 IU/kg) subcutaneously on postnatal days 0 and 2. Group I and III received 0.9% saline in the same way. Pups from each group were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14. Blood hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count were determined by blood cell analyzer. Total protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured by biochemical assay. Changes of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) mRNA expressions were measured by RT-PCR., RESULT: In group III, there were a few inflammatory cells infiltrations in interstitium on day 3 and inflammatory response worsened on day 7. Alveolar and capillary hypoplasia and interstitial fibrosis were evident on day 14. The pathological changes were ameliorated greatly in group IV and the survival was prolonged. There were no abnormal raises of hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count in group IV compared with group I. Total protein concentration in BALF was measured as a marker for capillary leakage. MPO is a major constituent of neutrophil cytoplasmic granules and its activity therefore is a direct measure of neutrophil presence and an indirect indicator of lung injury. Total protein concentration and MPO in BALF were greatly depressed in group IV compared with group III, P<0.05, P<0.001. The upregulation of genes of CINC-1 and MCP-1 was closely related with lung inflammation caused by oxidative stress. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression were detected and it was found that their changes were in line with the degree of lung inflammation. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression increased in group III compared with group I especially on day 7, P<0.01 or <0.001. The changes of MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA were positively correlated with changes of MPO in BALF covering all groups on days 3, 7 and 14, respectively (r = 0.391, P<0.05; r = 0.701, P<0.01; r = 0.600, P<0.01; r = 0.471, P<0.01; r = 0.789, P<0.01; r = 0.588, P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: EPO could significantly reduce the lung inflammatory cell infiltration, and capillary endothelial cell injury in hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rats. The mechanism may be related with the inhibition of MCP-1 and CINC-1 gene expression by EPO.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible relationship between expression of surfactant protein B (SP-B) gene product and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) in Han ethnic group., METHOD: Unrelated 20 cases with NRDS of Han ethnic group were selected as NRDS group while unrelated 20 diseases cases of Han ethnic group with diseases were selected as control group. The cases in the control group had congenital heart disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia or persistent pulmonary hypertension. Blood sample was taken from every case. Lung tissues were taken from the patients who died half an hour after death in the two groups. Expression of SP-B in lung tissue was determined with immunohistochemical tecnique. Genetic deficiency variant of SP-B intron IV was screened with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)., RESULTS: Two cases at gestational age 26 weeks and one case at gestational age 34 weeks and two cases at gestational age 42 weeks of NRDS groups had lower level expression of SP-B in lung tissue than those at the same age of NRDS. Expression of SP-B in lung tissue of control group increased with gestational age, but no such phenomenon was found in NRDS group. Further, two cases at gestational age 42 weeks of NRDS group had genetic deficiency variant of SP-B intron IV with gene analysis of five cases who had lower expression of SP-B. Clinical data suggest that patients at 42 weeks of gestational age had severe illness., CONCLUSIONS: Decrease of SP-B expression may participate in occurrence of NRDS, genetic deficiency variant of SP-B intron IV exists in the NRDS cases of Han ethnic group of China.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The development of neonatology and the availability of pulmonary surfactant have been helpful in effective reduction of the mortality of very low birth weight infants at the expense of an increasing number of survivors with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) caused by lung immaturity. BPD is a common syndrome in newborns, especially in preterm infants, when treated with hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, there have been no effective measure for the prevention and treatment of BPD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rh-IGF-1) on cell apoptosis and Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) expression during the lung injury induced by hyperoxia, so as to assess its effect on the inflammatory lung injury and its developmental repair., METHODS: Eighty full term neonatal Wistar rats under the same condition were divided randomly into four groups on the second day after birth. Group I was air control, group II was exposed to hyperoxia, group III air + rh-IGF-1, and group IV was treated with hyperoxia + rh-IGF-1. The pups in the control group were kept in room air, while pups in hyperoxia group were kept in a Plexiglas chamber and exposed to over 85% oxygen. Pups in group III were under the same raising condition except for exposure to room air and treated with intraperitoneal injection of rh-IGF-1 (1 microg/Kg) everyday from the third day. Pups in group IV were treated with intraperitoneal injection of rh-IGF-1 (1 microg/Kg) everyday from the third day of exposure to hyperoxia. Lung tissue sections of the neonatal rats were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) after 7 d of hyperoxia exposure, expression of CCSP was examined by immunohistochemical method, and apoptotic cell index of lung tissue was calculated by using TUNEL method., RESULTS: It was observed from immunohistochemical examination that positive staining of CCSP was distributed mainly in distal and respiratory bronchioles. The percentage of Clara cells in distal and respiratory bronchioles epithelium decreased in hyperoxia group (32.17 +/- 3.19)% compared to that in air control group (68.32 +/- 2.04)%, P < 0.01. Statistically significant differences were found in intensity of positiveness of Clara cells between hyperoxia (29.45 +/- 5.56) and air control group (42.37 +/- 3.24), P < 0.01. TUNEL assay showed that most apoptotic cells were alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. The apoptotic index increased significantly in the hyperoxia group (55.77 +/- 6.09)% compared to the air control group (16.41 +/- 4.01)%, (P < 0.01). The positive rate (52.98 +/- 2.68)% of Clara cells and the expression (41.22 +/- 6.36) of CCSP in hyperoxia + rh-IGF-1 group increased significantly when compared with hyperoxia group, and the differences between these two group were also statistically significant (P < 0.01). The apoptotic index increased significantly in the hyperoxia + rh-IGF-1 group (27.98 +/- 3.09)% compared to the hyperoxia group (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxia exposure can promote the pneumocyte apoptosis and inhibit the expression of CCSP. Rh-IGF-1 can remove the block of the formation of lung alveoli, increase the secretion of CCSP, mitigate inflammatory responses in airway and alleviate lung injury via pneumocyte apoptosis. Therefore, the results of this study provide a theoretic and experimental evidence for clinical application of rh-IGF-1 in prevention and treatment of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tracheobronchomalacia is one of the common respiratory tract dysplasia in children. Its symptoms are nonspecific, and routine methods are unreliable in the assessment of tracheobronchomalacia in children. In addition, many physicians are confused about its clinical characteristics, so tracheobronchomalacia is often underdiagnosed. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical features of tracheobronchomalacia in children and to investigate the diagnostic value of flexible bronchoscopy for children with tracheobronchomalacia., METHOD: For diagnosis and treatment, 229 children out of 4725 patients hospitalized in the division of respiratory disorders were examined by Olympus BF3c-20 flexible bronchoscopy or by Olympus BF-P20 flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia with propofol, in Chongqing Children's Hosptial from April 2004 to April 2006. Fifty-three cases were confirmed to have tracheobronchomalacia by bronchoscopy, patients' data including airway lesion, age, sex, clinical characteristics, aided examinations, treatment, final outcomes, were collected and analyzed., RESULTS: (1) Of the 53 children with tracheobronchomalacia, 31 were not suspected for this diagnosis prior to bronchoscopy, who were instead misdiagnosed as refractory pneumonia, difficult-to-control asthma, bronchial foreign body, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary atelectasis of unknown origin or bronchiolitis. (2) In the 53 children with tracheobronchomalacia aged one month to eight years, 41 were infants, 6 were younger than two years, 4 were younger than 3 years and the rest 2 cases were older than 3 years. The risk of tracheobronchomalacia related inversely with ages. Ten cases were girls and 43 were boys. (3) Eleven cases had tracheomalacia, 24 bronchomalacia, 18 tracheobronchomalacia; 12 cases had malacia on left lung, 11 on right lung, 19 on both sides; 21 children were mild cases, 25 moderate cases, 7 severe cases. (4) In the 53 children with tracheobronchomalacia, 28 had recurrent or prolonged wheezing, 16 chronic cough, 5 recurrent respiratory infections, 2 atelectasis of unknown origin, and 2 dyspnea., CONCLUSIONS: The infants and toddlers seem to be predisposed more to the bronchomalacia than the older children. Clinical features of children with airway malacia were variable and atypical, expiratory stridor and cough are the most commonly reported symptoms. Flexible bronchoscopy should be regarded as a "golden standard" method for diagnosing TBM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory reaction and injury in immature lungs are associated with activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) to trigger proinflammatory cytokine release, but the mechanism thereof is not fully understood. The present study was conducted to understand possible relationship between expression of NF-kappaB and its inhibitor and severity and outcome of neonates with hyaline membrane disease (HMD)., METHODS: Serial samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained during mechanical ventilation from 31 preterm infants with HMD. These infants were divided into two groups: survivors group [n = 22, birth weight (1500 +/- 320) g and gestational age (31.2 +/- 1.8) weeks] and nonsurvivors group [birth weight (1340 +/- 280) g, gestational age (30.8 +/- 2.1) weeks]. Nineteen preterm infants [birth weight (1470 +/- 280) g, gestational age (30.6 +/- 1.9) weeks] without respiratory disorders were enrolled as control subjects. Alveolar macrophages (AM) were isolated by differential adherence. AM was cultured and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1 hr. Then, nuclear extracts of AM were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for NF-kappaB expression. NF-kappaB inhibitor (IkappaB-alpha protein) in cytoplasmic extracts was detected by using Western blotting and IL-1beta and IL-8 in BALF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., RESULTS: NF-kappaB complexes were observed by EMSA, they were characterized by competition with cold oligonucleotide and p65-specific antibodies. The addition of an excess of cold oligonucleotide, corresponding to the NF-kappaB binding site, turned off the signal of the band, showing that the band was specific. An excess of an irrelevant oligonucleotide (corresponding to the SP-1) did not show any effect. The addition of an anti-p65 antibody caused the supershift of the two upper bands. After EMSA, the NF-kappaB complexes were quantified by using a ImageQuant software. NF-kappaB expression in AM at 24 hrs was higher in all the patients with HMD as compared with control subjects (survives/control, 34.1 vs 11.4 RDU, P < 0.01; nonsurvivors/control, 55.2 vs 11.4 RDU, P < 0.01). The NF-kappaB expression in AM at 72 hrs was higher than that in control subjects but not for nonsurvivors (survivors/control, 47.8 vs 25.6 RDU, P < 0.01; nonsurvivors/control, 21.8 vs 25.6, P > 0.05). The NF-kappaB expression in AM from nonsurvivors was depressed at 72 hrs as compared to 24 hrs (21.8 vs 55.2, P < 0.01), whereas the NF-kappaB expression in AM from survivors was still higher at 72 hrs than that at 24 hrs (47.8 vs 34.1, t = 4.43, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: Altered NF-kappaB activation in AM of BALF of neonates with HMD was observed, and it may be mediated by decreased IkappaB synthesis, increased IkappaB degradation, or both. In HMD nonsurvivors NF-kappaB translocation was hampered upon LPS activation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen in the neonatal period may impair lung growth and is a major contributing factor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Cell death from hyperoxic injury may occur through either an apoptotic or nonapoptotic pathway. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of hyperoxia on caspase-3 and p53 gene expression and apoptosis in the lungs of neonatal rats, so as to determine the type of cell death that occurs in the lungs of neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxia., METHODS: Hyperoxic lung injury model was established by exposing to 95% O(2) in the neonatal period of Spraque-Dawley rats. The levels of caspase-3 mRNA and p53 mRNA expression in the lungs of neonatal rats exposed to 95% hyperoxia or room air were detected by RT-PCR. To quantify PCR products, PCR products were electrophoretically separated with 1.5% agarose gels. The optical density (A) values of the DNA bands were quantified by complete gel documentation and analysis system. The A ratios of p53/beta-actin denoted the relative content of p53 mRNA, results were showed as mean +/- standard deviation. The specific positive or negative bands of caspase-3 in electrophoresis gels were counted, Fisher's exact test of propabilities was used to determined statistically significant differences between two groups. We determined the extent of apoptosis taking place in the lungs of neonatal rats exposed to 95% hyperoxia using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-fluorescence nick-end labeling (TUNEL) in 7-d-old neonatal lung. Under light microscope, five areas of lung parenchyma were systematically and randomly photographed from each animal and positive cells among 500 lung cells were calculated. Results were showed as mean +/- standard deviation., RESULTS: We found increased levels of p53 messenger RNA, a gene associated with apoptosis, in the lungs of neonatal rat born and raised in 95% hyperoxia. Moderate increase in the level of p53 mRNA was found in the hyperoxic-treated group at 24 h (q = 3.2305, P > 0.05). Significant increase in the level of p53 mRNA was found in the hyperoxic-treated group at 48 h (q = 7.2941, P < 0.01). The levels of p53 mRNA expression in neonatal rat lungs exposed to 95% O(2) for 72 h or 96 h returned to normal level. The levels of caspase-3 mRNA expression were very low or absent in the hyperoxic-treated groups at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h or in the air-breathing groups at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h. An increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis was found in the hyperoxic-treated group at 7 d (F = 56.5010, P < 0.001) which was significantly greater than the number of apoptotic cells found in the lungs of rats of the same age exposed to room air., CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that 95% hyperoxia could temporarily up-regulate the gene expression of p53, which induced the transcription of p21(WAF/CIP1) mRNA. Furthermore, p21(WAF/CIP1) could lead to cell cycle arrest and inhibit proliferation of lung cells. Meanwhile, p53 could also promote apoptosis of lung cells. Therefore, exposure to high concentrations of oxygen in the neonatal period may impair lung growth and is a major contributing factor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and hyperoxia may affect the future lung growth and lead to barrier of lung development. The treatments of anti-apoptosis and promoting alveoli growth hold a promising perspective in hyperoxic lung injury. The level and ratio of caspase-3 gene expression were very low or absent in the lungs of neonatal rats exposed to 95% O(2) or room air. We speculated that caspase-3 gene expression was not essential in the hyperoxia induced lung cell apoptosis in neonatal rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oxygen toxicity is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). U74389G, a potent 21-aminosteroid antioxidant, was applied to the 95% O(2) induced acute lung injury in newborn rat model. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of hyperoxic lung injury and the interaction of possible mediators, and to explore the effect of antioxidant intervention., METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: air-exposed control, air-exposed treated with U74389G, hyperoxia-exposed control, hyperoxia-exposed treated with U74389G. Hydroxyl radical formation (2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA) was assessed by an aromatic hydroxylation assay using GC/MS with salicylate as the probe. The 8-isoprostane, a specific marker for in vivo lipid peroxidation, was quantitated by enzyme immunoassay. Pulmonary macrophage influx and nitrotyrosine formation were measured by means of immunohistochemistry. (3)H-TdR (autoradiography) incorporation was assessed as an index of active lung cell growth., RESULTS: Exposure to 95% O(2) for 7 days induced significant lung injury and mortality. The contents of hydroxyl radical in the hyperoxia-exposed lungs were dramatically increased [(2,3-DHBA 49.2 +/- 3.5 pmol/mg), (2,5-DHBA 55.8 +/- 2.3 pmol/mg), P < 0.05) and were decreased by treatment with U74389G [(2,3-DHBA 37.9 +/- 2.4 pmol/mg), (2,5-DHBA 31.3 +/- 1.9 pmol/mg), P < 0.05). The level of 8-isoprostane in the lungs of 95% O(2)-exposed newborn rats was significantly raised (546.6 +/- 32.2 pg/mg, P < 0.05) and lowered down by U74389G (358.5 +/- 24.1 pg/mg, P < 0.05). This phenomenon was also observed in the air-exposed animals. Remarkable pulmonary macrophage infiltration was evident in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats and was attenuated by U74389G treatment. Nitrotyrosine distributed in the lung parenchyma and epithelial cells of large airway of hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats. The extent of protein nitration was reduced by U74389G, but the oxygen induced morphological change was not significantly improved by U74389G treatment. Exposure to 95% O(2) induced lung growth arrest as shown by (3)H-TdR incorporation. U74389G partially preserved active lung cell growth in hyperoxia-exposed rats, but showed an inhibitory effect on normal lung cell growth., CONCLUSION: Through scavenging hydroxyl radical and lipid peroxides, U74389G could block pulmonary macrophage influx and partly avert alveolar development arrest in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats. Antioxidant intervention holds promising in hyperoxic lung injury though cautions should be taken as possible interference on normal cell development.

AB  - Plasma protein levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine were measured by LC-MS/MS at 0 and 72 h after the initiation of inhaled nitric oxide (INO) at 20 ppm in 22 prematurely born infants with clinically documented bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Infants were classified at the time of hospital discharge as either "off mechanical ventilation," "on mechanical ventilation," or "expired/organ failure." These outcomes were tested for association with changes in plasma levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine and selected clinical risk factors. Infants whose 3-nitrotyrosine levels decreased over the 72 h period were more likely to wean off of mechanical ventilation (p =.03). There was no significant association between changes in 3-chlorotyrosne levels and outcome. After controlling for other variables, an odds ratio of 8.3 (95% CI: 1.3-54.4) for improved outcomes was observed if the 3-nitrotyrosine levels decreased. These data suggest that nitrative and oxidative stress may be related to the severity of lung disease and, consequentially, the overall outcome in this select group of infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature infants often require oxygen supplementation, which can elicit bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria play important roles in lung development, in both normal metabolism and apoptosis. Enhancing our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms in BPD development can facilitate the effective treatments., METHODS: Plasma samples from BPD and non-BPD infants were collected at 36 weeks post-menstrual age and used for metabolomic analysis. Based on hyperoxia-induced animal and cell models, changes in mitophagy and apoptosis were evaluated following treatment with itaconic acid (ITA). Finally, the mechanism of action of ITA in lung development was comprehensively demonstrated through rescue strategies and administration of corresponding inhibitors., RESULTS: An imbalance in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle significantly affected lung development, with ITA serving as a significant metabolic marker for the outcomes of lung development. ITA improved the morphological changes in BPD rats, promoted SP-C expression, and inhibited the degree of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II) apoptosis. Mechanistically, ITA mainly promotes the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) to facilitate dysfunctional mitochondrial clearance and reduces apoptosis in AEC II cells by regulating autophagic flux., CONCLUSION: The metabolic imbalance in the TCA cycle is closely related to lung development. ITA can improve lung development by regulating autophagic flux and promote the nuclear translocation of TFEB, implying its potential therapeutic utility in the treatment of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Very preterm born children are at risk for impairments in multiple neurodevelopmental domains, but outcomes vary between individuals. The present study aimed to distinguish subgroups with distinct profiles of functioning across motor, cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial domains. These profiles were related to neonatal and social/environmental factors., METHOD: The sample included 1977 children born very preterm (<32 weeks' gestation) in 2011 from the French population-based EPIPAGE-2 cohort. Using latent profile analysis, subgroups of children were distinguished based on their functioning at 5.5 years. The relation between outcome profiles and neonatal and social/environmental factors was tested using multivariable multinomial logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Four subgroups with distinct outcome profiles were distinguished: no deficit in any domain (45%); motor and cognitive deficits without behavioral/psychosocial deficits (31%); primarily behavioral and psychosocial deficits (16%); and deficits in multiple domains (8%). Male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1-2.7), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR = 2.1-2.8), low parental education level (OR = 1.8-2.1), and parental non-European immigrant status (OR = 2.3-3.0) were independently associated with higher odds for all suboptimal outcome profiles compared to the favorable outcome profile., CONCLUSION: Among 5.5-year-old very preterm born children, subgroups can be distinguished with distinct outcome profiles that vary in severity, type, and combinations of deficits. This information is important for the development of interventions that are tailored to the needs of large subgroups of children across multiple domains of functioning. General neonatal and social/environmental factors may be useful for early identification of very preterm born children at risk for general rather than domain-specific impairments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Very small preterm infants who have genital mycoplasmas isolated from the trachea are at increased risk to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The early stages of BPD are characterized by inflammation. Recruitment and activation of mononuclear cells in response to mycoplasmas may be important in the early stage of the disease. Lung epithelial cell production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a protein that attracts and activates mononuclear cells, could be critical in the regulation of mononuclear cell migration to the lung., METHODS: We examined the potential of Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) to induce MCP-1 gene expression and protein production in A549 cells, a pulmonary epithelial cell line with characteristics of type II cells., RESULTS: Live or heat-inactivated Mh induces MCP-1 mRNA and protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Stimulation of MCP-1 by Mh was not inhibited by 50 micrograms/mL of polymyxin B, interleukin (IL)-1ra, or neutralizing antibodies to IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha were not detected in conditioned media of Mh-stimulated A549 cells., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Mh may participate in the inflammatory component of BPD by directly inducing epithelial cell production of cytokines that recruit and activate mononuclear cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may change lung injury in moderate hyaline membrane disease (HMD)., METHODS: Fifteen moderately premature lambs (128 days gestation, term=147 days) were randomly assigned to treatment with 20 ppm inhaled NO (n=7) from the onset of ventilation or control (n=8). Except for inhaled NO, treatments were intentionally similar to those applied in clinical situations. After porcine surfactant administration (Curosurf, 100 mg/kg), mechanical ventilator settings were modified during the course of the study to maintain PaCO(2) between 40 and 50 mmHg and post-ductal SpO(2) between 90 and 95%. The main studied parameters were gas exchanges parameters, respiratory mechanics (static compliance and functional residual capacity) and pulmonary vascular permeability and/or filtration rate indices., RESULTS: We found that 20 ppm of inhaled NO for 5 h significantly reduce ventilatory and oxygen requirements, but only during the first hour of mechanical ventilation. No increase in extravascular lung water content (5.41+/-0.96 vs. 5.46+/-1.09 ml/g bloodless dry lung in the control group and in the NO group, respectively) and no impairment of the respiratory mechanics could be found in the NO-treated group. However, inhaled NO increased the albumin lung leak index in this model (6.09+/-1.51 in the NO-treated group vs. 4.08+/-1.93 in the control group; P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not therefore support a detrimental effect of short-term exposure to low doses of NO inhalation in moderate HMD. However, it may induce an increase in lung vascular protein leakage. The pathophysiological consequences of this finding remain to be elucidated.

AB  - We identified an alternatively-spliced surfactant protein B (SP-B) mRNA from normal human lung with a 12 nt deletion at the beginning of exon 8. This deletion causes a loss of four amino acids in the SP-B precursor protein. Sequence comparison of the 3' splice sites reveals only one difference in the frequency of U/C in the 11 predominantly-pyrimidine nucleotide tract, 73% for the normal and 45% for the alternatively-spliced SP-B mRNA (77-99% for the consensus sequence). Analysis of SP-B mRNA in lung indicates that the abundance of the alternatively-spliced form is very low and varies among individuals. Although the relative abundance of the deletion form of SP-B mRNA remains constant among normal lungs, it is found with relatively higher abundance in the lungs of some individuals with diseases such as congenital alveolar proteinosis, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, alveolar capillary dysplasia and hypophosphatasia. This observation points to the possibility that the alternative splicing is a potential regulatory mechanism of SP-B and may play a role in the pathogenesis of disease under certain circumstances.

AB  - Clinical trials have shown dexamethasone's beneficial effects on the pulmonary status of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia; however, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been a reported complication of this therapy with no known mechanism. Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that therapeutic dexamethasone doses would induce myocardial hypertrophy. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone 0.125 mg/kg/day, while paired littermate controls received saline placebo. The daily body weights were recorded and pups were sacrificed after 5 or 7 days of treatment. The heart weight to body weight ratio was used as a gross index of myocardial mass. Myocardial protein content, total protein to total DNA ratio, actin content and myosin heavy chain content were used as biochemical indices of hypertrophy. Our results included an increased heart weight to body weight ratio with elevation of the total protein content, actin content and total protein to total DNA ratio after both 5 and 7 days. We conclude that dexamethasone induces myocardial hypertrophy in neonatal rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) concentrations in tracheal lavage fluids of neonates with an endotracheal tube in place during the first month of life, and to evaluate the relationship of SLPI to neutrophil counts and elastase activity in patients in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) developed versus those in whom it did not., DESIGN: A prospective, inception cohort study., SETTING: University children's hospital neonatal intensive care unit., PATIENTS: Fifty-three neonates who weighed < 2000 gm at birth, and who had an endotracheal tube in place, were enrolled. Forth-one patients survived to 28 days; BPD developed in 24 but not in 17 patients., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tracheal lavage was performed on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28, and analyzed for neutrophils, elastase activity, and SLPI. Results were evaluated longitudinally for 28 days, and were compared between BPD and no-BPD groups during the first week., RESULTS: SLPI concentrations increased significantly for all patients during the study period. During the first week, SLPI concentrations were similar between BPD and no-BPD groups; neutrophil counts and elastase activity were higher in the BPD group., CONCLUSIONS: Patients in whom BPD ultimately developed had early evidence of increased pulmonary inflammation and a significantly less favorable protease-antiprotease balance. If elastase-induced injury contributes to the development of BPD, early therapy with recombinant SLPI might be beneficial by increasing the antielastase capacity of epithelial lining fluid.

AB  - Retinol deficiency in animal models results in histopathologic airway changes that appear similar to those found in human premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Dexamethasone (DEX), a steroid now often used in the treatment of BPD, might potentially affect lung vitamin A homeostasis since it alters serum and liver retinoid stores in certain models. Our objective was to determine the effect of DEX on neonatal rat lung retinoid status and the binding of retinoic acid (RA) to cytosolic and nuclear receptor proteins. We examined this effect both in room air and when the animals breathed 95% oxygen (O2). Twenty-four 1-day-old rat pups received either 1 microgram/g DEX subcutaneously, an equal volume of normal saline (NS) subcutaneously at 0 (start experiment time), 24, and 48 hours, or no injection at all, and were sacrificed at 72 hours. Twelve rats in each treatment group were housed in room air and 12 in each group were exposed to > 95% O2 for the 3 day period. Lung and liver were analyzed for retinyl palmitate (RP). Nuclear retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) were measured by specific binding assays. DEX decreased liver RP by 33-55% and rat pup lung RP by over 60%; it also decreased lung RAR binding (mean dpm/microgram protein +/- SEM) in both room air and oxygen groups: Air (11.2 +/- 1.0) vs. Air/DEX (4.6 +/- 1.3, n = 6; P < 0.01), and O2 (18.2 +/- 0.6) vs. O2/DEX (3.2 +/- 0.6, n = 6; P < 0.001).

AB  - A blinded, randomized, controlled study was designed to test whether multiple-dose surfactant therapy would improve pulmonary outcome in term infants with respiratory failure, resulting in a shortened period of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Infants > or = 34 weeks of gestational age in severe respiratory failure and receiving ECMO were stratified by diagnosis and then randomly assigned to the treatment or the control group. Four doses of modified bovine lung surfactant extract (beractant) were administered to the surfactant group (n = 28), and an equal volume of air was administered to the control group (n = 28). Lung compliance was initially low in both groups; after treatment, values were higher with time in the surfactant group (F = 5.40, p = 0.026). The ECMO treatment period was significantly shorter in the surfactant group (mean +/- SD: 107 +/- 33 hours vs 139 +/- 54 hours for the control group; U = 232, p = 0.023). Tracheal aspirate concentrations of surfactant protein A were low in both groups, and then increased steadily to a higher level in the surfactant group (F = 2.58, p = 0.04). The overall incidence of complications after ECMO was decreased in the surfactant group (18% vs 46% for the control group; chi-square value = 5.004, p = 0.025). Radiographic scores, echocardiographic findings, incidence of intracranial or pulmonary hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, time to extubation, duration of oxygen therapy, and duration of hospitalization did not differ between the two groups. Beractant in this population improved pulmonary mechanics, increased surfactant protein A content in tracheal aspirate, decreased time on ECMO duration, and reduced disease complications.

AB  - In view of the complications of general, spinal, and caudal anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in high-risk neonates, an evaluation of lumbar epidural anaesthesia (LEA) was undertaken to assess its technical feasibility, effectiveness and incidence of complications. In 18 consecutive cases, gestational age 26 +/- 2.6 wk, birth weight 877 +/- 310 g, 16 (89%) had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 12 (67%) were oxygen-dependent at the time of surgery. Using a standard loss of resistance technique and a 4.0 cm 20 G epidural needle, the epidural space was positively identified on the first attempt in 16 (89%), and on the second attempt in 2 patients (11%). Reflux of 0.9% saline used to identify the epidural space was blood tinged in two cases. Epidural analgesia was achieved in all cases with bupivacaine 0.25% with and without 1:200,000 epinephrine, 0.75 ml.kg-1 for the first two cases, and subsequently 1.0 ml.kg-1. In 15 patients (83%), good operating conditions were achieved with epidural analgesia alone. Inhalational anaesthesia supplementation was necessary in three cases (17%). In the first two patients, the level of analgesia (T8) was insufficient to control the response to traction on the hernial sac. In one infant, analgesic to T4, whose surgery was inadvertently delayed for four hours, inhalation anaesthesia was needed to control restlessness rather than pain. Ten infants were analgesic to T2, four to T4, two to T6 and two to T8. Intraoperative periodic breathing was seen in seven infants (39%), four with oxyhaemoglobin desaturation to 75%, and two to 85%. All responded to increased FIO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Nosocomial transmission of adenovirus type 3 associated with fatalities in infants has not been frequently reported. This report describes the nosocomial spread of adenovirus types 2 and 3 among infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in a chronic (transitional) care facility. The index case developed pneumonia with a clinical deterioration in respiratory status 8 days after admission. Within the next 10 to 30 days 9 other infants and 2 health care personnel became ill with respiratory symptoms. Three of these 10 infants had progressive respiratory failure and 2 of them died. All of these infants had underlying chronic lung disease of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The overall attack rate was 30% (10 of 33). Further spread of adenovirus was prevented by using barrier precautions and masks while performing tracheostomy care. Adenovirus isolates were serotyped as Ad3 in 4 patients and 1 staff member, as Ad2 in 3 patients, and as a combination of Ad2 and Ad3 in 1 patient. Two fatalities were associated with Ad3 infection. Three isolates from 2 patients and 1 staff member were not available for typing. Restriction endonuclease analysis was performed on all of these isolates of Ad3 and Ad2. There was no genetic heterogeneity in the isolates, suggesting a common source.

AB  - To test whether the presence of airway inflammatory markers differentiated babies with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) who recovered (n = 18) from those in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) developed (n = 18), tracheal aspirate samples from 36 newborn infants with HMD who underwent intubation were collected during days 1 to 28 of life and analyzed for the mucosal antimicrobial proteins lactoferrin and lysozyme. For babies with HMD in whom BPD developed, lactoferrin concentrations were decreased during the first 4 days of life (7 +/- 3, 14 +/- 3, 18 +/- 3, and 18 +/- 3 micrograms/ml, respectively) in comparison with those in babies with HMD who recovered (23 +/- 8, 29 +/- 6, 41 +/- 9, and 81 +/- 19 micrograms/ml); group differences reached statistical significance on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.05). Lysozyme levels in the secretions of babies with BPD were also lower on day 3 (31 +/- 5 micrograms/ml) than in those of babies who recovered (54 +/- 7.5 micrograms/ml). For babies with BPD whose endotracheal tube remained in place beyond day 4, lysozyme levels on days 5 to 12 were significantly lower for those classified as having severe BPD than for those with mild to moderate BPD. Because lysozyme and lactoferrin are products of serous cells found in submucous glands, it seems possible that the relative immaturity of submucous glands may influence the development of BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is chronic lung disease of prematurity and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in BPD patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a vasodilator and apoptotic mediator made by NO synthase (NOS). NOS is inhibited by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) hydrolyzes ADMA. Previously, in a BPD patient cohort, we identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DDAH1 rs480414 (G > A) that was protective against developing PH. This study aims to determine functional consequences of the DDAH1 SNP in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from neonatal cord blood. We tested the hypothesis that DDAH1 SNP (AA) results in DDAH1 gain of function, leading to greater NO-mediated apoptosis compared to DDAH1 wild-type (GG) in LCLs., METHODS: LCLs were analyzed by Western blot (DDAH1, cleaved and total caspase-3 and -8, and beta-actin), and RT-PCR (DDAH1, iNOS). Cell media assayed for nitrites with chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and conversion of ADMA to L-citrulline was measured by spectrophotometry., RESULTS: LCLs with DDAH1 SNP had similar levels of DDAH1 protein and mRNA expression, as well as DDAH activity, compared to DDAH1 WT LCLs. There were also no changes in cleaved caspase-3 and -8 protein levels. LCLs with DDAH1 SNP had similar iNOS mRNA expression. Nitrite levels in media were lower for DDAH1 SNP LCLs compared to DDAH1 WT LCLs (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that NO production was lower in DDAH1 SNP LCLs, indicative of a loss of function phenotype.

AB  - To determine whether the level of fibronectin in lung secretions correlates with the severity of lung injury or with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or both, serial tracheal aspirate samples were collected from 32 preterm infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome. Levels of total fibronectin, cellular fibronectin, plasma fibronectin, albumin, and secretory component of IgA (SC) were determined for the first 1 to 2 weeks of life in the 14 infants who recovered without pulmonary sequelae, and for weeks 1 to 4 in the 18 infants in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia developed. Secretory component was chosen as the reference protein because its concentration in lung secretions is minimally influenced by capillary leak and does not vary with gestational or postnatal age. Albumin/SC and plasma fibronectin/SC ratios in tracheal aspirates were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) during the first 2 weeks of life in infants in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia developed, suggesting greater capillary permeability in these infants. Cellular fibronectin/SC ratios in aspirates from infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were also significantly higher in the first 2 weeks, 9.0 +/- 1.7 and 7.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms/microgram SC in weeks 1 and 2, respectively, in comparison with values from infants without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 1.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/microgram SC (p less than 0.01), suggesting increased synthesis of fibronectin in the lungs of infants with subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Elevated levels of both plasma and cellular fibronectin in tracheal aspirate samples may provide an early index of the severity of lung injury in infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome.

AB  - The influence of dexamethasone on levels of total fibronectin (tFn), cellular fibronectin (cFn), plasma fibronectin (pFn), and albumin in lung secretions was determined in tracheal aspirate samples collected from 45 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia during a 6-week course of dexamethasone therapy. Secretory component for IgA (SC) was used as a reference protein. Thirty-seven infants (82%) survived and had their endotracheal tubes successfully removed. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with a significant decrease in the cFn/SC ratio. There was also a significant decrease in albumin/SC and pFn/SC ratios, suggesting decreased capillary permeability with corticosteroid therapy. Four of the remaining infants did not improve while receiving corticosteroids and died of respiratory failure at 3 to 8 weeks of age. In these "no response" infants, tFn/SC, cFn/SC, pFn/SC, and albumin/SC ratios when corticosteroid therapy was initiated were threefold to fourfold greater (p < 0.01) than ratios in survivors. Another group of four infants initially responded to corticosteroids but subsequently died with severe pulmonary cystic degeneration at 4 to 6 months of age; in these infants, tracheal aspirate tFn/SC, cFn/SC, and albumin/SC ratios were significantly lower than in survivors and remained unchanged during corticosteroid therapy. The decrease in the concentrations of plasma fibronectin and albumin in tracheal aspirate samples from the survivors suggests that the rapid clinical improvement seen in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia after the initiation of dexamethasone therapy is due in part to improvement in the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier. In addition, the decrease in the aspirate levels of cFn suggests the potential for corticosteroids to limit pulmonary fibrosis in the surviving infants. The depressed levels of fibronectin observed in the infants with severe cystic lung disease may represent an impaired healing response to lung injury.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to hyperoxia can result in significant lung injury and has been associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Leukotrienes (LT) recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to the lung, increase vascular permeability, and have therefore been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic lung injury. This study investigates ICI 198,615 (ICI), an LTD4 and LTE4 receptor antagonist in preventing hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rabbits. Matched littermates of 7-day-old rabbits received ICI (0.1 or 1.0 microM/kg/h) or vehicle alone, were exposed to greater than 95% O2, and sacrificed after 48, 72, 84 and 96 h of exposure. Bronchoalveolar alveolar lavage fluid (BAL) of the left lung was analyzed for white cell count, differential, absolute number of PMNs, total protein, and cyclooxygenase products 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2. Lung water was quantified utilizing the right lung. Results demonstrated no significant differences between the ICI groups or between the ICI groups and controls. In conclusion, the administration of the LTD4 and LTE4 receptor antagonist ICI 198,615 was insufficient to reduce the formation of pulmonary edema, reduce mortality or attenuate hyperoxic lung injury. These experiments suggest that a number of other mediators may be involved in the hyperoxic lung injury process and that the functional inhibition of a portion of the arachidonic acid cascade was not sufficient to either prevent or attenuate hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rabbits.

AB  - It is important to evaluate the development of neonates submitted to assisted ventilation since it is one of the most commonly used procedures in patients with respiratory failure. A group of 50 neonates who had been submitted to assisted ventilation were studied and compared to another group of 50 children with the same inclusion criteria, except for the fact that they had not needed ventilation. They were each evaluated since birth and thereafter every two months during their first year of life and every three months in the second year. The Amiel Tison Neurological Assessment was used to evaluate the children during the first year while the Mayo Clinic General Neurological Exploration adapted for nursing children was applied during the following year. In assessing psychomotor development, the Brunette Lezine Scale, standardized for Mexican children, was used. For practical purposes, a sample of the results obtained during the second year are presented while some pertinent variables are commented on. For those included in the ventilated group, results show a higher frequency of hyaline membrane disease (27 cases), intraventricular hemorrhage (19), pneumonia (18), and arterious duct persistence (13). The control group showed the following frequencies, respectively: 0, 4, 5, and 4 cases. The ventilation group was found to have a statistically significant higher relative risk rate (P less than 0.05) and a higher risk for neurologic sequelae (P less than 0.001) when compared to the control group. Asphyxia and hemorrhaging were factors associated and present in the ventilated group (P less than 0.05). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - We hypothesized that administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine would inhibit iron-catalyzed free radical generation and lessen the severity of oxygen-induced pulmonary injury. To evaluate its efficacy and safety in premature infants, we administered deferoxamine by intravenous infusion to five premature baboons with hyaline membrane disease supported with conventional ventilation and 100% oxygen for 6 days. Seven animals served as controls. Deferoxamine treatment was initiated at 10 mg/kg per hour but, after the precipitous death of the first animal, was progressively reduced to 1.25 mg/kg per hour in the other animals. Four of five deferoxamine-treated baboons developed cardiovascular collapse and all five died by 42 hours. Five of the seven control animals survived the 6-day experimental period. Since cardiovascular toxic effects have not previously been reported, these findings suggest unique vulnerability of the immature cardiovascular system to iron chelation.

AB  - The putative involvement of reactive oxygen species in the etiology of lung damage in infants receiving mechanical ventilation has been examined by comparing the levels of peroxidation and expression of the antioxidant enzymes, CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase, in lungs from control and affected infants as well as from fetuses and infants who died postnatally after term delivery. Mean levels (+/- SD) of lung peroxidation, determined with a thiobarbituric acid method, were similar in affected and control premature neonates and in fetal subjects (1.87 +/- 1.26, 1.92 +/- 2.07, and 1.19 +/- 1.36 nmol/mg protein, respectively). Expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases was also similar in these subjects and in the patients who died postnatally. Thus activity measurements and immunoblotting studies showed continuous expression of these enzymes throughout development with no apparent change in protein levels or size. Immunohistochemical examination of lung tissue showed expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases in epithelial, smooth muscle, endothelial, and some mesenchyme components. In patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, alveolar walls were thickened by an excess of fibrous tissue and terminal air spaces were lined mainly by type II pneumatocytes. All structures, including abnormal fibrous components, were positive for both CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase. Our data show that, unlike some experimental animals, expression of at least these antioxidant enzymes in human infants born prematurely is similar to that in adults, and indicate that such infants are better adapted for life in an oxygen-containing environment than previously suspected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - We conducted a case-control study of antecedents of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in 223 infants enrolled in a prospective, randomized clinical trial of phenobarbital prophylaxis for intracranial hemorrhage. The trial took place at three Boston neonatal intensive care units between June 1981 and April 1984. The 76 babies with BPD had radiographic evidence of the condition and required oxygen therapy for 28 days or more. All 147 control babies survived until day 28 of life without meeting either of these criteria for BPD. Compared with control infants, those with BPD received greater quantities of total, crystalloid, and colloid fluids per kilogram per day in the first 4 days of life. In addition, infants with BPD generally had a net weight gain in the first 4 days of life in contrast to the normal pattern of weight loss seen in control infants. Finally, the infants with BPD were more likely to be given a clinical diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus and to have received furosemide on days 3 and 4 of life. From these observations we infer that early postnatal phenomena such as excessive fluid therapy may be important in the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - We hypothesized that changes in plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) concentration in response to vitamin A administration might be useful for evaluating vitamin A status of very low birth weight infants susceptible to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We prospectively studied 24 consecutively admitted neonates (birth weight less than 1350 gm, gestational age less than 31 weeks, ventilator dependent for greater than 24 hours after birth), who were eligible to receive 2000 IU supplemental vitamin A by intramuscular injection on postnatal day 1 and on alternate days thereafter for 28 days. In addition to serial assessment of vitamin A status, we measured plasma RBP just before and 1, 3, and 6 hours after an intramuscular injection of vitamin A (2000 IU/kg retinyl palmitate) on days 1 and 28. The percent increase in plasma RBP (delta-RBP) was high (mean +/- SD: 61 +/- 37%) and plasma vitamin A and RBP values were low on day 1, indicative of vitamin A deficiency. Supplemental vitamin A improved vitamin A status of all infants as shown by low delta-RBP (mean +/- SD: 8 +/- 9%) and normal plasma vitamin A and RBP values on day 28. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed in 12 of 24 infants. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had a higher mean (+/- SD) delta-RBP on day 28 than those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (13 +/- 10% vs 3 +/- 3%, p less than 0.01), indicative of persistence of low vitamin A status in infants with lung disease despite supplementation. We conclude that the plasma RBP response to vitamin A is a useful indicator of vitamin A status in very low birth weight infants. Although vitamin A supplementation at the dosage used in this study normalizes conventional plasma indexes of vitamin A in very low birth weight infants, the plasma RBP response to vitamin A may continue to reflect persistence of low vitamin A status in the more immature infants with significant lung disease. We suggest that the plasma RBP response to vitamin A may be a useful functional test in such infants.

AB  - Fifty-three newborns with pneumoperitoneum were treated between July 1980 and July 1985. The birth weights of these infants ranged from 600 to 4350 grams; nearly 75 per cent weighed less than 1500 grams. The etiology of the pneumoperitoneum and the hospital survival were reviewed. All operative patients had exploratory surgery through an upper abdominal transverse incision extending across both rectus muscles. All gastric and duodenal perforations were closed primarily; the perforations in the remaining gastrointestinal tract were generally exteriorized through the lateral edge of the wound. The single leading cause of pneumoperitoneum in the newborn is necrotizing enterocolitis, accounting for 60 per cent of the patients in this series; 78 per cent of these infants survived. All infants with ("spontaneous") ileal perforations survived. The two patients with colon perforations (from meconium plug obstruction) died, one of congenital heart disease associated with Down's syndrome and the other of hyaline membrane disease. One patient who had mild hyaline membrane disease, who was not ventilated, and who did not have mediastinal emphysema also had pneumoperitoneum for which no cause was found at laparotomy ("spontaneous"). He survived. In six critically ill infants (11% of the series) pneumoperitoneum developed secondary to mediastinal dissection of air from ventilators. None of these infants was operated on because an intestinal perforation as a source of the pneumoperitoneum could reliably be excluded by the presence of pneumomediastinum and/or a negative paracentesis. This group of infants warrants special attention, because in them "negative" laparotomies performed in search of an intestinal perforation would certainly compromise their already precarious conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease of preterm neonates; the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood. Recent studies suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in BPD., STUDY DESIGN: miRNA and mRNA microarrays were performed to analyze the expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA in BPD and control lung tissues after oxygen and air exposure on day 21. Bioinformatics methods, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were performed to predict the potential functions of differentially expressed genes. Then, miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and TarBase data., RESULTS: Our results showed that a total of 192 differentially expressed miRNAs (74 downregulated and 118 upregulated) and 1,225 differentially expressed mRNAs (479 downregulated and 746 upregulated) were identified between BPD mice and normoxia-control mice. GO and KEGG analysis showed that for downregulated genes, the top significant enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were both mainly related to immune and inflammation processes; for upregulated genes, the top significant enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were both mainly related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. PPI network and miRNA-mRNA regulatory network construction revealed that the key genes and pathways associated with inflammation and immune regulation., CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed the integrated miRNA-mRNA data of distinct expression profiles in hyperoxia-induced BPD mice, and may provide some clues of the potential biomarkers for BPD, and provide novel insights into the development of new promising biomarkers for the treatment of BPD., KEY POINTS: . Integrated advanced bioinformatics methods may offer a better way to understand the molecular expression profiles involved in BPD.. . ECM remodeling, inflammation, and immune regulation may be essential to BPD.. . The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network construction may contribute to develop new biomarkers for the treatment of BPD..

AB  - Among the pathologic findings in infants succumbing to bronchopulmonary dysplasia are peribronchiolar and alveolar fibrosis. We examined the possibility that endogenously produced growth factors might contribute to these fibrotic changes through stimulation of fibroblast replication, with a resulting increase in collagen synthesis. We cultured fibroblasts from the lungs of prematurely delivered baboons and adult hamsters exposed to 100% oxygen and tested the media from these cells to see if they produced a factor(s) that was mitogenic to normal fibroblasts. We found that lung fibroblasts from baboons delivered prematurely at 140 days of gestation and ventilated for 6 days with 100% oxygen produced a factor(s) that supported fibroblast growth. A similar factor was also secreted by fibroblasts from normal term newborn baboon lungs and from the lungs of adult hamsters exposed to 100% oxygen for 4 to 8 days. Growth factor was not secreted by lung fibroblasts from 140-day non-breathing or 24-h-ventilated premature baboons, adult baboons, or hamsters not exposed oxygen. The growth-promoting substance is apparently a progression factor that is heat labile and inactivated by exposure to trypsin. These findings indicate that exposure of both the premature and adult lung to high concentrations of oxygen causes the elaboration of a growth factor that may induce fibroblast hyperplasia. This action may result in an increased production of connective tissue proteins and thereby contribute to the development of the fibrosis seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to determine whether vitamin A supplementation from early postnatal life could reduce the morbidity associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates. Forty VLBW neonates (700 to 1300 g birth weight, 26 to 30 weeks gestational age), who were oxygen dependent and required mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours after birth, were given by the intramuscular route either supplemental vitamin A (retinyl palmitate 2000 IU) or 0.9% saline solution on postnatal day 4 and every other day thereafter for a total of 14 injections over 28 days. The study groups were comparable in gestational maturity, clinical characteristics, initial lung disease, and vitamin A status at entry into the trial. Vitamin A administration resulted in significantly higher mean plasma concentrations of vitamin A and retinol-binding protein in treated infants compared with controls. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed in nine of 20 infants given vitamin A supplement and in 17 of 20 control infants (P less than 0.008). Four of 19 infants in the vitamin A group and 11 of 20 in the control group required mechanical ventilation on study day 28 (P less than 0.029). The need for supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care was reduced in infants given vitamin A supplement compared with controls. Airway infection and retinopathy of prematurity were less frequent in the vitamin A group. We conclude that vitamin A supplementation at the dosage used in this trial in VLBW neonates not only improves their vitamin A status but also appears to promote regenerative healing from lung injury, as evidenced by a decrease in the morbidity associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Forty-one low weight premature infants treated with intermittent positive pressure ventilation in infancy were followed clinically and with chest radiography for 4 to 6 years. One child died during the period (sudden infantile death) and 2 others were not available for follow-up examination. The abnormal chest pattern of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) resolved completely or improved during the period; residual changes were found in 34 per cent of the cases. The main part of the resolution occurred during the first 2 years. Mild BPD was more prone to heal. The persisting parenchymal changes--interstitial fibrosis or areas of hyperinflation or both--were generally slight. The frequency of infection of the lower respiratory tract was increased during the first 2 years of life and was positively correlated to the severity of the pulmonary abnormalities. The frequency of infection dramatically decreased during the subsequent 2 years.

AB  - Oxidant injury and release of proteolytic enzymes in prematures with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), who are treated with ventilators and oxygen, have been postulated as possible causes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The premature may be at particular risk due to low levels of antiproteases, such as alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI), and antioxidants, such as ceruloplasmin (CER). Both alpha 1PI and CER deficiencies have been correlated with the severity of RDS. We studied serial alpha 1PI activity as measured by trypsin inhibitory capacity (TIC) and CER in the serum 27 prematures who required ventilator therapy for RDS. Serum TIC values for day 1 were significantly lower (0.34 vs. 0.92 mg inhibited/ml of sample) in the 13 patients who developed BPD compared to the 14 who did not. No significant differences were seen on succeeding days. No significant differences in CER were seen, although both groups had levels 33-50% of adult normals (11.3 vs 9.3 mg/dl). Other significant variables included birthweight (p less than 0.005), severity of RDS (p less than 0.03), and gestational age (p less than 0.03). One way analysis of variances demonstrated day 1 TIC to be the most significant variable (p less than 0.0001), followed by weight (p less than 0.007), severity RDS (p less than 0.04), and gestational age (p less than 0.03). CER levels were not a significant variable. A formula utilizing unstandardized canonical discriminant function including day 1 TIC, birthweight, severity of RDS, and gestational age was 100% sensitive and 85% specific in the prediction of BPD for the original study group. In an additional 25 consecutive admissions with severe RDS of whom 18 survived, the formula was 100% sensitive (6/6) and 75% specific (9/12). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Fetal pulmonary maturity is generally determined by analyzing amniotic fluid for surfactants. This task is accomplished by lipid extraction of the fluid and resolution, identification and quantitation of the isolated lipids with thin-layer chromatography. These methods are lengthy, cumbersome and often not available on demand. A quick, simple, reliable and economical test therefore would be highly desirable. We have been able to correlate an optical density (OD) reading of amniotic fluid at 650 nm greater than or equal to 0.15 with the absence of hyaline membrane disease (HMD). For 428 fluids in which an OD reading of greater than or equal to 0.15 was found and delivery occurred within 48 hours, HMD was present in only two infants. The accuracy of the test was 99.53% , with a false-positive rate of 0.47%. With the use of this simple and accurate test one can satisfy the requirement of an on-demand test to determine fetal pulmonary maturity.

AB  - Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or high permeability pulmonary oedema (HPPE) is an uncommon presentation of a viral pneumonia and usually occurs in the setting of a fulminant or severe viral pneumonia. High permeability pulmonary oedema (HPPE) can be loosely defined as those forms of pulmonary oedema with normal cardiac function associated with the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial or intraalveolar spaces. Through the years, a number of phrases have been used to describe this entity: white lung, shock lung, wet lung, adult hyaline membrane disease, ARDS and others. The aetiology is varied but the clinical, radiologic and pathologic pictures are similar. In fact the pathologic picture is so consistent from patient to patient regardless of aetiology that it has been suggested that the term HPPE be used in place of the other commonly used ones. A case of HPPE of possible viral aetiology who responded to prompt intervention with a successful outcome, is described here.

AB  - Serum C-reactive protein determinations were performed on well and sick neonates, in order to gain information about normal values and its value in the diagnosis of neonatal septicaemia. The median value in 48 cord sera was 200 micrograms/l (range 15 to greater than 6,000 micrograms/L); there was no correlation between paired maternal and cord serum CRP levels (12 pairs). Thirty-six children were followed from birth for a mean of 20 days. There were 21 episodes of confirmed infection in 16 children, each associated with a sustained rise in C-reactive protein, often commencing before there was clinical evidence of infection. In four patients with raised levels, infection was suspected, but no firm evidence was obtained. In the remaining 16 children there were no values above 10 mg/l, and the 95th centile was about 6 mg/l, with no difference between values obtained in the first three days of life and those found subsequently. Hyaline membrane disease and jaundice were not associated with a rise. Raised serum C-reactive proteins is a good indicator of the presence of infection in the neonatal period.

AB  - Plasma concentrations of retinol and retinol-binding protein were measured at birth in 91 preterm infants. In 64% of these babies retinol values were less than 20 micrograms/dl, suggestive of vitamin A deficiency. Forty-seven of these infants were observed with sequential measurements of retinol and retinol binding protein through 21 days of age. In babies with respiratory distress syndrome retinol values were similar to those in babies without respiratory distress syndrome. The retinol binding protein levels were lower on the third day of life in babies with respiratory distress syndrome. Babies who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia had lower concentrations of retinol at birth (P less than 0.05) and on day 21 (P less than 0.05) than did babies who did not develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia, despite receiving recommended intakes of vitamin A. Many preterm infants are deficient in vitamin A at birth, and failure to correct this deficiency may contribute to the development of chronic lung disease.

AB  - Serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed prospectively on 10 normal control subjects, 20 Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), and 11 Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) newborn infants to evaluate the role of pulmonary inflammation in neonatal lung disease. Minimal inflammation was found in BAL at less than 24 h of life in all groups, but significant pulmonary polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) influxes were noted at 96 h in RDS and BPD compared with control subjects. By 1 wk of life, BAL PMN counts returned to normal in RDS, but counts remained significantly elevated through 5 wk in BPD. Alveolar macrophage (AM) counts were significantly elevated at 96 h in RDS (p less than 0.05), but were significantly depressed in BPD at 4 and 5 wk (p less than 0.05). The BAL elastase/alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1Pi) ratios in RDS did not differ from those of normal control subjects; however, these ratios were significantly elevated from 1 through 4 wk of life in BPD, placing these infants at risk for proteolytic lung damage. Lavage elastase levels were elevated in both RDS and BPD, associated with a parallel increase in BAL alpha 1Pi in RDS and depressed BAL alpha 1Pi in BPD. These findings suggest that pulmonary inflammation, associated with a prolonged PMN influx and an imbalance between elastase and alpha 1Pi, may contribute to the development of the neonatal chronic lung disease, BPD.

AB  - Pulmonary edema is an important feature of many newborn lung diseases, including respiratory distress from severe perinatal asphyxia, heart failure, hyaline membrane disease, pneumonitis from group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Neonatal pulmonary edema often results from increased filtration pressure in the microcirculation of the lungs. This occurs during sustained hypoxia, in left ventricular failure associated with congenital heart disease or myocardial dysfunction, following excessive intravascular infusions of blood, colloid, fat, or electrolyte solution, and in conditions that increase pulmonary blood flow. Low intravascular protein osmotic pressure from hypoproteinemia may predispose infants to pulmonary edema. Hypoproteinemia is common in infants who are born prematurely. Large intravascular infusions of protein-free fluid further decrease the concentration of protein in plasma and thereby facilitate edema formation. Lymphatic obstruction by air (pulmonary interstitial emphysema) or fibrosis (long-standing lung disease) also may contribute to the development of edema. Bacteremia, endotoxemia, and prolonged oxygen breathing injure the pulmonary microvascular endothelium and cause protein-rich fluid to accumulate in the lungs. The risk of neonatal pulmonary edema can be reduced by several therapeutic measures designed to lessen filtration pressure, increase plasma protein osmotic pressure, and prevent or reduce the severity of lung injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a pulmonary injury related to inflammation and is a major cause of premature infant death. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators in pulmonary injury and inflammation. We investigated the molecular mechanism of lncRNA H19 in pulmonary injury and inflammation in hyperoxia (Hyp)-induced BPD mice., STUDY DESIGN: The BPD newborn mouse model was established and intervened with H19 to evaluate the pathologic conditions and radial alveolar count (RAC) in lung tissues of mice in the room air (RA) and Hyp group on the 4th, 7th, and 14th days after birth. The levels of BPD-related biomarkers vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), and surfactant protein C (SPC) in lung tissues were detected on the 14th day after birth. The expression of and relationships among H19 and miR-17, miR-17, and STAT3 were detected and verified. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, p-STAT3, and STAT3 levels in mouse lung tissues were detected on the 14th day after birth., RESULTS: Hyp-induced mice showed increased alveolar diameter, septum, and hyperemia and inflammatory cell infiltration, upregulated H19, decreased overall number and significantly reduced RAC on the 7th and 14th days after birth, which were reversed in the si-H19-treated mice. VEGF was upregulated and TGF-beta1 and SPC was decreased in si-H19-treated mice. Moreover, H19 competitively bound to miR-17 to upregulate STAT3. IL-6 and IL-1beta expressions and p-STAT3 and STAT3 levels were downregulated after inhibition of H19., CONCLUSION: Downregulated lncRNA H19 relieved pulmonary injury via targeting miR-17 to downregulate STAT3 and reduced inflammatory response caused by p-STAT3 in BPD newborn mice., KEY POINTS: . lncRNA H19 was highly expressed in Hyp-induced BPD newborn mice.. . si-H19 relieved pulmonary injury in Hyp-induced BPD newborn mice.. . si-H19 upregulated miR-17 and downregulated STAT3 expression..

AB  - Alterations of lung tissues were evaluated in 74 infants with respiratory distress who received respirator therapy and high concentrations of oxygen for varying durations. Infant survival ranged from 3 hours to 135 days. Sequential pathologic changes were revealed to be an exudative reaction superimposed upon the early stages of typical hyaline membrane disease. This merged with and was eventually replaced by a reparative fibroproliferative response that was most pronounced in those infants who survived for the longest period of time. This response appeared causally related to the development of pulmonary complications of interstitial fibrosis, emphysema, obliterative bronchiolitis and cystic bronchiolectasis. Correlative ultrastructural studies disclosed generalized capillary endothelial damage in early stages of oxygen therapy, interstitial edema and alteration of alveolar cells attributed to the toxic effects of oxygen. Proliferation of type 2 alveolar cells with incorporation of hyaline membranes into septal walls was a notable feature of the reparative reaction and appeared significant in the subsequent development of interstitial fibrosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breastfeeding is one of the strategies that has been shown to be effective in preventing severe forms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). When mother's own milk (MOM) is not available, pasteurized donor milk (DM) is the best alternative. However, the evidence is inconclusive on the difference in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) between patients fed MOM and those fed with DM. As standard DM is usually mature pooled milk donated by mothers who have delivered their babies at term, the potential benefits of preterm milk may be lost., MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, retrospective, single-center study was conducted in the neonatology department of a high-complexity hospital. The study included newborns <32 weeks of gestational age born between January 2020 and December 2022. When supplemental milk was needed, non-pooled preterm pasteurized donor milk (PDM) matched for gestational age and moment of lactation was used in this study, classifying preterm infants in two groups: mainly MOM (>50% of the milk) or mainly PDM (>50% of the milk). Two groups were established: those who received >50% MOM and those who received >50% PDM. They were also classified according to the diagnosis of DBP: one group included no BPD or grade 1 BPD (noBPD/1), while the other included grade 2 or 3 BPD (BPD 2-3). The objectives of this study were, firstly, to evaluate the incidence of BPD 2-3 among patients who predominantly received PDM versus MOM. Secondly, to analyze differences in the type of human milk received and its nutritional components, as well as to study the growth in patients with or without BPD., RESULTS: One hundred ninety-nine patients were included in the study. A comparison of noBPD/1 versus BPD 2-3 groups between those receiving mainly MOM versus PDM showed no significant differences (19% vs. 20%, p 0.95). PDM colostrum in BPD 2-3 compared to noBPD/1 was higher in protein content (2.24 g/100 mL (SD 0.37) vs. 2.02 g/100 mL (SD 0.29) p < 0.01), although the statistical significance decreased after adjustment for gestational age and birth weight z-score (OR 3.53 (0.86-14.51)). No differences were found in the macronutrients in the mature milk of patients feeding more than 50% PDM in both study groups. Growth of BPD 2-3 showed a greater decrease in the difference in z-scores for height at birth and at discharge compared to noBPD/1 (-1.64 vs. -0.43, p 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of mainly MOM or PDM demonstrates a similar incidence of noBPD/1 or BPD 2-3. Non-pooled and matched by gestational age and time of lactation preterm donor milk can probably be an alternative when mother's own milk is not available, with a similar protective effect in the prevention of severe BPD.

AB  - Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is a hydrophilic protein with multiple crucial anti-inflammatory and immunological functions. It might play a role in the development and course of pulmonary infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other respiratory disorders. Only few small neonatal studies have investigated SP-D: we aimed to investigate the links between this protein, measured in the first hours of life in extremely preterm neonates, and clinical outcomes, as well its relationship with pulmonary secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were obtained within the first 3 h of life. SP-D and sPLA2 were measured with ELISA and radioactive method, respectively; epithelial lining fluid concentrations were estimated with urea ratio. Clinical data were prospectively collected. One hundred extremely preterm neonates were nonconsecutively studied. SP-D was significantly raised with increasing gestational age (24-26 wk: 68 [0-1,694], 27 or 28 wk: 286 [0-1,328], 29 or 30 wk: 1,401 [405-2,429] ng/mL, overall P = 0.03). SP-D was significantly higher in cases with clinical chorioamnionitis with fetal involvement (1,138 [68-3,336]) than in those without clinical chorioamnionitis with fetal involvement (0 [0-900] ng/mL, P < 0.001). SP-D was lower in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (251 [0-1,550 ng/mL]) compared with those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or who died before its diagnosis (977 [124-5,534 ng/mL], P = 0.05) and this was also significant upon multivariate analysis [odds ration (OR): 0.997 (0.994-0.999), P = 0.024], particularly in neonates between 27- and 28-wk gestation. SP-D significantly correlated with the duration of hospital stay (rho = -0.283, P = 0.002), invasive ventilation (rho = -0.544, P = 0.001), and total sPLA2 activity (rho = 0.528, P = 0.008). These findings help understanding the role of SP-D early in life and support further investigation about the role of SP-D in developing BPD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Surfactant protein-D increases with gestational age and is inversely associated with BPD development. These results have been obtained in the first hours of life of extremely preterm neonates with optimal perinatal care.

AB  - Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, and its expression increases under various stress conditions, including inflammation, hyperoxia, and senescence. GDF15 expression is increased in neonatal murine bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) models, and GDF15 loss exacerbates oxidative stress and decreases cellular viability in vitro. Our overall hypothesis is that the loss of GDF15 will exacerbate hyperoxic lung injury in the neonatal lung in vivo. We exposed neonatal Gdf15-/- mice and wild-type (WT) controls on a similar background to room air or hyperoxia (95% [Formula: see text]) for 5 days after birth. The mice were euthanized on postnatal day 21 (PND 21). Gdf15-/- mice had higher mortality and lower body weight than WT mice after exposure to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia exposure adversely impacted alveolarization and lung vascular development, with a greater impact in Gdf15-/- mice. Interestingly, Gdf15-/- mice showed lower macrophage count in the lungs compared with WT mice both under room air and after exposure to hyperoxia. Analysis of the lung transcriptome revealed marked divergence in gene expression and enriched biological pathways in WT and Gdf15-/- mice and differed markedly by biological sex. Notably, pathways related to macrophage activation and myeloid cell homeostasis were negatively enriched in Gdf15-/- mice. Loss of Gdf15 exacerbates mortality, lung injury, and the phenotype of the arrest of alveolarization in the developing lung with loss of female-sex advantage in Gdf15-/- mice. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show for the first time that loss of Gdf15 exacerbates mortality, lung injury, and the phenotype of the arrest of alveolarization in the developing lung with loss of female-sex advantage in Gdf15-/- mice. We also highlight the distinct pulmonary transcriptomic response in the Gdf15-/- lung including pathways related to macrophage recruitment and activation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the pathogen diagnostic performance of targeted high-throughput next-gen sequencing (tNGS) in respiratory infectious diseases in preterm infants using dynamic follow-up., METHODS: Clinical samples of respiratory secretions were consecutively collected from 20 preterm infants weekly for 5 weeks, during which 10 developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Pathogen identification from these collected specimens was performed by both conventional cultivation and tNGS., RESULTS: We found that targeted next-generation sequencing shared a 90.9% full or partial consistency for lower respiratory pathogen detection with the traditional culture-based approach, and increased the detection rate by 105.9%. Moreover, most of the pathogens identified by tNGS were diminished in patients after treatment., CONCLUSION: This study reveals the high sensitivity and performance of targeted high-throughput sequencing for respiratory infectious disease diagnosis and pathogen identification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the related risk factors in blood transfusions for extremely low birth weight infants and extreme preterm infants, and to explore the prevention strategy of anemia., METHODS: A total of 60 infants with gestational age < 28 weeks or birth weight < 1000 g admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The infants with a birth weight of less than 1000 g were divided into the blood transfusion group and the non-blood transfusion group according to whether they received a blood transfusion. The general health situation, disease occurrence and treatment measures during hospitalization were compared between the two groups, and the risk factors of blood transfusion were analyzed., RESULTS: There were significant differences in maternal anemia during pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age, hemoglobin and hematocrit at birth, blood collection within 2 weeks after birth, length of hospital stay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and patent ductus arteriosus between the transfusion group and the non-transfusion group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis and ROC curve analysis showed that the younger the gestational age (OR=0.385, 95% CI: 0.212~0.705, P=0.002), the lower the birth weight (OR=1.004, 95% CI: 0.967~0.998, P=0.001), the longer the hospitalization time (OR=2.178, 95% CI: 1.172~4.049, P=0.014) and a larger blood collection within 2 weeks after birth (OR=1.269, 95% CI: 1.084~1.489, P=0.003) would induce higher the blood transfusion rates., CONCLUSION: The transfusion indications of extremely low birth weight infants and extreme preterm infants are affected by many factors, among which gestational age, length of hospital stay, blood collection within 2 weeks after birth and birth weight are independent predictors of transfusion. Blood transfusion in extremely low birth weight infants and extreme preterm infants is associated with an increased risk of apnea, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and patent ductus arteriosus.

AB  - Neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the common causes of premature birth complications, which is caused by lung dysplasia. Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) has been proved to be related to BPD and other disease processes, but the molecular mechanism of metastasis-related lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in BPD has not been fully understood. This study focused on exploring the clinical and molecular mechanism of MALAT1 in neonatal BPD, aiming to provide new insights for the management of neonatal BPD. In our study, we first found that serum MALAT1 was up-regulated in neonatal BPD and severe BPD. Further, through receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, it was found that the area under the curve of MALAT1 for differentiating neonatal BPD from severe BPD was 0.943 and 0.866, respectively. Then, we established BPD models in vivo and in vitro with C57BL/6J mice and BEAS-2B cells, and found that MALAT1 was also highly expressed in them and increased with the induction time of the models. Pathological evaluation confirmed that down-regulating MALAT1 or up-regulating miR-206 might improve the pathological condition of BPD. Obvious inflammatory response, oxidative stress and up-regulated apoptosis were observed in BPD models in vivo and in vitro. However, after MALAT1 knockdown treatment, the above abnormal phenomena were alleviated to varying degrees. Furthermore, we also found that MALAT1 has a targeted relationship with miR-206, and miR-206 is down-regulated in BPD in vivo and in vitro. Down-regulating miR-206 could also eliminate the anti-BPD effect after knocking down MALAT1. The above results indicated that MALAT1 has the potential as a blood biomarker of neonatal BPD, and MALAT1-miR-206 axis mediates BPD process, which may be a new target for neonatal BPD treatment.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced lung injury occurs in neonates on oxygen support due to premature birth, often leading to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Current treatment options have limited effect. The aim of this study was to determine if human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and those differentiated to an alveolar-like phenotype (diPSCs) could repair hyperoxia-induced lung damage in a mouse model. Neonatal C57BL6/J mice were separated into two groups and exposed to 75% oxygen over 6 or 14 days. Cell treatments were instilled intra-orally following removal. Controls included hyperoxia, normoxia, and a vehicle. 7 and 14 days post treatment, lungs were extracted and histomorphometric analysis performed. Gene expression of markers mediating inflammation (Tgfbeta1, Nfkb1, and Il-6) were investigated. In addition, exosomes from each cell type were isolated and administered as a cell free alternative. There was a significant difference between the mean linear intercept (MLI) in hyperoxic vs. normoxic lungs prior to treatment. No difference existed between the MLI in iPSC-treated lungs vs. normoxic lungs after 6 and 14 days of hyperoxia. For mice exposed to 6 days of hyperoxia, gene expression in iPSC-treated lungs returned to normal 14 days later. At the same time points, diPSCs were not as effective. Exosomes were also not as effective in reversing hyperoxic lung damage as their cellular counterparts. This study highlights the potential benefit of using iPSCs to repair damaged lung tissue through possible modulation of the inflammatory response, leading to novel therapies for acute hyperoxia-induced lung injury and the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Ventilatory support, such as supplemental oxygen, used to save premature infants impairs the growth of the pulmonary microvasculature and distal alveoli, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although lung cellular composition changes with exposure to hyperoxia in neonatal mice, most human BPD survivors are weaned off oxygen within the first weeks to months of life, yet they may have persistent lung injury and pulmonary dysfunction as adults. We hypothesized that early-life hyperoxia alters the cellular landscape in later life and predicts long-term lung injury. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped lung cell subpopulations at postnatal day (pnd)7 and pnd60 in mice exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 3 days as neonates. We interrogated over 10,000 cells and identified a total of 45 clusters within 32 cell states. Neonatal hyperoxia caused persistent compositional changes in later life (pnd60) in all five type II cell states with unique signatures and function. Premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation with different durations also showed similar alterations in these unique signatures of type II cell states. Pathologically, neonatal hyperoxic exposure caused alveolar simplification in adult mice. We conclude that neonatal hyperoxia alters the lung cellular landscape in later life, uncovering neonatal programing of adult lung dysfunction. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.
