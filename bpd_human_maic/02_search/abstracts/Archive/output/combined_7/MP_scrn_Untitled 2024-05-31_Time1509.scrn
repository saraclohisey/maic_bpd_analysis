The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in the control of synaptic transmission, modulating memory, motivation, movement, nociception, appetite and thermoregulation. ECS also exert extraneural effects, mainly immunomodulation and vasodilation. Two cannabinoid receptors have been cloned so far: CB1 receptors are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) but can also be found in glial cells and in peripheral tissues; CB1 receptors are Gi/o protein coupled receptors that modulate the activity of several plasma membrane proteins and intracellular signaling pathways. CB2 receptors are also Gi/o protein-coupled receptors; although it is accepted that CB2 receptors are not expressed in forebrain neurons, they have been described in activated glia. The ECS plays an important role in perinatal life. For example, from the very beginning, participating in the successful embryonal passage through the oviduct and in implantation into the uterus; later on, participating in brain development, regulating neural progenitor differentiation and guiding axonal migration and synapto-genesis; or postnatally, participating in the initiation of milk suckling, at least in mouse pups. Additionally, endocannabinois and many of the cannabinoid agonists are strong antioxidants. Its antioxidant effect is directly related with its molecular structure, in particular for phenolic cannabinoids. These cannabinoids act as reducing substances, demonstrating to be comparable with BHT (antioxidant) in their ability to prevent Fenton reaction in in vitro experiments. Cannabinoid anti-oxidation, however, is also indirectly due to the modulation of different sources of oxidative stress as toxic NO, prostanoid or cytokine production. Much of this indirect antioxidant effect is mediated by CB2 receptor activation. These data point to the ECS as a natural antioxidant system. In fact, the enhancement of the \"endocannabinoid tone\" by blunting pharmacologically or genetically the endocannabinoid de-gradating machinery has shown some therapeutic benefits in animal models of diseases related with oxidative stress as cardiovascular diseases or some neurodegenerative diseases. Concerning the perinatal period, it is of high interest the increase in the endocannabinoid concentration demonstrated just after birth, when sudden increase of oxygenation is challenging the antioxidant defenses of the newborn. Besides, direct and indirect antioxidant properties of cannabinoids are involved in the robust neuroprotective effect demonstrated for cannabinoids in newborn animals after hypoxic-ischemic insults. There are no studies on the possible role of cannabinoids in other oxidative stress-related diseases of newborns, as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but altogether these data suggest that the ECS plays a relevant role in the newborn responses against oxidative stress in different physiological and pathophysiological conditions.","group":"g1","id":"9bf6fff1-4cbd-4730-b154-a5411b79fee1","_showDetails":true},"6f424882-53d4-4d65-8d5f-4def94a63584":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70200093","title":"Patient triggered ventilation (PTV)","authors":["Greenough A."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*air conditioning","*patient","*perinatal care","infant","ventilator","lung function test","weaning","nursery","pressure support ventilation","breathing","in vitro study","oscillation","clinical study","newborn","gas exchange","meta analysis","intermittent mandatory ventilation","pneumothorax","bleeding","lung dysplasia","general aspects of disease","physiology","oxygen"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"A.

Meta-analysis of the result of randomised trials of assist control ventilation (ACV) or synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) compared to conventional ventilation, however, demonstrated no significant difference in the incidence of pneumothorax, intraventricular haemorrhage or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Use of ACV/SIMV was associated with a significantly shorter duration of ventilation, but only if started in the recovery phase of the illness. In addition, ACV was associated with faster weaning compared to when the SIMV rate is reduced below 20 bpm, as this increases the infant's work of breathing. New triggered modes are now being used. During pressure support ventilation (PSV), as with SIMV and ACV, the initiation of mechanical inflation is determined by the beginning of the infant's inspiratory effort but, in addition, termination of inflation is also determined by the infant's inspiratory effort. When inflation is terminated is fixed with certain ventilators or can be manually adjusted (termination sensitivity). Increasing termination sensitivity has been shown to decrease the level of asynchrony, but this was associated with a shorter inflation time. In a randomised trial, pressure support with SIMV compared to SIMV alone was associated with a significant reduction in supplementary oxygen duration. The likely explanation for that finding is that addition of pressure support to SIMV reduced the work of breathing, as the transdiaphragmatic pressure time produce was shown to be significantly reduced when pressure support was added to SIMV. During proportional assist ventilation (PAV), the timing and frequency of ventilator inflations are controlled by the patient. The applied pressure is servo-controlled throughout each spontaneous breath, increasing in proportion to the flow and/or volume generated by the infant, this can be enhanced to reduce the work of breathing due to both compliance (elastic unloading) and resistance (resistive unloading) abnormalities. In vitro studies, however, have demonstrated it is essential to determine the most appropriate level of unloading if oscillations in the delivered pressure or high peak pressures are to be avoided. In addition, although during PAV unloading does reduce the inspiratory load, there can be wave form abnormalities and a time lag in delivery of the inflation pressure; the clinical impact of such problems requires evaluation. There have been very few clinical studies assessing PAV in prematurely born neonates, and those that have been performed have had short-term outcomes demonstrating gas exchange has been maintained at lower mean or peak pressures than on other ventilation modes. It is essential when newer triggered modes are introduced, the optimum method of use is first determined in physiological studies, before their efficacy is assessed in randomised trials with long term outcomes.","group":"g1","id":"6f424882-53d4-4d65-8d5f-4def94a63584","_showDetails":true},"619bf26b-086f-482e-8505-f8d7c83e1787":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70200086","title":"Use of heliox in ventialted neonates","authors":["Gadzinowski J.","Szczapa T."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*newborn","*perinatal care","patient","air conditioning","artificial ventilation","respiratory failure","gas","respiratory distress syndrome","oxygenation","mean arterial pressure","university","asthma","turbulent flow","medicine","density","vital sign","breathing mechanics","acid base balance","general condition","temperature","lung","heart rate","neonatology","lung dysplasia","meconium aspiration","intermittent mandatory ventilation","oxygen saturation","arterial gas","blood gas analysis","parental consent","population","tidal volume","peak expiratory flow","lung mechanics","lung alveolus oxygen tension","pH","pressure","gas flow","laminar flow","airway resistance","lung function test","diffusion","odor","taste","diving","breathing","blood oxygenation","survival","adult","tissue","lung ventilation","*heliox","oxygen","helium","carbon dioxide","inert gas","nitrogen"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"J.

Therapeutic usefulness of heliox is based on the reduction of density of the inspired gas mixture that leads to increase of the gas flow under the conditions of turbulent flow. Heliox reduces the Reynolds number and helps to convert turbulent flow to laminar flow. It should result in decreased airway resistance and decreased work of breathing. Heliox increases oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion in the alveoli due to its density which is lower than air, improving alveolar ventilation. Helium is an inert gas which does not have any biochemical effects on tissues. It is does not have any smell or taste, it is nonexplosive and safe to use. It has been widely used for deep diving. Effects of heliox persist as long as it used for ventilation, they cease as soon as it is stopped. According to the theoretical design the exchange of nitrogen by helium in the breathing gas mixture will not only cause an increase of volume of gas transported to the lungs but also better penetration of gas mixture into the atelectatic regions of lungs. It usually results in better ventilation during the \"acute phase\" of respiratory failure - the most critical period for the patient. Obtaining normal blood oxygenation during this period determines patient's chances for general condition stabilization and survival. Heliox use was described both in adults (eg. asthma and COPD) and in pediatric population (eg. asthma, RSV bronchilitis). There are few studies concerning heliox ventilation in neonates. The study in the Department of Neonatology of Poznan University of Medical Sciences was carried out in newborns with symptoms of severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Newborns with respiratory failure in course of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) were enrolled in the study. Patients were ventilated using pressure controlled synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV). Fraction of inspired oxygen was adjusted based on patient's oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas analysis. Parameters of mechanical ventilation, respiratory mechanics, oxygenation and acid-base balance were analyzed. Basic vital signs (heart rate, mean arterial pressure and temperature) were also recorded. Analyzed parameters were recorded one hour before heliox ventilation, one hour during heliox ventilation and one hour after heliox ventilation was stopped. Written parental consent was obtained for every patient. The study was approved by Bioethical Committee of Poznan University of Medical Sciences (decision no. 167/05). 34 patients in three groups (RDS, BPD and MAS) were enrolled in the study. It was found that mechanical ventilation with heliox did not affect basic vital signs of the ventilated newborns in any of the groups. Patients general condition was stable during and after ventilation with helium and oxygen mixture. No statistically significant changes in the heart rate, temperature or mean arterial pressure were present. It was found that mechanical ventilation with heliox caused and increase in tidal volume (VT) in ventilated newborns from the RDS and BPD group. It also increased values of dynamic compliance (Cdyn) in the ventilated newborns from the BPD and MAS group. Mechanical ventilation with heliox increased peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in BPD patients. Changes in described pulmonary mechanics parameters were statistically significant. It was also observed that mechanical ventilation with heliox allows to use lower fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in the newborns with respiratory failure in the RDS, BPD and MAS group. Statistically significant decrease of oxygenation index (OI) and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference (AaDO2) was found in all patients groups. Statistically significant increase in pH was observed in BPD and MAS group. It was concomitant with a decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The beneficial effects of heliox reversed soon after ventilation with this gas mixture was stopped. Ventilation with helium and oxygen mixture had a positive effect on the selected parameters of oxygenation, acid-base balance and respiratory mechanics in newborns with respiratory failure. Nevertheless this method of treatment will require further research on a bigger group of patients for unambiguous evidence of its clinical efficacy.","group":"g1","id":"619bf26b-086f-482e-8505-f8d7c83e1787","_showDetails":true},"10815a08-b8d5-430b-a466-db5955e48d2f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"50875752","title":"Ventilation-mediated injury after preterm delivery of ureaplasma parvum colonized fetal lambs","authors":["Polglase G.R.","Hillman N.H.","Pillow J.J.","Nitsos I.","Newnham J.P.","Knox C.L.","Kallapur S.G.","Jobe A.H."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","article","*artificial ventilation","bacterial colonization","controlled study","delivery","fetus","injury severity","lamb","lung function","*lung injury/co [Complication]","lung lavage","monocyte","nonhuman","positive end expiratory pressure","pregnancy","*premature labor/co [Complication]","prenatal period","priority journal","protein expression","serotype","signal transduction","tidal volume","*Ureaplasma","Ureaplasma infection","artificial lung surfactant","early growth response factor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 1beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Pediatric Research","language":"English","volume":"67","number":"6","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group (Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1530-0447","address":"G.

Method(s): A retrospective, descriptive, qualitative, pilot study of a convenience sample of parents of 16 children who were discharged from the hospital with a tracheostomy tube between September 2004 and December 2008 was conducted. Data were obtained from the unit's discharge database and from the primary and/or secondary caregivers. Univariate analyses were used to determine the frequency of primary and secondary caregiver participation at home. Themes were generated from caregiver responses regarding utilization of a second caregiver in the home. Result(s): A majority (93.8%, n=15) reported primary caregivers participating very often in the care of the infant at home; less than half (31.3%, n=5) reported comparable secondary caregiver participation. Fifty percent (n=8) said they would not be able to care for the infant at home without another trained caregiver. Analysis of the caregiver responses revealed three major themes: confidence, safety, and respite/support. Conclusion(s): Findings support the importance of training two caregivers in the care of a child being discharged with a tracheostomy tube.

In addition, they are at risk to develop episodes of severe respiratory failure (\"BPD spells\"). We report our experience with airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), a ventilation modality which allows spontaneous respiration during a relatively long high pressure phase followed by a shorter release period allowing for CO-{2} removal from the conducting airways. Despite the higher MAP, the unique APRV flow pattern is thought to decrease volutrauma. Objective(s): To determine the feasibility and safety of APRV in neonates with severe BPD. Design/methods: Approval for this retrospective review was obtained from Childrens Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Institutional Review Board. Patients with advanced BPD treated in the Newborn and Infant Critical Care Unit at CHLA that received APRV at the discretion of the attending neonatologist for developing severe respiratory failure between May 2004 and June 2005 were identified and their medical records reviewed. Result(s): Nine patients were placed on APRV using the AVEA ventilator (CareFusion, San Diego, CA). Eight infants were former extremely premature infants with severe BPD and 1 infant was born at term infant with suspected surfactant protein-B deficiency. Mean gestational and postmenstrual age was 26.7 +/- 4.9 and 50.5 +/- 9.8 weeks, respectively at the time of initiation of APRV. The duration of APRV was 17.5 +/- 11.9 days. On APRV, patients received higher MAP (29 vs. 15 cm H-{2}O; p< 0.001) and lower FiO-{2} (0.5 vs. 0.3; p = 0.38) compared to SIMV with pressure support, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation or high-frequency jet ventilation. Seven of the 9 patients had clinical improvement on APRV within 3 days defined by fewer episodes of severe desaturation, variability in FiO-{2}, and vasopressor/inotrope support. In addition, none of the infants received pharmacological neuromuscular blockade after the initiation of APRV. Despite the higher MAP, patients did not develop air-leaks and remained hemodynamically stable with normal blood pressure and urine output. Conclusion(s): These preliminary data indicate that infants with severe BPD tolerate the use of APRV without apparent adverse effects. However, it remains unclear whether APRV is indeed safe and beneficial in former very preterm neonates with severe BDP and episodes of respiratory failure. Randomized controlled studies are required to determine the safety, efficacy and long-term morbidities of this mode of ventilation in neonates. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

Hyperoxia contributes to the development of BPD, inhibits cell proliferation and decreases cell survival. The mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of caffeine in pulmonary oxygen toxicity remain largely unknown. A549 and MLE 12 pulmonary epithelial cells were exposed to hyperoxia or maintained in room air, in the presence of different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1 and 1mM) of caffeine. Caffeine had a differential concentration-specific effect on cell cycle progression, oxidative stress and viability, with 1mM concentration being deleterious and 0.05 mM being protective. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during hyperoxia was modulated by caffeine in a similar concentration-specific manner. Caffeine at 1mM, but not at the 0.05 mM concentration decreased the G2 arrest in these cells.

Based on their ability to recognize pathogens and to regulate the host defense, SP-A and SP-D have been recently categorized as \"Secretory Pathogen Recognition Receptors\". SP-A and SP-D were first identified in the lung; the expression of SP-A and SP-D has also been observed at other mucosal surfaces, such as lacrimal glands, gastrointestinal mucosa, genitourinary epithelium and periodontal surfaces. Since the role of these proteins is not fully elucidated at other mucosal surfaces, the focus of this article is on lung-SP-A and SP-D. It has become clear from research studies performed over a number of years that SP-A and SP-D are critical for the maintenance of lung homeostasis and the regulation of host defense and inflammation. However, none of the surfactant preparations available for clinical use have SP-A or SP-D. A review is presented here on SP-A- and SP-D-deficiencies in lung diseases, the importance of the administration of SP-A and SP-D, and recent patents and research directions that may lead to the design of novel SP-A- or SP-D-based therapeutics and surfactants. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","group":"g1","id":"7ecf0ffa-ffd4-44a0-9325-e3fc0d91b604","_showDetails":true},"4c81d9c6-cf1b-49e1-b8d0-4962baf3f556":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"360110568","title":"Moderate postnatal hyperoxia accelerates lung growth and attenuates pulmonary hypertension in infant rats after exposure to intra-amniotic endotoxin","authors":["Tang J.-R.","Seedorf G.J.","Muehlethaler V.","Walker D.L.","Markham N.E.","Balasubramaniam V.","Abman S.H."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["amnion fluid","animal experiment","animal tissue","article","blood vessel wall","female","gestation period","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","*hyperoxia","*lung development","lung structure","newborn","nonhuman","perinatal period","priority journal","protein expression","pulmonary hypertension","rat","*endotoxin/to [Drug Toxicity]","vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"299","number":"6","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1522-1504","address":"J.-R.

Escherichia coli ETX or saline (SA) was injected into amniotic sacs in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at 20 days of gestation. Pups were delivered 2 days later and raised in room air (RA) or moderate hyperoxia (O2, 80% O2 at Denver's altitude, ~65% O2 at sea level) from birth through 14 days of age. Heart and lung tissues were harvested for measurements. Intraamniotic ETX caused right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and decreased lung vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) protein contents at birth. In ETX-exposed rats (ETX-RA), alveolarization and vessel density were decreased, pulmonary vascular wall thickness percentage was increased, and RVH was persistent throughout the study period compared with controls (SA-RA). After antenatal ETX, moderate hyperoxia increased lung VEGF and VEGFR-2 protein contents in ETX-O2 rats and improved their alveolar and vascular structure and RVH compared with ETX-RA rats. In contrast, severe hyperoxia (>=95% O2 at Denver's altitude) further reduced lung vessel density after intra-amniotic ETX exposure. We conclude that intra-amniotic ETX induces fetal pulmonary hypertension and causes persistent abnormalities of lung structure with sustained pulmonary hypertension in infant rats. Moreover, moderate postnatal hyperoxia after antenatal ETX restores lung growth and prevents pulmonary hypertension during infancy.

Spontaneous preterm deliveries that occur before the 34th week of gestation, and particularly before the 32nd week of gestation, have been strongly associated to intrauterine infection, ascending from vagina, and represent the largest portion of neonatal deaths and neurological problems. Bacterial vaginosis, characterized by a diminished or absent flora of lactobacilli and increased colonization of several anaerobic or facultative microorganisms, increases two times the risk of preterm delivery before the 34th week. Trials of antibiotics failed to show efficacy and effectiveness against spontaneous preterm birth related to bacterial vaginosis. Some studies indicate benefit from selected probiotics to treat genitourinary infections, including bacterial vaginosis. Objective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the early administration of selected probiotics to pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis/intermediate degree infection to reduce the occurrence of spontaneous preterm delivery and related neonatal mortality and morbidity. Methods/Design. Women attending public prenatal care services in Rio de Janeiro will be screened to select asymptomatic pregnant women, less than 20 weeks' gestation, with no indication of elective preterm delivery. Those with vaginal pH > = 4.5 and a Nugent score between 4 and 10 (intermediate degree infection or bacterial vaginosis) will be randomized to either the placebo or the intervention group, after written informed consent. Intervention consists in the use of probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, 2 capsules a day, each capsule containing more than one million bacilli of each strain, for 6-12 weeks, up to the 24th-25th wk of gestation. Ancillary analyses include quantification of selected cervicovaginal cytokines and genotyping of selected polymorphisms. The randomization process is stratified for history of preterm delivery and blocked. Allocation concealment was designed as well as blinding of women, caregivers and outcome evaluators. The study will be supervised by an independent monitoring committee. Outcomes under study are preterm delivery (< 34- < 32 weeks of gestation) and associated neonatal complications: early neonatal sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and prematurity-related retinopathy; definitions were adapted from those recommended by the 2002 version of the Vermont-Oxford Network.

We examined the capacity of MSCs to differentiate into myofibroblasts, cells that participate in lung development, injury, and repair. Gene expression was measured by array, qPCR, immunoblot, and immunocytochemistry. Unstimulated MSCs expressed mRNAs encoding contractile (e.g., ACTA2, TAGLN), extracellular matrix (COL1A1 and ELN), and actin-binding (DBN1, PXN) proteins, consistent with a myofibroblast phenotype, although there was little translation into immunoreactive protein. Incubation in serum-free medium increased contractile protein (ACTA2, MYH11) gene expression. MSC-conditioned medium showed substantial levels of TGF-beta1, and treatment of serum-deprived cells with a type I activin receptor-like kinase inhibitor, SB-431542, attenuated the expression of genes encoding contractile and extracellular matrix proteins. Treatment of MSCs with TGF-beta1 further induced the expression of mRNAs encoding contractile (ACTA2, MYH11, TAGLN, DES) and extracellular matrix proteins (FN1, ELN, COL1A1, COL1A2), and increased the protein expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, myosin heavy chain, and SM22. In contrast, human bone marrow-derived MSCs failed to undergo TGF-beta1-induced myofibroblastic differentiation. Finally, primary cells from tracheal aspirates behaved in an identical manner as later passage cells. We conclude that human neonatal lung MSCs demonstrate an mRNA expression pattern characteristic of myofibroblast progenitor cells. Autocrine production of TGF-beta1 further drives myofibroblastic differentiation, suggesting that, in the absence of other signals, fibrosis represents the \"default program\" for neonatal lung MSC gene expression. These data are consistent with the notion that MSCs play a key role in neonatal lung injury and repair.

Of the deleterious effects induced by hyperoxia, alterations in protein synthesis are likely to be of great importance to the developing lung. Regulation of mRNA translation occurs predominantly at the level of initiation via control of mRNA/ribosome binding by proteins known as eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF). Although hyperoxia is known to suppress mRNA translation in adult lungs, little is known regarding the effects in newborns or the involved mechanism. This study was performed to determine the effect of exposure to 95% O2 on pulmonary protein synthesis in 4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups. We found that hyperoxia suppressed the incorporation of [3H]phenylalanine into lung protein over time, resulting in a 23% reduction after 72 h compared with pups reared in room air. This effect was preceded by a shift in total lung RNA to lower order polysomes. Hyperoxia increased eIF4G-eIF4E binding, a surrogate maker of eIF4F complex assembly, and initially activated, then suppressed, the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 and ribosomal S6 protein, downstream targets of mammalian target of rapamycin. Exposure to 95% O2 enhanced the phosphorylation of the translational repressor eIF2alpha in whole lung extracts and the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated eIF2alpha in epithelial cells. Cell culture studies further demonstrated that hyperoxia increases eIF2alpha phosphorylation in lung epithelial cells, but not in lung fibroblasts. These findings illustrate that hyperoxia-induced suppression of mRNA translation in the newborn lung is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of eIF2alpha in the epithelium.

Method(s): 17 pregnant women with imminent preterm birth were randomized to receive a single repeat dose of beta-methasone (12 mg) or placebo (repeat beta-methasone: 8 infants, gestational age (GA) 30.8 +/- 2.2 weeks; placebo: 14 infants, GA 30.4 +/- 2.7 weeks).

The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a membrane-bound multiligand receptor with a key role in inflammation. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) is created by alternative mRNA splicing or shedding of the receptor's extracellular domain and can inhibit RAGE-activation. Aim(s): To assess the association of funisitis with airway and systemic concentrations of sRAGE in very premature infants. Method(s): Forty-two ventilated infants (gestational age: 27.4 +/- 1.8. weeks, birth weight: 1017 +/- 229. g [mean +/- SD]) were studied. sRAGE concentrations were measured in tracheobronchial aspirate fluid (TAF) on days of life 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 and in umbilical cord serum of 28 infants by ELISA. The secretory component for IgA (SC) served as reference protein in TAF. Placental tissue, membranes and umbilical cords were examined microscopically to distinguish three groups: chorioamnionitis (n=9), funisitis (n=17) and controls (n=16). Result(s): The funisitis group had lower sRAGE concentrations than both other groups in cord blood serum (median: 0.52. ng/ml [25th-75th centile: 0.32-0.91]; control, 1.72 [1.02-2.69]; chorioamnionitis, 1.44 [0.92-1.63], p<0.01) and TAF on day 1 (290. ng/ngSC [140-400]; control, 2750 [1470-28920]; chorioamnionitis, 2150 [1220-7140], p<0.01). sRAGE in TAF remained lower in the funisitis than in the chorioamnionitis group on days 3 and 10, p<0.01 respectively.

Advances in basic pulmonary vascular biology over the last few decades have led directly to several novel therapies, which have significantly expanded therapeutic choices and have led to improved survival and quality of life of many children with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Despite these mprovements, long-term outcomes in many settings remain guarded and substantial challenges persist, especially with regard to understanding mechanisms and approach to structural remodeling of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Expression of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKGI), both critical mediators of nitric oxide (NO) signaling, is diminished in the injured newborn lung through unknown mechanisms. Recent studies suggest that excessive transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activity inhibits injured newborn lung development. To explore mechanisms that regulate pulmonary NO signaling, we tested whether TGF-beta decreases sGC and PKGI expression in the injured developing lung and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). We found that chronic oxygen-induced lung injury decreased pulmonary sGCalpha1 and PKGI immunoreactivity in mouse pups and that exposure to a TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody prevented this reduction of sGC and PKGI protein expression. In addition, TGF-beta1 decreased expression of NO signaling enzymes in freshly isolated pulmonary microvascular SMC/ myofibroblasts, suggesting that TGF-beta has a direct role in modulating NO signaling in the pup lung. Moreover, TGF-beta1 decreased sGC and PKGI expression in pulmonary artery and aortic SMC from adult rats and mice, suggesting a general role for TGF-beta in modulating NO signaling in vascular SMC. Although other cytokines decrease sGC mRNA stability, TGF-beta did not modulate sGCalpha1 or PKGIbeta mRNA turnover in vascular SMC. These studies indicate for the first time that TGF-beta decreases NO signaling enzyme expression in the injured developing lung and pulmonary vascular SMC. Moreover, they suggest that TGF-beta-neutralizing molecules might counteract the effects of injury on NO signaling in the newborn lung.

We have previously found that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) activity in airway epithelial cells of COPD patients is decreased compared to healthy smokers, suggesting a previously unknown role for C/EBPs in COPD pathogenesis. To investigate the role of the transcription factor C/EBPalpha in lung development and its potential role in COPD, mice with a lung epithelial-specific disruption of the C/EBPalpha gene (Cebpa DELTALE) were generated using Cre-mediated excision, and the resulting pathology was studied during development and into adulthood. CebpaDELTALE mice exhibit impaired lung development and epithelial differentiation, as well as affected vascularity. Furthermore, Cebpa DELTALE mice that survive until adulthood develop a severe pathological picture with irregular emphysema; bronchiolitis, including goblet cell hyperplasia, bronchiolar metaplasia, fibrosis and mucus plugging; and an inflammatory cell and gene expression profile similar to COPD. Cebpa DELTALE mice display lung immaturity during development, and adult CebpaDELTALE mice develop a majority of the histopathological and inflammatory characteristics of COPD. CebpaDELTALE mice could thus provide new valuable insights into understanding the long-term consequences of lung immaturity and the link to susceptibility of developing COPD.

Tracheal aspirates were obtained at intubation and on days 3, 7, and 28. Bacterial DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced. Concentrations of interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were measured. Chorioamnionitis was diagnosed by histology. BPD was defined as an oxygen requirement at 36 wk postmenstrual age., RESULTS: Acinetobacter was the predominant genus in the airways of all infants at birth. Ten infants developed BPD and showed reduced bacterial diversity at birth. No differences were detected in bacterial diversity, cytokines, LPS, and LTA from infants with and without exposure to chorioamnionitis., CONCLUSION: The airways of premature infants are not sterile at birth. Reduced diversity of the microbiome may be an important factor in the development of BPD and is not associated with differences in inflammatory mediators.","group":"g1","id":"cffcc672-07c1-4f42-b4d9-323f22efafa6","_showDetails":false},"dab3233d-3bce-4f98-8f2e-63995ae88a64":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"358062181","title":"Prolonged mechanical ventilation with air induces apoptosis and causes failure of alveolar septation and angiogenesis in lungs of newborn mice","authors":["Mokres L.M.","Parai K.","Hilgendorff A.","Ertsey R.","Alvira C.M.","Rabinovitch M.","Bland R.D."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["air","angiogenesis","animal experiment","animal model","apoptosis","article","*artificial ventilation","*chronic lung disease","controlled study","lung alveolus wall","*lung dysplasia","lung endothelium","mouse","newborn","nonhuman","priority journal","signal transduction","stretching","caspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","elastin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","Smad2 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","transforming growth factor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin A/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin receptor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"298","number":"1","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1522-1504","address":"R.

Previous studies showed fewer alveoli and microvessels, with reduced VEGF and increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signaling, and excess, scattered elastin in lungs of premature infants and lambs with CLD vs. normal controls. MV of newborn mice with 40% O2 for 24 h yielded similar lung structural abnormalities linked to impaired VEGF signaling, dysregulated elastin production, and increased apoptosis. These studies could not determine the relative importance of cyclic stretch vs. hyperoxia in causing these lung growth abnormalities. We therefore studied the impact of MV for 24 h with air on alveolar septation (quantitative lung histology), angiogenesis [CD31 quantitative-immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunoblots], apoptosis [TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), active caspase-3 assays], VEGF signaling [VEGF-A, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGF-R1), VEGF-R2 immunoblots], TGFbeta activation [phosphorylated Smad2 (pSmad2) quantitative-IHC], and elastin production (tropoelastin immunoblots, quantitative image analysis of Hart's stained sections) in lungs of 6-dayold mice. Compared with unventilated controls, MV caused a 3-fold increase in alveolar area, ~50% reduction in alveolar number and endothelial surface area, >5-fold increase in apoptosis, >50% decrease in lung VEGF-R2 protein, 4-fold increase of pSmad2 protein, and >50% increase in lung elastin, which was distributed throughout alveolar walls rather than at septal tips. This study is the first to show that prolonged MV of developing lungs, without associated hyperoxia, can inhibit alveolar septation and angiogenesis and increase apoptosis and lung elastin, findings that could reflect stretch-induced changes in VEGF and TGFbeta signaling, as reported in CLD.

Vitamin A supplementation has improved respiratory outcome of premature infants, but there is little information about the structural and molecular manifestations in the lung that occur with vitamin A treatment. We hypothesized that vitamin A supplementation during prolonged MV, without confounding by antenatal steroid treatment, would improve alveolar secondary septation, decrease thickness of the mesenchymal tissue cores between distal air space walls, and increase alveolar capillary growth. We further hypothesized that these structural advancements would be associated with modulated expression of tropoelastin and deposition of matrix elastin, phosphorylated Smad2 (pSmad2), cleaved caspase 3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), VEGF, VEGF-R2, and midkine in the parenchyma of the immature lung. Eight preterm lambs (125 days' gestation, term ~150 days) were managed by MV for 3 wk: four were treated with daily intramuscular Aquasol A (vitamin A), 5,000 IU/kg, starting at birth; four received vehicle alone. Postmortem lung assays included quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry, and morphometry and stereology. Daily vitamin A supplementation increased alveolar secondary septation, decreased thickness of the mesenchymal tissue cores between the distal air space walls, and increased alveolar capillary growth. Associated molecular changes were less tropoelastin mRNA expression, matrix elastin deposition, pSmad2, and PCNA protein localization in the mesenchymal tissue core of the distal air space walls. On the other hand, mRNA expression and protein abundance of VEGF, VEGF-R2, midkine, and cleaved caspase 3 were increased. We conclude that vitamin A treatment partially improves lung development in chronically ventilated preterm neonates by modulating expression of tropoelastin, deposition of elastin, and expression of vascular growth factors.

Yet, culture detects about 1% of the microbial world. Thus, the importance and nature of the microorganisms involved may not have been adequately characterized. We used molecular microbiologic techniques to characterize microbial diversity and burden of IAI in preterm PROM and its relationship to pregnancy outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Amniotic fluid from 230 subjects with PPROM was analyzed by culture and molecular methods. We used end-point and real-time PCR assays to amplify rDNA of bacteria or archaea, and end-point PCR for Candida spp., Ureaplasma spp., Mycoplasma hominis, GBS, Fusobacterium spp., and Sneathia/Leptoptrichia spp. Taxonomic designations were based on sequenced rRNA clones. RESULT(S): 1) The prevalence of IAI was higher by molecular and culture methods combined (48%; 97/204) than by culture alone (34%; 70/204); 2) microbial diversity was richer by PCR (n=41 phylotypes) than by culture (n = 16 species). Taxa detected by PCR but not culture included genera previously unreported in this setting but strongly associated with the gastrointestinal tract (GI) (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Coprobacillus, Sutterella), as well as novel uncultivated sequence types such as Bacteroidetes and candidate division TM7; 3) a positive PCR was associated with histologic chorioamnionitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and perinatal death (p<0.05 each); 4) a positive PCR had a shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery interval than a negative PCR (survival analysis, p<0.05); 5) a dose-response association was demonstrated between high bacterial rDNA abundance and gestational age at delivery (p<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): 1) Molecular microbiologic techniques are sensitive and allow the identification of novel, uncultivated taxa; 2) microorganisms from the GI (not previously identified in the vagina) appear to gain access to the amniotic cavity; 3) the association between the molecular features of IAI and clinical outcome gives importance to these subclinical infections.","group":"g1","id":"267c107f-65d8-4e80-8b52-6b7ee9d83bb0","_showDetails":true},"7f8cb79a-70f2-4f2d-a277-375feab4f2cd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70077531","title":"Glutathione sulfonamide detects Hocl-mediated GSH oxidaton in tracheal aspirates from preterm infants and shows promise for detecting lung infection","authors":["Harwood T.","Darlow B.","Cheah F.-C.","McNeill N.","Winterbourn C."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["*lung infection","*prematurity","*tracheal aspiration procedure","*society","infection","aspiration","oxidation","assay","infant","pregnancy","organism","commensal","Staphylococcus epidermidis","receiver operating characteristic","sensitivity and specificity","bacterial growth","lung dysplasia","inflammation","injury","bacterium culture","lung aspiration","lung fluid","neutrophil","degranulation","chronic lung disease","*glutathione","*sulfonamide","*free radical","myeloperoxidase","biological marker","oxidizing agent"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"47","number":"SUPPL 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"T.

It is associated with inflammation and oxidative injury and there is increasing evidence that unresolved infection plays a role. However, infection is difficult to diagnose clinically and bacterial culture of lung aspirates does not distinguish organisms that colonize the lung fluid from those that give an infectious response. We argued that infectious organisms should stimulate a neutrophil response, with degranulation and generation of reactive oxidants including the myeloperoxidase (MPO) product, HOCl. Biomarkers of HOCl may therefore be good indices of infection. Chlorotyrosine (Cl-Tyr) is one specific biomarker of HOCl. Another promising new candidate is the GSH oxidation product, glutathione sulfonamide (GSA). Our aim was to determine whether GSA is detectable in tracheal aspirate samples from ventilated premature infants, whether GSA or Cl-Tyr correlate with the presence of culture positive organisms, and whether the assays could be useful for diagnosing infection. Aspirates (87 samples) from 40 intubated infants <32 weeks gestation were collected at the time of routine suctioning and analyzed for GSA by LC-MS/MS, for Cl-Tyr by GC/MS and for MPO activity. They were classified as culture positive if a sample collected within 24 hours gave at least moderate growth of a single or mixed organism(s). GSA was detected in 67/87 samples (median 0.8nM) and levels correlated with MPO activity and Cl-Tyr levels (rs =0.59, and 0.55 resp. p<0.001). Median levels of GSA (4-fold) and the other biomarkers (2-fold) were significantly higher in positive culture aspirates. Aspirates that were positive for the commensal organism S. epidermidis had GSA levels no different from negative cultures, with more pathogenic organisms giving 5-fold higher values. A ROC curve for GSA showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting bacterial growth and the results suggest that GSA analysis could be useful for diagnosing infection.","group":"g1","id":"7f8cb79a-70f2-4f2d-a277-375feab4f2cd","_showDetails":false},"9fc011bb-5410-4854-9259-825671a6d9e9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70077527","title":"Overexpression of thioredoxin interacting protein decreases hypoxia response element promoter activity in murine alveolar epithelial cells","authors":["Tipple T.E.","Rogers L.K.","Liu Y.","Nelin L.D.","Welty S.E."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["*lung alveolus epithelium","*promoter region","*hypoxia","*DNA responsive element","*society","lung","mouse","plasmid","epithelium cell","ambient air","cytosolic fraction","fluorescence","exposure","genetic transfection","human","infant","lung development","model","lung dysplasia","hypothesis","analysis of variance","*thioredoxin interacting protein","*free radical","luciferase","vasculotropin","plasmid DNA","Renilla luciferin 2 monooxygenase","DNA","lysergide","thioredoxin 1","hypoxia inducible factor","protein"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"47","number":"SUPPL 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"T.E.

We previously reported that lung thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) and VEGF protein levels are inversely correlated in a newborn mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The present studies tested the hypothesis that overexpression of Txnip would decrease HRE promoter activity in mouse lung epithelial cells. MLE-12 cells were co-transfected with a HRE-luciferase reporter and Txnip plasmid DNA (0, 0.5, 1 or 2 mug/well) and were cultured in 1% hypoxia (H) or room air (RA) for 24 h. Cytosolic fractions were prepared and HRE-luciferase activities (normalized to renilla-luciferase) were determined. Data, expressed in relative fluorescence units (mean +/- SEM), represent the results of two separate experiments and were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc (n=10). Our data indicated independent effects of Txnip plasmid concentration and exposure on HRE-luciferase reporter activity. As expected, HRE-luciferase activity was strongly induced by hypoxia [7.86+/-0.7 (RA) vs 0.99+/-0.02 (H), p<0.005]. A 47% decrease in HRE-luciferase activity (4.26+/-0.25, p<0.005) was detected in cells transfected with 2 mug Txnip plasmid and exposed to 1% O2. Furthermore, transfection with 2 mug Txnip decreased HRE-luciferase activity by 61% (0.39+/-0.01, p<0.005) in cells maintained in RA. Thus, our data are consistent with Txnip-dependent regulation of HRE promoter activity in murine alveolar epithelial cells. Studies designed to elucidate the direct mechanism by which Txnip regulates HIF-dependent VEGF production, including the role of thioredoxin-1, are currently ongoing. Changes in pulmonary Txnip expression could alter lung VEGF expression in prematurely born human infants contributing to the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"9fc011bb-5410-4854-9259-825671a6d9e9","_showDetails":false},"8e4e541b-06d7-4c38-9581-b16b7725c8e7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70072464","title":"Anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome","authors":["Koh Y.S."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["*adult respiratory distress syndrome","*patient","*therapy","lung","liquid","pneumonia","neutrophil","sepsis","survival","inflammation","mortality","oxygenation","low drug dose","antiinflammatory activity","pathogenesis","risk","acute lung injury","artificial ventilation","inflammatory cell","lung injury","prematurity","model","pharmacology","hypoxemia","lung edema","inhalation","adult","in vitro study","clinical trial","lung alveolus epithelium","capillary endothelium","tidal volume","laboratory","fibrin deposition","animal experiment","oxygen therapy","adhesion","endothelium cell","human","case study","mouse","physiology","permeability","quality of life","survivor","immune response","microorganism","infection","interpersonal communication","electron","brain injury","respiratory failure","lung dysplasia","intensive care","physician","pathology","victim","lung burn","regulatory mechanism","attenuation","safety","acid aspiration","rat","architecture","pathophysiology","permeability barrier","rigidity","bronchodilatation","blood vessel permeability","male","asthma","nebulization","lung function","injury","signal transduction","lung clearance","corticosteroid","cytokine","surfactant","nitric oxide","oxidizing agent","acetylcysteine","angiotensin II","glutathione","proteinase","protein","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein","leukocyte elastase","antiinflammatory agent","steroid","sivelestat","angiotensin converting enzyme 2","beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent","lipid","elastase inhibitor","receptor","rc 3095","chymosin","angiotensin","blocking agent","aldosterone","transcription factor","sodium channel","dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase","lung surfactant","thrombocyte activating factor","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent","lipopolysaccharide","hydrocortisone","surfactant protein A","synthetase","neuronal nitric oxide synthase","cell adhesion molecule","scavenger","free radical","adenosine triphosphatase","antioxidant","oleic acid","transforming growth factor beta","proteinase inhibitor","enzyme","albumin","salbutamol"],"journal":"Respirology","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"SUPPL. 3","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing","isbn":"1323-7799","address":"Y.S.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is considered as a severe form of ALI. In spite of the remarkable advance in the understanding of its pathogenesis, the only effective therapeutic measure to decrease the mortality up to date is low tidal volume mechanical ventilation, which was revealed its efficacy via the ARDS Clinical Trials Network study1. The mortality rate still remains more than 40% and survivors suffer significant decrements in their quality of life. However, there is no recommendable pharmacology therapy in ARDS until now. Why is a pharmacology therapy attractive in ARDS? Multiple pharmacologic treatments have been studied for ARDS, because ARDS is an acute lung inflammation, in which diverse inflammatory cells and mediators are involved. The mediators including proinflammatory cytokines, oxidants, lipid mediators, platelet activating factor, nitric oxide (NO), and proteolytic enzymes seem to be interrelated in the development of ARDS. Therefore, any agent showing potent anti-inflammatory activity to key inflammatory cells and mediators in the pathogenesis of ARDS could be a candidate for its treatment. It includes immune modulating molecules, suppressive or blocking agents against key inflammatory cytokines, and modulating agents against key proinflammatory or antiinflammatory transcription factors. Moreover, agents to increase alveolar fluid clearance through activation of sodium channels, to enhance repair of damaged alveolar epithelium and alveolar capillary endothelium, and to inhibit fibrin deposition in late ARDS could be candidates as the therapeutic agents. The clinical dilemma, we faced at now, is why the agent, which attenuates acute lung inflammation in experiments, did not be translated its efficacy on ARDS patients' outcomes. Experimentally or clinically tried antiinflammatory agents against ALI 1) Corticosteroids Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents to suppress almost of the known inflammatory mediator in laboratory and animal studies of ALI. Corticosteroids inhibit virtually all levels of the inflammatory pathways beginning from neutrophils' adhesion to pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. Although these steroid effects are attractive, corticosteroid has been considered to be of no benefit in humans' ARDS until 1990. However, antifibrotic action of steroids seems to accelerate resolution of fbroproliferation in the late phase of ARDS2, which is characterized by dysregulatory fbroproliferation leading to functional and structural abnormalities. Several reports and uncontrolled case series suggest that low dose corticosteroids (200 to 300 mg daily of hydrocortisone or equivalent) for prolonged period (about 1 month) may be useful in the management of late-phase ARDS. However, a large recent study has demonstrated that despite improvements of pulmonary physiology, corticosteroids do not change mortality of patients who continue to meet ARDS criteria 7 to 28 days after onset of ALI3. This ARDSnet study has been challenged by the too late use and premature discontinuation of corticosteroid. Therefore, it should be elucidated further for the efficacy of low dose of corticosteroids to alleviate inflammation, to reduce organ dysfunction, and to improve survival, especially in sepsis associated ARDS. 2) Surfactant The pulmonary surfactant consists of unique lipids and proteins that contribute to the biophysical and innate immune properties of the lung. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) and SP-D play a role in regulating the host response to invading microorganisms. SP-A and SP-D are primary proteins of surfactant immune function. Surfactant degradation or inactivation may enhance the susceptibility to lung inflammation and infection. However, there is no significant survival improvement of ARDS by using recombinant SP-C based surfactant or proteinfree synthetic surfactant. 3) Inhaled nitric oxide Nitric oxide (NO), which is a ubiquitous mediator of cell-cell and intracellular communication, is a gaseous molecule that contains an unpaired electron. Appropriate use of low-dose inhaled NO could reduce the overall risk of brain injury in premature newborns with respiratory failure or improve the pulmonary outcome for premature infants who are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia with no apparent short-term adverse effects4. NO inhalation is still used as a rescue therapy in adult ARDS patients, who show refractory hypoxemia with various therapeutic measures. Although the effect of NO to improve oxygenation for a brief period has been well known, its anti-inflammatory effect on ALI has not been well recognized to critical care physicians. NO is an important endogenous regulatory molecule implicated in both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes in the lung. Overproduction of endogenous NO by inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS), which is expressed in the lung during sepsis, contributes significantly to the vascular leak in the lung. Inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase-derived excessive nitric oxide also improved the pulmonary pathology in burn victims with smoke inhalation injury in animal model5. NO seems to modulate lung inflammation through its interaction with the transcriptional regulatory factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), which plays a central role in regulating the transcription of many inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and other mediators involved in ALI. We observed that inhaled NO attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in rabbits6. The effects seems to be partly dependent on the decrease in endogenous NO production and on the attenuation of LPS-induced the NF-kappaB activation7. However, inhaled NO did not show any mortality reduction in adult ARDS and has not been fully elucidated its safety of long time use. Clinicians should be alert to adjust daily NO inhaled dose and to use NO for brief period in ARDS, if tried. 4) N-acetylcysteine, beta 2 agonists, and elastase inhibitors N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an anti-oxidant and a free radical scavenger. NAC exerts a protective effect on the LPS-induced ALI in rats. The mechanisms of action may be mediated through the reduction of the production of NO, free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The administration of N-acetylcysteine, which aims to replete glutathione, significantly restored Na+ - K+ ATPase activity and total antioxidant capacity levels and ameliorated lung architecture in oleic acid-induced lung injury. TGF-beta, which is critical to the development of pulmonary oedema in ALI, depletes intracellular glutathione. In patients with an established ARDS, intravenous NAC treatment during 72 hours neither improved systemic oxygenation nor reduced the need for ventilatory support8. Neutrophil elastase as like of other neutrophils and their cytotoxic products, including oxidants and proteases, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ARDS. Neutrophil elastase is able to escape from regulation by multiple protease inhibitors at inflammatory sites. Once unregulated, this enzyme disturbs the function of the lung permeability barrier and induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Sivelestat sodium hydrate, elastase inhibitor, appears to reduce NE concentration and neutrophil stiffness and improve pulmonary oxygenation in patients with ALI. Sivelestat sodium hydrate apparently did not affect survival or the duration of mechanical ventilation of ARDS. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) seem to enhance fluid clearance from the alveolar space, and to induce anti-inflammatory actions and bronchodilation. Beta-2-agonists in therapeutic doses inhibited increased lung vascular permeability in man. Experimental data show that it reduces pulmonary neutrophil accumulation or activation and inflammation in ARDS. LABA therapy decreases BAL fluid albumin levels in patients with chronic asthma, suggesting a possible modulating effect on microvascular leakage9. Continuous nebulization of albuterol improves pulmonary function via improved airway clearance and decreased fluid flux in a combined burn/smoke inhalation injury model. 5) Signal transduction modulators The NF-kappa B pathway represents an attractive therapeutic target for strategies to control neutrophilic inflammation and lung injury. A selective GRP receptor antagonist, RC-3095, attenuates the release of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo and improves survival in \"established\" sepsis. 6) Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 The activation of the pulmonary rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone seems to influence the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS in mouse model, and the angiotensin converting enzyme I/D polymorphism is a significant prognostic factor for the outcome of ARDS10. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which inactivates angiotensin II, protected murine lungs from acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration or sepsis 11. ACE2 might have antifibrotic activity by reducing angiotensin II in ALI 12.","group":"g1","id":"8e4e541b-06d7-4c38-9581-b16b7725c8e7","_showDetails":true},"60c3783e-f166-46b9-81c5-b9345145ed60":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70056819","title":"MicroRNA expression profile in bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Bhaskaran M.","Wang Y.","Breshears M.A.","Liu L."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","pathogenesis","lung","model","prematurity","inflammation","dysplasia","infant","rat","pathology","lung development","chronic lung disease","etiology","hyperoxia","exposure","therapy","*microRNA","protein","oxygen","nucleotide","RNA"],"journal":"The FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"S1\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"0892-6638","address":"M.

BPD is characterized by a lack of alveolar development and concomitant decreased pulmonary vascular development. Pulmonary vascular development requires intact signaling from several genes including Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), and Extracellular Superoxide Dismutase (EC-SOD). Signaling from these genes can be affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We performed a case control study to determine whether SNPs in VEGF, eNOS, or EC-SOD are associated with the development of BPD. Method(s): We used previously collected DNA samples from the University of Iowa that were linked to clinical outcome data to perform a case control study. All infants included in the study were European American and born at <= 32 weeks EGA. Cases were defined as infants who either required supplemental oxygen for the first 28 days of life, or died at less than 28 days of age. Samples were genotyped for several SNPs in each gene. The SNPs which were analyzed were chosen by review of the literature and Hapmap data to ensure good coverage of each gene. Samples were genotyped using mass spectroscopy with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization with time of flight detection. We used a chi-square test of association to determine significance. We then used a family based association test analyzing the same index cases along with corresponding parental data to confirm the association. Result(s): We included 219 samples in the analysis, 128 cases and 91 controls. None of the SNPs in VEGF or EC-SOD were associated with BPD. Two of the SNPs in eNOS, rs2373961 (p=0.006) andrs3918188 (p=0.035) were associated with BPD when cases and controls were compared. These same SNPs were also significant when analyzed with the family based association test(rs2373961- p=0.031, and rs3918188- p=0.022). Conclusion(s): Our data support an association between SNPs in eNOS and the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"92e2e29b-3279-4cbe-bded-92f29c976360","_showDetails":true},"4467340e-1d73-4ae9-8084-f228e4fadd7b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70021752","title":"Proceedings of the 24th International Workshop on Surfactant Replacement","authors":["Anonymous.","Babnik J.","Curstedt T.","Halliday H.L.","Hallman M.","Saugstad O.D.","Speer C.P."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["*workshop","newborn","lung dysplasia","model","body composition","prematurity","parity","genetic regulation","human","fetus growth","lymphocyte subpopulation","hypoxia","hyperoxia","lung injury","mouse","electroencephalography","monitoring","hypoglycemia","lamb","small for date infant","phototherapy","heart rate variability","maternal smoking","sex difference","arm","anthropometry","female","*surfactant","surfactant protein B","scatter factor","glucose","insulin"],"journal":"Neonatology","language":"English","volume":"95","number":"4\nSP  -","publisher":"S.

Although supplemental oxygen therapy is clinically important, the level and duration of hyperoxic exposure that would allow lung cells to reenter the cell cycle remains unclear. We hypothesized that cells exposed to lower concentrations of hyperoxia will retain the capacity to enter cell cycle when recovered in room air.

Ureaplasma urealyticum was the most frequently obtained organism (16/68; 23%). Escherichia coli was isolated in specimens from one baby, and none of the samples was positive for listeria or chlamydia.

The loss of Thy-1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Type II pneumocytes require direct cell-cell contact with fibroblasts for triglyceride transport and dipalmotyl phosphatidyl choline (DPCC) production. It is possible that developmental regulation of Thy-1 and consequent alterations in fibroblast phenotype modulate fbroblast-Type II pneumocyte interaction. Hypothesis: Pulmonary fibroblast Thy-1 expression increases through development promoting a lipofibroblastic (LF) phenotype and enhancing endogenous surfactant production. Method(s): (1) Fibroblast Thy-1 expression at different developmental time points (e18.5, P1, P3, P5, P7, P14, P28, Adult) was assessed by flow cytometry. (2) To determine if Thy-1 expression promoted a LF phenotype, we used fetal rat lung fibroblasts (RFL-6) without endogenous Thy-1 expression transfected with either empty vector (EV) or an inducible CD90.2 vector [as cultured mouse lung fibroblasts become Thy-1 negative when passaged]. Cells were then assessed for fatty acid and triglyceride uptake in response to rosiglitazone (ROSI). (3) To evaluate surfactant production, EV and CD90.2 cells were either directly co-cultured or suspended in a collagen raft in the media of immortalized Type II alveolar cells (MLE-12). Surfactant protein B (SP-B) was measured in the media by Western Blots. Result(s): (1) Expression of CD90.2 increases through alveolarization in a bimodal fashion. (2) CD90.2 cells took up more fatty acid but not triglyceride than EV cells. ROSI enhanced fatty acid uptake in EV but not CD90.2 cells (Figure) and modestly enhanced triglyceride uptake in CD90.2 cells. (3) Fibroblast co-culture enhanced SP-B expression but no difference was seen between CD90.2 and EV. Conclusion(s): Pulmonary fibroblast Thy-1 expression increases throughout the period of alveolarization (up to school-age in humans) promoting a progressively more LF phenotype.

Bronchiolitis is a viral respiratory infection of the bronchioles most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus. It usually affects infants of less than 2 years, particularly following premature delivery, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease. Although generic questionnaires about the impact of a child's disease on family are available, no specifi c questionnaire linked to bronchiolitis hospitalization exists. METHOD(S): A multidisciplinary scientifi c committee was set up and included in the whole process of questionnaire development. A literature review, 3 clinician interviews and 18 exploratory interviews with parents of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis were conducted in parallel. The concepts identifi ed were organised into a model. Items were generated for each concept using parents' words. The Impact of Bronchiolitis Hospitalization Questionnaire (IBHQ?) was developed in French to be completed by the parent who was the most often present at the hospital, within the seven days after bronchiolitis hospitalization, and again three months after hospitalization. The IBHQ=was tested for relevance and comprehension with nine new parents, and revised accordingly. RESULT(S): Items generated for each concept identifi ed were organised into eight sections: parents' emotional impact, infant's reactions, parents' physical impact, impact on daily organization, siblings' reactions, parents' behaviour with infant and siblings, impact on couple, and fi nancial consequences. Except a few items that were modifi ed or deleted following parents' suggestions, most of the items were well understood, and considered relevant and adequate by parents during comprehension tests. The revised IBHQ=contains 65 items. CONCLUSION(S): The IBHQ=is a unique and promising tool that provides a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of a child's bronchiolitis hospitalization on parents. An observational study is currently under way to validate psychometric properties and scoring of the questionnaire.","group":"g1","id":"54d6d4f7-1382-4bca-9dcd-6817ba666be2","_showDetails":false},"89207a5d-3dda-4be0-8d69-1b2078835383":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70015955","title":"Economic evaluation alongside the caffeine for apnea of prematurity (CAP) trial: Short term outcomes","authors":["Dukhvony D.","Lorch S.A.","Schmidt B.","Doyle L.W.","Kok J.H.","Roberts R.S.","Kamholz K.","Wang N.","Zupancic J.A."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["*newborn apnea","*economic evaluation","infant","cost effectiveness analysis","therapy","clinical trial","birth weight","survivor","lung dysplasia","patient coding","insurance","hospital","parent","society","air conditioning","surgery","drug dose","data base","patient","population","bootstrapping","productivity","*caffeine","placebo","caffeine citrate"],"journal":"Value in Health","language":"English","volume":"12","number":"3","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc.","isbn":"1098-3015","address":"D.

METHOD(S): We undertook a retrospective economic evaluation of the cost per survivor without Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), using individual patient data from clinical trial. We included direct medical costs either to the insurance payer or the hospital but excluded costs to parents and society, such as lost productivity. We multiplied local resource utilization data from the clinical trial, including days of ventilation, type of surgery or drug dosage, by unit costs for each resource. Unit costs were derived from two separate databases of Canadian costs for similar patient populations. We used a price of $0.10 per mg of generic caffeine citrate for our base case analysis. All costs were expressed in 2008 Canadian dollars. The time horizon for this analysis extended to fi rst discharge home. RESULT(S): The mean cost per infant was $117,577 in the caffeine group and $126,078 in the placebo group (difference of $8,501, p =0.0025). Cost-effectiveness analysis showed caffeine to be a dominant therapy: in 100% of 1000 bootstrap replications of the analysis, caffeine-treated infants had simultaneously better outcomes and lower mean costs. These results were robust to a ten-fold increase in the cost of caffeine. CONCLUSION(S): In comparison to placebo, caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity in infants less than 1250 grams is economically appealing.

BPD is characterized by disrupted alveolar development, which results, at least in part, from alveolar epithelial cell death. The potential for stem cell-based therapy aimed at restoring the alveolar epithelium in newborn lungs is therefore very attractive. The role of marrow-derived cell therapy in neonatal lung injury is largely unknown. Our aim was to study the fate and effects of adult bone marrow-derived cells in a murine model of neonatal lung injury. Design(s): Wild-type mice placed in a normoxic or hyperoxic (95% O2) environment received bone marrow cells from animals expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) at postnatal day 5 (P5) via intranasal approach. Controls received vehicle buffer. Lungs were analyzed between posttransplantation (TPX) day 2 and week 8. Population kinetics of donor cells were monitored by GFP-immunostaining combined with stereological volumetry. The phenotype of marrow-derived cells was studied by cell-specific double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The functional effects on lung growth and alveolarization were studied by histomorphometry and proliferation studies. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA. Result(s): The volume of GFP-immunoreactive donor cells rconstant between post-TPX weeks 1 and 8 and was similar in normoxic and hyperoxia-exposed recipients. Virtually all marrow-derived cells showed colocalization of GFP and the pan-macrophage marker, F4/80. Epithelial transdifferentiation was not seen. Marrow cell administration had adverse effects on somatic growth and alveolarization in normoxic mice, while no effects were noted in hyperoxic recipients. Reexposure of marrow-treated animals to hyperoxia at P66 resulted in marked expansion of the donor-derived macrophage population. Conclusion(s): Intranasal administration of unfractionated bone marrow cells to newborn mice does not achieve epithelial reconstitution but establishes persistent alveolar macrophage chimerism. The predominantly adverse effects of marrow treatment in newborn lungs are likely due to macrophage-associated paracrine effects. While this model and route of cell therapy may not achieve epithelial reconstitution, the role of selected stem cell populations and/or alternate routes of administration for cell-based therapy in injured newborn lungs deserve further investigation.","group":"g1","id":"67c5f8e3-c5e7-492a-a713-1dc33b55a7b7","_showDetails":false},"38198e74-d898-49d6-a7ee-39fec8a92b6c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"354603523","title":"IL-1 mediates pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses to chorioamnionitis induced by lipopolysaccharide","authors":["Kallapur S.G.","Nitsos I.","Moss T.J.M.","Polglase G.R.","Pillow J.J.","Cheah F.-C.","Kramer B.W.","Newnham J.P.","Ikegami M.","Jobe A.H."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["airway","animal cell","animal model","article","*chorioamnionitis","concentration (parameters)","controlled study","drug inhibition","female","fetus","fetus lung","fetus lung maturation","injection","lamb","liver","monocyte","neutrophil","neutrophilia","nonhuman","pathogenesis","*pneumonia","pregnancy","priority journal","protein blood level","protein expression","sheep","*systemic inflammatory response syndrome","amyloid A protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","carbonyl derivative/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide","inducible nitric oxide synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*interleukin 1","*interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent/ad [Drug Administration]","*interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","*interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent/pd [Pharmacology]","interleukin 1beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","myeloperoxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","recombinant interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent","unclassified drug","amyloid A3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"179","number":"10","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1535-4970","address":"S.

Method(s): After confirming the efficacy of recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1ra), fetal sheep were exposed to intra-amniotic (IA) injections of Escherichia coli LPS with or without prior IA injections of rhIL-1ra. Preterm lambs were delivered at 82% of term gestation. Measurements and Main Results: rhIL-1ra decreased IA LPS-induced lung inflammation assessed by decreased lung neutrophil and monocyte influx, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, lung IL-6 and IL-1beta mRNA expression, and airway myeloperoxidase concentrations. rhIL-1ra inhibited IA LPS-induced fetal systemic inflammation assessed by decreased plasma IL-8, protein carbonyls, blood neutrophilia, and the expression of serum amyloid A3 mRNA in the liver. rhIL-1ra also partially blocked the lung maturational effects of IA LPS. Therefore blockade of IL-1 signaling in the amniotic compartment inhibited fetal lung and systemic inflammation and lung maturation in response to LPS-induced chorioamnionitis.

We tested the hypothesis that IL-8 signaling mediates IA LPS-induced lung inflammation and lung maturation. Two strategies were used: 1) we tested if IA injection of recombinant sheep IL-8 (rsIL-8) induced fetal inflammation and 2) if IL-8 signaling was blocked by a novel CXCR2 receptor blocker, nicotinanilide thioglycolate methyl ester (NTME). To test effects of IL-8 in the fetus, rsIL-8 was given intravascularly (50 mug) at 124 +/- 1 day of gestation (term = 150 days). A separate group of sheep was given IA rsIL-8 (100 mug) and delivered 5 h to 7 days later at 124 +/- 1 day of gestation. After confirming efficacy of the CXCR2 inhibitor, effects of IL-8 blockade were tested by injecting fetal sheep intramuscularly with NTME (10 mg) before IA injection of Escherichia coli LPS (10 mg). Sheep fetuses were delivered 1 or 7 days after injections at 124 +/- 1 day of gestation. IA rsIL-8 induced a modest fivefold increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) monocytes and neutrophils and increased lung monocyte hydrogen peroxide generation. However, rsIL-8 did not induce lung maturation. Intravascular rsIL-8 did not change fetal cardiovascular variables, blood pH, or blood leukocyte counts. Inhibition of CXCR2 decreased IA LPS-induced increases in BAL proteins at 1 day but not at 7 days. NTME did not significantly decrease IA LPS-induced BAL leukocyte influx and lung cytokine mRNA expression. Inhibition of CXCR2 did not change IA LPS-induced lung maturation. IL-8 signaling does not mediate LPS-induced lung inflammation and lung maturation.

To date, no such protective effect has been demonstrated for the chronic neonatal lung injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The objective of our study was to determine whether evolving chronic neonatal lung injury, using a rat model, is resistant to the beneficial effects of hypercapnia or simply requires a less conservative approach to hypercapnia than that applied clinically to date. Neonatal rats inhaled air or 60% O2 for 14 days with or without 5.5% CO2. Lung parenchymal neutrophil and macrophage numbers were significantly increased by hyperoxia alone, which was associated with interstitial thickening and reduced secondary crest formation. The phagocyte influx, interstitial thickening, and impaired alveolar formation were significantly attenuated by concurrent hypercapnia. Hyperoxic pups that received 5.5% CO2 had a significant increase in alveolar number relative to airexposed pups. Increased tyrosine nitration, a footprint for peroxynitrite-mediated reactions, arteriolar medial wall thickening, and both reduced small peripheral pulmonary vessel number and VEGF and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) expression, which were observed with hyperoxia, was attenuated by concurrent hypercapnia. We conclude that evolving chronic neonatal lung injury in a rat model is responsive to the beneficial effects of hypercapnia. Inhaled 5.5% CO2 provided a significant degree of protection against parenchymal and vascular injury in an animal model of chronic neonatal lung injury likely due, at least in part, to its inhibition of a phagocyte influx.

IL-6 was similarly expressed in all tissues of infants with and without BPD. In contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was less prominent in the placenta of patients with BPD compared with those without BPD. IL-10 expression in the villous trophoblast layer was associated with a reduced odds ratio of developing BPD (adjusted OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.70, p = 0.02).

Forty-four amniotic fluid samples were obtained at delivery of preterm infants (median gestation, 28 weeks; birth weight, 908 g).

Both TGF-beta1 and IL-6 concentrations in the amniotic fluid increased with increasing histological severity of CAM (each p < 0.0001). The presence of both BPD and histological CAM was associated with significantly higher amniotic fluid TGF-beta1 and IL-6 concentrations than the presence of BPD without histological CAM, or the absence of both (each p < 0.0001). Both concentrations also correlated with the duration of oxygen administration in the neonates (each p < 0.0001).

We hypothesize that the reduced PICD in neonatal monocytes is regulated through the proteins of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein family., METHODS: mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 family proteins in cord blood and adult peripheral blood monocytes infected with Escherichia coli were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry and cytochrome c release by fluorescence microscopy., RESULTS: mRNA expression of antiapopototic Bcl-xL was upregulated in cord blood monocytes (CBMO), whereas proapoptotic Bim tended to be higher in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMO). Upon infection, Bax was more strongly expressed in PBMO compared with CBMO. The pro/antiapoptotic balance was skewed toward survival in CBMO and apoptosis in PBMO. Cytochome c release into the cytosol was enhanced in PBMO compared with CBMO., CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 proteins are involved in reduced PICD in neonatal monocytes. These findings are another step toward the understanding of sustained inflammation in neonates.","group":"g1","id":"b12cf0aa-06b9-4182-b4fd-8762ff941da4","_showDetails":true},"053f20d6-62a6-4d00-928c-6f798ebf51c8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"352813685","title":"Association of polymorphisms in the human surfactant protein-D (SFTPD) gene and postnatal pulmonary adaptation in the preterm infant","authors":["Hilgendorff A.","Heidinger K.","Bohnert A.","Kleinsteiber A.","Konig I.R.","Ziegler A.","Lindner U.","Frey G.","Merz C.","Lettgen B.","Chakraborty T.","Gortner L.","Bein G."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["allele","article","controlled study","female","genetic association","genetic variability","genotype","gestational age","human","infant","lung dysplasia","lung infection","major clinical study","male","morbidity","newborn","pneumothorax","prematurity","prevalence","priority journal","*respiratory distress syndrome/et [Etiology]","*single nucleotide polymorphism","diuretic agent","*surfactant protein D/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics","language":"English","volume":"98","number":"1","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd (9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2XG, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1651-2227","address":"A.

Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is a member of the collagenous subfamily of calcium-dependent lectins (collectins). Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human gene coding surfactant protein-D (SFTPD) and infectious pulmonary diseases have been established by several groups. As the outcome of very preterm infants is mainly determined by pulmonary morbidity, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential association between sequence variations within the SFTPD gene and pulmonary morbidity in preterm infants below 32 weeks of gestational age (GA). Materials and Results. Four validated SNPs were genotyped with sequence-specific probes (TaqMan 7000) in 284 newborn infants below 32 weeks of GA. An association between the SNP rs1923537 and the development of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the study population was found with a lower prevalence of RDS in infants having homozygous a minor allele genotype (odds ratio = 1.733, 95% confidence interval 1.139-2.636, adjusted p = 0.0408). Consecutively, the indicated polymorphism was found to be associated with a lower number of repetitive surfactant doses, and with a lower prevalence for the requirement of oxygen supplementation on day 28, as well as the use of diuretics. Conclusion. The finding of an association of a variant of the SFTPD gene, that has previously been shown to be associated with increased SP-D serum levels in adult patients with acute respiratory failure, i.e. RDS in preterm infants, may provide a basis for the initial risk assessment of RDS and modification of surfactant treatment strategies. A role for SP-D in neonatal pulmonary adaptation has to be postulated. © 2008 The Author(s).","group":"g1","id":"053f20d6-62a6-4d00-928c-6f798ebf51c8","_showDetails":true},"bac38224-50e0-4d56-96c7-3889a13b1657":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"50391268","title":"RSV prophylaxis with Palivizumab in high-risk children.

The need for such prophylaxis is established on the basis that RSV is the most common cause of lower airway complications in the first two years of life. However, preventive administration of Palivizumab to all children for whom there is an indication according to licensure entails significant costs. Based on new clinical and epidemiological data, the German guidelines on RSV prophylaxis of 2006 have been updated. According to the new guidelines, high-risk children e. g. children with chronic lung diseases, requiring oxygen therapy, should receive - and medium-risk children e. g. preterm infants born at <=28 weeks of gestational age or presenting additional risk factors can receive - prophylaxis. Decisions to use the prophylaxis will be made on the basis of establishing the risk of complicated RSV infection in individual patients. Furthermore it is stressed that high-risk children should be breast-fed, kept away from cigarette smoke, large groups of people and nursery schools, and should receive the generally recommended active immunizations, including vaccination against influenza, as soon as possible. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.","group":"g1","id":"bac38224-50e0-4d56-96c7-3889a13b1657","_showDetails":false},"868d0773-9209-413b-a6da-f9e382d2e2c8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"50293863","title":"Prenatal inflammation and lung development","authors":["Kramer B.W.","Kallapur S.","Newnham J.","Jobe A.H."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["amnion fluid","article","artificial ventilation","*chorioamnionitis/et [Etiology]","clinical feature","disease association","disease model","down regulation","explant","fetus","fetus lung","fetus lung maturation","gestational age","human","innate immunity","*lung development","*lung dysplasia/cn [Congenital Disorder]","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","lung injury/et [Etiology]","Mycoplasma","*neonatal respiratory distress syndrome","nonhuman","postnatal development","premature labor","prenatal exposure","sheep","upregulation","Ureaplasma","very low birth weight","CD31 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","endotoxin","gamma interferon/ec [Endogenous Compound]","lung surfactant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","surfactant protein A/ec [Endogenous Compound]","surfactant protein B/ec [Endogenous Compound]","surfactant protein C/ec [Endogenous Compound]","tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"1","publisher":"W.B.

Chorioamnionitis is inconsistently associated with changed risks of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), probably because the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis does not quantify the extent or duration of the fetal exposures to infection and inflammation. The correlations between prenatal exposures and postnatal lung disease also are confounded by the imprecision of the diagnoses of RDS and BPD. In animal models, chorioamnionitis caused by pro-inflammatory mediators or live ureaplasma induces lung maturation, but also causes alveolar simplification and vascular injury. Intra-amniotic endotoxin administration also modulates the fetal innate immune system, resulting in maturation of monocytes to alveolar macrophages and the induction or paralysis of inflammatory responses depending on exposure history.

To understand how neonatal hyperoxia can permanently disrupt lung development, we previously reported increased lung compliance, greater alveolar simplification, and disrupted epithelial development in adult mice exposed to 100% inspired oxygen fraction between postnatal days 1 and 4. Here, we investigate whether oxygen-induced changes in lung function are attributable to defects in surfactant composition and activity, structural changes in alveolar development, or both. Newborn mice were exposed to room air or 40%, 60%, 80%, or 100% oxygen between postnatal days 1 and 4 and allowed to recover in room air until 8 wk of age. Lung compliance and alveolar size increased, and airway resistance, airway elastance, tissue elastance, and tissue damping decreased, in mice exposed to 60-80% oxygen; changes were even greater in mice exposed to 100% oxygen. These alterations in lung function were not associated with changes in total protein content or surfactant phospholipid composition in bronchoalveolar lavage. Moreover, surface activity and total and hydrophobic protein content were unchanged in large surfactant aggregates centrifuged from bronchoalveolar lavage compared with control. Instead, the number of type II cells progressively declined in 60-100% oxygen, whereas levels of T1alpha, a protein expressed by type I cells, were comparably increased in mice exposed to 40-100% oxygen. Thickened bundles of elastin fibers were also detected in alveolar walls of mice exposed to >=60% oxygen. These findings support the hypothesis that changes in lung development, rather than surfactant activity, are the primary causes of oxygen-altered lung function in children who were exposed to oxygen as neonates. Furthermore, the disruptive effects of oxygen on epithelial development and lung mechanics are not equivalently dose dependent.

METHOD(S): Randomized assignment to receive 30% (N = 37) or 90% (N = 41) oxygen was performed. Targeted oxygen saturation values were 75% at 5 minutes and 85% at 10 minutes. Blood oxidized glutathione (GSSG)/reduced glutathione ratio and urinary o-tyrosine, 8-oxo-dihydroxyguanosine, and isoprostane levels, isofuran elimination, and plasma interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were determined. RESULT(S): The low-oxygen group needed fewer days of oxygen supplementation (6 vs 22 days; P < .01) and fewer days of mechanical ventilation (13 vs 27 days; P < .01) and had a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at discharge (15.4% vs 31.7%; P < .05). GSSG/ reduced glutathione x 100 ratios at day 1 and 3 were significantly higher in the high-oxygen group (day 1: high-oxygen group: 13.36 +/- 5.25; low-oxygen group: 8.46 +/- 3.87; P < .01; day 3: high-oxygen group: 8.87 +/- 4.40; low-oxygen group: 6.97 +/- 3.11; P < .05). Urinary markers of oxidative stress were increased significantly in the high-oxygen group, compared with the low-oxygen group, in the first week after birth. GSSG levels on day 3 and urinary isofuran, o-tyrosine, and 8-hydroxy-2'- deoxyguanosine levels on day 7 were correlated significantly with development of chronic lung disease. CONCLUSION(S): Resuscitation of preterm neonates with 30% oxygen causes less oxidative stress, inflammation, need for oxygen, and risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Since its original description in the late '60s, poor outcome in BPD has been strongly associated with late pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite progressive improvements in the care of preterm infants, PH still remains a significant cause of late morbidity and mortality in premature infants. More recently, experimental and clinical studies have shown that lung vascular growth is abnormal in infants with BPD, which may contribute to abnormalities of lung airspace structure, alters gas exchange with respiratory infections and exercise, and further increases the risk for developing PH. Current data are limited with regards to many fundamental aspects of pulmonary vascular disease and PH in infants with BPD, including: basic mechanisms that alter lung vascular growth and development after premature birth and may contribute to the pathogenesis of PH; the prevalence and natural history of PH in infants with BPD; approaches to screen and diagnose PH in this group; and effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of PH in infants with BPD.

The role of Ang signaling in pulmonary hypertension is well investigated, but its role in lung development is not elucidated. Here, we show that the Tie2 agonist ligand, Ang1, was detected in lung tissue at birth and its expression gradually increased in mice, whereas its antagonist Ang2 was abundant at birth and decreased inversely with Ang1. Mice expressing the potent chimeric Ang1 protein COMP-Ang1 in surfactant protein C (SPC)-positive lung epithelial cells, showed 50% lethality at birth due to respiratory failure. Surviving mice displayed impaired adaptive responsive respiratory function. Histological analysis revealed that pulmonary artery and alveolar structure were significantly dilated, and alveolar density was decreased to approximately a third of controls. Thus, the precise regulation of Tie2 signaling through an Ang1/Ang2 expression switch is important to construct a mature lung vascular network system required for normal lung development. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the contribution of leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species, we exposed newborn wild-type and NADPH oxidase p47phox subunit null (p47phox-/-) mice to air or acute hyperoxia (95% O 2) for up to 11 days. Hyperoxia-induced pulmonary neutrophil influx was similar in wild-type and p47-/- mice at post-natal days (P) 7 and 11. Macrophages were decreased in wild-type hyperoxia-exposed mice compared with p47phox-/- mice at P11. Hyperoxia impaired type II alveolar epithelial cell and bronchiolar epithelial cell proliferation, but depression of type II cell proliferation was significantly less in p47-/- mice at P3 and P7, when inflammation was minimal. We found reciprocal results for the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip/waf in type II cells, which was induced in 95% O2-exposed wild-type mice, but significantly less in p47phox-/- littermates at P7. Despite partial preservation of type II cell proliferation, deletion of p47phox did not prevent the major adverse effects of hyperoxia on alveolar development estimated by morphometry at P11, but hyperoxia impairment of elastin deposition at alveolar septal crests was significantly worse in wild-type vs. p47phox-/- mice at P11. Since we found that p47phox is expressed in a subset of alveolar epithelial cells, its deletion may protect postnatal type II alveolar epithelial proliferation from hyperoxia through effects on epithelial as well as phagocyte-generated superoxide.

Tolerating a higher level of arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is considered as 'permissive hypercapnia' and when combined with the use of low tidal volumes may reduce volutrauma and lead to improved pulmonary outcomes. Permissive hypercapnia may also protect against hypocapnia-induced brain hypoperfusion and subsequent periventricular leukomalacia. However, extreme hypercapnia may be associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. It may therefore be important to avoid large fluctuations in PaCO2 values. Recent randomized clinical trials in preterm infants have demonstrated that mild permissive hypercapnia is safe, but clinical benefits are modest.

Developmental dysregulation of these contractile cells contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns, and aberrant recapitulation in adults of the normal ontogeny of these cells has been speculated to underlie disease and repair in mature lungs. The significance of airway smooth muscle has been widely investigated, but contractile elements within the pulmonary parenchyma, although also of structural and functional consequence in developing and mature lungs, are relatively unstudied and little quantitative information exists. Here, we quantify the areal density of alpha-SMA expression in lung parenchyma and assess changes in its spatiotemporal distribution through postnatal ontogeny. Using an antibody against alpha-SMA, we immunofluorescently labeled contractile elements in lung sections from a postnatal growth series of rats. Images were segmented using thresholded pixel intensity. Alpha-SMA areal density in the alveolar interstitium was calculated by dividing the area of alpha-SMA-positive staining by the tissue area. The areal density of alpha-SMA in 2-day neonates was 3.7%, almost doubled, to 7.2% by 21 days, and decreased to 3% in adults. Neonates had large, elongate concentrations of alpha-SMA, and alpha-SMA localized both at septal tips and within the interstitium. In adults, individual areas of alpha-SMA expression were smaller and more round, and located predominately in alveolar ducts, at alveolar ends and bends. The results are consistent with increasing alpha-SMA expression during the period of peak myofibroblast activity, corresponding to the phase of rapid alveolarization in the developing lung. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","group":"g1","id":"82c90cbc-7bc3-46f8-a413-3f268d1b827b","_showDetails":true},"3c97a803-8513-46e1-9959-f49e75afa047":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"351131107","title":"Erythropoietin attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury by down-modulating inflammation in neonatal rats","authors":["Jang H.L.","Dong K.S.","Soo H.K.","Bong K.S.","Young S.H.","Chang S.S.","Joo W.L.","Yun S.C.","Won S.P."],"date":"2007//","keywords":["animal","article","*cell protection","disease model","drug effect","female","genetics","*hyperoxia","*inflammation/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung","metabolism","newborn","pathology","rat","Sprague Dawley rat","survival rate","peroxidase","*recombinant erythropoietin/dt [Drug Therapy]","tumor necrosis factor alpha"],"journal":"Journal of Korean Medical Science","language":"English","volume":"22","number":"6","publisher":"Korean Academy of Medical Science (302-75 Dong bu Ichon-dong, Yongsan-ku, Seoul 140-031, South Korea)","isbn":"1598-6357","address":"S.P.

Using newborn mice, in which alveolarization occurs postnatally, we designed studies to determine how MV with either 40% O2 or air might lead to dysregulated elastin production and impaired lung septation. MV of newborn mice for 8 h with either 40% O2 or air increased lung mRNA for tropoelastin and lysyl oxidase, relative to unventilated controls, with-out increasing lung expression of genes that regulate elastic fiber assembly (lysyl oxidase-like-1, fibrillin-1, fibrillin-2, fibulin-5, emilin-1). Serine elastase activity in lung increased fourfold after MV with 40% O2, but not with air. We then extended MV with 40% O2 to 24 h and found that lung content of tropoelastin protein doubled, whereas lung content of elastin assembly proteins did not change (lysyl oxidases, fibrillins) or decreased (fibulin-5, emilin-1). Quantitative image analysis of lung sections showed that elastic fiber density increased by 50% after MV for 24 h, with elastin distributed throughout the walls of air spaces, rather than at septal tips, as in control lungs. Dysregulation of elastin was associated with a threefold increase in lung cell apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase-3 assays), which might account for the increased air space size previously reported in this model. Our findings of increased elastin synthesis, coupled with increased elastase activity and reduced lung abundance of proteins that regulate elastic fiber assembly, could explain altered lung elastin deposition, increased apoptosis, and defective septation, as observed in CLD.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A3 (ABCA3) gene mutations cause fatal respiratory failure in term infants, but common ABCA3 polymorphisms have remained uncharacterized at the population level. Aim. To define a subset of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) which capture most of the variation within the ABCA3 gene, and to assess ABCA3 as a novel candidate gene for susceptibility to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. Methods. Based on an initial screen, nine tSNPs were selected. These 9 tSNPs and a length variation, representing >90% of haplotypic variation of the gene, and 5 nonsynonymous coding SNPs were genotyped in 267 preterm infants. SNP rs13332514 was genotyped in an additional 48 infants. Results. The fourth common haplotype was overrepresented in very premature infants with RDS, being accounted for by SNP rs13332514 (F353F), with an increased minor allele frequency in RDS. Furthermore, rs13332514 associated significantly with chronic lung disease defined as a requirement for supplemental O2 at 28 postnatal days in very premature infants. Conclusions.

The experiment was carried out with 47 newborn rat pups divided into six groups during postnatal days 3 to 13. The rats belonging to group 1 were designated as the control group and kept in room air without exposure to hyperoxia. Group 2 (clarithromycin), group 3 (montelukast), group 4 (pentoxifylline), group 5 (clarithromycin + montelukast + pentoxifylline combination), and group 6 (placebo) were kept in plexiglass chamber and exposed to hyperoxia (88-92%) throughout the experiment. Alveolar surface area percentage, fibrosis, and smooth muscle actin expression were assessed in the lungs, which were resected by thoracotomy on postnatal day 14. Results. Drug treatments, when used separately, were not detected to be superior to placebo with regard to mean alveolar surface area, fibrosis, and smooth muscle actin expression. Combination treatment resulted in significantly higher mean lung area percentages and lower actin scores with respect to the placebo treatment group (64.0% vs. 50.2%, p=0.002; 0 (0-1) vs. 7 (2-12), p=0.005, respectively).

Study Design: 351 mother/infant dyads with deliveries between 23 and 32 weeks' gestational age who had cord blood cultures for U urealyticum and M hominis had their medical records abstracted, other placental cultures performed, cord interleukin-6 levels determined, placentas evaluated histologically, and infant outcomes determined. Result(s): U urealyticum and/or M hominis were present in 23% of cord blood cultures. Positive cultures were more common in infants of nonwhite women (27.9% vs 16.8%; P = .016), in women less than 20 years of age, in those undergoing a spontaneous compared to an indicated preterm delivery (34.7% vs 3.2%; P = .0001), and in those delivering at earlier gestational ages. Intrauterine infection and inflammation were more common among infants with a positive U urealyticum and M hominis culture as evidenced by placental cultures for these and other bacteria, elevated cord blood interleukin-6 levels, and placental histology. Infants with positive cord blood U urealyticum and M hominis cultures were more likely to have neonatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome (41.3% vs 25.7%; P = .007; adjusted odds ratio, 1.86; 1.08-3.21) and probably bronchopulmonary dysplasia (26.8% vs 10.1%; P = .0001; adjusted odds ratio 1.99; 0.91-4.37), but were not significantly different for other neonatal outcomes, including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, or death.

We speculated that funisitis, reflecting fetal systemic inflammation, would be associated with higher concentrations of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in airways of extremely premature infants. Study Design: We measured macrophage migration inhibitory factor by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in tracheobronchial aspirate fluid of 35 ventilated infants less than 30 weeks' gestational age, throughout the first week of life. Three groups were distinguished histologically: chorioamnionitis, funisitis, and control. Result(s): Unexpectedly, funisitis was associated with significantly decreased macrophage migration inhibitory factor in tracheobronchial aspirate fluid on day 1 (P < .01) and levels remained lower than in the chorioamnionitis group thereafter. For the 35 patients in total, macrophage migration inhibitory factor steadily declined. Conclusion(s): Decreased macrophage migration inhibitory factor concentrations in airways of extremely premature infants with systemic fetal inflammation early in life might predispose them to pulmonary infection and interfere with maturation of the lung, contributing to adverse pulmonary outcome. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

RSV is estimated to cause up to 90% of all childhood bronchiolitis and up to 40% of all childhood pneumonias, often requiring hospitalization. Approximately 40% of those hospitalized with RSV have an underlying condition such as prematurity or lung or heart disease. Evidence from epidemiological data demonstrates a link between early RSV infection and chronic respiratory morbidity persisting into adolescence and young adulthood, especially for preterm infants. Local Saudi data have shown that RSV is the most common respiratory virus in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for respiratory illness. Palivizumab (Synagis; Abbott/Medlmmune), a humanized monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, has been approved as a prophylaxis for RSV and has been shown to reduce hospitalizations for RSV and the incidence of longer-term sequelae. The guidelines suggested here seek to balance the risk of RSV infection with currently available resources, and are a modification of the 1998 American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines. They offer evidence-based and cost-effective recommendations to assist neonatologists, pulmonologists and paediatricians to use palivizumab (Synagis) as an immuno-prophylaxis for RSV infection in selected high-risk infants and children. These infants include those born at 28 weeks' gestation or less without evidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), if less than 2 years' corrected age at the RSV season; infants discharged home on oxygen for BPD regardless of gestational age, if less than 2 years' corrected age at the RSV season; and infants born at 29 to 32 weeks of gestation if diagnosed with BPD but not discharged home on oxygen, and less than 1 year of corrected age at the onset of the RSV season. Specific recommendations are also made for vaccination with palivizumab (Synagis) for infants and children with congenital heart disease who meet certain criteria for age and severity, including those who with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, those under medication for cardiomyopathy and those who are to undergo cardiac catheterization at the onset of the RSV season. Certain categories should receive continuing RSV prophylaxis from 1 to 2 years of age. In children with heart disease who are not generally considered to be in at-risk groups, the paediatric cardiologist should individually assess the appropriateness of RSV prophylaxis for certain categories, including children with haemodynamically insignificant heart disease, corrected congenital heart disease, or mild cardiomyopathies not requiring medication. The Saudi Task Force Committee for RSV Prophylaxis recommends these guidelines as a broad guide to the introduction and use of prophylactic agents against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), subject to future change as necessary.","group":"g1","id":"f87e178b-11dc-48c8-9260-842306c98cd5","_showDetails":true},"4387c9a0-0826-47b7-80aa-01fc2e622d9e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"351217643","title":"Angiopoietin 2 concentrations in infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia: Attenuation by dexamethasone","authors":["Aghai Z.H.","Faqiri S.","Saslow J.G.","Nakhla T.","Farhath S.","Kumar A.","Eydelman R.","Strande L.","Stahl G.","Leone P.","Bhandari V."],"date":"2008//","keywords":["article","aspiration","assisted ventilation","birth weight","controlled study","female","gestational age","human","infant","*lung dysplasia/co [Complication]","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*lung dysplasia/pc [Prevention]","major clinical study","male","mortality","newborn morbidity","oxygen therapy","prematurity","protein determination","*angiopoietin 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","oxygen"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatology","language":"English","volume":"28","number":"2","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group (Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1476-5543","address":"V.

Nesfatin-1 is a brain-gut peptide with inhibitory effects on food intake, which is recently evidenced to show suppressive effect on oxidative stress. The present study aims to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Nesfatin-1 in BPD mice. AECIIs were extracted from newborn rats and exposed to hyperoxia for 24 h, followed by treatment with 5 and 10 nM Nesfatin-1. Declined cell viability, increased apoptotic rate, upregulated Bax, downregulated Bcl-2, increased release of ROS and MDA, and suppressed SOD activity were observed in hyperoxia-treated AECIIs, which were extremely reversed by Nesfatin-1. Newborn rats were exposed to hyperoxia, followed by treated with 10 mug/kg Nesfatin-1 and 20 mug/kg Nesfatin-1. Severe pathological changes, elevated MDA level, and declined SOD activity were observed in lung tissues of BPD mice, which were rescued by Nesfatin-1. Furthermore, the protective effect of Nesfatin-1 on hyperoxia-challenged AECIIs was abolished by silencing SIRT1. Collectively, Nesfatin-1 alleviated hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn mice by inhibiting oxidative stress through regulating SIRT1/PGC-1alpha pathway. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Recurrent episodes of hypoxemia and associated ventilator adjustments often lead to worsening CLD. The mechanism that causes these hypoxemic episodes is unknown. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), which is partially controlled by O2-sensitive voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, is an important adaptive response to local hypoxia that helps to match perfusion and ventilation in the lung. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that chronic lung injury (CLI) impairs HPV. Method(s): We studied preterm lambs that had MV with O2-rich gas for 3 weeks and newborn rats that breathed 95%-O2 for 2 weeks, both of which resulted in airspace enlargement and pulmonary vascular changes consistent with CLD. Measurements and Main Results:HPV was attenuated in preterm lambs with CLI after 2 weeks of MV and in newborn rats with CLI after 2 weeks of hyperoxia. HPV and constriction to the Kv1.x-specific inhibitor, correolide, were preferentially blunted in excised distal pulmonary arteries (dPAs) from hyperoxic rats, whose dPAs exhibited decreased Kv1.5 and K v2.1 mRNA and K+ current. Intrapulmonary gene transfer of Kv1.5, encoding the ion channel that is thought to trigger HPV, increased O2-sensitive K+ current in cultured smooth muscle cells from rat dPAs, and restored HPV in hyperoxic rats. Conclusion(s): Reduced expression/activity of O2-sensitive Kv channels in dPAs contributes to blunted HPV observed in neonatal CLD.","group":"g1","id":"2f52447d-ed9f-4350-bca8-e7531bbdac04","_showDetails":true},"ee3bacf8-bebd-4c0a-8a2f-2e5ed3d71f69":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"352803680","title":"The Fas system confers protection against alveolar disruption in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice","authors":["Mao Q.","Gundavarapu S.","Patel C.","Tsai A.","Luks F.I.","De Paepe M.E."],"date":"2008//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","antigen expression","apoptosis","article","birth","comparative study","controlled study","growth","*hyperoxia","lung","*lung alveolus","*lung disease","mouse","mouse strain","newborn","nonhuman","perinatal period","protection","protein family","stereology","upregulation","volumetry","wild type","*Fas antigen","*Fas ligand","Ki 67 antigen","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","mitogen activated protein kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","mitogen activated protein kinase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","oxygen","protein BAD","protein Bak","protein Bax","protein bcl 2","protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*alveolar disruption"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","language":"English","volume":"39","number":"6","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1044-1549","address":"M.

To assess the role of the Fas/FasL system, we compared the effects of hyperoxia (95% O2 from birth to Postnatal Day [P]7) in Fas-deficient lpr mice and wild-type mice. Alveolar disruption wasmore severe in hyperoxic lpr mice than in wild-type mice. In addition, a transient alveolarization defect was noted in normoxic lpr mice. Hyperoxia induced marked up-regulation of pulmonary Fas expression in wild-type mice, as well as elevated mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, Bad, and Bak. Pulmonary apoptotic activity was similar in hyperoxic wild-type and lpr mice. In contrast, lung growth and proliferation, assessed by stereologic volumetry and Ki67 proliferation studies, were significantly higher in hyperoxic wild-type mice compared with lpr mice, suggesting the Fas/FasL system has a pro-proliferative role in hyperoxic conditions. Levels of the prosurvival MAPkinase, pERK1/2, were significantly higher in hyperoxic wild-type mice compared with lpr mice, whilep Akt levelswere similar. These data suggest that the primary role of the Fas/FasL system in hyperoxic newborn lungs is pro-proliferative, rather than pro-apoptotic, and likely mediated through a Fas-ERK1/2 pathway. Fas-induced proliferation and lung growth in hyperoxic newborn lungs may counteract, in part, the detrimental effects of apoptosis mediated by non-Fas pathways, such as pro-apoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 family members. The capacity of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway to mediate protective rather than destructive functions in hyperoxic newborn lungs highlights the versatility of this complex pathway.","group":"g1","id":"ee3bacf8-bebd-4c0a-8a2f-2e5ed3d71f69","_showDetails":true},"f54f9c2b-2646-4e2b-b477-43de74006de9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"352586659","title":"Wilson-Mikity syndrome: Updated diagnostic criteria based on nine cases and a review of the literature","authors":["Hoepker A.","Seear M.","Petrocheilou A.","Hayes Jr. D.","Nair A.","Deodhar J.","Kadam S.","O'Toole J."],"date":"2008//","keywords":["article","assisted ventilation","birth weight","*chronic lung disease/di [Diagnosis]","*chronic lung disease/th [Therapy]","clinical article","controlled study","diagnostic procedure","female","gestational age","human","infant","kidney failure","lung insufficiency","male","maternal hypertension","morbidity","oligohydramnios","positive end expiratory pressure","prematurity","priority journal","validity","*wilson mikity syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","*wilson mikity syndrome/th [Therapy]"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"43","number":"10","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.

The validity of the diagnosis is currently unclear; now considered either an anachronism, part of BPD spectrum or included within various poorly defined diagnoses such as chronic pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity (CPIP). Objective(s): To define clinically useful diagnostic criteria for WMS so its position in the spectrum of CLD of infancy can be established. Method(s): We studied nine patients who fulfilled WMS criteria, combining this data with a detailed review of the available literature. Result(s): Despite minimal respiratory support at birth, all developed generalized or lobar cystic PIE by 3 weeks of age, followed by slow inflammatory progression over a further 2-3 months. Final outcome was variable but most were left with some degree of CLD. Conclusion(s): WMS is a rare but clearly identifiable syndrome with significant morbidity, predominantly affecting infants below 1,500 g birth weight. The earliest pathology appears to be alveolar air leak. Inflammatory activation induced by cystic interstitial air may cause the subsequent progressive respiratory disease.

Immunostaining for ABCA3 was detected at highest levels in type II epithelial cells of the lung but was also noted in other organs including liver, stomach, kidney, adrenal, pancreas, trachea, and brain. In the fetal lung, ABCA3 staining and mRNA increased prior to birth. Like other surfactant protein genes, ABCA3 expression was induced by thyroid transcription factor-1 in vitro. ABCA3 was coexpressed with SP-B and proSP-C in type II epithelial cells, ABCA3 staining was detected surrounding large, intracellular organelles consistent with its association with lamellar bodies. In the human fetal lung, ABCA3 staining was not detected prior to 22-23 weeks of gestation, except in the presence of pulmonary inflammation. ABCA3 was detected in type II epithelial cells of the human lung from 28 weeks of gestation and thereafter. Postnatally, intense ABCA3 staining was observed in hyperplastic epithelial cells relining injured airways in infants with chronic lung disease. Localization and regulation of ABCA3 in the respiratory epithelium is consistent with its proposed role in surfactant homeostasis. The role of ABCA3 in extrapulmonary tissues and organs remains to be elucidated. This manuscript contains online supplemental material at http://www.jhc.org.

Objective(s): We hypothesized that the lungs of premature infants undergoing mechanical ventilation contain fibroblast-like cells with features of mesenchymal stem cells. Method(s): Tracheal aspirate fluid from mechanically ventilated, premature (< 30 wk gestation) infants 7 days old or younger was obtained from routine suctioning and plated on plastic culture dishes. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 11 of 20 patients studied demonstrated fibroblast-like cells, which were identified as early as 6 hours after plating. Cells were found to express the mesenchymal stem cell markers STRO-1, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166, as well as CCR2b, CD13, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Cells were negative for the hematopoietic and endothelial cell markers CD11b, CD31, CD34, or CD45. Tracheal aspirate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/CCL2 levels were ninefold higher in aspirates in which fibroblast-like cells were found, and cells demonstrated chemotaxis in response to monocyte chemoattractant protein. Placement of cells into appropriate media resulted in adipogenic, osteogenic, and myofibroblastic differentiation. Patients from whom mesenchymal stem cells were isolated tended to require more days of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. Conclusion(s): Together, these data demonstrate that tracheal aspirate fluid from premature, mechanically ventilated infants contains fibroblasts with cell markers and differentiation potential typically found in mesenchymal stem cells.","group":"g1","id":"c10224fa-440a-452e-af08-412c9ccf4d61","_showDetails":true},"eefa7103-e79c-4e07-875d-bf25e998f022":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"47422870","title":"Strategies

The morbidity for BPD is not only in-hospital, with prolonged hospital stay, prolonged ventilation and oxygen use, and increased cost, but it is also associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome, failure to thrive, recurrent episodes of wheezing and increased hospitalisation visits in the first two years. This 'new' BPD has new pathogenesis, and hence implications for new strategies in the prevention of BPD. Strategies to prevention will require a multi-pronged approach, since the cause of BPD is usually multi-factorial. The best prevention is toavoid preterm birth and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Tocolytic agents are effective in delaying preterm labour suuficient to permit a complete course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy. Early use of nasal-prong continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in infants with RDS is associated with significant reductions in endotracheal ventilation and BPD. Prompt treatment of a clinically significant ductus arteriosus and avoiding volutrauma using synchronized volume targeted or guaranteed gentle ventilation may be associated with clinically important outcomes including BPD. Larger trials with long-term outcomes are needed to evaluate the newer ventilation modes such as patient-triggered ventilation and volume-targeted ventilation in very preterm infants. Drug therapies that have shown effectiveness in reducing BPD include vitamin A injection and post-natal systemic steroids. The latter treatment however, is associated with increased risk of cerebral palsy and poorer cognitive outcome and therefore not recommended as routine use for prevention of BPD particularly in the first two weeks of life. Newer therapies that hold promise for the future include inhaled nitric oxide, pentoxyfylline and inositol. Future research would no doubt also include stem cell therapy.","group":"g1","id":"eefa7103-e79c-4e07-875d-bf25e998f022","_showDetails":true},"bdecd3b8-b121-4079-bf5a-b73f2b0ac1c5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"46647896","title":"Nutritional support and bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Young T.E."],"date":"2007//","keywords":["article","artificial milk","body height","cell differentiation","cell growth","clinical trial","convalescence","diet supplementation","drug blood level","drug dose comparison","energy resource","head circumference","human","individualization","intensive care","*low birth weight/th [Therapy]","lung alveolus cell","*lung dysplasia/co [Complication]","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung dysplasia/pc [Prevention]","*lung dysplasia/th [Therapy]","newborn","*nutritional support","outcomes research","practice guideline","prophylaxis","urea nitrogen blood level","weight gain","acetylcysteine/dt [Drug Therapy]","alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial]","alpha tocopherol/cr [Drug Concentration]","alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy]","alpha tocopherol/po [Oral Drug Administration]","inositol/ct [Clinical Trial]","inositol/dt [Drug Therapy]","inositol/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","inositol/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","inositol/pd [Pharmacology]","nitrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","placebo","retinol/dt [Drug Therapy]","retinol/im [Intramuscular Drug Administration]","retinol/pd [Pharmacology]","selenium/ct [Clinical Trial]","selenium/cr [Drug Concentration]","selenium/dt [Drug Therapy]","selenium/po [Oral Drug Administration]","selenium/pa [Parenteral Drug Administration]","selenium/pd [Pharmacology]","superoxide dismutase/ct [Clinical Trial]","superoxide dismutase/dt [Drug Therapy]","superoxide dismutase/tr [Intratracheal Drug Administration]","superoxide dismutase/pd [Pharmacology]","urea/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatology","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group (Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1476-5543","address":"T.E.

Attempts to improve outcomes with nutritional supplementation have been unsuccessful. These have included nutrients to enhance protection from oxidative lung injury (vitamin E, selenium, N-acetyl cysteine, superoxide dismutase), to improve surfactant function (inositol) and to improve pulmonary cell growth and differentiation (vitamin A). Only vitamin A has shown modest benefit. After infants with BPD move to the convalescent phase of their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay, they continue to require extra energy and protein to grow at appropriate rates. Enriched formulas have shown promise, but standard supplementation schemes with commercial human milk fortifiers may be inadequate to meet the infant's needs. Efforts to individualize the amount of fortification guided by twice-weekly blood urea nitrogen determinations have led to improved gains in weight, length and head circumference.","group":"g1","id":"bdecd3b8-b121-4079-bf5a-b73f2b0ac1c5","_showDetails":false},"b9b1e99f-c224-4049-9b10-1e516630a7af":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"46647508","title":"Effect of tetrandrine on endothelin expression in the lungs and clinical significance thereof: Experiment with rat models with nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia","authors":["Xiong Z.-X.","Liu W.-Y.","Wang Y.-G.","Xu C.","Chen Z.-X."],"date":"2007//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","arteriole","article","body weight","bronchiole","controlled study","correlation analysis","*diaphragm hernia/cn [Congenital Disorder]","*diaphragm hernia/dt [Drug Therapy]","drug efficacy","drug mechanism","female","fetus","immunohistochemistry","lung weight","nonhuman","optical density","protein analysis","protein expression","protein function","rat","dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination]","*endothelin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","nitrofen","*tetrandrine/cb [Drug Combination]","*tetrandrine/dt [Drug Therapy]","*tetrandrine/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"National Medical Journal of China","language":"Chinese","volume":"87","number":"6","publisher":"Chinese Medical Association (42 Dongsi Xidajie, Beijing 100710, China)","isbn":"0376-2491","address":"W.-Y.

In the past they would have died before there was time to develop chronic lung disease (CLD). Based on the definition of a neonate requiring any form of respiratory therapy (oxygen or assisted ventilation) at 36 weeks' post-menstrual age, the CLD rate in Australia is 52% in those <28 weeks and 12% in those 28-32 weeks gestation. The high CLD rate in the former group is due to their improved survival rates (one-year survival rate of infants born in the State of Victoria is 41% at 23 and 24 weeks, 73% at 25 weeks, and 88% at 26 weeks). Data sources: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews on the prevention and treatment of CLD were identified in the published literature. Result(s): The following perinatal strategies were found to be effective in preventing or minimizing CLD: antenatal corticosteroids, postnatal surfactant, reduced oxygen saturation targeting at 89%-94%, early use of continuous positive airway pressure, synchronized ventilation, permissive hypercapnia ventilation strategy, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, closure of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus with indomethacin, reduced fluid intake, and inhaled nitric oxide. Several anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agents have been found in RCTs to be effective, including vitamin A and recombinant human superoxide dismutase. Clinical management after the development of CLD includes appropriate oxygen and ventilation strategies, fluid restriction, and diuretic and bronchodilator therapy. Postnatal corticosteroid therapy is efficacious but its side-effect is increasing. The risk of cerebral palsy outweighs the benefit of therapy. Only in severe CLD, low-dose and short-course dexamethasone should be used. Conclusion(s): Ongoing basic and clinical research is required to identify perinatal and neonatal interventions that are effective in either preventing or treating CLD in preterm neonates. © 2007, World J Pediatr.

The chorioamnionitis frequently associated with preterm birth induces monocyte influx into the fetal lung. Previous studies demonstrated that monocytes in the developing lung can mediate lung injury responses that resemble BPD in humans. We hypothesized that chorioamnionitis would induce maturation of immature monocytes in the fetal lung. Groups of three to seven time-mated ewes received saline or 10 mg of endotoxin (Escherichia coli 055:B5) in saline by intra-amniotic injection for intervals from 1 to 14 days before operative delivery at 124 days of gestational age. Monocytic cells from lung tissue were recovered using Percoll gradients. Monocytic cells consistent with macrophages were identified morphologically and by myosin heavy chain class II expression. An increase in macrophages was preceded by induction of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the lung and subsequent activation of the transcription factor PU.1. The production of IL-6 by monocytes/macrophages in response to endotoxin challenge in vitro increased 7 and 14 days after exposure to intra-amniotic endotoxin. Recombinant TNF-alpha induced IL-6 production by lung monocytic cells exposed to intra-amniotic endotoxin but not in control cells. Monocytic phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils also increased 7 and 14 days after exposure to intra-amniotic endotoxin. Intra-amniotic endotoxin induced lung monocytes to develop into functionally mature cells consistent with macrophages. These findings have implications for lung immune responses after exposure to chorioamnionitis.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung epithelial cells may lead to BPD., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential occurrence of EMT in a newborn rat model of BPD., METHODS: Newborn rats were exposed to a hyperoxic environment within 12 hr of birth. Lung tissue and isolated alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2 cells) were collected on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after hyperoxic exposure. Pathological changes in lung tissue, alveolar development, ultrastructural changes in AT2 cells, co-expression of surfactant associated surfactant protein C (SPC), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were investigated. The relative expression of SPC, alpha-SMA, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin were investigated in lung tissue and isolated AT2 cells., RESULTS: In lung tissue, alveolar development was attenuated from Day 7 onwards in the BPD model group; co-expression of SPC and alpha-SMA and ultrastructural changes typical of EMT were observed in AT2 cells from rats in the BPD group. SPC and alpha-SMA expression levels were higher in tissue samples from the BPD group than in control samples. Beginning on Day 7, evidence of a switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression was observed in BPD lung tissue sample and in isolated AT2 cells., CONCLUSION: EMT of AT2 cells occurred in the hyperoxia-induced newborn rat BPD model and resulted in attenuated alveolar development as a portion of the myofibroblasts accumulated in the lung originated from AT2 cells via EMT.

We discovered that MV of 2- to 4-day-old mice with 40% O2 for 8 h, compared with unventilated control pups, reduced lung expression of genes that regulate lung septation and angiogenesis (VEGF-A and its receptor, VEGF-R2; PDGF-A; and tenascin-C). MV with air for 8 h yielded similar results for PDGF-A and tenascin-C but did not alter lung mRNA expression of VEGF or VEGF-R2. MV of 4- to 6-day-old mice with 40% O2 for 24 h reduced lung protein abundance of VEGF-A, VEGF-R2, PDGF-A, and tenascin-C and resulted in lung structural abnormalities consistent with evolving CLD. After MV with 40% O2 for 24 h, lung volume was similar to unventilated controls, whereas distal air space size, assessed morphometrically, was greater in lungs of ventilated pups, indicative of impaired septation. Immunostaining for vimentin, which is expressed in myofibroblasts, was reduced in distal lung after 24 h of MV with 40% O2. These molecular, cellular, and structural changes occurred without detectable lung inflammation as evaluated by histology and assays for proinflammatory cytokines, myeloperoxidase activity, and water content in lung. Thus lengthy MV of newborn mice with O2-rich gas reduces lung expression of genes and proteins that are critical for normal lung growth and development. These changes yielded lung structural defects similar to those observed in evolving CLD.

We previously found fewer alveoli and more elastin in lungs of preterm compared with term lambs that had mechanical ventilation (MV) with O2-rich gas for 3 wk (MV-3 wk). We hypothesized that, in preterm more than in term lambs, MV-3 wk would reduce lung expression of growth factors that regulate alveolarization (VEGF, PDGF-A) and increase lung expression of growth factors [transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, TGF-beta1] and matrix molecules (tropoelastin, fibrillin-1, fibulin-5, lysyl oxidases) that regulate elastin synthesis and assembly. We measured lung expression of these genes in preterm and term lambs after MV for 1 day, 3 days, or 3 wk, and in fetal controls. Lung mRNA for VEGF, PDGF-A, and their receptors (VEGF-R2, PDGF-Ralpha) decreased in preterm and term lambs after MV-3 wk, with reduced lung content of the relevant proteins in preterm lambs with CLD. TGF-alpha and TGF-beta1 expression increased only in lungs of preterm lambs. Tropoelastin mRNA increased more with MV of preterm than term lambs, and expression levels remained high in lambs with CLD. In contrast, fibrillin-1 and lysyl oxidaselike-1 mRNA increased transiently, and lung abundance of other elastin-assembly genes/proteins was unchanged (fibulin-5) or reduced (lysyl oxidase) in preterm lambs with CLD. Thus MV-3 wk reduces lung expression of growth factors that regulate alveolarization and differentially alters expression of growth factors and matrix proteins that regulate elastin assembly. These changes, coupled with increased lung elastase activity measured in preterm lambs after MV for 1-3 days, likely contribute to CLD.

Trophic feedings of small volumes of breast milk or formula do not appear to increase the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). For prevention of NEC, breast milk, antenatal steroids and fluid restriction each confers a benefit. Because the incidence of NEC is relatively low, to determine if a particular prevention strategy is effective, large numbers of infants would need to be enrolled in a prospective, randomized controlled trial, and such trials are rare. Candidate therapies for NEC prevention that warrant further study include oral immunoglobulins, probiotics, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and arginine.

We demonstrated elevated bombesin-like peptide levels in infants that later developed BPD. In the 140-day hyperoxic baboon model of BPD, anti-bombesin antibody 2A11 abrogated lung injury. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that bombesin-like peptides mediate BPD in extremely premature baboons (born at Gestational Day 125 and given oxygen pro re nata [PRN], called the 125-day PRN model), similar to \"modern-day BPD.\" Methods: The 125-day animals were treated with 2A11 on Postnatal Day 1 (P1), P3, and P6. On P14 and P21, lungs were inflation-fixed for histopathologic analyses of alveolarization. Regulation of angiogenesis by bombesin was evaluated using cultured pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Measurements and Main Results: In 125-day PRN animals, urine bombesin-like peptide levels at P2-3 are directly correlated with impaired lung function at P14. Gastrin-releasing peptide (the major pulmonary bombesin-like peptide) mRNA was elevated eightfold at P1 and remained high thereafter. At P14, 2A11 reduced alveolar wall thickness and increased the percentage of secondary septa containing endothelial cells. At P21, 2A11-treated 125-day PRN animals had improved alveolarization according to mean linear intercepts and number of branch points per millimeter squared. Bombesin promoted tubulogenesis of cultured pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, but cocultured fetal lung mesenchymal cells abrogated this effect. Conclusion(s): Early bombesin-like peptide overproduction in 125-day PRN animals predicted alveolarization defects weeks later. Bombesin-like peptide blockade improved septation, with the greatest effects at P21. This could have implications for preventing BPD in premature infants.","group":"g1","id":"a62a0252-1e2a-4e80-951a-0ecc0e989a4d","_showDetails":true},"f10f9788-3710-47d3-8e44-70c2831ba38c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"46934214","title":"Angiogenesis in lung development, injury and repair: Implications for chronic lung disease of prematurity","authors":["Thebaud B."],"date":"2007//","keywords":["*angiogenesis","artificial ventilation","branching morphogenesis","*chronic lung disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","conference paper","embryo development","gene expression","human","hyperoxia","hypoxia","lung alveolus","lung blood vessel","lung capillary","*lung development","lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","lung emphysema","*lung injury","nonhuman","postnatal development","*prematurity","prenatal care","priority journal","protein expression","protein function","risk factor","signal transduction","steroid therapy","viral gene delivery system","*wound healing","angiopoietin 1/cb [Drug Combination]","angiopoietin 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","angiopoietin 1/pd [Pharmacology]","CD31 antigen","endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II/ec [Endogenous Compound]","hypoxia inducible factor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","isoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","lung surfactant","nitric oxide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","recombinant vasculotropin/cb [Drug Combination]","recombinant vasculotropin/dt [Drug Therapy]","recombinant vasculotropin/tr [Intratracheal Drug Administration]","recombinant vasculotropin/pd [Pharmacology]","sildenafil/pd [Pharmacology]","steroid","unclassified drug","vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin receptor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin 164/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin 188/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Neonatology","language":"English","volume":"91","number":"4","publisher":"S.

The disease has not disappeared, but it now affects infants with undeveloped distal airspaces, resulting in an arrest of alveolar development. The histological changes that occur during normal lung development are well described, but little is known about the signaling mechanisms that regulate saccular and alveolar development. Understanding how alveoli and the underlying capillary network develop and how these mechanisms are disrupted in preterm infants with BPD is critical to develop efficient and effective therapies for lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage. This brief review focuses on the recently recognized role of angiogenic growth factors during normal alveolar development, injury and repair with a particular emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor.

Method(s): mRNA expression was quantified at embryonic (E) day 15, 17, 19, 21, and postnatal age 1 day, 2 weeks, 12 weeks. Result(s): EGF and EGFR increased during gestation and development, then decreased in adulthood, whereas TGFalpha was highest at birth and remained unchanged afterwards. All TGFbeta isoforms increased slightly during pregnancy, reached highest expression during development, and returned to neonatal levels in adulthood. TGFbetaRI and TGFbetaRII patterns were similar to TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta1 respectively, whereas TGFbetaRIII expression was lowest at the postnatal time points. VEGF164 and VEGF120 showed a steady increase up to 2 weeks and declined at 12 weeks, whereas highest VEGF188 expression occurred at 12 weeks. VEGF-A receptors expression paralleled the summation of all three isoforms, increasing steadily with age.

Assessments of lung injury are confounded by effects of subsequent ventilatory support. Objective(s): To evaluate the injury response to a brief period of large tidal volume (VT) ventilation, simulating neonatal resuscitation in preterm neonates. Method(s): Preterm lambs (129 d gestation; term is 150 d) were ventilated (VT = 15 ml/kg, no positive end-expiratory pressure) for 15 minutes to simulate delivery room resuscitation, either with the placental circulation intact (fetal resuscitation [FR]) or after delivery (neonatal resuscitation [NR]). After the initial 15 minutes, lambs received surfactant and were maintained with either ventilatory support (FR-VS and NR-VS) or placental support (FR-PS) for 2 hours, 45 minutes. A control group received no resuscitation and was maintained with placental support. Samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung, and liver were analyzed. Measurements and Main Results: Inflammatory cells and protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, heat shock protein-70 immunostaining, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, serum amyloid A (SAA)-3, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, and TLR4 mRNA in the lungs were increased in the FR-PS group compared with control animals. There were further elevations in neutrophils, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in the FR-VS and NR-VS groups compared with FR-PS.

However, infants with BPD experience intermittent hypoxic episodes. This study was undertaken to determine whether intermittent hypoxic stress associated with BPD contributes to the development of neurological deficit. The model of BPD was produced in neonatal mice by exposure to hyperoxia (65% O2) for 4 weeks. Arterial blood gases, pulmonary mechanics, and histopathology were used to define the degree of lung injury. The mice were subjected to brief (10 min/day) and intermittent (10 days) hypoxic stress (8% O2) at different stages of the development of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. At 8 weeks of life, the neurofunction was assessed by water maze and rota-rod tests followed by cerebral morphological analysis using Nissl, bromodeoxyuridine, and caspase-3 immunostaining. Data were compared to naive normoxic littermates and those mice that were exposed only to hyperoxia or intermittent hypoxia alone. Mice with BPD subjected to brief/intermittent hypoxia demonstrated a significantly poorer navigational memory performance as compared with normoxic mice and mice with BPD that were not subjected to intermittent hypoxia. The neurofunctional handicap in these mice was associated with significantly decreased brain weight and increased cerebral expression of caspase-3. Our results suggest that intermittent hypoxia associated with hyperoxia-induced lung injury, but not lung injury itself, results in significant neurological handicap in neonatal mice with BPD.

We hypothesized that extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD)3, an antioxidant uniquely targeted to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and alveolar fluid, might have a different response (down-regulation) to hyperoxic injury and recovery in room air (RA), thereby contributing to the persistent airspace injury and inflammation. We used a murine BPD model using postnatal hyperoxia (O2) (4 or 5 d) followed by short-term recovery (14 d) in RA, which mimics the durable effects after injury during alveolar development. This was associated with significantly increased mRNA expression for antioxidant genes mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) in the O2 (n = 4) versus RA group (n = 5). SOD3, an Nrf2-independent antioxidant, was significantly reduced in the O2-exposed mice compared with RA. Immunohistochemistry revealed decreased and disrupted SOD3 deposition in the alveolar ECM of O2-exposed mice. Furthermore, this distinct hyperoxic antioxidant and injury profile was reproducible in murine lung epithelial 12 cells exposed to O2. Overexpression of SOD3 rescued the injury measures in the O2-exposed cells. We establish that reduced SOD3 expression correlates with alveolar injury measures in the recovered neonatal hyperoxic lung, and SOD3 overexpression attenuates hyperoxic injury in an alveolar epithelial cell line. Such findings suggest a candidate mechanism for the pathogenesis of BPD that may lead to targeted interventions.","group":"g1","id":"e6bdbd36-14af-499b-9cc4-7e7351f67e64","_showDetails":false},"84a29b32-721e-49ff-86de-ebaec0a5f151":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"43947200","title":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and intrauterine growth restriction","authors":["Gortner L.","Reiss I.","Hilgendorff A."],"date":"2006//","keywords":["airway","artificial ventilation","gas exchange","human","inflammation","*intrauterine growth retardation","lamb","letter","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","nonhuman","prematurity/th [Therapy]","priority journal","protein expression","small for date infant","messenger RNA"],"journal":"Lancet","language":"English","volume":"368","number":"9529","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","isbn":"0140-6736","address":"L.

Among preterm infants, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is characterized by the presence of intraalveolar fibrin deposition. Fibrin monomers inhibit surfactant function effectively. However, little is known about potential disturbances of intraalveolar fibrinolysis in RDS. We studied levels of major plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in lungs of preterm infants with RDS. METHODS. The antigen levels of PAI-1, tPA, and uPA were measured in 262 samples of tracheal aspirate fluid collected from 37 intubated preterm infants during the first 2 postnatal weeks. To examine the expression of PAI-1, tPA, and uPA in lung tissue, immunohistochemical analyses were performed on autopsy specimens from 7 preterm infants with RDS and 6 newborn infants without pulmonary pathologic conditions. RESULTS. For infants with an immature surfactant profile, as indicated by lecithin/sphingomyelin ratios in tracheal aspirate fluid of <=10, PAI-1 levels and ratios of PAI-1 to uPA and tPA were significantly higher during postnatal days 1 to 2, compared with infants with lecithin/sphingomyelin ratios of >=10. Moreover, infants who subsequently developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (n = 15) had higher PAI-1 levels on days 3 to 4 and days 7 to 8 than did those who survived without BPD. For preterm infants with RDS, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated increased expression of PAI-1, tPA, and uPA predominantly in alveolar epithelium. CONCLUSIONS. High concentrations of PAI-1 and an increased ratio of PAI-1 to uPA, with a concurrently less-increased ratio of PAI-1 to tPA, are associated with the severity of RDS among preterm infants during the first postnatal days. Pulmonary inhibition of fibrinolysis is a pathophysiologic feature of RDS and may play a role in the development of BPD.

The goals were to compare early school-age neurodevelopmental and respiratory outcomes for children who were treated with either early (<3 days) or delayed selective (>15 days) postnatal corticosteroid therapy and to compare systemic dexamethasone treatment with inhaled budesonide treatment. METHODS. One hundred twenty-seven (84%) of 152 survivors from the United Kingdom and Ireland who were recruited to the Open Study of Early Corticosteroid Treatment, a randomized trial of inhaled and systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent chronic lung disease, were traced and assessed at a median age of 7 years. Outcome measures were level of disability, presence of cerebral palsy, cognitive ability, behavioral difficulties and competencies, growth, and respiratory symptoms. Results were adjusted for potential confounding variables (gestational age, birth weight, gender, prenatal steroid therapy, method of delivery, Apgar score at 5 minutes, and Clinical Risk Index for Babies score). RESULTS. There were no significant differences among the treatment groups in cognitive ability, behavioral competencies or difficulties, overall disability rates, cerebral palsy, combined outcomes of death or cerebral palsy and death or moderate/severe disability, growth, respiratory morbidity, or diastolic blood pressure. Those assigned to dexamethasone were more likely to have high systolic blood pressure and to have a diagnosis of asthma than were those assigned to budesonide. CONCLUSIONS. Although postnatal steroid therapy has been associated with poor long-term outcomes, this study failed to show significant differences in cognitive function between dexamethasone- and budesonide-allocated groups. There may be increased systolic blood pressure and a greater likelihood of developing asthma in childhood after postnatal dexamethasone treatment.

This has been attributed to higher levels of androgens in the male lung. We previously showed that the genes encoding for the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) type 5 (conversion of androstenedione in testosterone) and type 2 (the opposite reaction) are, respectively, expressed in the human epithelial Type II (PTII)-like A549 cells and in human lung fibroblasts. Here, we aim to explain the physiological relevance of androgen synthesis by PTII cells. We showed that 17beta-HSD type 2 and type 5 genes are both up-regulated in correlation with the emergence of mature PTII cells in both male and female developing lungs of the fetal mouse. In contrast, the androgen receptor gene is expressed at similar levels in both sexes with no temporal regulation. In conclusion, the expression profile of the 17beta-HSD type 5 gene does not explain the presence of higher levels of androgens in the male fetal lung but that androgen synthesis must be a normal characteristic of mature PTII cells for both sexes. The production of androgens after the emergence of mature PTII cells should negatively regulate PTII cell maturation and thus, a novel and normal role for androgens in cell reprogramming is proposed. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Injurious environmental factors such as hyperoxia may disrupt distal airway branching and alveolar septation, as these critical stages in lung development occur following birth in extremely premature infants. To test if hyperoxia directly inhibited distal airway branching, we cultured E16 fetal mouse lung explants in either 20% (control) or 95% oxygen (hyperoxia). Hyperoxia reduced the number of distal airways to less than 50% of controls. Explants cultured in 95% oxygen also had fewer complex distal airways compared with controls. Mesenchymal cells adjacent to distal airways in hyperoxic explants appeared apoptotic by phase microscopy. Consistent with increased apoptosis, explants cultured in hyperoxia had increased caspase 3/7 activity compared with controls. Hyperoxia also increased mesenchymal caspase 3 expression and annexin V binding within cultured explants as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. We measured increased annexin V binding in isolated primary fetal lung mesenchymal cells cultured in 95% oxygen suggesting a direct effect on cells within the mesenchyme. Hyperoxia can lead to NF-kappaB activation, which mediates inflammatory cascades and may protect cells from apoptosis. We detected NF-kappaB activation and nuclear p65 localization in explants exposed to 48 h of hyperoxia. Inhibition of NF-kappaB prevented the hyperoxia-induced activation of caspase 3. NF-kappaB activation may therefore contribute to apoptosis in the developing fetal mouse lung following hyperoxia exposure. Our data suggest hyperoxia inhibits distal airway branching and directly induces apoptosis of the fetal mouse lung mesenchyme.

VEGF null mice have provided little insight into the role of VEGF during the later stages of lung morphogenesis. Therefore, we examined the in vitro effects of autocrine and paracrine VEGF-A production and the inhibition of VEGF-A signaling on a Flk-1-negative subset of fetal pulmonary mesenchymal cells (pMC). We hypothesized that VEGF-A receptor signaling regulates turnover of fetal lung mesenchyme in a cell cycle-dependent manner. VEGF receptor blockade with SU-5416 caused cell spreading and decreased proliferation and bcl-2 localization. Nuclear expression of the cell cycle inhibitory protein, p21, was increased with SU-5416 treatment, and p27 was absent. Autocrine VEGF production by pMC resulted in proliferation and p21/p27-dependent contact inhibition. In contrast, exogenous VEGF-A increased cell progression through the cell cycle. Selective activation of Flt by placental growth factor demonstrated the importance of this receptor/kinase in the VEGF-A responsiveness of pMC. The expression and localization of the survival factor bcl-2 was dependent on VEGF. These results provide evidence that VEGF-A plays a critical role in the regulation of fetal pulmonary mesenchymal proliferation, survival, and the subsequent development of normal lung architecture through bcl-2 and p21/p27-dependent cell cycle control.","group":"g1","id":"98afdb0e-b87e-4a40-90b0-8f5c165addb7","_showDetails":true},"79b025a8-cb94-40e3-b91c-764003397aed":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"43825339","title":"Nitric oxide donor restores lung growth factor and receptor expression in hyperoxia-exposed rat pups","authors":["Lopez E.","Boucherat O.","Franco-Montoya M.-L.","Bourbon J.R.","Delacourt C.","Jarreau P.-H."],"date":"2006//","keywords":["aerobic metabolism","ambient air","angiogenesis","animal cell","animal tissue","article","*cell growth","cell protection","cell survival","controlled study","female","*hyperoxia","*lung alveolus cell","morphometrics","newborn","nonhuman","protein expression","randomization","rat","regulatory mechanism","*3,3 bis(2 aminoethyl) 1 hydroxy 2 oxotriazene/dv [Drug Development]","*3,3 bis(2 aminoethyl) 1 hydroxy 2 oxotriazene/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration]","*3,3 bis(2 aminoethyl) 1 hydroxy 2 oxotriazene/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","*3,3 bis(2 aminoethyl) 1 hydroxy 2 oxotriazene/pd [Pharmacology]","elastin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor 18/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor receptor 3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor receptor 4/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*nitric oxide donor/dv [Drug Development]","*nitric oxide donor/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration]","*nitric oxide donor/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","*nitric oxide donor/pd [Pharmacology]","protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*lung alveolarization"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","language":"English","volume":"34","number":"6","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1044-1549","address":"P.-H.

Newborn rat pups were randomized at birth to hyperoxia (> 95% O2) or room air exposure for 6 or 10 d, while receiving D-NO or its diluent. On Day 6, several GFs and their receptors were studied at pre- and/or post-translational levels. Elastin transcript determination on Day 6, and elastin deposition in tissue and morphometric analysis of the lungs on Day 10, were also performed. Hyperoxia decreased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) 2, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-18, and FGF receptors (FGFRs) FGFR3 and FGFR4, increased mortality, and impaired alveolarization and capillary growth. D-NO treatment of hyperoxia-exposed pups restored the expression level of FGF18 and FGFR4, induced an increase of both VEGF mRNA and protein, enhanced elastin expression, and partially restored elastin deposition in alveolar walls. Although, under the present conditions, D-NO failed to prevent the physiologic consequences of hyperoxia in terms of survival and lung alveolarization, our findings demonstrate molecular effects of NO on GFs involved in alveolar development that may have contributed to the protective effects previously reported for NO.","group":"g1","id":"79b025a8-cb94-40e3-b91c-764003397aed","_showDetails":false},"5bd9777a-77fc-4369-afad-a09422122e47":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"44041115","title":"Anti-inflammatory therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit: Present and future","authors":["Watterberg K."],"date":"2006//","keywords":["*antiinflammatory activity","article","artificial ventilation","*chorioamnionitis/dt [Drug Therapy]","*chorioamnionitis/et [Etiology]","clinical trial","human","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*newborn intensive care","postnatal care","prenatal care","treatment outcome","unspecified side effect/si [Side Effect]","*azithromycin/ct [Clinical Trial]","*azithromycin/do [Drug Dose]","*azithromycin/dt [Drug Therapy]","*azithromycin/pd [Pharmacology]","*dexamethasone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]","*dexamethasone/ct [Clinical Trial]","*dexamethasone/cr [Drug Concentration]","*dexamethasone/do [Drug Dose]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*dexamethasone/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","*erythromycin/ct [Clinical Trial]","*erythromycin/do [Drug Dose]","*erythromycin/dt [Drug Therapy]","*erythromycin/pd [Pharmacology]","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*ketorolac/ct [Clinical Trial]","*ketorolac/do [Drug Dose]","*ketorolac/dt [Drug Therapy]","*ketorolac/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"11","number":"5","publisher":"W.B.

Reducing the exposure of preterm infants to postnatal inflammatory stimuli such as mechanical ventilation and sepsis may be more effective than anti-inflammatory drug therapy in improving outcomes. If anti-inflammatory drug therapy is considered necessary, the only drug currently proven to decrease extubation failure and bronchopulmonary dsyplasia (BPD) is dexamethasone, which is associated with numerous side effects. Erythromycin treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum has been ineffective in reducing BPD; are trials of azythromycin planned.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure of rats to benzo[a]pyrene (BP), a component of cigarette smoke, will result in increased susceptibility of newborns to oxygen-mediated lung injury and alveolar simplification, and that cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A and 1B1 enzymes and oxidative stress mechanistically contribute to this phenomenon. Timed pregnant Fisher 344 rats were administered BP (25 mg/kg) or the vehicle corn oil (CO) on gestational days 18, 19 and 20, and newborn rats were either maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) for 7 or 14 days. Hyperoxic newborn rats prenatally exposed to the vehicle CO showed lung injury and alveolar simplification, and inflammation, and these effects were potentiated in rats that were prenatally exposed to BP. Prenatal exposure to BP, followed by hyperoxia, also resulted in significant modulation of hepatic and pulmonary cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A and 1B1 enzymes at PND 7-14. These rats displayed significant oxidative stress in lungs at postnatal day (PND) 14, as evidenced by increased levels of the F2-isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2alpha. Furthermore, these animals showed BP-derived DNA adducts and oxidative DNA adducts in the lung. In conclusion, our results show increased susceptibility of newborns to oxygen-mediated lung injury and alveolar simplification following maternal exposure to BP, and our results suggest that modulation of CYP1A/1B1 enzymes, increases in oxidative stress, and BP-DNA adducts contributed to this phenomenon.

To examine the diverse roles of VEGF in the pathogenesis of and recovery from hyperoxia-induced ALI, we hypothesized that exogenous recombinant human VEGF (rhVEGF) treatment during early neonatal hyperoxic lung injury may increase pulmonary edema but would improve late lung structure during recovery. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were placed in a hyperoxia chamber (inspired O 2 fraction 0.9) for postnatal days 2-14. Pups were randomized to daily intramuscular injections of rhVEGF165 (20 mug/kg) or saline (controls). On postnatal day 14, rats were placed in room air for a 7-day recovery period. At postnatal days 3, 14, and 21, rats were killed for studies, which included body weight and wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, morphometric analysis [including radial alveolar counts (RAC), mean linear intercepts (MLI), and vessel density], and lung endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein content by Western blot analysis. Compared with room air controls, hyperoxia increased pulmonary edema by histology and wet-to-dry lung weight ratios at postnatal day 3, which resolved by day 14. Although treatment with rhVEGF did not increase edema in control rats, rhVEGF increased wet-to-dry weight ratios in hyperoxia-exposed rats at postnatal days 3 and 14 (P < 0.01). Compared with room air controls, hyperoxia decreased RAC and increased MLI at postnatal days 14 and 21. Treatment with VEGF resulted in increased RAC by 181% and decreased MLI by 55% on postnatal day 14 in the hyperoxia group (P < 0.01). On postnatal day 21, RAC was increased by 176% and MLI was decreased by 58% in the hyperoxia group treated with VEGF. rhVEGF treatment during hyperoxia increased eNOS protein on postnatal day 3 by threefold (P < 0.05). We conclude that rhVEGF treatment during hyperoxia-induced ALI transiently increases pulmonary edema but improves lung structure during late recovery. We speculate that VEGF has diverse roles in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, contributing to lung edema during the acute stage of ALI but promoting repair of the lung during recovery.

If events that initiate these diseases, as opposed to those that propagate the disease state, are to be understood, then the difficult area of how ethically to research problems in infancy must be tackled. Furthermore, the predisposition to archetypally 'pure' adult problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may lie antenatally, the effects being masked until the lung starts to age. An additional factor is that the success of paediatricians, for example in ensuring the survival of extremely premature, low birth weight infants leads to adult survivors with potentially a whole new morbidity. The first prerequisite to making progress is a sound understanding of the development of the normal lung and how adverse environmental and genetic influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and maternal atopy, respectively, may affect growth. This paper focuses on three key areas: the implications of different pre-school wheezing phenotypes for adult disease; the importance of very early life events in cystic fibrosis; and the long term consequences of chronic lung disease of prematurity. Finally, the ethical principles that must underpin future research in pre-school children is discussed, as well as the means we might use to further our understanding of the relevant early disease processes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective(s): determine if hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is upregulated in neonatal lung injury and is essential for postnatal alveologenesis. Method(s): A neonatal lung injury, in which there were patchy areas of interstitial thickening with a relative increase in the proportion of epithelial cells, was induced in newborn rats by exposing them to 60% oxygen for 14 days. Air-exposed pups had binding of endogenous HGF to its natural receptor, c-Met, inhibited by the intraperitoneal injection of either neutralizing antibody to HGF, or a truncated soluble c-Met receptor. Measurements and Main Results: The 60% oxygen-mediated lung injury was associated with increased lung mRNAs for hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met, relative to air-exposed control lungs, at Day 7 after birth. After exposure to 60% oxygen, immunoreactive HGF was increased at Days 4 and 7, and immunoreactive c-Met was increased at Day 14. In air-exposed pups, intraperitoneal injections of neutralizing antibody to HGF inhibited DNA synthesis in alveoli-forming secondary crests, and reduced the number of alveoli in 6-day-old pups. Intraperitoneal injections of a truncated soluble c-Met receptor inhibited DNA synthesis in secondary crests in 4-day-old air-exposed rat pups. Conclusion(s): HGF and its c-Met receptor are required for normal postnatal alveolar formation from secondary crests, and are upregulated during 60% oxygen-induced neonatal lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"e017980c-617e-4ef5-a50d-3144fd6b6284","_showDetails":false},"c4be5cc6-59e6-4782-9cad-217e0ff244a1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"41362186","title":"Transfer of proinflammatory cytokines across term placenta","authors":["Aaltonen R.","Heikkinen T.","Hakala K.","Laine K.","Alanen A."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["adult","amnion fluid","artery perfusion","article","cerebral palsy","cesarean section","controlled study","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","female","Finland","human","human tissue","inflammation","lung dysplasia","placenta perfusion","*placental transfer","premature labor","priority journal","protein transport","*cytokine","*interleukin 1beta","*interleukin 6","*tumor necrosis factor alpha"],"journal":"Obstetrics and Gynecology","language":"English","volume":"106","number":"4","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (250 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8RD, United Kingdom)","isbn":"0029-7844","address":"R.

The purpose of this study was to find out if the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6, transfer across the placenta, and thereby determine whether intra-amniotic inflammatory response, measured from the amniotic fluid, is of maternal or fetal origin. METHOD(S): Nineteen placentas from healthy women undergoing elective cesarean delivery at term with intact membranes and without labor, were dually perfused ex vivo in an open circulation system for either 30 minutes or 2 hours. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were added to maternal or fetal circulation in a concentration usually found in chorioamnionitis. As a reference, placentas without added cytokine were also perfused. The concentrations of cytokines were determined by enzyme immunoassays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). RESULT(S): After the addition of the cytokine to the arterial perfusate, the venous concentration on the same side of the placenta increased rapidly and reached a plateau at 10 minutes. No transfer of any cytokine in either direction was detected. Some endogenous release of IL-6 was observed in response to the perfusion. CONCLUSION(S): Proinflammatory cytokines do not cross normal term placenta. © 2005 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Objective(s): To see if continuous iNO from birth might reduce pulmonary vascular and respiratory tract resistance (PVR, RE) and attenuate growth of arterial and airway smooth muscle in preterm lambs with chronic lung disease. Method(s): Eight premature lambs received mechanical ventilation for 3 weeks, four with and four without iNO (5-15 ppm). Four term lambs, mechanically ventilated without iNO for 3 weeks, served as additional control animals. Measurements: PVR and RE were measured weekly. After 3 weeks, lung tissue was processed for quantitative image analysis of smooth muscle abundance around small arteries (SMart) and terminal bronchioles (SMtb). Radial alveolar counts were done to assess alveolar number. Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein in arteries and airways was measured by immunoblot analysis. Main Result(s): At study's end, PVR was similar in iNO-treated and untreated preterm lambs; PVR was less in iNO-treated preterm lambs compared with term control animals. RE in iNO-treated lambs was less than 40% of RE measured in preterm control animals. SMart was similar in iNO-treated and both groups of control lambs; SMtb in lambs given iNO was significantly less (~ 50%) than in preterm control animals. Radial alveolar counts of iNO-treated lambs were more than twice that of preterm control animals. eNOS was similar in arteries and airways of iNO-treated preterm lambs compared with control term lambs. Conclusion(s): iNO preserves structure and function of airway smooth muscle and enhances alveolar development in preterm lambs with chronic lung disease.","group":"g1","id":"d180a820-57e5-4aae-8ee3-e0213d155a0e","_showDetails":false},"c8dfd1b2-78c9-4921-8fc3-a37e61788cb0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"41691639","title":"Dose response to rhCC10-augmented surfactant therapy in a lamb model of infant respiratory distress syndrome: Physiological, inflammatory, and kinetic profiles","authors":["Shashikant B.N.","Miller T.L.","Welch R.W.","Pilon A.L.","Shaffer T.H.","Wolfson M.M."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","article","artificial ventilation","cytokine production","enzyme assay","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","inflammation","lamb","lung dysplasia","lung function","lung mechanics","*neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","*neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/th [Therapy]","newborn","nonhuman","prematurity","priority journal","treatment outcome","*beractant/ad [Drug Administration]","*beractant/cb [Drug Combination]","*beractant/cm [Drug Comparison]","*beractant/do [Drug Dose]","*beractant/dt [Drug Therapy]","*beractant/tr [Intratracheal Drug Administration]","*Clara cell protein","cytokine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound]","myeloperoxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]","unclassified drug","claragen","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/ad [Drug Administration]","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/cb [Drug Combination]","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/cm [Drug Comparison]","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/cr [Drug Concentration]","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/do [Drug Dose]","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/dt [Drug Therapy]","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/tr [Intratracheal Drug Administration]","*recombinant human Clara cell secretory protein/pk [Pharmacokinetics]"],"journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","language":"English","volume":"99","number":"6","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"8750-7587","address":"M.M.

Clara cell secretory protein (CC10), deficient in preterm infants, prevents SF degradation and has anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, intratracheal recombinant human (rh) CC10 (Claragen)-augmented SF (Survanta, Ross) therapy was examined in a premature lamb model of RDS with respect to inflammation and kinetic dose-response profiles. Preterm lambs (n = 24; gestational age: 126 +/- 3 days) were delivered via cesarean section, sedated, ventilated, and randomized into groups: 100 mg/kg SF, 100 mg/kg SF followed by 0.5 mg/kg rhCC10, 100 mg/kg SF followed by 1.5 mg/kg rhCC10, and 100 mg/kg SF followed by 5.0 mg/kg rhCC10. Arterial blood chemistry and lung mechanics were monitored; lungs were lavaged and snap-frozen after 4 h. TNF-alpha, IL-8 in plasma; TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, myeloperoxidase in lung; and rhCC10 in plasma, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung were analyzed. Improvement in compliance, peak inspiratory pressure, and ventilatory efficiency index were greatest (P < 0.05) with SF + 5.0 mg/kg rhCC10. Plasma, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung [rhCC10] (where brackets denote concentration) increased (P < 0.01) with dose. Plasma [IL-8] was lower (P < 0.05) with rhCC10 than SF alone. Treatment with at least 1.5 mg/kg rhCC10 resulted in lower (P < 0.05) lung [TNF-alpha], [IL-8], and [myeloperoxidase]; SF + 1.5 mg/kg rhCC10 group had lower (P < 0.05) lung [IL-6], compared with all other groups. Compared with SF alone, SF augmented with at least 1.5 mg/kg rhCC10 decreased RDS-induced lung and systemic inflammation. Given that inflammation may lead to functional compromise, these data suggest that early intervention with rhCC10 may enhance SF therapy and warrant longer duration studies to determine its role to decrease long-term complications of ventilator management.

Extremely premature infants exposed to hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation often develop lung inflammation and injury. We hypothesized that an imbalance between MMPs and their tissue inhibitors plays a key role. Our hypothesis was tested to: 1) examine the ontogeny of lung MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs); and 2) determine the effects of hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation on lung MMPs and TIMPs in premature newborn baboons developing chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia (CLD/BPD). Lung specimens were obtained from five groups of gestational controls (GCs) sacrificed at 125, 140, 160, 175, and 185 (term) days of gestation, one fetal baboon model of CLD/BPD delivered at 125 days, and two at 140 days of gestation. Paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were examined for pathological changes, and frozen lung specimens were analyzed for MMPs-1, -2, -8, and -9; TIMPs-1 and-2; and messenger RNA expression of type I collagen. In GCs, MMP-1 and -9 were elevated in the last trimester, whereas MMP-2 and -8 levels were decreased. Significant changes in lung architecture were noted in the BPD models. MMP-1 was increased in the 125-day model, but decreased in both 140-day models. MMP-8 and collagen mRNA levels were decreased, while MMP-9 and MMP-9 to TIMP-1 ratios were increased in all BPD models.

Study design: At delivery, we obtained biological specimens including umbilical cord venous blood for plasma interleukin-6 levels, as well as placental histology and bacteriology. Among other neonatal outcomes, we collected prospective information on BPD. Result(s): Of 141 newborns in the study, 16 had BPD; 79% of these had antecedent FIRS, 27% of those without FIRS had BPD. By multivariable regression, only very low birth weight (adjusted [adj] odds ratio [OR] 32.0, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 5.0 to positive infinity) and FIRS (adj OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 42.3) remained significant risk factors. Escherichia coli, perhaps due to its pyogenic nature (strongly elicits inflammatory responses), may have had a special relationship with BPD. Conclusion(s): In our data, FIRS and neonatal BPD are highly associated. It is possible that certain pyogenic bacteria in the chorioamnion space may be implicated more often than others. Condensation: Neonates having Fetal Inflammatory Response Syndrome at delivery may later develop BPD. Pyogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, may be implicated more frequently.

The soluble form of ST2 (sST2), interleukin-33 (IL-33), and soluble form of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) have attracted increasing attention as biomarkers for different diseases. The aim of the current study was to assess the predictive value of plasma sST2, IL-33, and suPAR levels in patients with risk of BPD development., METHODS: A total of 38 babies were studied prospectively on delivery to the neonatal intensive care unit. Serum levels of IL-33, sST2, and suPAR were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum samples were collected from umbilical cord (at the time of delivery, termed CB) and peripheral blood (on day 14, termed PB)., RESULTS: Levels of suPAR (PB-suPAR) and sST2 (PB-sST2) in the peripheral blood of the BPD group were significantly higher than the corresponding levels in the non-BPD group (P < 0.001, P = 0.028, respectively. There was a statistically significant correlation between PB-suPAR levels and the severity of BPD (P < 0.001)) when the suPAR results were analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic curve., CONCLUSION: PB-suPAR and PB-sST2 levels are sensitive and specific independent predictive biomarkers in preterm babies with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"75cb5c57-e226-4af8-a272-5f64b81a15ea","_showDetails":true},"07719301-4e4f-4d68-9194-744dfd700cb7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"40207736","title":"Antibiotic therapy reduces nitrosative stress and programmed cell death in the rabbit foetal lung","authors":["Gras-Le Guen C.","Jarry A.","Vallette G.","Toquet C.","Colombeix C.","Laoisse C.L.","Potel G.","Roze J.C.","Bugnon D.","Debillon T."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","antibiotic therapy","apoptosis","article","down regulation","enzyme activity","epithelium cell","Escherichia coli","fetus","fetus lung","histology","immunocompetent cell","immunohistochemistry","inflammation","inoculation","intrauterine infection/dt [Drug Therapy]","intrauterine infection/et [Etiology]","lung dysplasia","lung infection/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung infection/et [Etiology]","*lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung injury/et [Etiology]","*lung injury/pc [Prevention]","maternal disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","maternal disease/et [Etiology]","nick end labeling","nonhuman","oxidative stress","priority journal","protein expression","staining","3 nitrotyrosine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*ceftriaxone/cb [Drug Combination]","*ceftriaxone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*ceftriaxone/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","*ceftriaxone/pd [Pharmacology]","*gentamicin/cb [Drug Combination]","*gentamicin/dt [Drug Therapy]","*gentamicin/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","*gentamicin/pd [Pharmacology]","inducible nitric oxide synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","nitric oxide/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"25","number":"1","publisher":"European Respiratory Society (4 Ave Sainte-Luce, Lausanne CH-1003, Switzerland)","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"C.

The aim of this study was: 1) to characterise the early inflammatory response elicited in infected foetal lungs, in terms of nitric oxide-derived oxidative stress and programmed cell death; and 2) to investigate the effects of antibiotic therapy on these parameters. A previously described rabbit experimental model of materno-foetal infection was used. Animals were divided into three groups: controls; Escherichia coli infected (12 h); and E. Coli infected (12 h) and treated (24 h gentamicin+ceftriaxone). Foetal lungs were examined in terms of histology, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, immunohistochemical detection of 3-nitrotyrosine, and detection of apoptotic cells by the TUNEL assay and Hoechst staining. In the infected group, a moderate inflammatory response was observed, associated with a significant increase in inducible NOS activity, the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine residues in epithelial and immune cells, the down-regulation of constitutive NOS activity and clusters of apoptotic cells, as compared with the control group. Early antibiotic therapy, initiated at 12 h post-inoculation, elicited a significant decrease in the infection-induced nitrosative stress. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and of apoptotic cells were decreased in the infected-and-treated group compared with the infected group, mainly by the re-expression of constitutive NOS and of the basal level of inducible NOS. Altogether, these findings indicate that early antibiotic therapy can curb the inflammatory reaction and help avert antenatal lung injury, which is known to be involved in the onset of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Appropriately designed studies are required to determine the role of newer ventilation modes and whether forms of respiratory support avoiding intubation are less injurious to the lungs. Research should also focus on infants with other respiratory disorders, particularly BPD.

Appropriate intrauterine anatomic development of lung structures, along with cellular differentiation and biochemical maturation is critical for adequate physiologic function at birth. Lung morphogenesis can be divided into five distinct chronologic stages and the last alveolar phase extends to a great degree into the postnatal period. Most of approximately 300 x 10 6 alveoli in adult human lungs are formed by about 18 months of gestational age. The process of alveolarization includes the branching of the respiratory acinus and the development of a dense capillary network which must be in concert with the differentiation of the alveolar epithelium and the eruption of secondary septa. This process is responsive to several physiologic stimuli including nutritional status and oxygenation. There is also evidence that many regulatory factors can influence the formation of alveoli in the developing lung either positively (some growth factors, retinoic acid, estrogen, thyroid hormone) or negatively (glucocorticoids, oxygen, inflammation). Infants born during the late canalicular or saccular stage can survive because gas exchange is possible. These infants generally suffer severe complications related to decreased levels of pulmonary surfactant which cause hyaline membrane disease. Despite the administration of exogenous surfactant, 15-30% of survivors develop a prolonged course of ventilatory failure because of the lung damage that results in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It is a complex pulmonary disorder characterized by lung inflammation and injury leading to abnormal repair and decreased alveolarization. As we still do not fully understand the processes that regulate the formation of new alveoli, there are still no clinically proven therapies that can be used to increase the formation of alveoli in infants with chronic lung disease. This remains a major goal in pulmonary biology.","group":"g1","id":"a341826c-853a-42ae-a016-bae7f4a24e3e","_showDetails":false},"35f2f330-9ea9-4aa8-b2ef-cba4d962e1ff":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"43076571","title":"Recruited inflammatory cells mediate endotoxin-induced lung maturation in preterm fetal lambs","authors":["Kallapur S.G.","Moss T.J.M.","Ikegami M.","Jasman R.L.","Newnham J.P.","Jobe A.H."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal tissue","article","cell count","controlled study","cytokine release","delivery","*fetus lung maturation","gestational age","*inflammatory cell","lung lavage","lung parenchyma","lung volume","measurement","nonhuman","pneumonia","*prematurity","pressure volume curve","priority journal","quantitative analysis","scoring system","antibody","CD18 antigen","*endotoxin","inducible nitric oxide synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 1","phosphatidylcholine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","RNA","surfactant protein A/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"172","number":"10","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.G.

In preterm lambs, intraamniotic endotoxin and interleukin 1 (IL-1) induce lung inflammation followed by lung maturation. Objective(s): To test if inflammatory cells are required to mediate induced lung maturation. Method(s): Lung inflammation was induced by intraamniotic injection of endotoxin or IL-1. Inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung was inhibited by an anti-CD18 blocking antibody given intramuscularly to the fetus. Preterm lambs were delivered at 124-d gestation (term = 150 d) 2 or 7 d after exposure to endotoxin/IL-1 or endotoxin/IL-1 + anti-CD18 antibody. Measurements: Lung inflammation was measured by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell count, inflammatory scoring of lung parenchyma, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Lung maturation was quantitated by surfactant protein mRNA expression, saturated phosphatidylcholine pool size, and pressure-volume curves. Main Result(s): Inhibition of CD18 significantly reduced endotoxin-induced but not IL-1-induced fetal lung inflammatory cell recruitment and activation as well as expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Compared with control lungs, both endotoxin and IL-1 induced lung maturation. Anti-CD18 antibody administration inhibited only endotoxin-induced but not IL-1-induced increases in surfactant protein mRNA and surfactant saturated phosphatidylcholine. Exposure to anti-CD18 antibody moderated endotoxin-induced increases in lung volumes but had no effect on IL-1-induced increases in lung volumes. Conclusion(s): (1) Endotoxin- but not IL-1-induced inflammatory cell recruitment in the preterm fetal lamb lung is CD18 dependent; (2) recruited inflammatory cells mediate some aspects of fetal lung maturation.","group":"g1","id":"35f2f330-9ea9-4aa8-b2ef-cba4d962e1ff","_showDetails":false},"996b54fb-ea9d-483a-9e71-3a6986216a42":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"41548974","title":"Exposure to prolonged hyperoxia decreases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in lungs of neonatal rats","authors":["Liu B.","Liu X.-Y.","Li J.","Wang W.","Wei K.-L."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["ambient air","angiogenesis","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","article","cell differentiation","cell proliferation","controlled study","correlation analysis","endothelium cell","exposure","fibrosing alveolitis","*hyperoxia","immunohistochemistry","in situ hybridization","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","lung injury","newborn","nonhuman","perinatal period","protein expression","rat","rat strain","regulatory mechanism","staining","tissue section","eosin","hematoxylin","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics","language":"Chinese","volume":"7","number":"5","publisher":"Xiangya Hospital of CSU (141 Xiangya Road, Changsha Hunan 410008, China)","isbn":"1008-8830","address":"B.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell mitogen that can regulate proliferation, differentiation and angiogensis of endothelial cells in neonatal lungs. This paper aimed to study the changes of VEGF expression in the lungs of neonatal rats exposed to prolonged hyperoxia so as to explore the mechanism of BPD. Method(s): Wistar rat pups were randomized to hyperoxia (Hyperoxia group, FiO2 =0.95) or room air exposure (Normoxia group) (both n = 30) from postnatal 12 hrs. The rats were sacrificed at postnatal days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 21 (5 rats each time point) and their lungs were collected. The lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation. Expressions of VEGF protein and mRNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Results were expressed as gray values. The higher the value, the lower the expressions. Result(s): After being exposed to hyperoxia for 7 days, lung tissues developed interstitial fibrosis, abnormal vascular constitution and a decreased alveolar septation. These changes became more obvious with the time of prolonged hyperoxia exposure. Expressions of VEGF protein at 3 and 7 days of exposure in the Hyperoxia group decreased significantly as compared with the Normoxia group (81.9 +/- 0.8 vs 80.8 +/- 1.0,82.8 +/- 1.2 vs 79. 2 +/- 1.6, P < 0.01). The expression of VEGF mRNA in the Hyperoxia group was also lower at 3 and 7 days of exposure (89.5 +/- 1.1 vs 88.0 +/- 1.0, 91.1 +/- 1.5 vs 87.7 +/- 1.7, P < 0. 001 ). Both VEGF protein and mRNA levels gradually decreased with the hyperoxia exposure time and their levels could not be detected at 14 and 21 days of hyperoxia exposure. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia exposure inhibited the expression of lung VEGF in neonatal rats, which may be the underlying mechanism of hyperoxia-induced BPD.","group":"g1","id":"996b54fb-ea9d-483a-9e71-3a6986216a42","_showDetails":true},"e849fda3-b872-495e-973c-fa0b3cc584ce":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"43881510","title":"Outcomes of premature and very-low-birth-weight infants from 1991 to 2002","authors":["Sbeiti N.","Ziedeh F.","Ramadan M.","Lababidi H.","Rajab M."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["Apgar score","article","birth weight","brain hemorrhage","controlled study","delivery","female","gestation period","human","infant","infection","intrauterine growth retardation","lung dysplasia","major clinical study","male","mother fetus relationship","necrotizing enterocolitis","newborn morbidity","newborn mortality","outcome assessment","patent ductus arteriosus","premature labor","*prematurity/dt [Drug Therapy]","survival","*very low birth weight/dt [Drug Therapy]","steroid/dt [Drug Therapy]","surfactant/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Journal Medical Libanais","language":"English","volume":"53","number":"3","publisher":"Lebanese Order of Physicians in Lebanon (P.O.

It became of great importance to compare outcome data of individual hospitals to international numbers, taking into consideration the dramatic changes in medical care for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants and their mothers that occurred during the past decade worldwide. OBJECTIVE(S): Evaluate the neonatal outcome (mortality and morbidity) of VLBW and premature infants born at Makassed General Hospital (MGH) and admitted to ICN and compare it to the international rates. METHOD(S): Detailed data were collected for all VLBW (< 1500 g) and/or premature infants (< 30 weeks) born at MGH and admitted to ICN from Jan 1, 1991, through May 31, 2002, retrospectively. Three study periods were defined according to the emergence of new treatment modalities, namely antenatal steroid use and surfactant treatment Outcome measures were the survival rates at day 28 and on discharge. Secondary outcomes were morbidity rates for patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and nosocomial and maternofetal infections. We studied the effect of antenatal steroids, surfactant, and new respiratory support modes as well as the effect of birth weight, etiology of pre-term labor, mode of delivery, Apgar score, gender, multiple gestation, and intrauterine growth retardation on both survival and morbidity. RESULT(S): There were 207 VLBW (<= 1500 g) and/or pre-mature (<= 30 W) infants. Four infants were excluded because of major congenital anomalies. A total 203 were enrolled in the study. The mean birth weight was 1195 +/- 274 grants. There were 99 males and 104 females. The overall survival rate was 69.5%. There was significant improvement in survival over the study periods. Mortality decreased from 50.0% to 26.4% at the end of the study (p < 0.001). Antenatal steroids had a significant positive effect on survival. The antenatal steroid use increased during the study period from 11% to 83%. Surfactant had a positive effect on those who experienced early respiratory distress with survival rate of 69% for those not prepared with antenatal steroids compared to universal rate of 75%. Birth weight, gestational age and Apgar score were positively related to survival rate (p < 0.001). There was no proven relation between delivery mode, multiple gestation, gender, intrauterine growth retardation and survival. Infection was the major cause of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION(S): A considerable reduction in mortality was observed at our institution over the 12 years study period. Changes in survival appear to reflect newer therapies namely antenatal steroid use and surfactant treatment.","group":"g1","id":"e849fda3-b872-495e-973c-fa0b3cc584ce","_showDetails":false},"48a6bd54-e9cc-40ef-a248-342800eb6af0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"43046315","title":"Association study of gene polymorphism and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [16]","authors":["Kazzi S.N.J.","Kim U.O.","Quasney M.W.","Buhimschi I."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["birth weight","child","disease severity","gene linkage disequilibrium","*genetic polymorphism","gestational age","heredity","human","letter","*lung dysplasia","lung hemorrhage","patent ductus arteriosus","pneumonia","premature fetus membrane rupture","priority journal","respiratory distress syndrome","sepsis","statistical analysis","survival","very low birth weight","tumor necrosis factor alpha"],"journal":"Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"115","number":"1","publisher":"American Academy of Pediatrics (141 Northwest Point Blvd, P.O.

Adding MVP to the lipid moiety of TPN prevents lipid peroxidation and vitamin loss. The aim of the study was to compare modes of delivery of MVP on lung procollagen mRNA and alveolar counts. Three-day-old guinea pig pups were infused continuously with one of three intravenous solutions: 1) control = dextrose; 2) AA + MVP = MVP given with the dextrose + amino-acid moiety, in a \"piggyback\" setup with a lipid emulsion mixed close to the infusion site; and 3) LIP + MVP = same as AA + MVP except that MVP is given with the lipid emulsion. After 4 days, lungs were prepared for alveolar count (intercept technique) and for quantification of the procollagen/beta-actin mRNA ratio (initial step of fibrosis). Data were compared by ANOVA. The procollagen mRNA was lower (P < 0.05) in animals receiving LIP + MVP than those with AA + MVP. But the two modes of admixture of MVP had the same effect on the alveolar counts, which were lower (P < 0.01) than controls. The mode of delivery of TPN affects lung remodeling. Although LIP + MVP protects against the initiation of lung fibrosis, the absence of a beneficial effect on alveolar counts suggests that these features of lung remodeling are not caused by a unique component of TPN. Specific roles of peroxides, components of MVP, and light exposure on lung remodeling need to be explored before LIP + MVP can be recommended as an alternative mode of parenteral vitamin delivery. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","group":"g1","id":"46a49e72-6cb8-41a2-ba5f-c30134faa20e","_showDetails":false},"f30882dc-1e39-44b5-92bf-be40aa7ce599":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"40863552","title":"TGF-alpha perturbs surfactant homeostasis in vivo","authors":["Ikegami M.","Le Cras T.D.","Hardie W.D.","Stahlman M.T.","Whitsett J.A.","Korfhagen T.R."],"date":"2005//","keywords":["adult respiratory distress syndrome","animal cell","animal tissue","article","cell culture","controlled study","homeostasis","lung dysplasia","lung lavage","mouse","nonhuman","priority journal","protein analysis","protein expression","protein function","protein metabolism","respiratory epithelium","signal transduction","surface tension","epidermal growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","phosphatidylcholine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","phospholipid/ec [Endogenous Compound]","protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*surfactant","*transforming growth factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"289","number":"1 33-1","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"M.

Secretion of saturated phosphatidylcholine was decreased 40-60% by expression of TGF-alpha. Although SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C mRNA levels were unchanged by expression of TGF-alpha, SP-A and SP-B content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was decreased. The minimum surface tension of surfactant isolated from the transgenic mice was significantly increased. Incubation of cultured normal mice type II cells with TGF-alpha in vitro did not change secretion of surfactant phosphatidylcholine and SP-B, indicating that TGF-alpha does not directly influence surfactant secretion. Expression of a dominant negative (mutant) EGF receptor in the respiratory epithelium blocked the TGF-alpha-induced changes in lung morphology and surfactant secretion, indicating that EGF receptor signaling in distal epithelial cells was required for TGF-alpha effects on surfactant homeostasis. Because many epithelial cells were embedded in fibrotic lesions caused by TGF-alpha, changes in surfactant homeostasis may at least in part be influenced by tissue remodeling that results in decreased surfactant secretion. The number of nonembedded type II cells was decreased 30% when TGF-alpha was expressed during development and was increased threefold by TGF-alpha expression in adulthood, suggesting possible alteration of type II cells on surfactant metabolism in the adult lung. Abnormalities in surfactant function and decreased surfactant level in the airways may contribute to the pathophysiology induced by TGF-alpha in both the developing and adult lung.

The LINCR protein has structural similarities to Drosophila Neuralized, which regulates the developmentally important Notch signaling pathway. Endotoxemia-induced LINCR expression in vivo was localized by in situ hybridization to alveolar epithelial type II cells, and shown to be induced by LPS and inflammatory cytokines in the T7 alveolar epithelial type II cell line. RING domain-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of LINCR was demonstrated using full-length FLAG-LINCR or a deletion mutant lacking the RING domain expressed in 293T cells, and using a GST-LINCR RING fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. LINCR preferentially interacted with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH6 and preferentially generated polyubiquitin chains linked via non-canonical lysine residues.

The Gene Ontology (GO), a valuable and widely-used resource for characterizing gene function, offers perhaps the most suitable functional annotation system for this purpose. However, due in part to the difficulty of studying molecular genetic effects in humans, even the current collection of comprehensive GO annotations for human genes and gene products often lacks adequate developmental context for scientists wishing to study gene function in the human fetus., DESCRIPTION: The Developmental FunctionaL Annotation at Tufts (DFLAT) project aims to improve the quality of analyses of fetal gene expression and regulation by curating human fetal gene functions using both manual and semi-automated GO procedures. Eligible annotations are then contributed to the GO database and included in GO releases of human data. DFLAT has produced a considerable body of functional annotation that we demonstrate provides valuable information about developmental genomics. A collection of gene sets (genes implicated in the same function or biological process), made by combining existing GO annotations with the 13,344 new DFLAT annotations, is available for use in novel analyses. Gene set analyses of expression in several data sets, including amniotic fluid RNA from fetuses with trisomies 21 and 18, umbilical cord blood, and blood from newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, were conducted both with and without the DFLAT annotation., CONCLUSIONS: Functional analysis of expression data using the DFLAT annotation increases the number of implicated gene sets, reflecting the DFLAT's improved representation of current knowledge. Blinded literature review supports the validity of newly significant findings obtained with the DFLAT annotations. Newly implicated significant gene sets also suggest specific hypotheses for future research. Overall, the DFLAT project contributes new functional annotation and gene sets likely to enhance our ability to interpret genomic studies of human fetal and neonatal development.","group":"g1","id":"4ee0c64d-72a1-42aa-917d-912e2d198c16","_showDetails":false},"65158e75-7533-426d-8971-695239469ebd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"38233617","title":"Thymulin evokes IL-6-C/EBPbeta regenerative repair and TNF-alpha silencing during endotoxin exposure in fetal lung explants","authors":["Land S.C.","Darakhshan F."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["article","chorioamnionitis","controlled study","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","fetus","fetus lung","human","human cell","immunohistochemistry","inflammation","lung alveolus epithelium","*lung disease/et [Etiology]","*lung dysplasia","priority journal","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","antisense oligonucleotide","complementary DNA","*cytokine","Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide","fibroblast growth factor","*interleukin 6","mitogen activated protein kinase","RNA","*thymulin","*tumor necrosis factor alpha","zinc ion"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"286","number":"3 30-3","publisher":"American Physiological Society","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"S.C.

To manipulate this relationship, we examined the effect of the thymic immunomodulator thymulin on fetal lung mesenchyme-epithelial differentiation during exposure to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Gestation day 14 fetal rat lung explants were cultured for 96 h at fetal (23 mmHg) or ambient (142 mmHg) Po2. Airway surface complexity (ASC, perimeter/ area2) was greater at fetal vs. ambient Po2; however, exposure to 0.1-50 mug/ml LPS significantly raised ASC at 2 mug/ml in ambient Po2 explants. LPS (50 mug/ml) depressed ASC in both conditions to untreated ambient Po 2 control values without changes in necrosis or apoptosis. To manipulate LPS-evoked TNF-alpha and IL-6 release, we exposed explants and A549 cells to combinations of 50 mug/ml LPS, 10 muM ZnCl2, and 0.1-1,000 ng/ml thymulin at either Po2. Thymulin+Zn2+ suppressed and potentiated LPS-evoked TNF-alpha and IL-6 release, yielding an IC50(TNF-alpha) of 0.5 +/- 0.01 ng/ml and EC 50(IL-6) of 1.4 +/- 0.3 ng/ml in A549 cells. This was accompanied by activation of the p38 MAPK-MAPKAP-K2 pathway with sustained expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 transcripts at ambient Po2. LPS+thymulin+Zn2+-treated explants showed proliferation of CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-beta EBPbeta) and fibroblast growth factor-9 immunoreactive mesenchyme, which was abolished by IL-6 antisense oligonucleotides. The posttranscriptional suppression of immunogenic TNF-alpha synthesis coupled with raised IL-6 and C/EBPbeta-dependent mesenchyme proliferation suggests a role for bioactive thymulin in regulating regenerative repair in the fetal lung.","group":"g1","id":"65158e75-7533-426d-8971-695239469ebd","_showDetails":false},"60e2a04b-00ee-4258-97c5-a6d6f06fbf48":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"38971415","title":"A link between lung androgen metabolism and the emergence of mature epithelial type II cells","authors":["Provost P.R.","Simard M.","Tremblay Y."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["*androgen metabolism","androgen synthesis","animal experiment","article","cell maturation","controlled study","correlation analysis","*epithelium cell","female","fetus lung maturation","gene expression","male","mouse","nonhuman","nucleotide sequence","priority journal","receptor gene","upregulation","androgen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","testosterone 17beta dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"170","number":"3","publisher":"American Lung Association","isbn":"0003-0805","address":"Y.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the genes encoding for the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) type 5 (androstenedione -> testosterone) and type 2 (the opposite reaction) are expressed in human epithelial type II (PTII)-like A549 cells and in human lung fibroblasts, respectively. Here, we aim to explain the physiological relevance of androgen synthesis by PTII cells. We showed that both 17beta-HSD type 2 and type 5 genes are upregulated in correlation with the emergence of mature PTII cells in both male and female developing lungs of the mouse. In contrast, the androgen receptor gene is expressed equally in both sexes with no temporal regulation. We conclude that the expression profile of the 17beta-HSD type 5 gene does not explain the presence of higher levels of androgen in the male fetal lung, but that androgen synthesis must be a normal feature of mature PTII cells for both sexes. The production of androgens after the emergence of mature PTII cells should negatively regulate PTII cell maturation and, thus, a role for androgens in cell reprogramming is suggested.","group":"g1","id":"60e2a04b-00ee-4258-97c5-a6d6f06fbf48","_showDetails":true},"e307a920-9f30-418f-92f8-957bda0b2aeb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"38125487","title":"Neutrophil and monocyte adhesion molecules in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and effects of corticosteroids","authors":["Ballabh P.","Simm M.","Kumari J.","Krauss A.N.","Jain A.","Califano C.","Lesser M.L.","Cunningham-Rundles S."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["arterial blood","article","drug effect","female","flow cytometry","human","infant","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","major clinical study","male","monocyte","neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","neutrophil","newborn","oxygen therapy","prediction","priority journal","protein expression","very low birth weight","CD11b antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","CD18 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*cell adhesion molecule/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*corticosteroid/dt [Drug Therapy]","*corticosteroid/pd [Pharmacology]","dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","PADGEM protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition","language":"English","volume":"89","number":"1","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"1359-2998","address":"P.

Lung-specific expression of TGF-alpha in transgenic mice was driven with the human surfactant protein (SP)-C promoter. Pulmonary arteriograms and arterial counts show that pulmonary vascular development was severely disrupted in TGF-alpha mice. TGF-alpha mice developed severe pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling characterized by abnormally extensive muscularization of small pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary vascular development was significantly improved and pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling were prevented in bitransgenic mice expressing both TGF-alpha and a dominant-negative mutant EGF receptor under the control of the SP-C promoter. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), an important angiogenic factor produced by the distal epithelium, was decreased in the lungs of TGF-alpha adults and in the lungs of infant TGF-alpha mice before detectable abnormalities in pulmonary vascular development. Hence, overexpression of TGF-alpha caused severe pulmonary vascular disease, which was mediated through EGFR signaling in distal epithelial cells. Reductions in VEGF may contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular disease in TGF-alpha mice.","group":"g1","id":"644bee1e-4ca8-4bac-8cf4-a965fbc6bdc9","_showDetails":true},"fc3a6e0d-3c4c-417b-9b08-fcd5d8ffe149":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"37158845","title":"Induced p21Cip1 in premature baboons with CLD: Implications for alveolar hypoplasia","authors":["O'Reilly M.A.","Watkins R.H.","Staversky R.J.","Maniscalco W.M."],"date":"2003//","keywords":["animal tissue","article","cell proliferation","*chronic lung disease","disease course","lung alveolus epithelium","lung development","lung dysplasia","*lung hypoplasia","lung ventilation","mesenchyme","newborn","nonhuman","oxygen therapy","*prematurity","priority journal","protein expression","Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*oxygen","*protein p21/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*surfactant protein B/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"285","number":"4 29-4","publisher":"American Physiological Society","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"M.A. O'Reilly, Dept. of Pediatrics, Box 850, Univ. of Rochester, 601 Elmwood Ave., Rochester, NY 14642, United States.

Because the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 inhibits proliferation of oxygen-exposed cells, its expression was investigated in premature baboons delivered at 125 days (67% of term) and treated with oxygen and ventilation pro re nata (PRN) for 2, 6, 14, and 21 days. Approximately 5% of all cells expressed p21 during normal lung development of which <1% of these cells were pro-surfactant protein (SP)-B-positive epithelial cells. The percentage of cells expressing p21 increased threefold in all PRN-treated animals, but different cell populations expressed it during disease progression. Between 2 and 6 days of treatment, p21 was detected in 30-40% of pro-SP-B cells. In contrast, only 12% of pro-SP-B cells expressed p21 by 14 and 21 days of treatment, by which time p21 was also detected in mesenchymal cells. Even though increased epithelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation occurs during disease progression, those cells expressing p21 did not also express the proliferative marker Ki67. Thus two populations of epithelial and mesenchymal cells can be identified that are either expressing Ki67 and proliferating or expressing p21 and not proliferating. These data suggest that p21 may play a role in disorganized proliferation and alveolar hypoplasia seen in newborn chronic lung disease.","group":"g1","id":"fc3a6e0d-3c4c-417b-9b08-fcd5d8ffe149","_showDetails":true},"cf2bd0c2-f20c-4604-9edc-233a2fa396fd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"37363367","title":"Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor-1 and Neonatal Compensatory Lung Growth after Exposure to 95% Oxygen","authors":["Jankov R.P.","Luo X.","Campbell A.","Belcastro R.","Cabacungan J.","Johnstone L.","Frndova H.","Lye S.J.","Tanswell A.K."],"date":"2003//","keywords":["air","animal model","animal tissue","article","controlled study","DNA synthesis","growth","immunohistochemistry","*lung development","lung dysplasia","newborn","nonhuman","Northern blotting","oxygen toxicity","priority journal","protein expression","rat","Western blotting","basic fibroblast growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*fibroblast growth factor receptor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","ligand/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*oxygen","reactive oxygen metabolite/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"167","number":"11","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"A.K.

Intense IP-10 mRNA expression was detected by in situ hybridization in the bronchiolar and peribronchiolar areas and the vascular endothelium after IA endotoxin at all time points tested. MIG mRNA expression was detected initially focally in infiltrating neutrophils (15 hours after IA endotoxin) and later in the bronchiolar and peribronchiolar areas and vascular endothelium (1 day after IA endotoxin). In contrast to endotoxin, IA tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1alpha did not induce IP-10 or MIG mRNA in the lung. IA endotoxin also caused a modest induction of IP-10 and MIG mRNA in the jejunum, liver, and spleen. The IP-10 and MIG receptor CXCR3 was detected in the bronchiolar epithelium of preterm lambs by immunostaining. IP-10 and MIG are potent angiostatic chemokines that may contribute to lung injury and altered pulmonary vascular development in the preterm exposed to chorioamnionitis.","group":"g1","id":"72d14aab-2bb4-4189-87e3-2e1c870f1bea","_showDetails":false},"6a182880-4788-416d-bdcc-927e603bb31d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"39391038","title":"Noninvasive delivery of small inhibitory RNA and other reagents to pulmonary alveoli in mice","authors":["Massaro D.","Massaro G.D.","Clerch L.B."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal tissue","article","brain cortex","cerebellum","controlled study","*drug delivery system","drug effect","emphysema","heart","kidney","liver","lung","*lung alveolus","lung dysplasia","male","mouse","nonhuman","priority journal","protein expression","testis","*calfactant/ad [Drug Administration]","*calfactant/pr [Pharmaceutics]","*calfactant/pd [Pharmacology]","cellular retinol binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*elastase/ad [Drug Administration]","*elastase/na [Intranasal Drug Administration]","*elastase/pr [Pharmaceutics]","*elastase/pd [Pharmacology]","*glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase/ad [Drug Administration]","*glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase/na [Intranasal Drug Administration]","*glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase/pr [Pharmaceutics]","*glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase/pd [Pharmacology]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*retinoic acid/ad [Drug Administration]","*retinoic acid/na [Intranasal Drug Administration]","*retinoic acid/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration]","*retinoic acid/pr [Pharmaceutics]","*retinoic acid/pd [Pharmacology]","*small interfering RNA/ad [Drug Administration]","*small interfering RNA/na [Intranasal Drug Administration]","*small interfering RNA/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration]","*small interfering RNA/pr [Pharmaceutics]","*small interfering RNA/pd [Pharmacology]","*surfactant"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"287","number":"5 31-5","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"D.

As proof of principle, we took advantage of the spreading ability of pulmonary surface active material (InfaSurf), mixed it with elastase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) small inhibitory RNA (siRNA), or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and instilled microliter amounts of the mixture into the nose of lightly anesthetized mice. One instillation of elastase caused diffuse alveolar destruction (emphysema) demonstrating widespread alveolar delivery. A single nasal instillation of GAPDH siRNA, compared with scrambled GAPDH siRNA, lowered GAPDH protein in lung, heart, and kidney by ~50-70% 1 and 7 days later. To test the possibility of lung-specific delivery of a potentially therapeutic drug, we administered ATRA and monitored its effect on expression of cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP)-1 mRNA, whose translation product is a key molecule in retinoid metabolism. Given intranasally, ATRA elevated CRBP-1 mRNA 4.3-fold in a lung-specific manner. The same dose and dose schedule of ATRA given intraperitoneally increased CRBP-1 mRNA only ~1.8-fold in lung; intraperitoneally administered ATRA elevated expression of CRBP-1 mRNA 1.7-fold or more in brain cortex, cerebellum, and testes, thereby increasing the risk of untoward effects. This simple noninvasive technique allows regulation of specific proteins in the lung and lung-specific delivery of reagents of experimental and potentially therapeutic importance.","group":"g1","id":"6a182880-4788-416d-bdcc-927e603bb31d","_showDetails":true},"9759c35b-9ed1-498f-a9bc-d3084173d19d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"47248806","title":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome in a full-term newborn: Report of one case","authors":["Lin W.-J.","Hsu M.-L.","Fan H.-C.","Lin S.-P.","Cheng S.-N.","Yuh Y.-S."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["acute disease/di [Diagnosis]","acute disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","acute disease/th [Therapy]","article","artificial ventilation","blood gas analysis","case report","cesarean section","clinical feature","disease severity","elective surgery","endotracheal intubation","gestational age","human","laboratory test","lung infiltrate/di [Diagnosis]","male","newborn","*newborn disease/di [Diagnosis]","*newborn disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","*newborn disease/th [Therapy]","*respiratory distress syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","*respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","*respiratory distress syndrome/th [Therapy]","respiratory failure/di [Diagnosis]","respiratory failure/dt [Drug Therapy]","respiratory failure/th [Therapy]","thorax radiography","treatment outcome","dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/dt [Drug Therapy]","dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/tr [Intratracheal Drug Administration]","lung surfactant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","repeated drug dose"],"journal":"Clinical Neonatology","language":"English","volume":"11","number":"1","publisher":"Society of Neonatology of the Republic of China (23 Taichung Kang Road, sec 1, Taichung 403, Taiwan (Republic of China))","isbn":"1381-3390","address":"Y.-S.

The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) significantly increases the mortality and morbidity of this disease. beta-Catenin signaling plays an important role in tissue development and remodeling. Aberrant beta-catenin signaling is associated with clinical and experiment models of BPD. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of beta-catenin signaling is beneficial in promoting alveolar and vascular development and preventing PH in experimental BPD, we examined the effects of ICG001, a newly developed pharmacological inhibitor of beta-catenin, in preventing hyperoxia-induced BPD in neonatal rats. Newborn rat pups were randomized at postnatal day (P)2 to room air (RA) + DMSO (placebo), RA + ICG001, 90% FiO2 (O2) + DMSO, or O2 + ICG001. ICG001 (10 mg/kg) or DMSO was given by daily intraperitoneal injection for 14 days during continuous exposure to RA or hyperoxia. Primary human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were cultured in RA or hyperoxia (95% O2) in the presence of DMSO or ICG001 for 24 to 72 hours. Treatment with ICG001 significantly increased alveolarization and reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH during hyperoxia. Furthermore, administering ICG001 decreased PASMC proliferation and expression of extracellular matrix remodeling molecules in vitro under hyperoxia. Finally, these structural, cellular, and molecular effects of ICG001 were associated with down-regulation of multiple beta-catenin target genes. These data indicate that beta-catenin signaling mediates hyperoxia-induced alveolar impairment and PH in neonatal animals. Targeting beta-catenin may provide a novel strategy to alleviate BPD in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"d8836310-f192-41ed-99e8-8a5ffe06a6b0","_showDetails":true},"650fe003-722f-492c-bba7-7c0e8958b045":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"38787660","title":"VEGF causes pulmonary hemorrhage, hemosiderosis, and air space enlargement in neonatal mice","authors":["Le Cras T.D.","Spitzmiller R.E.","Albertine K.H.","Greenberg J.M.","Whitsett J.A.","Akeson A.L."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["animal model","animal tissue","article","capillary endothelium","chronic lung disease/et [Etiology]","controlled study","electron microscopy","endothelium cell","inflammation/et [Etiology]","lung capillary","lung development","lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*lung emphysema/et [Etiology]","lung function","*lung hemorrhage/et [Etiology]","*lung hemosiderosis/et [Etiology]","lung homogenate","lung lavage","macrophage","mouse","newborn","newborn mortality","nonhuman","postnatal development","priority journal","respiratory distress syndrome/et [Etiology]","sudden infant death syndrome/et [Etiology]","transgenic mouse","doxycycline","*hemosiderin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","surfactant protein B","*vasculotropin","chronic lung disease of infancy/et [Etiology]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"287","number":"1 31-1","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"T.D.

Increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines present in the amniotic fluid and the systemic fetal circulation seem to be important mediators in the early inflammatory response by recruiting and activating inflammatory cells and by inducing pathways of lung injury. As a consequence vascular cell adhesion molecules are upregulated and a marked infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages as well as an increased expression of interleukin-8 mRNA in the bronchoalveolar epithelium and in the interstitial tissue takes place. These antenatal events may prime the lungs such that various injurious factors in the postnatal period provoke an excessive inflammatory response: oxygen toxicity, mechanical ventilation, inappropriate resuscitation, pulmonary and systemic infections, persistent ductus arteriosus. Besides proinflammatory cytokines, toxic oxygen radicals, lipid mediators and potent proteases may be responsible for acute and chronic lung injury. In general, an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors can be considered as a hallmark of lung injury, and may considerably affect normal alveolarisation and pulmonary vascular development by inducing growth arrest of the immature lung. © 2004 Elsevier Science Ltd.","group":"g1","id":"2ccedada-0134-42a4-a3e5-a928d9a7c19c","_showDetails":true},"d2a4f97d-a6c7-48b4-9f50-306775a3732b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"39425304","title":"Thiol metabolism in preterm infants during the first week of life","authors":["Ahola T.","Levonen A.-L.","Fellman V.","Lapatto R."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["article","birth weight","controlled study","correlation analysis","enzyme activity","erythrocyte","female","glutathione metabolism","human","infant","major clinical study","male","newborn","oxidative stress","pathogenesis","*prematurity","priority journal","*protein metabolism","respiratory distress syndrome","sex difference","antioxidant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","cysteine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glutamate cysteine ligase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glutathione/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glutathione peroxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glutathione reductase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glutathione transferase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*thiol derivative/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation","language":"English","volume":"64","number":"7","publisher":"Informa Healthcare (69-77 Paul Street, London EC2A 4LQ, United Kingdom)","isbn":"0036-5513","address":"T.

The glutathione cycle is one of the most important intracellular antioxidant systems. The synthesis of glutathione may not be adequate in preterm neonates because of the low levels of cysteine available. The aim of this study was to evaluate cysteine and glutathione metabolism during the first week of life in preterm infants. Method(s): Plasma and erythrocyte thiol concentrations were measured in 78 preterm infants with a birthweight of 500-1500 g, and erythrocyte glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and glucose 6-phosphatedehydrogenase (G6PDH) in 26 infants with a birthweight of 1000-1500 g. Result(s): The mean (SD) plasma glutathione concentration increased from day 0 to day 1 (14.9 (7.1) vs. 27.7 (11.9) mumol/L, p < 0.001), and then decreased. The plasma cysteine concentration changed in the opposite direction (172 (59) vs. 129 (42) mumol/L, p < 0.01). In infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) the mean plasma glutathione concentration, but not cysteine, was lower on day 0 compared with infants without RDS (11.7 (5.2) vs. 21.4 (5.6) mumol/L, p < 0.01). Erythrocyte glutathione concentration decreased during the first week of life, whereas erythrocyte cysteine concentration increased significantly from day 3 to day 7 (p < 0.01). Erythrocyte cysteine and glutathione concentrations had a positive correlation. The GCL and GR activities did not change, but GST and G6PDH activities decreased during the first week (p < 0.01). GPx activity decreased until day 3 (p < 0.01) and was higher on day 0 and day 1 in infants with RDS. Conclusion(s): Very low birthweight infants have an initial increase in plasma glutathione and initial decrease in plasma cysteine level during the first week of life, and also a positive correlation between erythrocyte cysteine and glutathione levels.","group":"g1","id":"d2a4f97d-a6c7-48b4-9f50-306775a3732b","_showDetails":false},"b481202a-02bc-46ba-9d41-bfef0a02f9d8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"39421604","title":"Characterization of corticosteroid redosing in an in vitro cell line model","authors":["Vidaeff A.C.","Ramin S.M.","Gilstrap III L.C.","Alcorn J.L."],"date":"2004//","keywords":["concentration response","conference paper","controlled study","*dose time effect relation","drug dose reduction","gene expression","human","human cell","in vitro study","Kruskal Wallis test","lung adenocarcinoma","lung alveolus cell","nucleotide sequence","priority journal","rank sum test","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","corticosteroid/do [Drug Dose]","corticosteroid/pd [Pharmacology]","*dexamethasone/do [Drug Dose]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","surfactant protein B/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"4","publisher":"Mosby Inc.

We studied the effect of 48 hours' exposure to various concentrations of dexamethasone in a human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line (H-441). We measured the level of surfactant protein B (SP-B) mRNA by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR after initial dexamethasone exposure, and after redosing, 1 or 2 weeks later. Values are mean +/- SE for 5 experiments. Comparisons were made by Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test with significance set at P <. 05. Induction of SP-B mRNA was maximal within 48 hours of the initial dexamethasone exposure. Redosing with the same dexamethasone concentration resulted in levels more than double those initially observed. Redosing with dexamethasone concentration 10 times lower had an effect comparable to that of the initial, higher concentration. Our results suggest a residual effect of the initial exposure that potentiates redosing, allowing significant dose reductions. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Since inflammation is often detected at birth in the lungs of newborns who later develop CLD,2 it has been an attractive strategy to abrogate inflammation, but the arsenal is limited. Glucocorticoids have been widely used but are acknowledged to be potentially harmful to neurologic and somatic development, and are not recommended outside controlled trials.3 The number that benefit is comparable to the number harmed, according to meta-analysis.4 More specific blockade of harmful inflammation could overcome this obstacle.

To evaluate longitudinal change in arterial blood plasma levels of soluble adhesion molecules in infants of <30 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and to look for differences in these levels in neonates who subsequently developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) compared with those neonates who did not, and also to investigate the effect of dexamethasone treatment on levels of soluble adhesion molecules in plasma. Methods. We measured plasma concentrations of soluble L-selectin (sL-selectin), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on days 1,3,7,14,21, and 28 of life and before and 2 to 3 days after initiating a 6-day course of dexamethasone treatment. Infants with RDS were followed until discharge and were classified as non-BPD and either 1) BPD day 28 reflecting oxygen requirement on day 28 but not at 36 corrected weeks or 2) BPD 36 weeks reflecting oxygen requirement at 36 (corrected) weeks' gestation. The classification of presence or absence of BPD by oxygen requirement was supported by and was consistent with radiologic findings of BPD for all infants. The difference between BPD day 28 and BPD 36 weeks was supported by more extensive radiologic effects in the latter. Results. The arterial plasma level of sL-selectin in infants who had RDS and did not develop BPD was significantly decreased compared with term healthy infants, as was the level of sE-selectin. Compared with infants who had RDS and did not develop BPD, sL-selectin levels were even further decreased in infants who had RDS and did develop BPD both at birth and throughout the first 4 weeks of life (day 1 through day 28). Infants with BPD also showed increasing levels of sE-selectin during this period of time, whereas infants without BPD did not. Levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in infants without BPD were not different from infants with BPD initially but increased in infants with BPD compared with infants without BPD, significant on day 28 in both groups. Dexamethasone treatment increased concentration of sL-selectin and decreased concentration of sE-selectin. Conclusions. Low sL-selectin may be an early indicator of enhanced risk for BPD. Low levels of sL-selectin and increasing levels of sE-selectin may be risk factors for BPD. The effects of dexamethasone treatment include significant modulation of adhesion molecules.","group":"g1","id":"d5b88ae5-b8d0-4adf-a8b8-ba37827c197f","_showDetails":true},"c896b79a-2f4a-4407-8b4f-42c13f47c5f9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"36330702","title":"Chronic lung disease of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation: A population-based study","authors":["Lal M.K.","Manktelow B.N.","Draper E.S.","Field D.J."],"date":"2003//","keywords":["article","birth weight","*chronic lung disease/ep [Epidemiology]","*chronic lung disease/et [Etiology]","controlled study","fetus growth","gestational age","human","*intrauterine growth retardation/ep [Epidemiology]","macrosomia/ep [Epidemiology]","major clinical study","newborn","newborn care","newborn morbidity","newborn mortality","observation","population research","*prematurity/ep [Epidemiology]","priority journal","risk factor","small for date infant/ep [Epidemiology]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"111","number":"3","publisher":"American Academy of Pediatrics (141 Northwest Point Blvd, P.O.

To determine the risk of chronic lung disease (CLD) in small for gestational age (SGA) preterm infants in comparison to appropriately grown and large for gestational age (LGA) infants. Methods. Observational study derived from a geographically defined population (Trent Health Region, United Kingdom). All preterm infants of <=32 completed weeks' gestation born to Trent resident mothers admitted to neonatal units between 1995 and 1999 (inclusive) were included. Birth weight percentiles were created for the whole population, and infants were classified as SGA infants (if <10th percentile), appropriately grown (if between 25th and 75th percentiles - reference group), and LGA infants (if >=90th centile). Both mortality and CLD rates (using both 28 days' and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age [PMA] definitions) were determined for these groups of infants. Results. Four thousand fifty-one preterm infants <=32 weeks' gestation were identified. SGA infants showed higher mortality before 28 days' postnatal age and 36 weeks' PMA as compared with reference group infants (odds ratio [OR]: 2.01, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.49-2.72; and OR: 2.00, 95% Cl: 1.49-2.69), respectively. SGA infants showed a significantly greater risk of developing CLD, both at 28 days' and 36 weeks' PMA as compared with the reference group infants (OR: 1.34, 95% Cl: 1.03-1.74; and OR: 1.87, 95% Cl: 1.39-2.51), respectively. LGA infants showed a trend toward a reduced incidence of CLD in comparison to the reference group, which was statistically significant for the 36 weeks' definition (OR: 0.76-28 weeks, 95% Cl: 0.57-1.01; and OR: 0.55-36 weeks, 95% Cl: 0.37-0.81). Conclusions. Fetal growth seems to influence mortality in general and morbidity, attributable to CLD, in particular in preterm infants. SGA preterm infants are at higher risk of death before 28 days' and 36 weeks' PMA and CLD by both definitions. LGA infants show reduced risk of CLD.","group":"g1","id":"c896b79a-2f4a-4407-8b4f-42c13f47c5f9","_showDetails":true},"195219d3-7ef1-476e-a696-607ebaad788e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"37338943","title":"Surfactant Protein Profile of Pulmonary Surfactant in Premature Infants","authors":["Ballard P.L.","Merrill J.D.","Godinez R.I.","Godinez M.H.","Truog W.E.","Ballard R.A."],"date":"2003//","keywords":["article","aspiration","assisted ventilation","clinical article","endotracheal intubation","female","gestational age","human","in vitro study","lung alveolus surface tension","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung dysplasia/th [Therapy]","male","newborn","newborn intensive care","postnatal care","*prematurity","priority journal","protein analysis","protein function","sampling","trachea","artificial lung surfactant/cb [Drug Combination]","artificial lung surfactant/dt [Drug Therapy]","dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination]","dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung surfactant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","phospholipid/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"168","number":"9","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.L.

In 71 large aggregate surfactant samples that had normal in vitro function (minimum surface tension of less than 1 mN/m by pulsating bubble surfactometry), mean +/- SEM contents of SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C (3.7 kD) were 7.1 +/- 1.4%, 1.8 +/- 0.2%, and 4.6 +/- 0.6%, respectively, of phospholipid. To assess SPs in the 1st week of life, we analyzed samples from additional infants receiving only synthetic replacement surfactant.

Ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) form the center of sphingolipid metabolism and determine proapoptotic and antiapoptotic balance. Findings in animal models suggest a possible pathophysiologic role of ceramide and S1P in COPD, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. Sphingolipid research is now focusing on the role of ceramides during lung inflammation and its regulation by sphingomyelinases. Recently, sphingolipids have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Ceramide upregulation was linked with vascular endothelial growth factor suppression and decreased surfactant protein B levels, pathways important for the development of BPD. In a murine model of BPD, intervention with an S1P analog had a favorable effect on histologic abnormalities and ceramide levels. Ceramides and S1P also regulate endothelial permeability through cortical actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, which is relevant for the pathogenesis of ARDS. On the basis of these observations, the feasibility of pharmacologic intervention in the sphingolipid pathway to influence disease development and progression is presently explored, with promising early results. The prospect of new strategies to prevent and repair lung disease by interfering with sphingolipid metabolism is exciting and could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with severe lung disorders.","group":"g1","id":"5bf9886b-e98a-4f27-8806-b6709b948c96","_showDetails":false},"00aa58e8-bc95-4a21-87c1-7fec7ee49d9a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"38168330","title":"Early-onset neonatal bacterial infections","authors":["Juretic E."],"date":"2003//","keywords":["antibiotic prophylaxis","antibiotic therapy","antigen specificity","bacterium culture","bone marrow","breast milk","cerebral palsy/et [Etiology]","clinical protocol","conference paper","cytokine production","cytotoxicity","drug indication","drug use","female","fetus disease","granulocyte","host resistance","human","immune system","immunity","infection sensitivity","inflammation","intrauterine infection","labor","lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","maternal disease","memory cell","neutrophil","newborn","*newborn infection/dt [Drug Therapy]","*newborn infection/et [Etiology]","onset age","*perinatal infection/dt [Drug Therapy]","*perinatal infection/et [Etiology]","phenotype","placental transfer","premature fetus membrane rupture","premature labor","protection","Streptococcus agalactiae","T lymphocyte","treatment indication","vertical transmission","*antibiotic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","cytokine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","immunoglobulin A antibody/ec [Endogenous Compound]","immunoglobulin G antibody/ec [Endogenous Compound]","secretory immunoglobulin/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Gynaecologia et Perinatologia, Supplement","language":"Croatian","volume":"12","number":"1","publisher":"Naprijed (Petrova 13, Zagreb 10000, Croatia)","isbn":"1331-0151","address":"E.

Intrauterine infections are causally associated with spontaneous premature parturition and fetal inflammation has a possible role in the genesis of fetal injury leading to cerebral palsy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Antibiotic administration to patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes seems justified but it appears that there is no evidence to support the use of antibiotics in women with premature labour and intact membranes and with no signs of infection. Fetal and neonatal innate and acquired defenses against infections function less well and hence the increased susceptibility to infection. The neonatal immune system is both immature and inexperienced. Bone marrow reserve of granulocyte precursors is reduced and neonatal neutrophils are deficient in adherence, deformability, and chemotaxis. Although fetal T lymphocytes early in gestation exhibit antigen specific cytotoxicity, their phenotypic appearance as well as the circulating cell proportions are different. There is a deficiency of memory T cells and this may be a reason for a lower production of some important cytokines. The IgG antibodies of the fetus and newborn are transplacentally transported and maternal in origin. Secretory IgA antibodies along with other host defense components in the mother's milk protect the newborn mucosal membranes after birth. Group B streptococcus is a major pathogen of neonatal sepsis. Transmission is vertical and occurs mostly during labour and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is effective. Culture-based prevention strategy provides greater reduction in neonatal early-onset disease than risk-based strategy. Upgrading of protection protocols is needed until efficient vaccine becomes available.","group":"g1","id":"00aa58e8-bc95-4a21-87c1-7fec7ee49d9a","_showDetails":false},"294e7530-8f20-4613-9528-ae623b94153e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"36015918","title":"A catalytic antioxidant attenuates alveolar structural remodeling in bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Chang L.-Y.L.","Subramaniam M.","Yoder B.A.","Day B.J.","Ellison M.C.","Sunday M.E.","Crapo J.D."],"date":"2003//","keywords":["animal tissue","article","baboon","catalyst","controlled study","drug effect","eosinophil","fetus","gestational age","*hyperoxia","hysterotomy","lung alveolus","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","mast cell","neurosecretory cell","newborn","nonhuman","oxygen toxicity","priority journal","protein urine level","*antioxidant/dt [Drug Therapy]","*antioxidant/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","*antioxidant/pd [Pharmacology]","bombesin derivative","manganese derivative/dt [Drug Therapy]","manganese derivative/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","manganese derivative/pd [Pharmacology]","*metalloporphyrin/dt [Drug Therapy]","*metalloporphyrin/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","*metalloporphyrin/pd [Pharmacology]","oxygen","unclassified drug","aeol 10113","*manganese tetrakis(n methylpyridinium 2 yl)porphyrin/dt [Drug Therapy]","*manganese tetrakis(n methylpyridinium 2 yl)porphyrin/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","*manganese tetrakis(n methylpyridinium 2 yl)porphyrin/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"167","number":"1","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"L.-Y.L.

We tested the hypothesis that a catalytic antioxidant metalloporphyrin AEOL 10113 can protect against hyperoxia-induced lung injury using a fetal baboon model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Fetal baboons were delivered by hysterotomy at 140 days of gestation (term = 185 days) and given 100% oxygen for 10 days. Morphometric analysis of alveolar structure showed that fetal baboons on 100% oxygen alone had increased parenchymal mast cells and eosinophils, increased alveolar tissue volume and septal thickness, and decreased alveolar surface area compared with animals given oxygen as needed. Treatment with AEOL 10113 (continuous intravenous infusion) during 100% oxygen exposure partially reversed these oxygen-induced changes. Hyperoxia increased the number of neuroendocrine cells in the peripheral lung, which was preceded by increased levels of urine bombesin-like peptide at 48 hours of age.

Chronic lung disease, a frequent complication of premature birth, is characterized by excess abundance, tone, and reactivity of smooth muscle in the pulmonary circulation and conducting airways, leading to increased lung vascular and airway resistance. Whether these structural and functional changes are associated with diminished pulmonary expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein is unknown. Both quantitative immunoblot analysis and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry showed that there was less eNOS protein in the endothelium of small intrapulmonary arteries and epithelium of small airways of preterm lambs that were mechanically ventilated for 3 wk compared with control lambs born at term. No significant differences were detected for other proteins (inducible NOS, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and pancytokeratin). Lung vascular and respiratory tract resistances were greater in the chronically ventilated preterm lambs compared with control term lambs. These results support the notion that decreased eNOS in the pulmonary circulation and respiratory tract of preterm lambs may contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic lung disease.","group":"g1","id":"15d0858e-fed6-4676-982e-f7c4f54591d2","_showDetails":false},"a445060c-82a1-42ac-a578-2c30deec0485":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"30307309","title":"Bioactive transforming growth factor-beta in the lungs of extremely low birthweight neonates predicts the need for home oxygen supplementation","authors":["Lecart C.","Cayabyab R.","Buckley S.","Morrison J.","Kwong K.Y.","Warburton D.","Ramanathan R.","Jones C.A.","Minoo P."],"date":"2000//","keywords":["animal cell","article","bioassay","clinical article","controlled study","epithelium cell","female","human","lung fluid","male","newborn","nonhuman","*oxygen therapy","prediction","priority journal","protein analysis","sex difference","*very low birth weight/et [Etiology]","*very low birth weight/th [Therapy]","luciferase","steroid/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*transforming growth factor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Biology of the Neonate","language":"English","volume":"77","number":"4","publisher":"S.

Patients - 17 consecutive newborn infants <= 29 weeks' gestational age (median, 25; 9 boys) who were ventilated from birth underwent daily bronchoalveolar lavage sampling. Results - 102 samples were collected, of which 57 contained IL-10 in amounts that were comparable with those found previously in ventilated term infants with respiratory failure. Chronic lung disease developed in 9 of the 11 survivors and all 9 infants had produced IL-10. IL-1beta and IL-8 were detected in nearly all samples and were raised throughout the course of sample collection.

While its use may reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Evidence of increased adenosine levels are noted in chronic lung diseases including tracheal aspirates of infants with BPD. Utilizing a well-characterized newborn mouse model of alveolar hypoplasia, we hypothesized that hyperoxia-induced alveolar inflammation and hypoplasia is associated with alterations in the adenosine signaling pathway., METHODS: Newborn murine pups were exposed to a 14-d period of hyperoxia and daily caffeine administration followed by a 14-d recovery period in room air. Lungs were collected at both time points for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis as well as histopathology and mRNA and protein expression., RESULTS: Caffeine treatment increased inflammation and worsened alveolar hypoplasia in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. These changes were associated with decreased alveolar type II (ATII) cell numbers, increased cell apoptosis, and decreased expression of A2A receptors. Following discontinuation of caffeine and hyperoxia, lung histology returned to baseline levels comparable to hyperoxia exposure alone., CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest a potentially adverse role of caffeine on alveolar development in a murine model of hyperoxia-induced alveolar hypoplasia.","group":"g1","id":"ad32df19-e6c0-4887-bc5c-25d2177cdcb6","_showDetails":true},"3bf38d46-73b2-4db3-a357-06814e85c4ee":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"34654652","title":"LPS-induced lung injury in neonatal rats: Changes in gelatinase activities and consequences on lung growth","authors":["Franco M.-L.","Waszak P.","Banalec G.","Levame M.","Lafuma C.","Harf A.","Delacourt C."],"date":"2002//","keywords":["animal model","animal tissue","article","controlled study","enzyme activity","histology","inflammatory cell","lung development","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","lung malformation/et [Etiology]","newborn","nonhuman","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","postnatal development","priority journal","protein content","rat","*doxycycline/do [Drug Dose]","*doxycycline/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]","Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide","*gelatinase"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"282","number":"3 26-3","publisher":"American Physiological Society","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"C.

Aim(s): To investigate the adhesion and aggregation of platelets from preterm infants on ECM under defined shear conditions. Method(s): In vitro platelet function was investigated in 106 preterm infants, 74 full term infants, and 26 healthy adults. Blood samples were obtained from all infants within 24 hours of birth, and weekly until discharge from preterm infants only. Citrated whole blood was placed in ECM precoated tissue culture plates and subjected to shear stress (1300 s-1) for two minutes using a rotating Teflon cone. Platelet adhesion (surface coverage) and aggregation (average size) to ECM were assayed using an image analyser. Assays for von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, ristocetin cofactor, and vWF collagen-binding activity were performed on samples from an additional 70 preterm infants, 23 healthy full term infants, and 24 healthy adults. Preterm infants with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) were analysed separately in both cohorts. Result(s): Platelets from preterm infants displayed significantly less platelet adhesion than those from full term infants but similar aggregation and levels of vWF antigen, ristocetin cofactor, and collagen binding activity. Mean surface coverage was 22.0 (8.4)% for preterm infants with HMD, 28.7 (8.0)% for healthy preterm infants, and 35.7 (7.9)% for full term infants. Surface coverage in the preterm infants correlated with gestational age during the first 24 hours only, and did not reach full term levels during 10 weeks of follow up. Conclusion(s): Platelet adhesion to ECM is significantly poorer in preterm than in full term infants, and poorer in preterm infants with HMD than in healthy preterm infants. Intrinsic platelet properties rather than the concentration or activity of vWF may be responsible for this difference.","group":"g1","id":"22549de6-da5b-4386-992e-9d9d2542a368","_showDetails":false},"8bd28bb1-8fec-4b5e-8dc8-ff805f4efcd2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"30978929","title":"Effects of parenteral cysteine and glutathione feeding in a baboon model of severe prematurity","authors":["Stabler S.P.","Morton R.L.","Winski S.L.","Allen R.H.","White C.W."],"date":"2000//","keywords":["amino acid blood level","animal model","article","baboon","diet supplementation","nonhuman","*parenteral nutrition","*prematurity","protein intake","respiratory distress/co [Complication]","*cysteine","*glutathione"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","language":"English","volume":"72","number":"6","publisher":"American Society for Nutrition","isbn":"0002-9165","address":"S.P.

Nuclear abundance and consensus binding characteristics of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (Rel A/p65) plus glutathione biosynthetic capacity were determined. Maximal HIF-1alpha activation at 23 Torr was sustained over the postnatal shift in (DELTA) P(O2) and was elevated in vivo throughout late gestation. NF-kappaB was activated by the acute postnatal DELTAP(O2) in fATII cells, becoming maximal with moderate and severe oxygenation in vitro and within 6 h of birth in vivo, declining thereafter, fATII cell and whole lung glutathione and GSH-to-GSSG ratio increased fourfold with a postnatal DELTAP(O2) and were matched by threefold activity increases in gamma- glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthase. GSH concentration depletion by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine abrogated both HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB activation, with HIF-1alpha showing a heightened sensitivity to GSH concentration.

Clinical signs and symptoms include tachypnea, retractions, apnea, and radiographic findings of poorly inflated lungs with reticulogranular opacities. The disease develops as a result of chronic pulmonary inflammation and continuous lung injury induced by oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and other causes. Fifty to sixty-five percent of neonates with CLD are rehospitalized with respiratory problems, and 21% of very low birth weight neonates are diagnosed with asthma or other respiratory disorders by the age of five. These infants are at risk of adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae as they have a more complicated neonatal course. Many studies have explored various preventive therapies including alpha1-proteinase inhibitors, superoxide dismutase, antioxidants, and ventilatory management. Although the results from these trials are promising, further studies are needed to define which patients are most likely to benefit from preventive therapy. Two preventive treatment approaches that have shown a decrease in morbidity and an improvement in mortality are antenatal steroids and surfactant therapy. Postnatal corticosteroid therapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment for CLD, however, there are a number of detrimental side effects associated with this treatment. Due to the increased incidence in periventricular leukomalacia, early treatment of steroid therapy cannot be recommended. The optimal time to start steroid therapy appears to be after the first week of life. In addition, the lowest dose and shortest duration of treatment needs to be implemented in order to minimize potential complications. Although bronchodilators and diuretics continue to be used extensively in infants with CLD, there are surprisingly few well-controlled studies that have evaluated the clinical impact of this therapy. Further trials are needed in order to support the routine use of these therapies in CLD. Unfortunately, inhaled steroids have not shown an improvement in long-term outcomes of CLD, however, they have shown a decrease in systemic steroid usage. CLD is a complex disease with many unanswered questions. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of various treatment modalities with particular focus on the long-term outcomes such as oxygen and ventilator dependency as well as the incidence of CLD.","group":"g1","id":"9ab14c74-4aac-4b44-a41f-18d461a9b594","_showDetails":true},"8cb2525d-59b5-4d1e-abbb-420eb50e1517":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"32455718","title":"Surface activity in vitro: Role of surfactant proteins","authors":["Possmayer F.","Nag K.","Rodriguez K.","Qanbar R.","Schurch S."],"date":"2001//","keywords":["adsorption","comparative study","compression","conference paper","expiratory reserve volume","human","lung alveolus carbon dioxide tension","*lung alveolus surface tension","prediction","phosphatidylcholine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","phosphatidylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*surfactant protein A/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*surfactant protein B/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*surfactant protein C/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology - A Molecular and Integrative Physiology","language":"English","volume":"129","number":"1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"1095-6433","address":"F.

Pattle concluded surfactant was a lipoprotein. Our group has investigated the roles of the surfactant proteins (SP-) SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C using a captive bubble tensiometer. These studies show that SP-C>SP-B>SP-A in enhancing surfactant lipid adsorption (film formation) to the equilibrium surface tension of ~ 22-25 mN/m from the 70 mN/m of saline at 37degreeC. In addition to enhancing adsorption, surfactant proteins can stabilize surfactant films so that lateral compression induced through surface area reduction results in the lowering of surface tension (gamma) from ~ 25 mN/m (equilibrium) to values near 0 mN/m. These low tensions, which are required to stabilize alveoli during expiration, are thought to arise through exclusion of fluid phospholipids from the surface monolayer, resulting in an enrichment in the gel phase component dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The results are consistent with DPPC enrichment occurring through two mechanisms, selective DPPC adsorption and preferential squeeze-out of fluid components such as unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) from the monolayer. Evidence for selective DPPC adsorption arises from experiments showing that the surface area reductions required to achieve gamma near 0 mN/m with DPPC/PG samples containing SP-B or SP-A plus SP-B films were less than those predicted for a pure squeeze-out mechanism. Surface activity improves during quasi-static or dynamic compression-expansion cycles, indicating the squeeze-out mechanism also occurs. Although SP-C was not as effective as SP-B in promoting selective DPPC adsorption, this protein is more effective in promoting the reinsertion of lipids forced out of the surface monolayer following overcompression at low gamma values. Addition of SP-A to samples containing SP-B but not SP-C limits the increase in gammamax during expansion. It is concluded that the surfactant apoproteins possess distinct overlapping functions. SP-B is effective in selective DPPC insertion during monolayer formation and in PG squeeze-out during monolayer compression. SP-A can promote adsorption during film formation, particularly in the presence of SP-B. SP-C appears to have a superior role to SP-B in formation of the surfactant reservoir and in reinsertion of collapse phase lipids. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","group":"g1","id":"8cb2525d-59b5-4d1e-abbb-420eb50e1517","_showDetails":true},"419fd6cd-c0a0-4d5e-9f64-ec6db7830c20":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"34874972","title":"Photoprotection prevents TPN-induced lung procollagen mRNA in newborn guinea pigs","authors":["Lavoie J.-C.","Rouleau T.","Gagnon C.","Chessex P."],"date":"2002//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal tissue","article","controlled study","genetic code","genetic transcription","guinea pig","*light exposure","*lung fibrosis/et [Etiology]","newborn","nonhuman","*oxidative stress","parenteral nutrition","peroxidation","prematurity","priority journal","protein blood level","protein induction","amino acid","glutathione/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glutathione disulfide","hydrogen peroxide","lipid","messenger RNA","*procollagen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","sodium chloride"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"33","number":"4","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.

We developed an electronic patient documentation system (EDS) called PCode to identify and select patient diagnostic (DX) codes and compared EDS to the previous paper-based documentation system (PDS). Our hypothesis was that EDS would capture more patient diagnostic codes than PDS. METHOD(S): PDS was originally developed as a two page 'code sheet' which listed all 275 neonatal diagnoses/management options and corresponding 3-4 character diagnostic (DX) codes, organized by organ system. PDS code sheets were manually completed by one of three trained 'coders' for every neonatal patient. EDS was developed as a Java application with the 'coder' selecting DX codes from drop lists also categorized by organ system. The study intervention was patient code selection using either the PDS or the EDS system. Both systems produced a paper DX code summary. PDS data capture occurred from 11/1997-3/1999 followed by EDS data capture until 8/2000. The primary outcome variable was DX codes captured per patient. Data were analyzed using independent t-test and linear regression. RESULT(S): The number of diagnoses increased with decreasing birth weight. After linear regression was applied to control for birth weight, the number of DX codes was 31% greater in the EDS group, 7.2 +/- 2.9 DX codes/patient, p=0.008. There was a trend towards fewer erroneous DX codes in the EDS group. The most common DX codes were hyaline membrane disease, sepsis evaluation and hyperbilirubinemia, as expected for this patient population. CONCLUSION(S): EDS captured more VLBW infant DX codes compared to PDS. These results support the transition toward electronic data documentation for the neonatal clinical environment.

In an in vitro model of fetal alveolar type II epithelial cells, we investigated the profile of cytokines in response to ascending DELTApO2 regimen (oxyexcitation). The peak of TNF-alpha (4 h) preceded IL-1beta and IL-6 (6-9 h), indicating a positive feedback autocrine loop confirmed by exogenous rmTNF-alpha. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced a dose-dependent release of cytokines, an effect specifically obliterated by selective antioxidants of the hydroxyl radical (.OH) and superoxide anion (O2-). Actinomycin and cycloheximide blocked the induced production of cytokines, implicating transcriptional and translational control. Whilst the dismutating enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were ineffective in reducing ROS-induced cytokines, MnP, a cell-permeating SOD mimetic, abrogated xanthine/xanthine oxidase-dependent cytokine release. Desferrioxamine mesylate, which inhibits the iron-catalysed generation of OH via the Fenton reaction, exhibited a mild effect on the release of cytokines. Dynamic variation in alveolar pO2 constitutes a potential signalling mechanism within the perinatal lung allowing upregulation of cytokines in an ROS-dependent manner. © 2001 Academic Press.","group":"g1","id":"e0018b01-3495-481e-9570-7f1655ea205c","_showDetails":false},"fa6ffa4d-99e8-480c-85b4-4bfbbb08f7c0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms as major risk factors for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in a Chinese Han population.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.10.004","authors":["Wang, Xijuan","Li, Wenbin","Liu, Wei","Cai, Baohuan","Cheng, Tingting","Gao, Chunfang","Mo, Luxia","Yang, Hui","Chang, Liwen"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20131010//","keywords":["Base Sequence","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/en [Enzymology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","China","DNA Primers","*Ethnicity/ge [Genetics]","Genotype","*Glutathione Transferase/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction","Risk Factors"],"journal":"Gene","volume":"533","number":"1","isbn":"0378-1119","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24120392"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysphasia (BPD) is a complex multifactorial disease with an obvious genetic predisposition.

In the present study, the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are associated with BPD in Chinese Han infants was examined. Sixty infants with BPD and 100 gestational age and birth weight-matched preterm infants without BPD were recruited. Genotyping for GSTM1 and GSTT1 was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The GSTM1 null genotype was more prevalent in BPD infants (65.0%) than in the control subjects (48.0%), which yielded higher risk towards BPD (odds ratio (OR): 2.012, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.040-3.892, p=0.037). There was no statistically significant association of GSTT1 genotype with BPD (OR: 1.691, 95% CI=0.884-3.236, p=0.111), although the frequency of GSTT1 null genotype was higher among the BPD subjects (60.0%) than in the control patients (47.0%).

Nineteen VLBW infants who received a 3 wk dose tapering course of dexamethasone for treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were prospectively enrolled. Blood for hormone assays was collected immediately before the start of the dexamethasone course (Td-pre), 3 wk after commencement of the drug (Td-end) and 2 wk after dexamethasone treatment had been stopped (Td-post). In addition, 28 VLBW infants who participated in a concurrent longitudinal leptin study within the same period but did not receive corticosteroid had their serum leptin and insulin concentrations serially monitored. Blood specimens for the latter group of infants were obtained at 2 (Twk-2), 5 (Twk-5) and 7 (Twk-7) wk of postnatal age. Serum leptin and insulin at Td-end were significantly increased, whereas plasma ACTH and serum cortisol were significantly suppressed compared with the pretreatment (Td-pre) levels in the corticosteroid group (p < 0.0001 for leptin and insulin; p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 for ACTH and cortisol, respectively). In contrast, serum leptin and insulin at weeks 5 (Twk-5) and 7 (Twk-7) did not differ significantly from their respective levels at week 2 (Twk-2) in the non-treatment group. Conclusion(s): The administration of systemic corticosteroid resulted in significant increases in serum leptin and insulin, but marked suppression of hormones of the HPA axis. The effect of dexamethasone on the \"adipoinsular\" and HPA axes was transient and reversible. The adipoinsular axis in preterm infants is likely to be functional and active at an early stage of human development, and leptin may regulate energy balance in VLBW infants in the early postnatal period. Corticosteroids may, through the adipoinsular axis or its associated pathways, mediate in the regulation of body weight in preterm neonates.","group":"g1","id":"1c461bba-dd72-4a69-af6c-bb837f34a13c","_showDetails":true},"17ac9cc9-7b9a-4907-a362-b9963924af8e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"34547864","title":"Differential effect of dexamethasone and hydrocortisone on alveolar growth in rat pups","authors":["Fayon M.","Jouvencel P.","Carles D.","Choukroun M.L.","Marthan R."],"date":"2002//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal tissue","article","controlled study","drug effect","histology","lung alveolus","*lung development","lung dysplasia","lung volume","nonhuman","priority journal","rat","respiratory distress syndrome","*dexamethasone/cm [Drug Comparison]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","*hydrocortisone/cm [Drug Comparison]","*hydrocortisone/do [Drug Dose]","*hydrocortisone/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"33","number":"6","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.

While both dexamethasone and hydrocortisone increased alveolar diameter with thinning of the interairspace walls, only dexamethasone reduced the overall internal surface area of the lung available for respiratory exchange.

Decrease in lung compliance and distensibility often is seen in human CDH as well as experimentally produced CDH. Collagen and elastin, critical components of the lung connective tissue, have been suggested to have important influence on lung compliance and maximal expansion. The barotrauma caused by mechanical ventilation is known to produce structural changes in the pulmonary architecture. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and production of elastin in the lung in newborn rats with CDH during mechanical ventilation. Method(s): CDH was induced in rat embryos after administration of nitrofen to pregnant dams on day 9.5 of gestation. Cesarean section was performed on day 21 of gestation. The newborn rats were intubated using a 24-gauge Teflon catheter. After ligation of the umbilical cord, the intubated animals were transferred immediately to a warm plate and connected to a modified ventilator. Ventilation was continued for a maximum of 6 hours. The relative amount of soluble elastin in the lung was assessed using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the relative amount of tropoelastin mRNA expression in the lung. Result(s): Elastin mRNA in the CDH lung was increased significantly (P lt; .01) at one hour after ventilation compared with ventilated controls. Elastin protein significantly increased in the CDH lung at one hour (P lt; .01) and 6 hours (P lt; .01) after starting ventilation compared with controls. Conclusion(s): The data show that during mechanical ventilation, elastin production is increased significantly in the CDH lung, and this may further affect lung compliance.

The progressive loss of lung gas exchange units in patients with IPF leads to respiratory failure and eventually to death. While the etiology of this disease is unknown, for many years studies suggested that chronic inflammation was the underlying factor that caused fibroproliferation and structural alterations of the lung. Recent data show that fibroproliferation and fibrosis can occur independently of inflammation, suggesting that IPF is a disease caused by a mesenchymal, rather than an immune disorder. Mesenchymal growth factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, platelet-derived growth factor, connective tissue growth factor, fibroblast growth factors, and keratinocyte growth factors, as well as proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, have been shown to be exaggerated in several fibrotic lung disorders including IPF, ARDS, sarcoidosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as pulmonary manifestations of systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). We argue that inflammation is required to initiate growth factor production and repair of the damaged alveolar epithelial lining in fibrotic lung diseases and that exaggerated TGF-beta production may be responsible for the fibrotic response seen in diseases such as IPF. We recognize the potential role of several growth factors in the fibroproliferative process in the lung, and in this brief report we focus on the possible roles of the growth factors IGF-I and TGF-beta in cell migration, proliferation, and ECM synthesis in patients with IPF.","group":"g1","id":"62589862-c338-40d8-8632-3749a8911879","_showDetails":false},"16f2329f-91b7-449c-b434-9153ab6e479e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"34415816","title":"Urine bombesin-like peptide elevation precedes clinical evidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Cullen A.","Van Marter L.J.","Allred E.N.","Moore M.","Parad R.B.","Sunday M.E."],"date":"2002//","keywords":["article","barotrauma/co [Complication]","clinical trial","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","creatinine urine level","diagnostic value","disease association","female","human","immunoreactivity","low birth weight/th [Therapy]","*lung dysplasia/co [Complication]","*lung dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","lung infection","major clinical study","male","neurosecretory cell","newborn","newborn screening","oxygen therapy","prediction","priority journal","protein urine level","radioimmunoassay","risk assessment","sensitivity and specificity","*urinalysis","*bombesin derivative/ec [Endogenous Compound]","creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","oxygen","unclassified drug","*bombesin like peptide/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"165","number":"8","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.E.

Improved medical care has led to a paradoxically increased incidence of BPD due to greater infant survival. Early prediction of BPD has proven challenging. Increased pulmonary neuroendocrine cells containing bombesin-like peptide immunoreactivity occur in infants with BPD. We hypothesized that elevated urine bombesin-like peptide levels precede BPD. One hundred thirty-two infants, 28-weeks gestation or less, were studied. Urine bombesin-like peptide levels, determined by radioimmunoassay, were normalized for creatinine. BPD was defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. A first urine bombesin-like peptide level greater than 20,000 pg/mg creatinine (12,500 fmol/mg) between postnatal days 1-4 occurred among 54% of the infants who later developed BPD (p <= 0.001), versus 10% among non-BPD infants (specificity 90%). Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that elevated urine bombesin-like peptide levels are associated with BPD (odds ratio 9.9, 95% confidence interval: 3.4, 29) (p <= 0.001) after adjusting for all confounding factors. Thus, elevated bombesin-like peptide levels in these infants at 1-4 days after birth are associated with a 10-fold increased risk of developing BPD. Utilizing urine bombesin-like peptide for screening might permit early therapeutic interventions to reduce disease progression and could provide a target for new preventive therapies.","group":"g1","id":"16f2329f-91b7-449c-b434-9153ab6e479e","_showDetails":false},"649d998f-d76b-43f5-9366-af35159957c2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"35477168","title":"Oxygen-mediated parenchymal and vascular lung injury","authors":["Luo X.-P.","Jankov R.P.","Ning Q.","Liao L.-J.","Tanswell A.K."],"date":"2002//","keywords":["animal cell","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","blood vessel injury","cell death","cell growth","conference paper","controlled study","disease association","epithelium cell","host resistance","hyperoxia","intensive care","lung alveolus epithelium","lung alveolus macrophage","lung development","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung parenchyma","morbidity","mortality","necrosis","newborn care","nonhuman","oxidation","oxygen toxicity","prematurity","pulmonary hypertension","rat","treatment planning","antioxidant/dt [Drug Therapy]","antioxidant/pd [Pharmacology]","endothelin 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","hydrogen peroxide","isoprostane","oxygen","reactive nitrogen species/ec [Endogenous Compound]","reactive oxygen metabolite/ec [Endogenous Compound]","thiol derivative/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Acta Pharmacologica Sinica","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"SUPPL.","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group (Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1671-4083","address":"X.-P.

Pulmonary O2 toxicity, through the generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species in excess of antioxidant defenses, is believed to be a major contributor to the development of BPD. Our studies demonstrated that hyperoxia-induced lung epithelial cell death is a necrosis secondary to loss of reduced thiols, and is hydrogen peroxide-dependent in vitro. Parenchymal injury in vivo also appears to be hydrogen peroxide-dependent and is alveolar macrophage-independent, whereas pulmonary hypertension appears to be isoprostane-, endothelin 1- (ET-1) and alveolar macrophage-dependent. An antioxidant intervention prevented pulmonary hypertension but not the changes in lung architecture found in animals exposed to oxygen. This indicates that different mediators regulate these different aspects of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. Antioxidant interventions can have an adverse impact on lung growth, which is in keeping with the increasingly recognized role of low levels of oxygen-derived products in normal cell growth. Antioxidant interventions may not, therefore, be an appropriate therapy in the newborn infant. The recognition of the importance of ET-1 and 8-isoprostane in oxygen-mediated pulmonary hypertension and of neutrophils in parenchymal injury, and their reversibility with appropriate interventions, suggests that alternative approaches may be feasible.","group":"g1","id":"649d998f-d76b-43f5-9366-af35159957c2","_showDetails":true},"833f528b-86fb-491c-979b-5c6774624cb3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"32747364","title":"Rescue use of DNase in critical lung atelectasis and mucus retention in premature neonates","authors":["El Hassan N.O.","Chess P.R.","Huysman M.W.A.","Merkus P.J.F.M.","De Jongste J.C."],"date":"2001//","keywords":["article","artificial ventilation","*atelectasis/co [Complication]","*atelectasis/dt [Drug Therapy]","*atelectasis/th [Therapy]","bronchus mucus","case report","drug efficacy","drug safety","human","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung dysplasia/th [Therapy]","lung infection/co [Complication]","male","nebulization","newborn","*prematurity","priority journal","respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","respiratory distress syndrome/th [Therapy]","*dornase alfa/ad [Drug Administration]","*dornase alfa/do [Drug Dose]","*dornase alfa/dt [Drug Therapy]","*dornase alfa/ih [Inhalational Drug Administration]","*surfactant/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"108","number":"2 II","publisher":"American Academy of Pediatrics (141 Northwest Point Blvd, P.O.

We hypothesized that MnSOD increases in human lung in response to oxygen treatment, although this response could be restricted to certain cell types and depend on gestational age. Therefore, the cell-specific expression of pulmonary immunoreactive MnSOD protein was investigated during development, and in patients with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), chronic lung disease (CLD), or persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN). Throughout ontogenesis, all cell types expressed MnSOD, but the most intense positivity was found in bronchiolar epithelium and (pre-) type-II pneumocytes. MnSOD protein did not increase during development. The MnSOD staining pattern in arterial endothelium was more intense in RDS patients than in age-matched controls, but this may be related to induction of MnSOD by increased blood flow rather than by oxygen. MnSOD expression in other cell types of RDS, CLD, or PPHN patients did not differ from that in age-matched controls. We conclude that, in terms of mitochondrial enzymatic superoxide scavenging capacity, preterm infants are not more vulnerable than term infants to oxygen-induced lung injury at physiological oxygen concentrations.

The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), genetic testing, lung-function testing, and lung biopsy. Because knowledge of the usefulness of MDCT pattern recognition in ChILD is at present limited, we examined the occurrence of MDCT patterns in children with histologically confirmed interstitial lung disease., METHOD: We searched the biopsy, MDCT, and clinical information database of a single national paediatric referral hospital for 2004-2020. Data were from affected children under age 18. MDCT images we reanalysed while blinded to the identity and referral information., RESULTS: We included 90 patients, of whom 63 (70 %) were male. The median age at biopsy was 1.3 years (interquartile range 0.1-16.8). Biopsy findings fell into 26 histological classes covering all nine chILD classification categories. We recognized six distinct MDCT patterns: neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (23), organizing pneumonia (5), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (4), bronchiolitis obliterans (3), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (2), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 2). Of the total 90, in 51 (57 %) children, none of these six MDCT patterns appeared. Of those 39 children with a recognizable MDCT pattern, in 34 (87 %), that pattern predicted their final diagnosis., CONCLUSIONS: Among cases of chILD, we identified a specific predefined MDCT pattern in only 43 %. However, when such a recognizable pattern occurred, it was predictive of the final chILD diagnosis. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Aerosolized medications such as inhaled steroids and beta agonists are commonly administered in-line through nasal CPAP, especially to infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that aerosol delivery to the lungs via variable-flow nasal CPAP in an in vitro model would be unreliable, and that the delivery would depend on the position of the aerosol generator within the nasal CPAP circuit., METHODS: We used a system that employed a test lung placed in a plastic jar and subjected to negative pressure. Simulated inspiration effort was measured with a heated-wire anemometer. We used technetium-99m-labeled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid as our aerosol. The nebulizer was placed either close to the humidifier or close to the nasal prongs in the circuit, and patient effort was simulated with a minute ventilation of 0.4 L/min., RESULTS: Relative aerosol delivery to the infant test lung with the nebulizer close to the humidifier was extremely low (0.3 +/- 0.4%), whereas placing the nebulizer close to the nasal prongs resulted in significantly (P < .001) improved delivery (21 +/- 11%). Major areas of aerosol deposition with the nebulizer close to the humidifier versus close to the nasal prongs were: nebulizer (10 +/- 4% vs 33 +/- 13%, P < .001), exhalation limb (9 +/- 17% vs 26 +/- 30%, P = .23), and generator tubing (21 +/- 11% vs 19 +/- 20%, P = .86). Placing the nebulizer close to the humidifier resulted in 59 +/- 8% of the aerosol being deposited in the inhalation tubing along the heater wire., CONCLUSIONS: Isotope delivery from an aerosol generator placed near the humidifier on variable-flow nasal CPAP was negligible in this in vitro setup; however, such delivery was significantly improved by locating the aerosol generator closer to the nasal CPAP interface.","group":"g1","id":"90f1aa1c-889d-4860-b0ff-21212061f131","_showDetails":true},"5ff3a625-593b-4482-b877-d669e4087869":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"32786599","title":"Matrix metalloproteinases-2, -8, and -9 and TIMP-2 in tracheal aspirates from preterm infants with respiratory distress","authors":["Cederqvist K.","Sorsa T.","Tervahartiala T.","Maisi P.","Reunanen K.","Lassus P.","Andersson S."],"date":"2001//","keywords":["article","artificial ventilation","basement membrane","blood vessel permeability","chronic lung disease/et [Etiology]","clinical article","densitometry","disease association","*enzyme analysis","extracellular matrix","female","human","immunopathology","infant","lung alveolus oxygen tension","lung blood flow","lung dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","male","molecular weight","morbidity","*neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","newborn","pneumonia/di [Diagnosis]","*prematurity/di [Diagnosis]","priority journal","protein expression","*trachea disease/di [Diagnosis]","trachea mucus","Western blotting","*gelatinase A/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*gelatinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound]","immunoglobulin A/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*neutrophil collagenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","oxygen","*tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"108","number":"3","publisher":"American Academy of Pediatrics (141 Northwest Point Blvd, P.O.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family endoproteinases that act in degradation of extracellular matrix and basement membranes. The development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by early pulmonary inflammation, increased microvascular permeability, and subsequently by disordered repair. The aims of our study were to characterize the presence and molecular weight forms of MMP-2, -8, and -9 and their specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2, in lungs of preterm infants during the early postnatal period and to determine whether levels of these MMPs and TIMP-2 in tracheal aspirate fluid (TAF) are associated with acute or chronic lung morbidity of the preterm infant. Methods. TAF samples were collected from 16 intubated preterm infants (gestational age 27.0 +/- 2.0 weeks; birth weight 875 +/- 246 g) during their first 5 postnatal days. The presence and molecular weight forms of MMPs and TIMP-2 were identified by Western immunoblotting, and their levels were evaluated by densitometric scanning. Results. MMP-8 in TAF was higher in infants who needed treatment with surfactant (25.4 +/- 6.3 vs 10.6 +/- 1.5 arbitrary unit/secretory component of immunoglobulin A [AU/SC]) and in whom BPD developed (N = 6; 27.6 +/- 5.2 vs 15.1 +/- 5.0 AU/SC). TIMP-2 levels were lower in infants with initial arterial to alveolar oxygen tension ratios <0.22 (2.7 +/- 1.1 vs 16.8 +/- 7.4 AU/SC) and in infants needing mechanical ventilation for >1 week (5.2 +/- 2.1 vs 22.8 +/- 11.7 AU/SC). Conclusions. In preterm infants, an imbalance between pulmonary MMP-8 and TIMP-2 participates in the acute inflammatory process in respiratory distress syndrome and may contribute to the development of chronic lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"5ff3a625-593b-4482-b877-d669e4087869","_showDetails":false},"2837932c-a615-4453-8dac-5e0509d29f6e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"32694561","title":"Surfactant proteins: Role in lung physiology and disease in early life","authors":["Mallory G.B.

A 21-aminosteroid antioxidant, U74389G, attenuated both pulmonary hypertension and macrophage accumulation in the O2-exposed lungs. To determine whether macrophage accumulation played an essential role in the development of pulmonary hypertension in this model, pups were treated with gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) to reduce lung macrophage content. Treatment of 60% O2-exposed animals with GdCl3 prevented right ventricular hypertrophy (p < 0.05) and smooth muscle hyperplasia around pulmonary vessels, but had no effect on morphologic changes in the lung parenchyma. In addition, GdCl3 inhibited 60% O2-mediated increases in endothelin-1, 8-isoprostane, and nitrotyrosine residues. Organotypic cultures of fetal rat distal lung cells were subjected to cyclical mechanical strain to assess the potential role of GdCl3-induced blockade of stretch-mediated cation channels in these effects. Mechanical strain caused a moderate increase of endothelin-1 (p < 0.05), which was unaffected by GdCl3, but had no effect on 8-isoprostane or nitric oxide synthesis. A critical role for endothelin-1 in O2-mediated pulmonary hypertension was confirmed using the combined endothelin receptor antagonist SB217242. We concluded that pulmonary macrophage accumulation, in response to 60% O2, mediated pulmonary hypertension through up-regulation of endothelin-1.","group":"g1","id":"7318f816-086a-4378-a700-63f99d2ff3bf","_showDetails":true},"1f36fa93-54f4-4687-ba4a-bdf9c27e743b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"32578778","title":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Jobe A.H.","Bancalari E."],"date":"2001//","keywords":["artificial ventilation","conference paper","disease severity","forced expiratory flow","human","infant nutrition","lung development","*lung dysplasia/co [Complication]","*lung dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*lung dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*lung dysplasia/pc [Prevention]","lung injury/co [Complication]","lung injury/et [Etiology]","lung injury/pc [Prevention]","nonhuman","pathophysiology","positive end expiratory pressure","*prematurity","priority journal","bombesin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 11/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound]","lung surfactant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","macrophage inflammatory protein 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","transforming growth factor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"163","number":"7","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"A.H.

Besides inflammatory cells, various cytokines, lipid mediators, proteolytic enzymes and toxic oxygen radicals may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Intrauterine exposure to chorioamnionitis or proinflammatory cytokines has been shown to induce a pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response in the fetus.

Oxygen toxicity remains a major risk factor for the development of CLD and as a consequence the antioxidant status of CLD babies is a major focus of interest. In the present study, we determined whether ascorbate, urate, and total glutathione concentrations were decreased in infants who developed CLD when compared to those who did not. From 34 preterm infants, 141 serial bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma samples were collected: 12 developed CLD (median gestation 26 weeks, range 23-28 weeks, median birth weight 780 g, range 630-1070 g), 16 developed and recovered from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (median gestation 31 weeks, range 26-39 weeks, median birth weight 1820 g, range 840-4160 g), and six were ventilated for non-respiratory reasons, (median gestation 35 weeks, range 32-38 weeks, median birth weight 2180 g, range 1100-2860 g). Following birth, the concentration of BALF ascorbate, urate and glutathione decreased over the 1st week in all three groups. Thereafter, BALF ascorbate increased in RDS and control infants during the 2nd week but this increase was delayed by 2 weeks in the CLD infants. No differences were noted between the RDS and CLD groups for urate and total glutathione in BALF or urate in plasma. BALF protein concentration was similar in all three groups except for a rise at day 7 in the CLD group but this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion A delayed increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ascorbate concentration might be associated with an increased risk of developing chronic lung disease of prematurity.","group":"g1","id":"20eaa7f5-7434-4b3b-ac1a-4817a58de509","_showDetails":true},"1ebb52c6-ebbe-420a-98e7-13bbfaef2588":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"32778222","title":"Effects of ventilation with different positive end-expiratory pressures on cytokine expression in the preterm lamb lung","authors":["Naik A.S.","Kallapur S.G.","Bachurski C.J.","Jobe A.H.","Michna J.","Kramer B.W.","Ikegami M."],"date":"2001//","keywords":["animal cell","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","article","*artificial ventilation","controlled study","inflammation","lamb","lung alveolus","*lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung parenchyma","lung ventilation","neutrophil","newborn","nonhuman","positive end expiratory pressure","prematurity","priority journal","protein expression","ventilator","cell protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*cytokine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 1beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","surfactant protein C/dt [Drug Therapy]","tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"164","number":"3","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.

We compared those weighing under 1000 g at birth (n=25) with those weighing 1001 - 1250 g (n=28). All neonates received central parenteral nutrition at an average age of 42.3 h. The liquid requirements of the lower birth-weight group were significantly greater. No differences were found in the supply of glucose, proteins, lipids and calories until after the first 15 days of life, when the < 1000 g group required a greater liquid and caloric intake. Parenteral nutrition was suspended earlier for the > 1000 g group (32.6 vs. 48.1 days). Maximum weight loss (12.56%) for the two groups occurred at 5.23 days. No differences in weight gain (g/kg/day) between the groups were observed. The > 1000 g group began enteral nutrition significantly earlier and presented greater tolerance. The incidence of complications (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis, Candidas A sepsis, osteopenia) was greater in the lower birth-weight group, as was that of hyaline membrane disease and mechanically assisted respiration. There were no differences in the incidence of intracraneal haemorrhage, ductus arteriosus, early sepsis, delayed intrauterine growth or hypoglucemia. Conclusion(s): The severity of the initial pathology and the greater incidence of complications among the lower birth-weight neonates (< 1000 g) influenced both the need for parenteral nutrition and the reduced tolerance to enteral nutrition. Although the rate of weight gain was similar for the two groups, the < 1000 g group required a longer period of parenteral nutrition. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

We analyzed their levels between two groups, RDS infants who developed BPD (n = 8, BPD group) and those who did not (n = 11, RDS group). The levels of the type IV collagen in the BPD group were significantly higher than those in the RDS group at 3 and 7 days of age (p = 0.0024).

The lack of decline in chronic lung disease of prematurity despite the generalized use of surfactant and alternative modes of ventilation such as high-frequency oscillation (HFO) has been attributed to some misunderstanding of how HFO has to be used. We used a new ventilatory strategy in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, by initiating HFO immediately after intubation and attempting early lung volume optimization before surfactant was administered. Study Design. The outcome of 32 VLBW infants, managed with first intention HFO over a period of 24 months (September 1, 1996 and August 31, 1998) was compared by chart review with 39 historical controls, consecutively managed with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) over a period of 24 months (January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995). Setting. An 11-bed tertiary care pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital. Results. The 2 groups of patients were similar in demographic distribution of birth weight, gestational age, race, and gender. Patients on first intention HFO were ventilator-dependent (median [95% confidence interval]: 5 [3-6] vs 14 [6-23] days) and oxygen-dependent (12 [4-17] vs 51 [20-60] days) for a shorter time than patients on CMV. The incidence of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks of gestational age was significantly lower in the HFO group compared with the CMV group (0% vs 34%). Conclusions. First intention HFO with early lung volume optimization shortened the need for respiratory support and improved pulmonary outcome of VLBW infants with respiratory distress syndrome significantly.","group":"g1","id":"3bf4376c-075e-4fe6-8057-b8c3aea63518","_showDetails":true},"b5d38b24-815a-4c01-9586-081b38f835db":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Secondhand smoke exposure in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.22819","authors":["Collaco, Joseph M","Aherrera, Angela D","Ryan, Timothy","McGrath-Morrow, Sharon A"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20130627//","keywords":["Adrenal Cortex Hormones/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Anti-Inflammatory Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Combined Modality Therapy","*Environmental Exposure/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Hospitalization/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Kaplan-Meier Estimate","Logistic Models","Male","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Respiration, Artificial/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Retrospective Studies","Self Report","Surveys and Questionnaires","*Tobacco Smoke Pollution/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"49","number":"2","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=23804596"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Preterm infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) often experience significant respiratory morbidities during the first two years of life. Second hand smoke (SHS) has been demonstrated to lead to respiratory morbidities in the general population. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence/impact of SHS on preterm infants and children with BPD., METHODS: Subjects (n = 352) were recruited from the Johns Hopkins BPD outpatient clinic between January 2008 and August 2012. Second hand smoke exposure and respiratory morbidities were assessed through questionnaires and chart review., RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of preterm infants with BPD were exposed to SHS in the home setting, despite having significant lung disease. SHS was associated with multiple measures of socio-economic status, including lower household income (P < 0.001), lower caregiver education level (P = 0.013), and having public versus private insurance (P = 0.002). We found no difference in acute care use or chronic symptoms with SHS exposure. We observed trends that preterm infants who were exposed to SHS were more likely to be prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (P = 0.054) and were weaned off of supplemental oxygen over 2 months later (P = 0.13) than infants not exposed to SHS., CONCLUSION: SHS exposure in preterm infants with BPD is common, even in those receiving supplemental oxygen and respiratory medications. Although there were no associations between respiratory outcomes and self-reported SHS exposure, trends toward increased use of inhaled steroids and a longer duration of supplemental oxygen use were noted. Further work is needed to determine more accurate means of assessing SHS risk in this vulnerable population.

To investigate the relationship of cortisol concentrations during the first week of life to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), markers of lung inflammation, and respiratory outcome in very low birth weight infants. Methods. Newborns <1500 g birth weight were prospectively enrolled at 2 centers. Serum cortisol was measured 3 times during days 2 to 7 of life. Tracheal lavage was performed on intubated infants and analyzed for interleukin-1beta, -6, and -8, and for total protein, albumin, and alpha-1 protease inhibitor. Infants receiving prenatal glucocorticoids were excluded. Results. We obtained 337 cortisol values from 125 infants. Infants treated for PDA had lower cortisol values after day 2. One hundred thirty-three tracheal fluid samples were obtained on matching days from 71 intubated infants. Cortisol correlated inversely with tracheal interleukins and proteins. Lower cortisol values during the second half of the week correlated with longer duration of supplemental oxygen therapy and with subsequent development of chronic lung disease at 28 days and at 36 weeks. Conclusion. Infants with lower cortisol values in the first week of life had an increased incidence of PDA, increased lung inflammation, and an increased incidence of chronic lung disease. These findings suggest that early adrenal insufficiency may underlie the previously observed association of increased lung inflammation and PDA with adverse respiratory outcome in this population.","group":"g1","id":"a1579647-bd94-4c66-8b77-999b034a30f7","_showDetails":true},"e90bae86-09dc-4396-9fda-e18729476ebc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"30208032","title":"Acute bronchiolitis","authors":["Deschildre A.","Thumerelle C.","Bruno B.","Dubos F.","Santos C.","Dumonceaux A."],"date":"2000//","keywords":["age","antibiotic therapy","article","assisted ventilation","*bronchiolitis/di [Diagnosis]","*bronchiolitis/dt [Drug Therapy]","*bronchiolitis/ep [Epidemiology]","*bronchiolitis/et [Etiology]","*bronchiolitis/pc [Prevention]","*bronchiolitis/th [Therapy]","child hospitalization","corticosteroid therapy","high risk population","human","infant disease/di [Diagnosis]","infant disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","infant disease/ep [Epidemiology]","infant disease/et [Etiology]","infant disease/pc [Prevention]","infant disease/th [Therapy]","lung dysplasia","physiotherapy","prematurity","prognosis","*virus infection/di [Diagnosis]","*virus infection/dt [Drug Therapy]","*virus infection/ep [Epidemiology]","*virus infection/et [Etiology]","*virus infection/pc [Prevention]","*virus infection/th [Therapy]","*antibiotic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","*antivirus agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","*bronchodilating agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","*bronchodilating agent/ih [Inhalational Drug Administration]","*corticosteroid/dt [Drug Therapy]","immunoglobulin/dt [Drug Therapy]","monoclonal antibody/dt [Drug Therapy]","virus vaccine/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Archives de Pediatrie","language":"French","volume":"7","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS (62 rue Camille Desmoulins, Issy les Moulineaux Cedex 92442, France)","isbn":"0929-693X","address":"A.

Little is known about its production and possible role in fetal and neonatal lung disorders. We therefore examined IL-8 expression by immunohistochemistry in lung tissue from neonates with hyaline membrane disease, from fetuses with amniotic infection, and from a fetal control group with noninflammatory diseases. In the majority of cases with hyaline membrane disease, intense IL-8 immunoreaction was seen in fetal and neonatal neutrophils and in almost half of these cases, in epithelial cells of the terminal airways as well as in the connective tissue cell compartment. In contrast, in the amniotic infection group, strong IL-8 immunostaining was almost exclusively seen in maternal aspirated neutrophils. Little or no IL-8 signal was seen in the control cases in all cell types examined. Also, no IL-8 production by fetal lung cells was detected in fetuses <18 wk of gestation. The marked presence of IL-8 in all cell types of the lung in hyaline membrane disease cases indicates a role for IL-8 in the pathobiology of hyaline membrane disease possibly similar to that in adult respiratory distress syndrome. It further suggests that the cytokine network of the fetal lung is already well developed by the second trimester of pregnancy.","group":"g1","id":"60eeb2bb-a5dd-43ce-bf71-9424cbc1b12b","_showDetails":false},"dd89c371-33df-470b-9c1f-6ea1c2af93df":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"30991184","title":"Clara-cell secretory protein in preterm infants' tracheal aspirates correlates with maturity increases in infection","authors":["Lassus P.","Nevalainen T.J.","Eskola J.U.","Andersson S."],"date":"2000//","keywords":["alkalosis/et [Etiology]","antiinflammatory activity","arterial pH","article","aspiration","*cell secretion","Clara cell","clinical article","controlled study","female","gestational age","human","infant","*infection risk","leukocyte count","lung lavage","male","oxygen concentration","perinatal period","priority journal","respiratory distress","*secretory protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","uteroglobin/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"30","number":"6","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.

Concentration of CCSP in TAF when corrected for dilution increased from 3.6 +/- 11 mug/mL on day 1 to 29.6 +/- 6.9 mug/mL on day 14. CCSP correlated with gestational age. A negative correlation was found between CCSP and inspiratory oxygen concentration, and a positive correlation between CCSP and both arterial pH and base excess during the first 2 postnatal weeks. Infants with clinical and laboratory signs of infection had higher CCSP than noninfected infants, and a negative correlation was found between CCSP and leukocyte count during the first 2 postnatal weeks (all P < 0.05). We suggest that pulmonary CCSP correlates with both gestational and postnatal age, and increases in response to infection in infants with respiratory distress during the early postnatal period.

The 6- ketoprostaglandin F(1alpha) output was increased similarly in both vehicle- and drug-treated O2-exposed animals. O2 exposure also caused a significant increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein and extravascular lung water that could not be ameliorated by Wy-50295 or MK-0591.

Although hyperoxia had no effect on septal thickness, Wy-50295 caused significant thickening in both air- and O2- exposed pups.

We report that lung TRX and its reductase, TR, are specifically upregulated at birth by O2. Throughout the third trimester, mRNAs for TRX and TR were expressed constitutively at low levels in fetal baboon lungs. However, after premature birth (125 or 140 of 185 days gestation), lung TRX and TR mRNAs increased rapidly with the onset of O2 or air breathing. Lung TRX mRNA also increased in lungs of term newborns with air breathing. Premature animals (140 days) breathing 100% O2 develop chronic lung disease within 7-14 days. These animals had greater TRX and TR mRNAs after 1, 6, or 10 days of life than fetal control animals. In 140-day animals given lesser O2 concentrations (as needed) who do not develop chronic lung disease, lung TRX and TR mRNAs were also increased on days 1 and 6 but not significantly on day 10. In fetal distal lung explant culture, mRNAs for TRX and TR were elevated within 4 h in 95% O2 relative to 1% O2, and the response was similar at various gestations. In contrast, TRX protein did not increase in lung explants from premature animals (125 or 140 days) but did in those from near-term (175- day) fetal baboons after exposure to hyperoxia. However, lung TRX protein and activity, as well as TR activity, eventually did increase in vivo in response to hyperoxia (6 days). Increases in TRX and TR mRNAs in response to 95% O2 also were observed in adult baboon lung explants. When TRX redox status was determined, increased O2 tension shifted TRX to its oxidized form. Treatment of lung explants with actinomycin D inhibited TRX and TR mRNA increases in 95% O2, indicating transcriptional regulation by O2. The acute increase in gene expression for both TRX and TR in response to O2 suggests an important role for these proteins during the transition from relatively anaerobic fetal life to O2 breathing at birth.","group":"g1","id":"87a9c785-ac19-4537-9afa-0cb56b431b84","_showDetails":true},"ef5014f4-2ad4-4b1c-91a6-1582ebf6f76c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"27024419","title":"Evaluation of the newborn's blood gas status","authors":["Brouillette R.T.","Waxman D.H."],"date":"1997//","keywords":["arterial carbon dioxide tension","arterial oxygen tension","blood gas analysis","conference paper","good laboratory practice","human","*lung dysplasia/cn [Congenital Disorder]","*lung dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","lung ventilation","*perinatal asphyxia/di [Diagnosis]"],"journal":"Clinical Chemistry","language":"English","volume":"43","number":"1","publisher":"American Association for Clinical Chemistry Inc.","isbn":"0009-9147","address":"R.T.

Blood gas measurements are as important for ill newborns as for other critically ill patients, but rapidly changing physiology, difficult access to arterial and mixed venous sampling sites, and small blood volumes present unique challenges. This paper discusses considerations for interpretation of blood gases in the newborn period. Blood gas measurements and noninvasive estimations provide important information about oxygenation. The general goals of oxygen therapy in the neonate are to maintain adequate arterial P(a)O2 and S(a)O2, and to minimize cardiac work and the work of breathing. Pulse oximetry and transcutaneous oxygen monitoring are extraordinarily useful techniques of estimating and noninvasively monitoring the neonate's oxygenation, but each method has limitations. Arterial blood gas determinations of pCO2 provide the most accurate determinations of the adequacy of alveolar ventilation, but capillary, transcutaneous, and end- tidal techniques are also useful. An approach to and examples of acid-base disorders are presented. Three hemoglobin variants relevant to the newborn are considered: fetal hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin. Blood gases obtained in the immediate perinatal period can help assess perinatal asphyxia, but particular attention must be paid to the sampling site, the time of life, and the possible and proven diagnoses.","group":"g1","id":"ef5014f4-2ad4-4b1c-91a6-1582ebf6f76c","_showDetails":true},"99c65000-d3b3-4579-a7f6-5a7764c5f885":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"28304250","title":"Transcriptional regulation of tropoelastin expression in rat lung fibroblasts: Changes with age and hyperoxia","authors":["Bruce M.C.","Honaker C.E."],"date":"1998//","keywords":["age","animal cell","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","article","controlled study","female","fetus","hyperoxia","intron","*lung development","lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*lung fibroblast","lung injury/et [Etiology]","male","newborn","nonhuman","*prematurity","priority journal","rat","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","*transcription regulation","cyclophilin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","nuclear RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*tropoelastin/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"274","number":"6 18-6","publisher":"American Physiological Society","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"M.C.

With the use of an RT-PCR assay and intron- specific primers to detect heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) and intron- spanning primers to detect mRNA in freshly isolated rat lung fibroblasts, tropoelastin gene expression was found to be upregulated late in gestation. From days 18 to 21 of gestation, there was a 4.5-fold increase in tropoelastin hnRNA (P < 0.0001) and a 6-fold increase in mRNA (P = 0.002). After birth, tropoelastin expression was downregulated. Signals decreased from fetal day 21 to postnatal day 2 for both tropoelastin hnRNA (P = 0.021) and mRNA (P = 0.043). Tropoelastin hnRNA decreased further from days 2 to 6 (P = 0.04). Both tropoelastin hnRNA and mRNA were again upregulated during alveolarization from days 9 to 11, indicating that, once upregulated, transcription of the tropoelastin gene is not constant but varies with fetal and postnatal age. Exposure to >95% oxygen, when initiated on postnatal day 2 or 3 and continued until day 11, significantly diminished the developmental increase in tropoelastin hnRNA (P < 0.005) and mRNA (P < 0.05) normally seen on days 9-11, indicating that the postnatal upregulation of tropoelastin gene expression is inhibited by hyperoxic exposure in the early postnatal period.","group":"g1","id":"99c65000-d3b3-4579-a7f6-5a7764c5f885","_showDetails":true},"e9eadef3-da68-4022-b38e-84477d1b5456":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"27433100","title":"Role of neutrophils in lung vascular injury and edema after premature birth in lambs","authors":["Carlton D.P.","Albertine K.H.","Cho S.C.","Lont M.","Bland R.D."],"date":"1997//","keywords":["animal cell","animal experiment","animal tissue","article","blood pressure","*blood vessel injury/di [Diagnosis]","concentration response","controlled study","fetus","lamb","lung edema/di [Diagnosis]","lung fluid","*lung injury/di [Diagnosis]","membrane permeability","neutrophil chemotaxis","nonhuman","pathogenesis","prematurity/di [Diagnosis]","priority journal","respiratory distress/di [Diagnosis]","thorax pressure","*chlormethine"],"journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","language":"English","volume":"83","number":"4","publisher":"American Physiological Society","isbn":"8750-7587","address":"D.P.

Circulating neutrophil concentration transiently decreased within 2 h after birth and then returned to prenatal values by 6-8 h. The decrease in circulating neutrophil concentration was related directly to the accumulation of neutrophils in the air spaces, drainage of liquid and protein from the lung 6-8 h after delivery, and postmortem extravascular lung water. In additional studies, we intravenously administered mechlorethamine to 5 fetal lambs to reduce circulating neutrophils before delivery (neutrophil concentration before birth: 9 +/- 11 cells/mul). Compared with control lambs, neutrophil-depleted lambs had significantly less drainage of liquid (7.8 +/- 5.9 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.9 ml/h, respectively) and protein (116 +/- 74 vs. 42 +/- 27 mg/h, respectively) from the lung 6-8 h after birth and significantly less extravascular lung water at postmortem (6.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.8 0.6 g/g dry lung, respectively).

Although its source in lung is unknown, TF is a major inhibitor for lipid peroxidation and microbial propagation in lung fluid, and iron-free TF has been shown in rabbits to decrease the severity of respiratory failure and to improve surfactant activity. This study shows that TF is produced and secreted by the lung. In baboons and humans, TF gene expression displays distinct temporal patterns in different lung cells as revealed by in situ hybridization. Although expression of TF mRNA in submucosal glands remains active during development and throughout adulthood, its level in airway epithelia increases with advancing gestational age, reaches its peak before birth, declines 6-12 me after birth, and diminishes in the older adult. In premature baboons maintained on ventilatory support, expression of TF mRNA is suppressed in both airway epithelium and glands. TF production by airway epithelia before birth most likely prevents oxidative damage in the newborn period, and its loss during injury may allow further lung damage.","group":"g1","id":"beb3e068-82d6-4947-bf79-71efa902cdd2","_showDetails":true},"a6d5fcf8-fe57-4286-af28-411c2a875e8b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"A new way of thinking about complications of prematurity.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1099800412461563","authors":["Moore, Tiffany A","Berger, Ann M","Wilson, Margaret E"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20121002//","keywords":["Adaptation, Physiological","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Newborn, Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]","*Infant, Premature"],"journal":"Biological research for nursing","volume":"16","number":"1","isbn":"1099-8004","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=23034538"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The morbidity and mortality of preterm infants are impacted by their ability to maintain physiologic homeostasis using metabolic, endocrine, and immunologic mechanisms independent of the mother's placenta. Exploring McEwen's allostatic load model in preterm infants provides a new way to understand the altered physiologic processes associated with frequently occurring complications of prematurity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity. The purpose of this article is to present a new model to enhance understanding of the altered physiologic processes associated with complications of prematurity. The model of allostatic load and complications of prematurity was derived to explore the relationship between general stress of prematurity and complications of prematurity. The proposed model uses the concepts of general stress of prematurity, allostasis, physiologic response patterns (adaptive-maladaptive), allostatic load, and complications of prematurity. These concepts are defined and theoretical relationships in the proposed model are interpreted using the four maladaptive response patterns of repeated hits, lack of adaptation, prolonged response, and inadequate response. Empirical evidence for cortisol, inflammation, and oxidative stress responses are used to support the theoretical relationships. The proposed model provides a new way of thinking about physiologic dysregulation in preterm infants. The ability to describe and understand complex physiologic mechanisms involved in complications of prematurity is essential for research. Advancing the knowledge of complications of prematurity will advance clinical practice and research and lead to testing of interventions to reduce negative outcomes in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"a6d5fcf8-fe57-4286-af28-411c2a875e8b","_showDetails":false},"601d77f5-b25b-4127-9d04-fb668c9b6dcf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"29522636","title":"Abnormal lung growth and the development of pulmonary hypertension in the Fawn-Hooded rat","authors":["Le Cras T.D.","Kim D.-H.","Gebb S.","Markham N.E.","Shannon J.M.","Tuder R.M.","Abman S.H."],"date":"1999//","keywords":["animal experiment","article","cell maturation","fetus","lung alveolus oxygen tension","lung development","*lung hypoplasia/et [Etiology]","nonhuman","pathogenesis","priority journal","*pulmonary hypertension/co [Complication]","rat","respiratory epithelium"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"277","number":"4 21-4","publisher":"American Physiological Society","isbn":"1040-0605","address":"T.D.

Barium-gelatin angiograms demonstrated reduced background arterial filling and density in adult FHR lungs. Perinatal treatment of FHR with supplemental oxygen increased alveolarization and reduced the subsequent development of right ventricular hypertrophy in adult FHR.

An imbalance between increased neutrophil elastase and a decreased antiprotease shield has been suggested as a factor contributing to the development of chronic lung disease (CLD). We hypothesized that administration of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1PI), also known as alpha1- antitrypsin, to premature neonates would prevent CLD. Design. A randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective study of A1PI supplementation was performed. Neonates <24 hours of age with birth weights 600-1000 g on respiratory support, and 1001-1250 g with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were eligible. Intravenous A1PI (60 mg/kg) or placebo was infused on days 0, 4, 7, and 14. Primary outcome was CLD in survivors, defined as the need for supplemental oxygen on day 28. Results. A total of 106 patients were recruited. There were no significant differences between groups in birth weight or incidence of RDS. The incidence of CLD in survivors was lower in the treated group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (relative risk [RR], 0.79; confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.02). This beneficial trend persisted at 36 weeks corrected gestational age (RR, 0.48; CI, 0.23-1.00). The incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was lower in the treated group (RR, 0.22; CI, 0.05-0.98). Other complications were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions. In this, the first trial of a protease inhibitor for the prevention of CLD in premature infants, the infusions were well-tolerated. A1PI therapy may impede the development of CLD and appears to reduce the incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage in some neonates born prematurely.","group":"g1","id":"8c02f951-6ac8-44e7-88e6-bab7596e2c22","_showDetails":true},"32d14b4e-efb2-49ce-b19e-3ceb578fea27":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"27067224","title":"Blood C-reactive protein levels after natural porcine surfactant (Curosurf)","authors":["El Hanache A.","Gourrier E.","Karoubi P.","Merbouche S.","Mouchnino G.","Leraillez J."],"date":"1997//","keywords":["article","*artificial ventilation","human","hyaline membrane disease","major clinical study","newborn","premature labor","*protein blood level","*respiratory distress syndrome","*C reactive protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","lung surfactant","lung surfactant extract","*surfactant"],"journal":"Archives de Pediatrie","language":"French","volume":"4","number":"1","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS (62 rue Camille Desmoulins, Issy les Moulineaux Cedex 92442, France)","isbn":"0929-693X","address":"J.

The files of not infected premature babies, aged 25 to 36 weeks of gestational age, under mechanical ventilation for a hyaline membrane disease (HMD), admitted in our unit between January 1990 to June 1995, have been retrospectively studied. They were separated into three groups: A: 67 infants ventilated for more than 5 days for HMD without surfactant therapy; B: 23 infants treated by Surfexo; C: 60 infants treated by Curosurf. CRP was measured daily between day 0 (D0) and D5. Means and standard deviations were calculated for each day and each group. The mean values of CRP at D1 to D5 in group C were compared to D0. The daily CRP values were compared in the three groups. For group C, the results were studied daily according to the gestational age, dosage and age of the neonate at the first instillation. The statistical results have been given according to the Student t test. Results. Afler Curosurf, the mean CRP value rose significantly from D1 to D4 compared to D0. There was no difference of CRP between groups A and B from D0 to D5. Group C had higher values in comparison to group A (between D1 to D5) and to group B (between D1 and D3). There was no significant difference of the CRP values in group C according to the number of instillations or the amount instilled, but CRP was lower in early treated infants (< H6). Discussion. Curosurf instillation is followed by a significant increase in CRP, maximum at D2. This is not seen after Surfexo. This increase seems less important at D2-D3 when Curosurf is administered early. The CRP increase afer Curosurf therapy could be due to an inflammatory reaction to the heterologous proteins it contains.","group":"g1","id":"32d14b4e-efb2-49ce-b19e-3ceb578fea27","_showDetails":true},"10dbcef8-b400-4ccb-bc8f-2b3a8a1db5a8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"29227849","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor in human preterm lung","authors":["Lassus P.","Ristimaki A.","Ylikorkala O.","Viinikka L.","Andersson S."],"date":"1999//","keywords":["article","birth weight","blood sampling","cell growth","clinical article","*fetus lung maturation","gestational age","human","infant","intubation","lecithin sphingomyelin ratio","lung aspiration","priority journal","protein blood level","*respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung surfactant","lung surfactant extract","*surfactant/dt [Drug Therapy]","*vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"159","number":"5 I","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.

VEGF in TAF increased from 25 +/- 12 pg/ml (mean +/- SEM) on Day 1 to 526 +/- 120 pg/ml on Day 7 (mean concentrations, 106 +/- 25 pg/ml on Days 1 to 3 and 342 +/- 36 pg/ml on Days 4 to 7). In plasma, mean concentration of VEGF during the first week was 48 +/- 6 pg/ml, with no increase observed. In TAF, higher VEGF was found in patients born to mothers with premature rupture of the membranes, or chorionamnionitis, whereas preeclampsia of the mother was associated with lower VEGF (all p < 0.05). In TAF, no correlations existed between VEGF and gestational age or birth weight, but a correlation existed between lecithin/sphengomyelin ratio and VEGF (p < 0.05). During Days 4 to 7 patients developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) had lower VEGF in TAF than did those surviving without BPD (235 +/- 31 versus 383 +/- 50; p < 0.05). VEGF increased rapidly in the lungs of the preterm infant during the first days of life. VEGF may be indicative of pulmonary maturity and may participate in pulmonary repair after acute lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"10dbcef8-b400-4ccb-bc8f-2b3a8a1db5a8","_showDetails":true},"e0245849-1b15-4de3-943f-e63cb9081d93":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"29518792","title":"The consultation for immunological disorders in Hospital Maria Pia","authors":["Marques L.","Lopes I.","Neves E."],"date":"1999//","keywords":["acquired immune deficiency syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","acquired immune deficiency syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","acquired immune deficiency syndrome/ep [Epidemiology]","adolescent","age","blood transfusion","brain disease/co [Complication]","brain disease/di [Diagnosis]","brain disease/ep [Epidemiology]","child","clinical article","conference paper","consultation","controlled study","follow up","hearing impairment","human","Human immunodeficiency virus 1","Human immunodeficiency virus 2","*Human immunodeficiency virus infection/di [Diagnosis]","*Human immunodeficiency virus infection/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Human immunodeficiency virus infection/ep [Epidemiology]","*Human immunodeficiency virus infection/et [Etiology]","infant","lung dysplasia","Pneumocystis pneumonia/co [Complication]","Pneumocystis pneumonia/di [Diagnosis]","Portugal","prematurity","psychosocial disorder","thrombocytopenia/co [Complication]","thrombocytopenia/di [Diagnosis]","thrombocytopenia/ep [Epidemiology]","vertical transmission","antiretrovirus agent/cb [Drug Combination]","antiretrovirus agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","proteinase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination]","proteinase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]","RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination]","RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Nascer e Crescer","language":"Portuguese","volume":"8","number":"3","publisher":"Hospital de Criancas Maria Pia (Rua da Boavista 827, Porto 4000, Portugal)","isbn":"0872-0754","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed6&NEWS=N&AN=29518792"],"address":"Portugal","abstract":"Children with HIV infection risk are followed in Hospital de Criancas Maria Pia since 1994. A specific period of follow-up was individualised since 1996 and was integrated in the Immunological Disorders Consultation created in 1998. These children benefit from pediatric, nursing, social and psychiatric support offered by a multidisciplinary team. During this five- year period (94/99) 43 children were followed. HIV infection was diagnosed in 8: HIV1 in 6 and HIV2 in 2. The infection was excluded in the remaining 35 children. HIV1 was acquired by vertical transmission and HIV 2 by transfusion. The age of diagnosis was 4 to 8 weeks in HIV1 infected children, with the exception of one infant diagnosed at the age of 7 months with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The child's mother seropositivity was unknown. In HIV2 infected children the age of diagnosis was 7 and 15 years. Two children presented AIDS, one had HIV encephalopathy, another had thrombocytopenia and the remaining 4 were asymptomatic. In association these children presented other problems: prematurity 3; bronchopulmonary dysplasia 1, deafness 1. All suffered from psychosocial problems (5 were abandoned by their parents). Antiretroviral therapy was instituted following the guidelines and the preparations available for children. At present all the children are under triple therapy with two reverse transcriptase inhibitors associated with one protease inhibitor. In two there were difficulties in the compliance to the proposed regimen: one did not tolerate the medication and in another there was lack of family support. In both these difficulties were resolved. In all the children there was a sharp fall in viral load after the beginning of triple therapy. At present 3 present undetectable values. One child with AIDS and the child with encephalopathy died at the age of 9,5 and 2,5 respectively. A young man was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Consultation at HSJ at the age of 20. Thirteen (37%) of the children in which HIV infection was ruled out presented a series of other problems: growth failure 4; congenital syphilis 3, prematurity 2, congenital malformations 2 (cardiopathy, cryptorchidy, limb malformations), microcephaly 1, neurological abnormalities 3 (hypertonia, brisk reflexes, hypotonia), developmental delay 4, positivity for HCV 2, parent death of abandon 8. We stress the importance of an adequate follow-up of these children in order to establish an early diagnosis and therapy of HIV infection. The diagnosis and treatment of other associated problems is also necessary even in the group of children who are not infected.","group":"g1","id":"e0245849-1b15-4de3-943f-e63cb9081d93","_showDetails":true},"7eea3bc1-691f-4de6-91dd-f00189afea7f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"29467799","title":"Retinol and retinol-binding protein in neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Valdes-Ramos R.","Cardona-Perez A.","Pacheco Y.","Barrera-Reyes R.","Meza-Camacho C."],"date":"1999//","keywords":["anthropometry","article","artificial ventilation","clinical article","disease association","human","*lung dysplasia","newborn","priority journal","protein determination","*retinol deficiency","statistical analysis","vitamin blood level","*retinol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*retinol binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Nutrition Research","language":"English","volume":"19","number":"10","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.

To establish general radiological patterns, studying their utility in orienting the differential diagnosis between primary diseases and pulmonary complications responsible for the distress. Material(s) and Method(s): The necropsy and radiological findings of 71 infants born with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) were correlated with the clinical records. The etiology was hyaline membrane disease in 40 newborns, neonatal pneumonia in 17, aspiration of clear or meconium-stained amniotic fluid in 6 and 7, respectively, and primary pulmonary lymphangiectasis in the remaining case. Additional lung complications consisted of loss of alveolar airspace in 17 infants, massive pulmonary hemorrhage in 7 and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 8. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): There was a high incidence of normal X-rays (25.35%) during the initial period despite the presence of well-established and severe disease. The sensitivity of chest X- ray for each of the underlying lung diseases causing NRDS was as follows: 80% for hyaline membrane disease, 71.4% for aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, 70.6% for neonatal pneumonia, 50% for massive aspiration of clear amniotic fluid and 100% for the remaining causes. Although there are no radiological patterns showing significant sensitivity and specificity for a given primary disease or pulmonary complication, the radiological differential diagnosis serves to orient the study. Given the complexity and lack of clinical specificity of NRDS, it is necessary to approach this disease from both the clinical and radiological points of view.","group":"g1","id":"04aed5ed-ecf0-48b9-a0e3-9bce21ac1592","_showDetails":true},"3488b1a3-072f-49e2-b6c0-8afae81d4fee":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"29340240","title":"Hyperoxia induces thioredoxin and thioedoxin reductase gene expression in lungs of premature baboons with respiratory distress and bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Das K.C.","Guo X.-L.","White C.W."],"date":"1999//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","baboon","conference paper","controlled study","gene expression system","*hyperoxia","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","newborn","nonhuman","oxidation reduction reaction","pathophysiology","prematurity","priority journal","*respiratory distress/et [Etiology]","signal transduction","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","oxygen","*thioredoxin","*thioredoxin reductase"],"journal":"Chest","language":"English","volume":"116","number":"SUPPL.","publisher":"American College of Chest Physicians (3300 Dundee Road, Northbrook IL 60062-2348, United States)","isbn":"0012-3692","address":"C.W.

Following administration of surfactant, preterm neonates with RDS and a birth weight of less than 1,200 g were included in this comparative observational pilot study when still mechanically ventilated and with an oxygen requirement on the third day of life. The patients (gestational age 26.1 +/- 0.9 weeks, birth weight 826 +/- 140 g, mean +/- SD) were alternately allocated to prophylactic treatment with inhaled beclomethasone (n = 7), or to early systemic dexamethasone therapy after day 10 of life, if clinically indicated (n = 9). Pulmonary inflammation and lung permeability were assessed by analyzing the levels of interleukin-8, elastase alpha1 proteinase inhibitor, free elastase activity, and albumin in tracheal aspirates on days 10 and 14 of life. The secretory component of IgA served as reference protein. We observed no significant differences in the concentrations of interleukin-8, elastase alpha1 proteinase inhibitor, and albumin between the two groups on day 10 of life. On day 14, 3 (median; range, 1-3) days following initiation of dexamethasone treatment, concentrations of the inflammatory mediators and of albumin were significantly lower in the group on systemic steroid therapy than in the group treated with inhaled steroids (P < 0.01). Additionally, there was a significant difference in oxygen requirements between both groups on day 14. In the group treated with inhaled steroids, concentrations of the inflammatory mediators, albumin, and oxygen requirements did not show a difference between day 10 and 14. We conclude that, in contrast to systemic dexamethasone treatment, a 12-day course of inhaled beclomethasone does not affect lung inflammation and pulmonary microvascular permeability in preterm infants at risk for CLD within the first 2 weeks of life.","group":"g1","id":"1e516c42-e5d8-4146-9802-58ca696c0a07","_showDetails":true},"1d3e18b0-867d-4fc4-9091-722f16439d72":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in infancy.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2013.09.012","authors":["Steinhorn, Robin H"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20130929//","keywords":["Bosentan","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","Hernia, Diaphragmatic/di [Diagnosis]","*Hernia, Diaphragmatic/pp [Physiopathology]","Hernia, Diaphragmatic/th [Therapy]","Humans","Hypertension, Pulmonary/di [Diagnosis]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/pp [Physiopathology]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/th [Therapy]","Infant, Newborn","Milrinone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Nitric Oxide/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Piperazines/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Prostaglandins/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Purines/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Signal Transduction/ph [Physiology]","Sildenafil Citrate","Sulfonamides/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Sulfones/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Vascular Resistance/ph [Physiology]"],"journal":"Early human development","volume":"89","number":"11","isbn":"0378-3782","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=24083892"],"address":"Ireland","abstract":"Normal pulmonary vascular development in infancy requires maintenance of low pulmonary vascular resistance after birth, and is necessary for normal lung function and growth.

In the United States alone, approximately 91,000 infants are hospitalized with RSV infections yearly, at an estimated annual cost of at least 300 million dollars. The burden of RSV infections is even greater if outpatient visits for children and adults and RSV morbidity in patients with underlying conditions are included. Obstacles to controlling RSV remain appreciable and challenging. The virus causes predictable, widespread outbreaks of illness each year and repeated infections throughout life. The most severe infections occur in the youngest infants, especially premature infants and those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Patients with chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases and those with immunosuppression also are at high risk for severe RSV infection, and their risk may last well beyond infancy. Institutionalized adults, especially the elderly, also are at risk of complicated disease. To be effective, a vaccine against RSV must be administered shortly after birth and ideally should provide better immunity than natural disease, if reinfection is to be prevented. It must also be effective in the wide variety of populations at risk. Recently, several candidate vaccines for RSV have been developed. In the interim, RSV immune globulin and a monoclonal antibody to RSV have been approved for prophylaxis in infants at high risk. For therapy in immunocompromised patients, especially patients receiving transplants, a combination of RSV immune globulin and the antiviral ribavirin has been tried. Therapy for RSV, however, remains limited, controversial, and mostly supportive.","group":"g1","id":"54e1e511-2104-4134-a2c6-bf2f41d42e9b","_showDetails":false},"ca0684a9-2835-4a2e-83c4-60befe209515":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"29405585","title":"Functional and antigenic concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor after administration for the prevention of chronic lung disease of prematurity","authors":["Stiskal J.A.","Ito S.","Cox D.W.","Shennan A.T.","O'Brien K.K.E.","Kelly E.N.","Longley T.B.","Rabinovitch M.","Dunn M.S."],"date":"1999//","keywords":["article","artificial ventilation","birth weight","*chronic lung disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","*chronic lung disease/et [Etiology]","*chronic lung disease/pc [Prevention]","clinical trial","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","double blind procedure","female","human","major clinical study","male","newborn","*prematurity/et [Etiology]","priority journal","randomized controlled trial","*alpha 1 antitrypsin/ct [Clinical Trial]","*alpha 1 antitrypsin/do [Drug Dose]","*alpha 1 antitrypsin/dt [Drug Therapy]","*alpha 1 antitrypsin/pk [Pharmacokinetics]"],"journal":"Biology of the Neonate","language":"English","volume":"76","number":"3","publisher":"S.

A1PI supplementation may also be useful for protecting premature neonates who receive mechanical ventilation from the development of chronic lung disease (CLD). However, the pharmacokinetics of exogenous A1PI in this population are unknown. We attempted to determine the disposition of A1PI in premature infants with birth weight 600-1250 g who received 60 mg/kg on days 0, 4, 7 and 14 in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Functional and antigenic plasma concentrations of A1PI were measured at specified time points. Result(s): On both functional and antigenic assays, concentrations began in the normal adult range and rose from day 0 to 10 then fell slightly, but remained above initial values. The concentrations were not significantly different between the treatment and placebo groups. Conclusion(s): The results of this study indicate that neonatal pharmacokinetics of A1PI differ markedly from those of the adult. Total plasma clearance of exogenous A1PI seems high in the ventilated premature neonate. Higher or more frequent doses may be necessary to maintain A1PI plasma concentrations above baseline.","group":"g1","id":"ca0684a9-2835-4a2e-83c4-60befe209515","_showDetails":true},"568fab00-4bef-427d-bf1d-be887f24e802":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"29558652","title":"Bone metabolism and circulating IGF-I and IGFBPs in dexamethasone-treated preterm infants","authors":["Ward W.E.","Atkinson S.A.","Donovan S.M.","Paes B."],"date":"1999//","keywords":["article","blood level","body composition","bone development","bone disease/si [Side Effect]","*bone metabolism","bone mineral/ec [Endogenous Compound]","bone turnover","chronic lung disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","clinical article","controlled study","dual energy X ray absorptiometry","food intake","growth","human","newborn","nutrient","*prematurity","urine level","weight gain","amino terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","biochemical marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]","collagen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*dexamethasone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","osteocalcin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","peptide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*somatomedin binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*somatomedin C/ec [Endogenous Compound]","unclassified drug"],"journal":"Early Human Development","language":"English","volume":"56","number":"2-3","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd (P.O.

Method(s): Plasma and urine samples from 17 infants were obtained prior to DEX, after 9-12 days of DEX and 10 days after the completion of DEX to assess plasma IGF-I, IGFBPs, osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptide. Nutrient intakes and growth were monitored from birth until term corrected age at which time body composition was evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Result(s): Although nutrient intakes did not differ during or after DEX, weight gain (115 vs. 174 g/week) and length gain (0.7 vs. 1.0 cm/week) were higher after DEX treatment. Plasma IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and osteocalcin increased over time. N-telopeptide was the only biochemical parameter which appeared to be suppressed during DEX (1342 nM bone collagen equivalents/mM creatinine vs. 2486 (pre-DEX) and 2292 (post-DEX)). At term corrected age, bone mineral content was lower in dexamethasone-treated infants compared to preterm and term reference infants. Conclusion(s): Changes in circulating IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 paralleled the changes reported in non-steroid-treated infants; however, it remains uncertain whether the natural rise in IGF-I was suppressed by DEX treatment. Assessment of these circulating components provided limited insight into the mechanisms by which DEX alters growth and bone turnover.

Even if the diagnosis is made, the long-term consequences are not taken into account by both, the patient and the medical doctor. Chronic bronchopulmonary diseases need to be treated together with the pediatric pneumologist. This is undoubtedly necessary in the case of severe asthma, interstitial lung diseases and in CF. Longterm treatment is frequently complicated by the noncompliance of the patient and his family and by a certain ignorance of the medical doctor. Therefore, training programmes for the patients and a continuous education of the medical doctor is essentially important to ameliorate the final outcome of the different diseases.

Although high PVR is present in premature lambs with severe hyaline membrane disease (HMD), whether ET-1 plays a role in the pathophysiology of experimental HMD is unknown. To test the hypothesis that ET-1 activity contributes to high PVR in the premature lamb with HMD, we studied the hemodynamic effects of a selective ETA receptor antagonist, BQ 123, in 10 animals (gestational age 125 d; 147 d = term). After baseline measurements, animals were intubated, treated with surfactant (Infasurf), and mechanically ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.00 for 8 h. Animals were treated with continuous infusions of either BQ 123 (1 mg/h; treatment group, n = 5) or 1% DMSO (control; n = 5). Plasma ET-1 levels progressively increased during prolonged ventilation with hyperoxia (0.8 +/- 0.1 pg/mL, baseline to 6.8 +/- 2.5 pg/mL, 8 h, p < 0.05). In comparison with control lambs, BQ 123 treatment caused a sustained reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (0.55 +/- 0.04 mm Hg mL-1 min-1, control versus 0.18 +/- 0.04 mmHg mL-1 min-1, BQ 123, p < 0.05), increased left pulmonary artery blood flow (70 +/- 12 mL/min, control versus 194 +/- 28 mL/min, BQ 123, p < 0.05), and increased arterial Pao2 (53 +/- 14 mm Hg, control versus 174 +/- 71 mm Hg, BQ 123,p < 0.05) 8 h after the onset of ventilation. We conclude that circulating levels of ET-1 increase after delivery of premature lambs with severe HMD, and that selective ETa receptor blockade causes sustained improvement in hemodynamics in severe experimental HMD. These studies suggest that ET-1 contributes to the hemodynamic abnormalities in this model of pulmonary hypertension and severe HMD.","group":"g1","id":"7cb98441-1f4a-462a-8ba5-935be6d1548e","_showDetails":true},"dd3e4c12-75a5-4552-9f6c-e90e9f411cc5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"28325814","title":"Bronchial colonization and infection due to Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in children","authors":["Dutau G.","Prere M.F.","Lemozy J.","Vezard Y.","Micheau P.","Glorieux I.","Piet- Duroux S.","Dabernat H."],"date":"1998//","keywords":["antibiotic sensitivity","article","*bacterial colonization","bronchus secretion","cell count","cheek mucosa","child","childhood disease","clinical article","controlled study","coughing","epithelium cell","Escherichia coli","female","Haemophilus influenzae","Haemophilus parainfluenzae","human","infant","interstitial pneumonia","Klebsiella oxytoca","lobar pneumonia","*lower respiratory tract infection","male","*Moraxella catarrhalis","neutrophil","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","sputum analysis","Streptococcus pneumoniae","*amoxicillin","*antibiotic agent","*penicillin G"],"journal":"Semaine des Hopitaux","language":"French","volume":"74","number":"21-22","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS (62 rue Camille Desmoulins, Issy les Moulineaux Cedex 92442, France)","isbn":"0037-1777","address":"G.

There were 16 boys and nine girls, with a mean age of 16.8 months and an age range of 2 months to 6 years. The reason for admission was presence of subacute or chronic respiratory symptoms without cystic fibrosis, including cough of more than one month's duration with or without stasis of respiratory tract secretions, attacks of dyspnea with wheezing, or recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. Sputum samples were required to satisfy four criteria: (a) gross appearance of a deep respiratory tract sample, (b) buccal epithelial cell count less than 10 per x 100 field, (c) neutrophil count greater than 25 per x 100 field, and (d) organism count of at least 105 per ml as determined with x 1000 magnification. Focal abnormalities were seen on the chest radiograph in only five patients, of whom two had lobar pneumonia and three middle lobe syndrome. Evidence of interstitial pneumonia was seen in a 13-month-old. A mild to severe bronchial syndrome was by far the most common finding (91%). Only one patient had a normal chest radiograph. Serum C-reactive protein levels were moderately elevated in four of 15 cases (26/7%). The absolute peripheral neutrophil count was 5000 or more per mm3 in eight cases (42.1%), with a range of 5022 to 15733 per mm3. M. Catarrhalis was the only pathogen in 12 cases (52.2%), with counts ranging from 105 to over 107. Eleven patients (47.8%) had M. catarrhalis and another pathogen: Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=6, including 4 with decreased susceptibility to penicillin), Haemophilus influenzae (n=4 including 3 with susceptibility to amoxicillin), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n=1). All but one of the M. catarrhalis strains were resistant to amoxicillin. When patients with and without other pathogens in addition to M. catarrhalis were compared, no differences were found regarding age, sex, presenting symptoms, comorbid conditions, or chest radiograph findings. A review of the literature demonstrated that M. catarrhalis is becoming increasingly important as a cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract symptoms. M. catarrhalis should be looked for in patients with a cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract symptoms. M. catarrhalis should be looked for in patients with a persistent cough, stasis of respiratory tract secretions, recurrent bronchitis, acute or chronic focal pulmonary abnormalities, middle lobe syndrome, protracted bronchiolitis, asthma, or exacerbations of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as in ventilated and nonventilated infants admitted to intensive care units.","group":"g1","id":"dd3e4c12-75a5-4552-9f6c-e90e9f411cc5","_showDetails":false},"d64f2a35-2d15-4e55-8178-371eec6d6451":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"28425289","title":"Superoxide dismutase: A role in the prevention of chronic lung disease","authors":["Davis J.M."],"date":"1998//","keywords":["*chronic lung disease/co [Complication]","*chronic lung disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","*chronic lung disease/et [Etiology]","*chronic lung disease/pc [Prevention]","conference paper","enzyme localization","gene therapy","lung dysplasia/co [Complication]","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","lung dysplasia/pc [Prevention]","pathogenesis","prematurity","priority journal","recombinant DNA technology","antioxidant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","nitric oxide/cb [Drug Combination]","nitric oxide/dt [Drug Therapy]","oxygen radical/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*superoxide dismutase/cb [Drug Combination]","*superoxide dismutase/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Biology of the Neonate","language":"English","volume":"74","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"S.

For in vivo studies, wild-type (WT) and BRP-39(-/-) mice received continuous exposure to 21% O2 (control mice) or 100% O2 from postnatal (PN) 1 to PN7 days, along with intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administered on alternate days (PN2, -4, and -6). Lung histology, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell counts, BAL protein, and cytokines measurements were performed., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hyperoxia differentially contributed to macrophage polarization by enhancing LPS induced M1 and inhibiting interleukin-4 induced M2 phenotype.

To test the hypothesis that in infants born at <=29 weeks' gestation soluble adhesion molecule concentrations would be higher in the first week of life in infants that subsequently develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia than in infants that do not. Design and Methods. In cord blood and on days of life 1, 3, and 7, we measured serum concentrations of soluble P- Selectin, E-Selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in samples obtained from infants <=29 weeks' gestational age. At 1 month of age we assessed the infants' clinical courses to determine whether the infants met the criteria for the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and evaluated the infants' radiographic studies to stage the level of BPD. On discharge, the duration of oxygen therapy, the requirement for home oxygen therapy, and length of hospital stay were determined. Results. Concentrations of soluble P-Selectin were greatest in cord blood samples obtained from all infants and were markedly reduced on day of life 1, regardless of the subsequent development of BPD. In serum samples obtained from cord blood and on days of life 1 and 3, soluble E-Selectin levels were higher in infants that developed BPD than in infants that did not develop BPD. In addition, the highest concentrations of soluble E-Selectin in serum samples from cord blood and on day of life 1 were associated with the development of stage 3 or 4 BPD. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations were higher on days of life 3 and 7 in the infants that went on to develop BPD than in those that did not. Conclusions. Because neutrophil attachment to endothelial cell adhesion molecules is a key event in the initiation of an inflammatory response, the association of higher early concentrations of soluble E- Selectin with the development of BPD suggests that E-Selectin may play a key role in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation and the development of BPD. This association also suggests that inflammatory events or effects leading to inflammatory responses occurring in the prenatal and/or very early perinatal periods contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"bb5f3dc0-cd2a-4b9d-9ac6-3626836b1d49","_showDetails":true},"40862a77-d929-4864-9e58-770275dd3bf4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"28113464","title":"Role of early postnatal dexamethasone in respiratory distress syndrome","authors":["Mukhopadhyay K.","Kumar P.","Narang A."],"date":"1998//","keywords":["article","artificial ventilation","bleeding tendency/co [Complication]","clinical article","clinical trial","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","disease severity","female","human","human cell","human tissue","hyaline membrane disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","male","newborn","perinatal period","pneumothorax/co [Complication]","randomized controlled trial","*respiratory distress syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","*respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","*steroid therapy","*dexamethasone/ct [Clinical Trial]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"Indian Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"35","number":"2","publisher":"Springer India (Barakhamba Road 110001, New Delhi 110 001, India)","isbn":"0019-6061","address":"A.

Design(s): Prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded study. Setting(s): Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Method(s): 19 babies who had hyaline membrane disease were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were clinical and radiographic diagnosis of RDS, requiring mechanical ventilation and FiO2 > 0.3. Ten babies received injection dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg/dose 12 hourly for 3 days starting within 6 hours of birth. The control group did not receive any drug. Babies with active infection, bleeding tendency and congenital malformation were excluded. None of the babies received surfactant. The duration of ventilation and AaDO2 and FiO2 requirements from day one to five were calculated. Result(s): The initial AaDO2 were similar in both the groups but on day 3, 4, 5 AaDO2 were low in study group (201, 85, 70) compared to control group (236, 209, 162). The initial FiO2 were 0.66 and 0.63 in dexamethasone and control groups, respectively and remained high till day 2 and came down in study group on days 3, 4 and 5 (0.41, 0.27, 0.27) compared to control group (0.53, 0.34, 0.42). The mean duration of ventilation was shorter in dexamethasone group (87 hours) vs control group (120 hours). Conclusion(s): Early use of postnatal dexamethasone reduces the disease severity and oxygen requirement in RDS and hence would be useful in the Indian context.","group":"g1","id":"40862a77-d929-4864-9e58-770275dd3bf4","_showDetails":false},"7cf6989e-c727-421f-9a71-7e214e6d5aee":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"28028676","title":"Protective effect of exogenous transferrin against hyperoxia: A study on premature rabbits","authors":["Shah M.","Bry K.","Hallman M."],"date":"1997//","keywords":["article","capillary permeability","controlled study","dose response","human","human cell","human tissue","*hyperoxia","intravenous drug administration","iron metabolism","lipid peroxidation","lung injury/di [Diagnosis]","lung lavage","newborn","oxidation reduction reaction","*prematurity/th [Therapy]","priority journal","rabbit","albumin","*iron","*lipid peroxide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","oxygen","*oxygen radical/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*transferrin/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"24","number":"6","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.

To test this hypothesis, we studied whether supplementation of transferrin (TF) in premature rabbits would modify the degree of hyperoxic lung injury. Animals, delivered prematurely at 29 days of gestation (term 31 days), were randomized and given either 0.5 g/kg of albumin (Alb) (n = 116) or 0.5 g/kg of iron- free TF (n = 132) intravenously within 2 hours after birth. Another group was randomized to receive saline (n = 15), or either 0.35 g/kg (n = 12) or 0.70 g/kg of iron-free TF (n = 8). After exposure to a 100% oxygen environment for 2 or 4 days, the animals were killed, and plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was recovered. Infusion of TF caused a dose-dependent increase in the concentration of TF and an increase in the unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Administration of TF at birth increased the gradient of TF between serum and alveolar epithelial lining fluid on day 4, suggesting decreased alveolarcapillary permeability. BAL fluid and plasma from TF-supplemented animals contained less lipid peroxidation products and more inhibitor of lipid peroxidation than BAL fluid or plasma from Alb-treated animals. In TF- treated animals, the recovery of protein in BAL fluid (TF group, 1.26 +/- 0.07 mg; Alb group, 1.78 +/- 0.10 mg; P= 0.02) and the water content of the extravascular lung tissue (TF group, 78.5 +/- 1.4%; Alb group, 83.2 +/- 1.3%; P = 0.05) were lower than in Alb-treated animals.

Aerosols can be generated by a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or a jet nebulizer. An MDI combined with a spacer device is easier to use and avoids undesirable effects noted in conjunction with jet nebulization. We compared the clinical effectiveness of 200 mug (2 puffs) salbutamol delivered from an MDI in conjunction with a valved spacer device (Aerochamber(*)), and 600 mug given via jet nebulizer (PariBaby()) on 2 consecutive days, the order being randomized. Thirteen spontaneously breathing very preterm infants [mean (SD) gestational age 27.2 (1.8) weeks; birth weight 0.90 (0.34) kg] were studied at a corrected age of 37 (2.3) weeks. Mean (SD) study weight was 1.83 (0.38) kg. Dynamic lung compliance and resistance were determined from measurements of flows, volumes, and transpulmonary pressures, using a pneumotachometer and a small esophageal microtransducer catheter before and 20 min after salbutamol application. Baseline values before salbutamol administration were similar on both occasions: the mean (SD) compliance was 7.7 (3.0) mL. kPa 1 . kg - 1 pre-MDI plus-spacer and 8.4 (3.1) pre-jet nebulizer; the resistance was 10.4 (4.0) kPa.

We conclude that even in small preterm infants 200 mug salbutamol via MDI plus spacer improves dynamic resistance as effectively as 600 mug via jet nebulizer and may therefore be a preferable mode of aerosol administration.","group":"g1","id":"72b82ebc-a1d1-4080-bbb2-c09d737766df","_showDetails":true},"ea223e57-1433-48c9-92de-70ff57a1590c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"27143602","title":"Early postnatal dexamethasone therapy may lessen lung inflammation in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome on mechanical ventilation","authors":["Wang J.Y.","Yeh T.F.","Lin Y.J.","Chen W.Y.","Lin C.H."],"date":"1997//","keywords":["airway pressure","arterial carbon dioxide tension","article","*artificial ventilation","cell count","clinical article","clinical trial","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","female","human","infant","lung dysplasia/cn [Congenital Disorder]","lung function test","lung lavage","male","newborn","*pneumonia/dt [Drug Therapy]","postnatal care","*prematurity/cn [Congenital Disorder]","priority journal","randomized controlled trial","*respiratory distress syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","*respiratory distress syndrome/th [Therapy]","tracheobronchial toilet","6 oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]","ampicillin","*dexamethasone/ct [Clinical Trial]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","gentamicin","leukotriene B4/ec [Endogenous Compound]","sodium chloride"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"3","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.

Rats and humans differed in water content of their lungs, with rats showing a sharper decline during gestation. In the human lung, collagen and elastin made their appearance at an early stage of gestation; elastin, in particular, increased rapidly during gestation, suggesting a role in intrauterine alveolar formation. In the rat, elastin accumulation is primarily a postnatal event, as is alveolar formation. Hydroxyproline concentrations increased with conceptual age and continued to increase rapidly postnatally between 4 and 7 weeks in the rat, but slowed in the human after 60 weeks of conceptual age. Desmosine concentrations level off at the end of the study period in rats, while these are still increasing, although slowly, in humans.

In addition, the variabilities in the pressures of a simulated airway were compared. A continuous flow (8 L/min) was used to generate CPAP. A Harvard ventilator was used to simulate breathing at a fixed volume (12.1 mL) and rate (45 breaths/min). The pressure drop across and the flow rate through each device were measured, thus allowing the determination of imposed work, i.e., the work of breathing done by the patient to overcome frictional losses due to the NCPAP device. In addition, the pressure fluctuations in the simulated airway were measured. The data presented are averages of 36 breaths using the new device and 34 breaths using the conventional device. The means of the imposed work in the new device and in the conventional device were 0.135 (95% CI +/- 0.004) mJ/breath and 0.510 (95% CI +/- 0.004) mJ/breath (P < 0.01) respectively. The coefficients of variation for pressure in the simulated airway were: new 6.8% and conventional 15.3%. We conclude that the imposed work of the new NCPAP device for the VLBW baby is approximately one-fourth of that of the conventional device. The airway pressure generated by the VLBW size of the new NCPAP device shows less variability during simulated breathing than that found with the conventional device.

Methods - A double blind, placebo controlled study was performed to determine the change in pulmonary ventilation of premature infants with RDS as a result of dexamethasone treatment, and to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone on the levels of surfactant-associated proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) in the tracheal fluid from 34 premature infants with RDS and 29 control subjects. Results - Dexamethasone treatment decreased fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PCO2), mean airway pressure (MAP), and facilitated successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. SP-A concentrations in the tracheal aspirates were increased at days 7 and 14, and SP-D concentrations were increased during the period from days 3 to 14 in the dexamethasone treated group compared with the control group. However, albumin levels in the tracheal aspirate samples were decreased after dexamethasone treatment over the period from days 3 to 14. There was an inverse correlation between PCO2 values and SP-A concentrations. Conclusions - These result suggest that early use of dexamethasone can improve pulmonary status and also increase SP-A and SP-D levels in the tracheal fluid in premature infants with RDS.","group":"g1","id":"18257b33-e56d-4c9b-8f18-ae4970fe3424","_showDetails":true},"5ba94eda-9167-4daa-a14f-2c5614f639dd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Changes in pulmonary tissue structure and KL-6/MUC1 expression in a newborn rat model of hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/01902148.2013.810795","authors":["Zhu, Yuting","Fu, Jianhua","You, Kai","Jin, Linlin","Wang, Min","Lu, Danchi","Xue, Xindong"],"date":"2013//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Gene Expression","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mucin-1/bl [Blood]","Mucin-1/ge [Genetics]","*Mucin-1/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Wistar","Tissue Distribution"],"journal":"Experimental lung research","volume":"39","number":"10","isbn":"0190-2148","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=24298937"],"address":"England","abstract":"Following preterm birth, levels of Krebs von den Lungen-6/mucin 1 (KL-6/MUC1) in serum correlate closely with the development of advanced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the role of KL-6/MUC1 in the development of BPD is unclear. To explore whether a relationship exists between KL-6/MUC1 and pathological changes in BPD and verify such a clinical finding, we established a newborn rat model of 95% oxygen-induced BPD. The development of pulmonary alveoli was evaluated by determining the radial alveolar count (RAC) and examining the location, distribution, and expression of KL-6/MUC1 in pulmonary tissues using a fluorescent immunoassay, Western blot, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The synchronic expression levels of KL-6/MUC1 in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and pulmonary tissues were examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean RAC in the hyperoxia group was significantly lower than in normoxia controls, whereas the expression levels of KL-6/MUC1 were higher. On days 1, 3, 7, and 14, the mean RACs in hyperoxic rats were 15.00, 12.67, 12.00, and 11.33, respectively. The expression levels of KL-6/MUC1 peaked in the experimental group on day 1, and began to decrease slightly after day 3. The expression levels of KL-6/MUC1 in serum and BALF were associated with KL-6/MUC1 expression in pulmonary tissues. We suggest that increased lung KL-6/MUC1 expression appears to be closely associated with impairment of alveolarization in a newborn rat model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. Changes in lung KL-6/MUC1 expression can be evaluated effectively and less invasively by monitoring KL-6/MUC1 in serum and BALF.","group":"g1","id":"5ba94eda-9167-4daa-a14f-2c5614f639dd","_showDetails":true},"838f7788-b3b4-46c6-aeef-552ce83b7006":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"26271006","title":"Vitamin A supplementation in premature neonates with postnatal lung injury","authors":["Bonati M.","Barzago M.M.","Stellari F.F.","Bortolotti A.","Introvini P.","Pagani G.","Palmieri M.","Rezzonica R.","Fedeli T.","Tagliabue P.","Siliprandi N."],"date":"1996//","keywords":["article","artificial ventilation","clinical article","clinical trial","delivery","drug blood level","drug efficacy","female","human","intravenous drug administration","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung dysplasia/pc [Prevention]","*lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung injury/pc [Prevention]","*lung injury/th [Therapy]","male","newborn","newborn intensive care","oral drug administration","*prematurity","treatment outcome","vitamin blood level","*retinol/ct [Clinical Trial]","*retinol/dt [Drug Therapy]","*retinol/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","unclassified drug","idroplurivit/ct [Clinical Trial]","idroplurivit/dt [Drug Therapy]","idroplurivit/pk [Pharmacokinetics]"],"journal":"International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","language":"English","volume":"34","number":"8","publisher":"Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle (P.O.

Twenty-five preterm babies, 24-34 weeks gestation, 600-1770 g birth weight, received 1000 IU/day of vitamin A intravenously for the first 28 days of life.

Even though expected therapeutic plasma concentrations were reached in the majority of infants without exceeding the toxic level, no association was found between vitamin A plasma concentrations and maternal or newborns characteristics at delivery and clinical status or outcome of infants. Thus, even if dosage schedule may be furtherly optimized to reach and maintain wanted therapeutic ranges, the efficacy of routine therapeutic vitamin A supplementation has to be adequately proved.","group":"g1","id":"838f7788-b3b4-46c6-aeef-552ce83b7006","_showDetails":false},"47017ea0-4c58-4b00-a812-7f76402f269e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"26179233","title":"Sixty six years of surfactant research","authors":["Floros J.","Karinch A.M.","Phelps D.S."],"date":"1996//","keywords":["adult","article","host resistance","human","hyaline membrane disease","lung function","medical research","mouse","newborn","nonhuman","prematurity","priority journal","protein structure","respiratory distress syndrome","surface tension","*lung surfactant","protein","surfactant"],"journal":"Applied Cardiopulmonary Pathophysiology","language":"English","volume":"6","number":"1","publisher":"Pabst Science Publishers (Eichengrund 28, Lengerich D-49525, Germany)","isbn":"0920-5268","address":"J.

B. Lachmann and L.M.G. van Golde was held on the River Danube. The purpose of this congress was to promote cross-fertilization of ideas among investigators involved in various aspects of surfactant research. The beginning of surfactant research is marked by Kurt von Neergaard's work in 1929, which suggested that surface tension plays an important role in lung expansion. However, rigorous study of surfactant, the substance that modulates surface tension in the lung, started in the 1950's with the work of several investigators, including Dr. Clements. The clinical correlation of lack of surfactant with hyaline membrane disease in the prematurely born infant was also described in the 1950's by Dr. Avery. Today, we know that surfactant is essential for normal lung function and that surfactant, or its components, are dynamic in nature and complex. Complexity has been observed at structural, functional, molecular, and genetic levels. Although the prematurely born infant has been the centerpiece of surfactant research for the past several decades, recently considerable interest has arisen regarding the role of surfactant in acute respiratory distress in humans of all ages. The topics covered were diverse, ranging from whole animal experimentation to molecular and genetic levels, including work both in basic and clinical science, and clinical trials. Two awards for outstanding poster presentations by a young investigator were given. The basic science award went to Dr. C. Casals for her work on SP-A self-aggregation and structure. The clinical award went to Dr. P.A. Dargeville for addressing the problem of identifying a useful surfactant sampling technique.","group":"g1","id":"47017ea0-4c58-4b00-a812-7f76402f269e","_showDetails":false},"987f98f0-3888-4a1f-94ee-01d87dbfa4c0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"25344018","title":"Controlled trial of dexamethasone in neonatal chronic lung disease: A 3- year follow-up","authors":["Jones R.","Wincott E.","Elbourne D.","Grant A."],"date":"1995//","keywords":["article","child","child death","child development","*chronic lung disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","clinical trial","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","double blind procedure","drug efficacy","human","infection","intravenous drug administration","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung dysplasia/th [Therapy]","major clinical study","mental development","morbidity","oral drug administration","oxygen therapy","priority journal","randomized controlled trial","scoring system","*dexamethasone/ct [Clinical Trial]","*dexamethasone/do [Drug Dose]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"96","number":"5 I","publisher":"American Academy of Pediatrics (141 Northwest Point Blvd, P.O.

We compared the effects of a policy of neonatal steroid administration versus placebo for babies chronically dependent on supplemental oxygen in terms of long-term health and development, judged at 3 years of age. Design. Double-blind randomized controlled trial. Setting. Thirty-one centers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Canada, and the United States. Patients. Babies who were chronically dependent on supplemental oxygen between 2 and 12 weeks of age were recruited to the trial between 1986 and 1989. Sixty-two children were known to have died, 23 before discharge from the hospital and 10 afterward in the active group, compared with 25 and 4, respectively, in the placebo group. Information was available for 209 of the 212 eligible for follow-up (99%). Interventions. A 1-week course of active dexamethasone phosphate 0.6 mg/kg/d (dexamethasone base 0.5 mg/kg/d) or saline placebo was given intravenously (or orally, if no intravenous line). There was an option to give a second tapering 9-day course if relapse occurred after initial improvement. Outcome Measures. Information about respiratory problems, growth, neurodevelopment and disability, infection, and health service use when the children were 3 years old was ascertained from questionnaires to general practitioners, health visitors, and parents (and occasionally pediatricians). Results. About half the children in both groups had been admitted to the hospital for respiratory problems, with more in the active than the placebo group having at least five outpatient consultations for these problems over the 3 years. Overall, the children were below average in height, weight, and head circumference. About one fifth had cerebral palsy, 8% some visual loss, and 16% hearing loss; 18% needed or were anticipated to need special schooling. There were no clear differences between the randomized groups. These overall conclusions were not altered by any of the prespecified secondary analyses. Conclusions. Despite early benefits, there were no clear effects at 3 years of age. As 40% of the placebo group eventually received open steroids, even a trial of this size has limited statistical power to detect a moderate effect of the policy. Regardless of random allocation, overall morbidity was high, confirming that babies with protracted dependence on supplemental oxygen are at high risk of childhood disability and poor health.","group":"g1","id":"987f98f0-3888-4a1f-94ee-01d87dbfa4c0","_showDetails":false},"23702d22-54d5-4736-a2a4-dc54a60bd139":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"25324895","title":"Babyhaler - A new paediatric aerosol device","authors":["Kraemer R."],"date":"1995//","keywords":["aerosol","body weight","breathing pattern","child","childhood disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","clinical article","clinical trial","conference paper","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","*cystic fibrosis/dt [Drug Therapy]","drug administration","drug delivery system","drug formulation","human","*hyaline membrane disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","infant","infant disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","inhalational drug administration","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung function","particle size","patient compliance","pediatrics","pharmaceutics","*respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","tidal volume","topical drug administration","wheezing","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent/ct [Clinical Trial]","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent/ad [Drug Administration]","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent/cm [Drug Comparison]","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent/do [Drug Dose]","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent/pr [Pharmaceutics]","bronchodilating agent/ct [Clinical Trial]","bronchodilating agent/ad [Drug Administration]","bronchodilating agent/cm [Drug Comparison]","bronchodilating agent/do [Drug Dose]","bronchodilating agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","bronchodilating agent/pr [Pharmaceutics]","corticosteroid/ad [Drug Administration]","corticosteroid/dt [Drug Therapy]","*fenoterol/ct [Clinical Trial]","*fenoterol/ad [Drug Administration]","*fenoterol/cm [Drug Comparison]","*fenoterol/do [Drug Dose]","*fenoterol/dt [Drug Therapy]","*fenoterol/pr [Pharmaceutics]","methacholine","placebo/cm [Drug Comparison]","*salbutamol/ct [Clinical Trial]","*salbutamol/ad [Drug Administration]","*salbutamol/cm [Drug Comparison]","*salbutamol/do [Drug Dose]","*salbutamol/dt [Drug Therapy]","*salbutamol/pr [Pharmaceutics]","*terbutaline/ct [Clinical Trial]","*terbutaline/ad [Drug Administration]","*terbutaline/cm [Drug Comparison]","*terbutaline/do [Drug Dose]","*terbutaline/dt [Drug Therapy]","*terbutaline/pr [Pharmaceutics]"],"journal":"Journal of Aerosol Medicine: Deposition, Clearance, and Effects in the Lung","language":"English","volume":"8","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc.

The willingness of a young child to cooperate, however, is limited and the 10-12 mins needed to deliver drug using a nebulizer often limits the compliance with this mode of administration in infants. Therefore, drug delivery systems using the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) as the aerosol generator attached to valved holding chambers were developed. The breathing pattern of a baby with lung disease is quite different from that of older children and adults, for whom most large-volume devices were developed. Infants have a high respiratory frequency, small tidal volume, and low inspiratory airflow rate. Therefore, specific conditions for optimal drug use in this particular group of patients have to be met. Efficacy of topical drug delivery depends on the generation of aerosol particles with an adequate size distribution (technical prerequisites), the breathing pattern of the child (physiological requirements), and the willingness of a young child to cooperate with parental drug administration (practicality and compliance). Infants with lung disease have a tidal volume of 8-10ml/kg body weight. The volume of a spacer device must be such that about 5-10 breaths would be needed to provide an adequate dose. In addition, the dimensions of a spacer device must be such that sufficient drug particles of optimal size will be generated to minimize impaction and deposition within the device. The Babyhaler consists of a tubular chamber 230mm long, with a volume of 350ml and low-resistance inspiratory and expiratory valves. The drug aerosol, which has a mass median diameter of 3.21mum, is contained briefly within the holding chamber to allow the young child to inhale the medication during normal tidal breathing. Face masks used in conjunction with the Babyhaler provide an effective seal. The overall dead space volume was found to be approximately 55ml. Efficacy was demonstrated in several clinical trials that evaluated bronchodilator response to beta2-agonists, functional antagonism against bronchial aerosol challenge and efficacy of topical corticosteroids. These results plus additional handling studies have demonstrated that infants and young children can be treated using the inhalation route, and several important practical problems which previously limited drug compliance have been overcome.","group":"g1","id":"23702d22-54d5-4736-a2a4-dc54a60bd139","_showDetails":false},"490df431-7aba-45d9-ae7e-093aa6cf52b9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"25143899","title":"Surfactant associated protein A determination using a chemiluminescence system - Application to tracheal aspirates from newborns","authors":["Taieb J.","Francoual J.","Magny J.-F.","Fraslon C.","Messaoudi C.","Lindenbaum A.","Bourbon J."],"date":"1995//","keywords":["article","aspiration biopsy","chemoluminescence","clinical trial","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","human","human tissue","*hyaline membrane disease/di [Diagnosis]","infant","major clinical study","methodology","newborn","priority journal","*protein A"],"journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","language":"English","volume":"235","number":"2","publisher":"Elsevier (P.O.

We studied 14 specimens of human lung tissue: from three fetuses, four normal infants, two preterm infants with hyaline membrane disease, and five infants with late bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). EGF, TGF-alpha, and EGF receptor (EGF-R) colocalized in airway epithelium in normal fetal and in postnatal human lung. They were also colocalized in scattered alveolar epithelial cells in postnatal lung. Large numbers of alveolar macrophages immunostained for EGF, TGF-alpha, and EGF R in lungs with late stages of BPD. The colocalization of these growth factors suggests parallel expression of EGF family members. Moreover, the colocalization of these growth factors with their receptor in developing lung suggests that they may act through an autocrine mechanism. The prominent expression of these growth factors in alveolar macrophages in BPD suggests they may be involved with the pathogenesis of this disease.","group":"g1","id":"08f7649d-f40c-478d-abf3-62586b6346c2","_showDetails":true},"3412ae30-1604-4076-b5ca-76a26eeefc27":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"25100345","title":"Chronic pneumonitis of infancy: A unique form of interstitial lung disease occurring in early childhood","authors":["Katzenstein A.-L.A.","Gordon L.P.","Oliphant M.","Swender P.T."],"date":"1995//","keywords":["article","clinical article","clinical feature","female","fetus lung maturation","human","human tissue","infant","*infant disease","inflammatory cell","*interstitial pneumonia/di [Diagnosis]","lung alveolus cell","lung alveolus proteinosis","lung dysplasia","lung fibrosis","male","recurrent infection"],"journal":"American Journal of Surgical Pathology","language":"English","volume":"19","number":"4","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (530 Walnut Street,P O Box 327, Philadelphia PA 19106-3621, United States)","isbn":"0147-5185","address":"A.-L.A.

We have recently shown that, in parallel to reduced ventilatory support, IL-8 levels in tracheobronchial aspirate fluid (TAF) are decreased following dexamethasone treatment. However, it is not known whether this effect is due to a decreased pulmonary production of IL-8 or due to a decreased leakage of IL-8 from plasma. To answer this question, we simultaneously determined IL-8 and albumin-levels in TAF as well as plasma levels of IL-8 in preterm infants at risk for BPD before and after dexamethasone treatment. Additionally, IL-8 levels in TAF were compared to levels of term infants ventilated for nonpulmonary reasons (n = 8). Samples were obtained from 17 neonates at risk for BPD (gestational age 27.4 +/- 0.6 weeks, birth weight 877 +/- 42 g, mean +/- SE), treatment with dexamethasone was initiated at a median of 12 days. Following treatment with dexamethasone, TAF-levels of IL-8 and albumin were significantly reduced (p < 0.01). Plasma levels were 200-fold lower compared with TAF values (p < 0.01), and were not affected by dexamethasone therapy. The results demonstrate, that dexamethasone decreases production and/or secretion of IL-8 within the lung. The benefit of dexamethasone in neonates with BPD may be due to a downregulation of pulmonary inflammation by a decreased local generation of IL-8.","group":"g1","id":"02a496d1-0f42-4a31-bbb9-adca75647161","_showDetails":false},"52caab9b-ad19-4709-9b27-90c1ccaef628":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"2607655","title":"Tryptase immunoreactive mast cell hyperplasia in bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Lyle R.E.","Tryka A.F.","Griffin W.S.","Taylor B.J."],"date":"1995//","keywords":["age","article","enzymology","female","human","hyperplasia","immunohistochemistry","immunology","infant","*lung","*lung dysplasia","male","mast cell","mortality","newborn","pathology","prematurity","autacoid","chymase","monoclonal antibody","*serine proteinase","tryptase","chymase 2"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"19","number":"6","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.

Pathomechanisms contributing to BPD are poorly understood. However, it is assumed that genetic factors predispose to BPD and other pulmonary diseases of preterm neonates, such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). For association studies, genes upregulated during alveolarization are major candidates for genetic analysis, for example, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFR)., OBJECTIVE: Determining genetic risk variants in a Caucasian population of premature neonates with BPD and RDS. Methods. We genotyped 27 polymorphisms within 14 candidate genes via restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP): MMP-1, -2, -9, and -12, -16, FGF receptors 2 and 4, FGF-2, -3, -4, -7, and -18, Signal-Regulatory Protein alpha (SIRPA) and Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1)., RESULTS: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMP-9, MMP-12, FGFR-4, FGF-3, and FGF-7 are associated (P < 0.05) with RDS, defined as surfactant application within the first 24 hours after birth. One of them, in FGFR-4 (rs1966265), is associated with both RDS (P = 0.003) and BPD (P = 0.023)., CONCLUSION: rs1966265 in FGF receptor 4 is a possible genetic key variant in alveolar diseases of preterm newborns.","group":"g1","id":"89e0c3a4-dfaf-4ac7-b88f-c303b4531df0","_showDetails":true},"0cd2e325-88e1-42d8-ba97-37dbacd0508a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"24230350","title":"Effects of dexamethasone on bronchoalveolar inflammatory reaction in preterm infants at high risk for BPD","authors":["Groneck P.","Reuss D.","Goetze-Speer B.","Speer C.P."],"date":"1994//","keywords":["article","clinical article","clinical trial","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","drug effect","human","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung function","neutrophil chemotaxis","newborn","*prematurity","randomized controlled trial","trachea mucus","very low birth weight","chemoattractant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde","language":"German","volume":"142","number":"6","publisher":"Springer Verlag (Tiergartenstrasse 17, Heidelberg D-69121, Germany)","isbn":"0026-9298","address":"P.

The mechanism of this action, however, is not clear. In this study we investigated the effects of dexamethasone on bronchoalveolar inflammation and permeability. Method(s): 24 very low birth weight infants (mean birthweight 892 +/- 36 g, mean gestational age 27.2 +/- 0.3 weeks) who developed signs of beginning BPD on day 10 of postnatal age (FiO2 >= 0.3 and/or PIP >= 16 cm H2O), were randomly assigned to dexamethasone treatment on day 10 or day 16. The effects of this treatment on inflammatory indicators in tracheobronchial secretions were evaluated. The following aspects of inflammation were assessed: 1) Chemotactic activity and number of neutrophils in lung effluent fluid. 2) Concentrations of the chemoattractants leukotriene B4, C5a, and interleukin-8. 3) Concentrations of elastase-alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, and activity of elastase and alpha1-proteinase inhibitor. 4) Concentrations of albumin as a marker of microvascular permeability. Result(s): All inflammatory indicators significantly decreased after treatment with dexamethasone on day 10 and 16, with the exception of leukotriene B4 which decreased only after early treatment. Albumin concentrations also significantly decreased after dexamethasone treatment. Conclusion(s): Dexamethasone decreases the inflammatory pulmonary response and microvascular permeability in infants at risk for BPD.","group":"g1","id":"0cd2e325-88e1-42d8-ba97-37dbacd0508a","_showDetails":true},"ea5908d2-295d-4c0f-9639-f153c56ea393":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"24342833","title":"Surfactant therapy","authors":["Smets K."],"date":"1994//","keywords":["article","drug mechanism","drug metabolism","endotracheal intubation","human","lung dysplasia","lung function","morbidity","mortality","newborn","oxygenation","*respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","*respiratory distress syndrome/pc [Prevention]","lung surfactant","lung surfactant extract","*surfactant/dt [Drug Therapy]","surfactant ta","unclassified drug","c.l.s.e."],"journal":"Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde","language":"Dutch","volume":"50","number":"21","publisher":"Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde (De Pintelaan 185, Gent B-9000, Belgium)","isbn":"0371-683X","address":"K.

The primary indication of its therapeutic use is preventive and/or curative treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in preterm babies. Endotracheal administration of surfactant causes a dramatic improvement in lung function in most 'RDS-infants'. However, in about 70% this effect is only temporary. The short term response to surfactant instillation may have a prognostic significance. Therapeutic failure indicates that other factors than surfactant deficiency play an important role in the pathogenesis of the respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant therapy reduced overall mortality and morbidity in most clinical trials. The effect on duration of hospitalization and on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is still discussed. Experimental and clinical studies clearly demonstrated functional and quantitative deficiencies of surfactant in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Leakage of plasma proteins and progressive modifications in surfactant secretion by the type II alveolar cells play an important role. Although efficacy of surfactant replacement therapy in ARDS has been proven in animal studies, it still remains experimental in humans.","group":"g1","id":"ea5908d2-295d-4c0f-9639-f153c56ea393","_showDetails":false},"834e661b-a57e-4f1f-a3a6-9dcd2bf25efb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"24116431","title":"A mutation in the surfactant protein B gene responsible for fatal neonatal respiratory disease in multiple kindreds","authors":["Nogee L.M.","Garnier G.","Dietz H.C.","Singer L.","Murphy A.M.","DeMello D.E.","Colten H.R."],"date":"1994//","keywords":["article","case report","disease association","female","*frameshift mutation","genetic analysis","homozygosity","human","infant","lung alveolus proteinosis","nucleic acid base substitution","pathogenesis","priority journal","*respiratory distress syndrome/et [Etiology]","*lung surfactant/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","language":"English","volume":"93","number":"4","publisher":"The Journal of Clinical Investigation (P.O.

Data Extraction: Preference given to studies with quantitative end-points to assess damage and causal relationships. Data Synthesis: Related studies are integrated to obtain basic mechanisms of damage where possible. Conclusion(s): Ventilation with high tidal volumes can increase vascular filtration pressures; produce stress fractures of capillary endothelium, epithelium, and basement membrane; and cause lung rupture. Mechanical damage leads to leakage of fluid, protein, and blood into tissue and air spaces or leakage of air into tissue spaces. This process is followed by an inflammatory response and possibly a reduced defense against infection. Predisposing factors for lung injury are high peak inspiratory volumes and pressures, a high mean airway pressure, structural immaturity of lung and chest wall, surfactant insufficiency or inactivation, and preexisting lung disease. Damage can be minimized by preventing overdistention of functional lung units during therapeutic ventilation.","group":"g1","id":"a896f08e-5e0c-46df-9182-9f80f07aae7a","_showDetails":true},"c03ad36b-9a51-4bb4-9d40-e09a0ed97f9f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"24019154","title":"Pneumonia in early childhood","authors":["Roos R."],"date":"1993//","keywords":["asthma","child","childhood disease","conference paper","controlled study","female","human","infant","inhalational drug administration","lung dysplasia","major clinical study","male","*pneumonia/di [Diagnosis]","*pneumonia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*pneumonia/ep [Epidemiology]","*pneumonia/et [Etiology]","Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus","risk factor","virus infection","aminoglycoside antibiotic agent/cb [Drug Combination]","aminoglycoside antibiotic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","ampicillin/cb [Drug Combination]","ampicillin/dt [Drug Therapy]","antibiotic agent/cb [Drug Combination]","antibiotic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","antitussive agent/cb [Drug Combination]","antitussive agent/dt [Drug Therapy]","cefotaxime/cb [Drug Combination]","cefotaxime/dt [Drug Therapy]","ceftazidime/cb [Drug Combination]","ceftazidime/dt [Drug Therapy]","cefuroxime/cb [Drug Combination]","cefuroxime/dt [Drug Therapy]","codeine/cb [Drug Combination]","codeine/dt [Drug Therapy]","erythromycin/dt [Drug Therapy]","mucolytic agent/cb [Drug Combination]","paracetamol/cb [Drug Combination]","paracetamol/dt [Drug Therapy]","penicillin G/dt [Drug Therapy]","ribavirin/ad [Drug Administration]","ribavirin/dt [Drug Therapy]","vancomycin/cb [Drug Combination]","vancomycin/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Atemwegs- und Lungenkrankheiten","language":"German","volume":"19","number":"12","publisher":"Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle (P.O.

Clinical symptoms: Viral pneumonia in early childhood usually means generalized infection, whereas bacterial pneumonia means septicemia. Diagnosis and therapy: Isolation of the infecting agents is sometimes difficult. Blood cultures in bacterial pneumonia are only positive in about 30%. Isolates of tracheal secretions have a low specificity. Therapy for bacterial pneumonia should be started immediately and should follow the same principles as treatment for septicemia. The selection of drugs is empirically. The outcome of viral pneumonia is doubtful, many affected neonates develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

All groups had elevated mean levels of vWF:Ag, compared to adults. Although levels remained stable over the four week period, the group of infants with BPD had a significantly high mean level of vWF:Ag at 21 days than those groups without BPD (p < 0.05). Visual examination of vWF multimer patterns revealed absence of unusually large vWF multimers and triplet patterns suggestive of increased proteolytic degradation of von Willebrand factor. However, densitometer scanning revealed that samples with higher vWF:Ag levels (>200 percent) had increased amounts of moderate to smaller sized multimers, regardless of presence or absence of BPD. It is our conclusion that von Willebrand factor antigen levels are nonspecifically elevated in premature infants and that chronic lung disease is associated with even higher plasma values, possibly owing to pulmonary endothelial injury.","group":"g1","id":"9e5bc6d9-69db-490b-9080-4ca8d3a80099","_showDetails":false},"7af1b98f-efe5-4cad-995c-900d5d54940b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"23185215","title":"Effects of birth order, gender, and intrauterine growth retardation on the outcome of very low birth weight in twins","authors":["Chen S.-J.","Vohr B.R.","Oh W."],"date":"1993//","keywords":["article","birth order","controlled study","female","gender","*gestational age","human","intrauterine growth retardation","lung dysplasia","major clinical study","male","mortality","newborn","priority journal","prognosis","sepsis","twins","*very low birth weight"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"123","number":"1","publisher":"Mosby Inc.

The clinical symptoms of the two diseases are similar, but in the case of CP, ventilatory support alone is not sufficient, early antibiotic therapy also being necessary to prevent sepsis. In a retrospective study we analyzed the medical records of all infants admitted between March, 1986 and March, 1987 with respiratory distress syndrome, with the aim of establishing whether we could differentiate infants with CP from those with HMD, on the basis of the history, lab. findings, x-rays or ventilation parameters. According to the results of bacterial culture on admission and the content of surfactant in the amniotic fluid, two groups were differentiated. Group HMD: Culture negative and a lack of surfactant; 32 infants. Group CP: Positive microbial culture of blood or tracheal aspiration or gastric aspiration; no lack of surfactant in the amniotic fluid; 19 infants. We compared both groups with respect to the following parameters: Gestational age, birth weight, maternal infections, Apgar score, leucocyte count, differential blood count, C-reactive protein, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, peak inspiratory pressure, static compliance, and chest x-ray. There were significant differences between the two groups in birth weight, gestational age, maternal infection, Apgar score, differential blood count and CRP, but no differences in the above-mentioned ventilatory parameters, and static compliance. Our data show that CP mainly affects infants with a higher birth weight and a higher gestational age, whose condition probably deteriorates already in the whomb, as the low Apgar score at 1 minute post partum indicates.

Conclusion(s): Platelet-activating factor plays a role in the protein leak seen in the preterm lung, which contributes to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.","group":"g1","id":"b827dbe7-3714-429c-a473-a37cb553a7ab","_showDetails":false},"b9bb3e99-8f04-495b-80c7-d9af8c4b423e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Neonatal hyperoxic exposure persistently alters lung secretoglobins and annexin A1.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/408485","authors":["Raffay, Thomas M","Locy, Morgan L","Hill, Cynthia L","Jindal, Nik S","Rogers, Lynette K","Welty, Stephen E","Tipple, Trent E"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20130926//","keywords":["Animals","Annexin A1/bi [Biosynthesis]","*Annexin A1/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Gene Expression Regulation","Humans","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Immunity, Innate/ge [Genetics]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Macrophages/me [Metabolism]","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Oxygen/me [Metabolism]","*Proteins/ge [Genetics]","Secretoglobins/bi [Biosynthesis]","*Secretoglobins/ge [Genetics]","*Uteroglobin/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"BioMed research international","volume":"2013","isbn":"2314-6141","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=24187664"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Altered functions of the lung epithelial surface likely contribute to the respiratory morbidities in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Infants with BPD exhibit decreased expressions of secretoglobins (SCGBs), including Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP). Expression of lung SCGB and annexin A1 (ANXA1) is persistently altered in CCSP knockout mice suggesting that CCSP indirectly influences innate immune responses. The present studies tested the hypothesis that neonatal hyperoxic exposure induces deficits in CCSP expression that are associated with persistent alterations in lung SCGB and ANXA1 expression. Newborn C3H/HeN mice were exposed to room air (RA) or 85% O2 from birth and were sacrificed at 14 d or returned to RA for 14 d. Neonatal hyperoxia followed by RA recovery was associated with decreased lung CCSP and SCGB3A1 protein but not mRNA expression. Hyperoxia-induced alterations in the charge characteristics of ANXA1 were unchanged by RA recovery and were associated with elevated lung macrophage numbers. These findings support a model in which hyperoxia-induced alterations in Clara cell function influence lung innate immune function through effects on immunomodulatory proteins. Studies to determine the mechanism(s) by which CCSP alterations affect SCGBs, ANXA1, and innate immune responses in BPD are warranted.","group":"g1","id":"b9bb3e99-8f04-495b-80c7-d9af8c4b423e","_showDetails":true},"80f7a340-71b7-4ed7-a506-a5f709100b11":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"22058855","title":"Dexamethasone increases plasma amino acid concentrations in bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Williams A.F.","Jones M."],"date":"1992//","keywords":["*amino acid blood level","article","catabolism","clinical article","drug effect","human","low birth weight","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","newborn","priority journal","*protein degradation","side effect","*uremia/co [Complication]","*uremia/et [Etiology]","*uremia/si [Side Effect]","alanine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","citrulline/ec [Endogenous Compound]","cystine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*dexamethasone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]","*dexamethasone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","glutamine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","ornithine/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"67","number":"1 SUPPL.","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group (Tavistock Square, London WC1H 9JR, United Kingdom)","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"A.F.

Elastase was detected at least once in 39 of the 65 infants studied. Eleven of these infants were ventilated with > 60% oxygen for > 5 days. In 19 infants, the presence of elastase was associated with positive bacterial and/or viral cultures and/or elevated ratios (> 0.22) of immature neutrophils to total neutrophils. Elastase was not detected in the lung secretions of 26 infants ventilated with > 60% oxygen for < 3 days, suggesting minimal risk for elastic fiber destruction in the intubated infant who neither has pneumonia nor requires prolonged hyperoxic ventilation. The risk for elastic fiber destruction was further evaluated by analyzing sequential urine and tracheal aspirate samples for the presence of an elastolytic degradation product of elastin (desmosine). The biochemical data indicated a potential risk for proteolytic destruction of elastic fibers in association with infection and/or prolonged hyperoxic exposure. In addition, autopsy specimens obtained from three of the infants revealed structurally abnormal lung parenchymal elastic fibers. Because elastic fibers are believed to provide the structural support for alveolar septal development, proteolytic degradation of these fibers may be a significant factor in the impaired lung development that occurs in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"47a8a7c8-39b6-43de-a468-a8e7c34632cb","_showDetails":true},"e9f3b1fc-c109-4c43-bf4e-2dea2eb0906a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"20175804","title":"Effect of fibrinogen degradation products and lung ground substance on surfactant function","authors":["O'Brodovich H.M.","Weitz J.I.","Possmayer F."],"date":"1990//","keywords":["article","*fibrinolysis","human","human cell","*lung edema","priority journal","*fibrinogen","*lung surfactant","*plasminogen"],"journal":"Biology of the Neonate","language":"English","volume":"57","number":"6","publisher":"S.

Increased surface tension can occur because of a relative surfactant deficiency and/or dysfunction. It has been previously demonstrated that surfactant dysfunction occurs when plasma protein inhibitors leak into the alveolar space during the induction of the lung injury and edema formation. The present study investigated whether inhibitors that would be generated during the stage of repair from lung injury could impair surfactant function. We determined whether fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) which would be released during lysis of the fibrin(ogen)-containing alveolar exudate and hyaline membranes, and components of the lungs' ground substance could inhibit the in vitro function of a lipid extract surfactant preparation. FDP were prepared by incubating human fibrinogen with plasmin or neutrophil elastase for 4 min to 60 h and were characterized by SDS-PAGE. Early (fragment X and Y) and late (fragment D and E) plasmin-derived FDP (MW > 40,000) inhibited surfactant function as assessed by a bubble surfactometer. The early elastase-derived FDP also inhibited surfactant, but the later and much smaller fragments (MW < 15,000) did not affect surfactant function. Laminin also inhibited surfactant in a dose-dependent manner. Neither hyaluronic acid nor heparan sulfate affected surfactant performance in vitro. We conclude that plasmin-induced lysis of intraalveolar fibrinogen and hyaline membranes will result in prolonged generation (i.e. days) of surfactant inhibitors. The inhibition of surfactant by these proteins varies with the molecular weight and it is the protein component rather than the carbohydrate component of the ground substance that is responsible for affecting surfactant performance.","group":"g1","id":"e9f3b1fc-c109-4c43-bf4e-2dea2eb0906a","_showDetails":false},"d5fd48d5-fdc8-45c4-ac3b-bac2ea8ea15f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"19252594","title":"Hospital costs of hyaline membrane disease.

The infants had been born with a mean gestational age of 27.6 weeks and a mean birth weight of 0.88 kg. Study weight averaged 1.24 +/- 0.35 kg, and study age averaged 5.5 +/- 2.4 weeks. Requirements for fractional concentration of inspired oxygen averaged 0.41 +/- 0.15 to maintain an oxygen saturation of 0.93 +/- 0.02. The VO2 was measured by means of a commercially available analyzer through a flow-through circuit and pump connected to a hood or in line with the ventilator. Cardiac output was calculated by means of pulsed Doppler ultrasonography. Oxygen saturation was measured by means of transcutaneous pulse oximetry. The coefficient of oxygen utilization was calculated as VO2/SOT. Transfusion consisted of packed erythrocytes (10 ml/kg). Oxygen utilization fell in all subjects after transfusion (p < 0.01), but it fell more substantially in subjects with higher coefficients of oxygen utilization (r = -0.80, p < 0.01), suggesting a physiologic benefit in selected patients, particularly those with higher levels of oxygen utilization. There was also a significant increase in overall systemic oxygen transport (p < 0.01) and decrease in VO2 (p < 0.02). Hemoglobin levels alone did not correlate with overall systemic oxygen transport, VO2, or level of oxygen use before transfusion, and thus did not predict which subjects would have a physiologic benefit from transfusion as reflected by falls in oxygen utilization.","group":"g1","id":"045e078f-90bf-4694-8b1d-275a2477d583","_showDetails":false},"eee00120-aa8a-4008-94f8-88a8f7a72b0d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"17031108","title":"Pulmonary hypertension in the fetus, the newborn and the child","authors":["Morett L.A.","Ortega R."],"date":"1987//","keywords":["child","classification","diagnosis","*echocardiography","fetus","great blood vessel","heart","human","human cell","newborn","pathophysiology","*pulmonary hypertension","respiratory system"],"journal":"Clinics in Perinatology","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"1","isbn":"0095-5108","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0095-5108%2818%2930789-9","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed3&NEWS=N&AN=17031108"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Pulmonary hypertension is a syndrome characterized by high pulmonary vascular resistance.

Therefore, we will focus mainly on the former and then summarize how we diagnose and manage the problem in the fetus. So far there is not a clear definition of pulmonary hypertension in the prenatal patient, but in the newborn, we can define persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) as a condition characterized by severe, labile cyanosis arising from right-to-left shunting across fetal channels due to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance with pulmonary artery pressure elevations to levels equal to or greater than systemic arterial pressure. This may occur as an idiopathic or unexplained disorder or may be associated with a multitude of pathologic conditions, including: meconium aspiration syndrome, shock, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, polycythemia, congenital heart disease, hyaline membrane disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, renal agenesis and renal dysplasia, rhesus (Rh) isoimmunization, fetal hydantoin syndrome, maternal ingestion of prostaglandin inhibitors, nonbacterial endocardial thrombosis, or on a genetic basis. The clinical features may be nonspecific, but most newborns with PPH are full-term or premature infants who are small for gestational age, and products of pregnancies complicated by toxemia, prolonged gestation, maternal hypertension, hydramnios, and so forth. Infants typically present with perinatal asphyxia, marked cyanosis, acidosis, right ventricular heave, intercostal retractions, and increased anteroposterior chest diameter.

Bacterial clearance is impaired due both to the numerical deficiency of alveolar macrophages and due to their decreased microbicidal activity in the first week of life. Effective recruitment of granulocytes to foci of lung infection is impeded by decreased release of complement-derived and alveolar macrophage-derived chemotactic factors and by limited bone marrow granulocyte reserves. Granulocytes that do reach the site of infection have decreased microbicidal activity. Hyperoxia and barotrauma exacerbate lung injury by triggering a generalized but not directed influx of circulating phagocytes, impair alveolar macrophage and granulocyte function, and may trigger inappropriate release of oxygen radicals and toxic enzymes by these cells.

EcoRI digestion of the DNA of the nurse's isolate and of 34 of the 35 infant isolates revealed that no two were identical. LBW seropositive infants were randomized to receive either seronegative blood products or blood products from random donors; there was no significant difference in the number of acquired CMV infections. There were no deaths among 18 infants with acquired CMV infection. Hepatosplenomegaly and worsening bronchopulmonary dysplasia developed in one LBW infant. These results prove that nosocomial transmission of CMV did not occur frequently during the 3-year period.","group":"g1","id":"5e481056-a279-4cbc-83a1-a7121b517f7c","_showDetails":false},"416bc8cc-35b5-4a13-938a-dcc6c51d7efb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"16214808","title":"The use of profile analysis in the evaluation of neonatal care","authors":["Cuttini M.","De Vonderweid U.","Giglio L."],"date":"1985//","keywords":["child","*child health care","diagnosis","economic aspect","epidemiology","human","Italy","*morbidity","*mortality","*newborn","organization and management","perinatology","prevention","short survey","social aspect","therapy","*profile"],"journal":"Rivista Italiana di Pediatria","language":"Italian","volume":"11","number":"3","isbn":"0392-5161","address":"Istituto per l'Infanzia 'Burlo Garofolo' a Carattere Scientifico, Cattedra di Puericultura, Universita di Trieste, 34137 Trieste Italy","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed3&NEWS=N&AN=16214808"],"abstract":"Profile analysis is one of the main strategies recommended by the Professional Standards Review Organizations for the evaluation of health services. It is a presentation of aggregated data, relative both to process and to outcome, in a format which displays patterns of use of health services over a defined period of time. As it often utilizes routinely collected data, it represents a simple and economical tool for the continuous monitoring and evaluation of medical services. Its main advantage is the early identification of problem areas where to address more specific audit interventions. The purpose of the present paper is to give an example of the application of profile analysis to the evaluation of the Perinatal Service of Trieste. Most of the data that are used have been collected within the Collaborative Multicentric Study of Perinatal Preventive Medicine (MPP1) supported by the Italian Research Council; some others, on neonatal mortality and morbidity, come from the routine collection of data in our service. The process variables we have chosen are: use of cardiotocography and amnioscopy, number of cesarean sections for all indications and for fetal distress, number of operative vaginal deliveries, percentage of alcalinization and umbilical vein catheterization in newborns presenting with an Apgar score of 4 or less at the first minute, number of determinations of hemoglobin and blood glucose after birth. The outcome variables are: perinatal mortality, total and corrected (excluding deaths due to congenital malformations) neonatal mortality, birth weight specific neonatal mortality, prematurity, low birth weight, birth asphyxia, hyaline membrane disease and 'neonatal diseases' in general. The outcome data show a good level of neonatal health in our service: the number of at-risk patients, the incidence of neonatal disorders, total and birth weight specific neonatal mortality have decreased over the years to values that are comparable with the best figures reported in the literature. The process data show an extensive use of technology, like cardiotocography, in the management of labor and delivery. The frequency of cesarean sections has increased, with a corresponding reduction of the number of operative vaginal deliveries. The pediatric staff applies invasive therapeutical procedures in the delivery room less and less frequently. On the other hand, the number of simple diagnostic tests, like hemoglobin and blood glucose determinations, is rising, without a corresponding increase in the incidence of anemia and hypoglicemia. This may represent a form of hyperutilization of ready available procedures. In conclusion, the application of profile analysis to the Perinatal Service of Trieste demonstates the advantages of this strategy for the evaluation of both outcomes and staff attitudes. Profile monitoring does not allow, in general, to establish causal relationships between patterns of care and outcomes, or to draw definite conclusions on the quality of care: it must be considered a simple and powerful preliminary step to more specific studies.","group":"g1","id":"416bc8cc-35b5-4a13-938a-dcc6c51d7efb","_showDetails":true},"815abe5e-0999-421f-966f-728ac7dce0a1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"15029195","title":"Histometrical evaluation on the degree of lung growth and development of human premature babies","authors":["Saito M.","Saito K."],"date":"1985//","keywords":["autopsy","case report","diagnosis","*growth","histology","histometry","human","*lung","lung development","newborn","pregnancy","*prematurity","respiratory system","lung acinus"],"journal":"Acta Neonatologica Japonica","language":"Japanese","volume":"21","number":"2","isbn":"0029-0386","address":"First Department of Pathology, Akita University School of Medicine, Hondo, Akita City Japan","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed3&NEWS=N&AN=15029195"],"abstract":"To elucidate causes of respiratory failure in human premature babies, the degree of their lung growth and development was histometrically evaluated. The parameter estimation of the fetal lung acinus described in the foregoing paper applied to 42 autopsy cases of stillborn babies and liveborns who died within 4 days after birth. Their gestational age varied from 17 to 42 weeks. Twelve of the 42 cases were pathologically diagnosed as associated with neonatal hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The results are as follows: In the human fetal lung the acinar size increases consicuously during the late gestational period. While it is only 67 mu at 17 weeks, it attains to 300 mu and 500 mu at 28 weeks and term. At 17-19 weeks terminal airspace derived from an end of respiratory bronchiole begins successive dichotomy in its extremity. The number of generation of the terminal airspaces becomes 4 at 32-34 weeks that remains unchanged untill term. Around the 25th week of gestation shallow primitive alveoli are formed in the lateral walls of terminal airspaces. Then mean depth and diameter of fetal alveoli reach 29.6mu and 43.0mu at term. In 30 cases without hyaline membrane disease (non-HMD cases) the mean wall thickness T of terminal airspaces decreases in a steep and later steady curve with gestational age. T is 43mu, 20mu and 10 mu at 17-19 weeks, 31 weeks and term. In the non-HMD cases the surface area S0 of terminal airspaces in a unit volume of the lung acinus is 55 mm2/mm3 at term, whereas it is 30 mm2/mm3 in 17-19 weeks' gestation. S0 increases in contrast to decreasing T. The mean T of the wall thickness T of terminal airspaces was calculated in the HMD and non-HMD groups. Both gestational age and body weight were almost matched for the two groups. T is 26.4mu in the former group, a significantly larger value than 19.1mu in the latter (p < 0.005). The thickness of hyaline membranes was excluded on calculation of T in the HMD group. Three of the 12 HMD cases are particularly notable because of their much larger T, almost twice as that of the non-HMD cases. When lung sections of these 3 cases were observed, the terminal airspaces appeared to have thick and more immature walls with close resemblance to those of younger fetus. It implies that some of the HMD cases would reveal frank immaturity in internal structure of the lung acinus.","group":"g1","id":"815abe5e-0999-421f-966f-728ac7dce0a1","_showDetails":false},"837f3583-24ac-48c8-b403-cd33e5f988c8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"14086292","title":"Pulmonary air leak associated with neonatal hyponatremia in premature infants","authors":["Mohan P.","Rojas J.","Davidson K.K.","Lindstrom D.P.","Menzies-Henry C.","Bond J.","Cotton R.B."],"date":"1984//","keywords":["*artificial ventilation","clinical article","etiology","heart","human","*hyaline membrane disease","*hyponatremia","low birth weight","lung fluid","newborn","*pneumomediastinum","*pneumopericardium","*pneumothorax","prematurity","respiratory system"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"105","number":"1","isbn":"0022-3476","address":"Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37236 United States","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed3&NEWS=N&AN=14086292"],"abstract":"Pulmonary air leak (pneumothorax, interstitial air dissection, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium) constitutes the most important complication in the ventilator management of hyaline membrane disease. It is generally recognized that the incidence has increased substantially during the past 10 years, resulting in increased neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is likely that this increase is related in part to improved survival. In addition, the use of continuous distending airway pressure, which has contributed to the improvement in survival, has played a role in the increased incidence of air leak. This increase has also been associated with simultaneous changes in fluid management in pregnant mothers during labor. There is evidence that increased lung water content in HMD is related both to disease severity and to susceptibility to air leak and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The onset of diuresis heralds the improvement of oxygenation and pulmonary function, and it is possible that fluids administered intravenously to the mother prior to delivery may influence the lung water status in the infant. Such a process might be aggravated when boluses of fluid are administered in an attempt to decrease uterine contractions at a time when the mother may have impaired ability to excrete a water load. Our purpose was to identify factors associated with air leak in infants with HMD and birth weight <1250 gm, receiving mechanical ventilation. Specific relationships between air leak and factors influencing lung water status were sought.","group":"g1","id":"837f3583-24ac-48c8-b403-cd33e5f988c8","_showDetails":false},"ee254aa8-798a-46fa-bf9c-29c4f5edf711":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"14041824","title":"High-frequency ventilation compared to conventional positive-pressure ventilation in the treatment of hyaline membrane disease in primates","authors":["Bell R.E.","Kuehl T.J.","Coalson J.J.","Ackerman Jr. N.B.","Null Jr. D.M.","Escobedo M.B.","Yoder B.A.","Cornish J.D.","Nalle L.","Skarin R.M."],"date":"1984//","keywords":["*airway pressure","animal experiment","ape","fetus","*gas exchange","generator","*high frequency ventilation","*hyaline membrane disease","*intermittent positive pressure ventilation","nonhuman","*positive end expiratory pressure","primate","respiratory system","therapy"],"journal":"Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"12","number":"9","isbn":"0090-3493","address":"Department of Pediatrics, Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center, San Antonio, TX 78236 United States","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00003246-198409000-00017","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed3&NEWS=N&AN=14041824"],"abstract":"High-frequency ventilation (HFV) has been suggested as an alternative to conventional positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) in the treatment of infants with hyaline membrane disease (HMD).

All animals had clinical and radiographic evidence of HMD. At 96 h of life, all animals were sacrificed and clinical and pathological findings were analyzed. During the first 10 h of the experiment, the HFO animals required higher mean proximal airway pressures than either the HFFI or PPV groups. However, both the HFFI and HFO animals had higher Pao2/Pao2 ratios than the PPV controls, suggesting earlier saccular recruitment. Thus, HFV is as effective as PPV in the treatment of HMD in baboons.

It is an abnormal condition associated with a variety of pulmonary disorders and represents a manifestation of underlying pulmonary pathology rather than a disease entity per se. The incidence of atelectasis accompanying several common respiratory disorders in childhood are listed in Table 1. The greater frequency of atelectasis in infants with meconium aspiration or bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with older children with asthma or cystic fibrosis can be explained by several properties of the developing lung in childhood. The smaller and more collapsible airways, the more compliant chest wall, and the lack of channels for collateral ventilation in infancy predispose younger children to atelectasis once airway obstruction develops. The clinician who identifies atelectasis in a child must determine the mechanism by which atelectasis developed, the functional significance of the collapsed lung, and the etiology responsible for its presence. This article provides a framework to help physicians address these issues and thereby elect the most rational diagnostic and therapeutic interventions at the most appropriate time. In keeping with the general theme of this issue, atelectasis arising from disorders of the pediatric airway is considered in most detail.","group":"g1","id":"e2829e67-9114-4fbd-8c94-c736ecd7baed","_showDetails":true},"a6733719-15b4-4fb8-9f78-1fd76c17520e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"13204635","title":"Complications of positioning and chest physiotherapy","authors":["Tyler M.L."],"date":"1982//","keywords":["*complication","human","*physiotherapy","*postural drainage","respiratory system","review","therapy","*thorax"],"journal":"Respiratory Care","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"4","isbn":"0020-1324","address":"Resp.

CPT consists of one or more of the following: therapeutic positioning, percussion, vibration and coughing. In therapeutic positioning, also called postural or bronchial drainage, the position of choice is 'good'-lung-down,-'bad'-lung-up, and positioning is gaining in popularity as a means of enhancing air entry into alveoli that have collapsed as a result of localized conditions. Complications of CPT have been infrequently reported but are severe when they occur. Some of these are massive pulmonary hemorrhage, perhaps caused by clots dislodged during percussion, a decrease in Pao2 from positioning the 'bad' lung down, and rib fractures in a neonate with hyaline membrane disease. Percussion and vibration should not be done when bright red hemoptysis is present and recent, and head-down positioning should be used cautiously and only when the affected lung is uppermost. Adverse physiologic effects associated with CPT occur in a small proportion of the patients studied and generally are of modest clinical significance. Some that have been reported are an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), a fall in Pao2, a decrease in cardiac output, which may make CPT hazardous in the first 24 hours after a procedure like mitral valve replacement, a fall in FEV'1, possibly caused by percussion without the prior administration of a bronchodilator, a fall in specific airways conductance, and a decrease in total lung/thorax compliance. Patients with increased ICP, hypoxemia, cardiovascular or hemodynamic instability, and marked bronchospasm should be treated with extreme caution and monitored carefully. Recognition of the nature and potential for the complications and adverse effects of CPT allows the therapist to modify therapy so that it may be safely administered to both the critically and the chronically ill.","group":"g1","id":"a6733719-15b4-4fb8-9f78-1fd76c17520e","_showDetails":false},"3b0e0034-b9f7-480a-9cd7-8cce89fb7e0e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"13199402","title":"Theoretical considerations on measuring colloid-osmotic pressure","authors":["Pfeiffer H.G.","Linsenmeier M.","Kolb E."],"date":"1982//","keywords":["*adult respiratory distress syndrome","*injury","intensive care","*lung edema","*oncotic pressure","*respiratory failure","respiratory system","theoretical study"],"journal":"Intensivbehandlung","language":"German","volume":"7","number":"3","isbn":"0341-3063","address":"Inst.

Indicative of this situation are the numerous descriptive syndromes (e.g., adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, capillary leak syndrome, fluid lung, stiff lung, Da Nang lung, pulmonary hyaline membrane disease). Animal models cannot yet amply imitate the multifactorial pathophysiology of a patient with polytrauma in intensive care, and the clinician has not yet been able to explain the complex syndrome in all its genetic causality. The interstitial edema results from the increased input of fluid from the intravascular space. Thus the regulation of these gradients or the capillary membranes must be pathologically altered. In addition, endogenous defense mechanisms can fail. The transcapillary-acting gradients, both intravascularly and interstitially, are the colloid-osmotic pressure and the hydrostatic pressure. Starling formulated their interaction in the hypothesis bearing his name today and still considered generally valid. Other factors, which were defined by Starling more than half a century ago, include the plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP), the pericapillary interstitial hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures, and the filtration coefficient. Clinical studies consider COP to be a very important prognostic factor as regards the pulmonary function and survival in intensive care patients.","group":"g1","id":"3b0e0034-b9f7-480a-9cd7-8cce89fb7e0e","_showDetails":false},"4c35760e-a056-441a-9bf2-8e762e1d3708":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1980 to 1987>","accession":"11046439","title":"Decreased umbilical cord serum ceruloplasmin concentrations in infants with hyaline membrane disease","authors":["Omene J.A.","Longe A.C.","Ihongbe J.C.","Glew R.H.","Holzman I.R."],"date":"1981//","keywords":["case report","diagnosis","*hyaline membrane disease","newborn","respiratory system","*umbilical cord blood","*ceruloplasmin","*superoxide dismutase"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"99","number":"1","isbn":"0022-3476","address":"Dept.

The concentration of ceruloplasmin in serum is markedly age dependent and tends to parallel the concentration of copper. Cord blood from uncomplicated term deliveries contains a concentration of ceruloplasmin significantly below that of the adult and a similarly reduced copper concentration. The concentration of copper in premature infants tends to be low at birth and increases over the first 12 weeks of age. It has been postulated that there may be an association between a low ceruloplasmin concentration in premature infants and the concentration of copper. The studies of Gitlin and Biasucci suggest that a significant increase in ceruloplasmin concentration occurs after 26 weeks of gestation. During the course of pregnancy, the concentration of both ceruloplasmin and copper increases in maternal serum. During a recent survey of ceruloplasmin concentrations in Nigerian children with protein malnutrition, we analyzed serum from several infants with HMD.

As losses from stillbirths, intrapartum asphyxia, and hyaline-membrane disease diminish, major congenital anomalies emerge as the most important causes of mortality in infants of diabetic mothers. The overall incidence of major anomalies was 6 to 9 per cent in several large studies of such infants - three to four times that found in a general neonatal population. Fetal malformations occur before eight weeks of gestation (postmenstrual dates), when most diabetic pregnant women have not yet come to medical attention. Until recently, there has been no objective method to assess control of diabetes retrospectively during this important phase of embryogenesis. Hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) is a normal minor hemoglobin that is distinguished from hemoglobin A by the addition of a glucose moiety to the amino-terminal valine of the beta chain. Glycosylation of hemoglobin A occurs during circulation of the red cell. Expressed as a percentage of total hemoglobin, the level of HbA(1c) is dependent on the average concentration of glucose to which the red cell has been exposed during its life cycle. Measurement of HbA(1c) provides an integrated, retrospective index of glucose control, reflecting the mean blood glucose concentration over the four to eight weeks before its measurement. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diabetic women delivering infants with major congenital anomalies had higher HbA(1c) values in early pregnancy than did women delivering infants who were free of anomalies; such a finding would suggest a more severe derangement of metabolic control in the former group. Our results revealed a significantly higher incidence of major congenital anomalies in the offspring of women with elevated HbA(1c) values, and we conclude that poorly controlled diabetes is associated with an increased risk of such anomalies.","group":"g1","id":"d7c09101-4209-4f23-acbf-aa78b9e59960","_showDetails":true},"81a2c9fb-ec41-44e3-bbab-9e9e3e70e8f7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"[Chronic morbidities of premature newborns].","journal":"Orvosi hetilap","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1556/OH.2013.29709","authors":["Balla, Gyorgy","Szabo, Miklos"],"date":"2013//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Cerebral Hemorrhage/et [Etiology]","Cerebral Hemorrhage/me [Metabolism]","Cerebral Hemorrhage/th [Therapy]","*Cerebral Hemorrhage","Cerebral Ventricles","*Chronic Disease","Dietary Carbohydrates/me [Metabolism]","Gestational Age","Humans","Hungary/ep [Epidemiology]","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Infant, Newborn","Leukomalacia, Periventricular/et [Etiology]","Leukomalacia, Periventricular/me [Metabolism]","Leukomalacia, Periventricular/th [Therapy]","*Leukomalacia, Periventricular","*Neovascularization, Pathologic/co [Complications]","Premature Birth/ep [Epidemiology]","*Premature Birth","Quality of Life","Retinopathy of Prematurity/et [Etiology]","Retinopathy of Prematurity/me [Metabolism]","Retinopathy of Prematurity/th [Therapy]","*Retinopathy of Prematurity","Risk Factors","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/de [Drug Effects]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"volume":"154","number":"38","isbn":"0030-6002","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=24036018"],"address":"Hungary","abstract":"The most important chronic morbidities of premature newborns, deeply influencing quality of life, are retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia.

Effective prevention is based on detailed knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of these special diseases having multifactorial nature sharing several common risk factors, and one is the pathological angiogenesis. This sensitive system is affected by several stress situations which are the consequences of prematurity leading to abnormal vascular growth. After birth, relative hyperoxia, compared to intrauterine life, and decreasing concentrations of vascular growth factors result in vascular injury, moreover, may cause vessel apoptosis. The consequence of this phenomenon is the activation of hypoxia responsible genes resulting in robust pathological neovascularization and organ damage during the later phase.

The uncritical application of air with a high saturation of oxygen caused one of the most serious instances of iatrogenic damage in the history of medicine and resulted in blindness; the uncritical application of too small a saturation caused deaths from hyaline membrane disease and the sequelae of hypoxia of the brain.

We examined eNAMPT (extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), a critical inflammatory DAMP and TLR4 ligand, as a potential therapeutic target to reduce IAI severity and improve adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes. Methods: Blood/tissue samples were examined in: 1) women with histologically-proven chorioamnionitis, 2) very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates, and 3) a preclinical murine pregnancy model of IAI. Groups of pregnant IAI-exposed mice and pups were treated with an eNAMPT-neutralizing mAb. Results: Human placentas from women with histologically-proven chorioamnionitis exhibited dramatic NAMPT expression compared to placentas without chorioamnionitis. Increased NAMPT expression in whole blood from VLBW neonates (day 5) significantly predicted BPD development. Compared to untreated LPS-challenged murine dams (gestational day 15), pups born to eNAMPT mAb-treated dams (gestational days 15/16) exhibited a > 3-fold improved survival, reduced neonate lung eNAMPT/cytokine levels, and reduced development and severity of BPD and pulmonary hypertension (PH) following postnatal exposure to 100% hyperoxia days 1-14. Genome-wide gene expression studies of maternal uterine and neonatal cardiac tissues corroborated eNAMPT mAb-induced reductions in inflammatory pathway genes. Discussion: The eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory pathway is a highly druggable contributor to IAI pathobiology during pregnancy with the eNAMPT-neutralizing mAb a novel therapeutic strategy to decrease premature delivery and improve short- and long-term neonatal outcomes. eNAMPT blood expression is a potential biomarker for early prediction of chronic lung disease among premature neonates.

Animal models of hyperoxia-associated lung injury (HALI) are characterized by enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an adaptive antioxidant response. ROS contribute to pathogenesis, partly through enhancing pro-inflammatory activity in macrophages. Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein whose expression lowers mitochondrial superoxide (O2i-) production. UCP2, therefore, has potential to contribute to antioxidant response. It is inducible in macrophages., OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We hypothesized that induction of UCP2 occurred in response to pulmonary hyperoxia in vivo and that expression localized to pulmonary macrophages. We then investigated mechanisms of UCP2 regulation in hyperoxia-exposed macrophages in vitro and correlated changing UCP2 expression with mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTApsim) and O2i- production., RESULTS: UCP2 is induced in lungs of mice within 1 h of hyperoxia exposure. Induction occurs in pulmonary alveolar macrophages in vivo, and can be replicated in vitro in isolated macrophages. UCP2 mRNA does not change. UCP2 increases quickly after the first hyperoxia-induced burst of mitochondrial O2i- generation. Suppression of DELTApsim and mitochondrial O2i- production follow and persist while UCP2 is elevated., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Induction of UCP2 is an early response to hyperoxia in pulmonary macrophages. The mechanism is post-transcriptional. UCP2 induction follows a transient rise in mitochondrial ROS generation. The subsequent falls in DELTApsim and mitochondrial O2i- support the notion that regulable UCP2 expression in macrophages acts to contain mitochondrial ROS generation. That, in turn, may limit inappropriate pro-inflammatory activation in HALI.","group":"g1","id":"1b0c21bd-8c51-4c3f-8970-d4e77cb2259a","_showDetails":true},"ad92789f-6e6a-4815-8220-0dfae6be9899":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1974 to 1979>","accession":"8304332","title":"Pathoanatomical aspects of oxygen intoxication (normobaric hyperoxia).

Pulmonary hyaline membranes after normobaric hyperoxia must be regarded as the sequel of an increased permeability of the lung capillaries with exudation of plasma in a generalized clotting activity. From the acute changes the chronic proliferative conditions must be differentiated. These appear especially in prematurely born children in the form of retrolental fibroplasia, the cause of which is an arterial vasoconstriction induced by oxygen. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and fibrosis of the lungs are also late sequels of normobaric hyperoxia and should be looked upon as reactive and reparative changes. In spite of thoroughgoing researches the pathogenetic mechanism that leads to changes after normobaric hyperoxia is far from clear. The relevance for humans of changes that can be very satisfactorily reproduced experimentally has not been finally elucidated as - in the contradistinction to animal experiment - a primarily damaged insufficient lung makes oxygen therapy necessary.

Hyaline membrane disease now appears to be the clinical and morphologic expression of an immature lung forced to adapt to extrauterine life. The dilated bronchioles, the thick interstitial septa, and the small surface area for gas exchange seen in histologic sections are the primary abnormalities. The hyaline membranes are secondary and are the residua of pulmonary edema, which probably occurs, in part, as a consequence of the markedly subatmospheric intrapulmonary pressure produced as the infant makes increasingly vigorous inspiratory efforts. Low concentrations of plasma proteins may enhance fluid leakage in the premature lung, as noted by Bland. Bland and associates have also emphasized the necessity of restricting fluid intake if pulmonary edema is to be avoided in premature infants. If pulmonary edema is avoided, the maturation of the immature lung probably occurs only 24 to 36 hr after delivery, the same interval as is required for maturation when glucocorticoids are given in utero; however, if the lung is injured by too vigorous assistance to ventilation, excessive intravascular fluid, prolonged hypoxemia and hypercapnia, or if the infant is forced to make increasingly strong respiratory efforts, transudation of fluid into the interstitial and air spaces of the lung may be increased and the course of the disease prolonged.","group":"g1","id":"5733f0cf-ef93-48aa-b7ce-ab788339d9a7","_showDetails":false},"dba1a40c-8e24-4b30-8dc5-814aaf94ccb3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1974 to 1979>","accession":"8234537","title":"Blood coagulation and pulmonary function","authors":["Mammen E.F."],"date":"1977//","keywords":["*blood clotting","*disseminated intravascular clotting","*fat embolism","*hyaline membrane disease","*lung embolism","*lung function","review","*thrombosis"],"journal":"International Anesthesiology Clinics","language":"English","volume":"15","number":"4","isbn":"0020-5907","address":"Dept.

As in pulmonary fibrin embolism, pulmonary fat embolism is also a much more frequently encountered complication of skeletal fractures or burns. The intravascular presence of fat droplets seems to activate the hemostatic mechanism, resulting in a progressively increasing obstruction of the pulmonary microcirculation. The recognition of early signs of respiratory failure possibly indicates this ongoing process. High doses of steroids were found to interrupt and prevent this process. Pulmonary platelet emboli are the early signs of a consumption coagulopathy that can develop as a complication of a variety of underlying diseases that trigger this activation. Again, the recognition of early respiratory dysfunction can lead to an early diagnosis of consumption coagulopathy, which will improve the patient's chance for survival.

The aims and virtues of ET are described, followed by a discussion of theoretical and practical problems and the various types of blood used. The various complications and accidents are listed. Finally, biological effects on the neonatal organism are studied. A first chapter lists the physico-chemical changes caused by ET: hemodynamic changes, effects on blood picture, changes of blood mass, fluid compartments and plasma volume as well as blood cells. Effects on tissue oxygenation by changes of the PO2-50 (advantage of heparinized blood but theoretical risk of reducing erythropoiesis). Metabolic effects: proteins (few important changes); carbohydrates: hypoglycemia after ET with ACD (acid citrate dextrose) blood (proving necessity of immediate feeding); lipids (disadvantage of heparinization which stimulates lipoprotein-lipase and consequently increases the blood FFA (free fatty acids) and decreases the bilirubin-albumin link). Mention is made of the effect on the electrolytes (theoretical uselessness of injection of Ca) and on the acid base balance (acidosis-alkalosis sequence with ACD, stability with heparin). The temperature of the blood administered is important. Plasma variations and most hormonal secretions are affected, the choice of the umbilical venous or arterial pathway is important. The effects vary: reactions of premature babies frequently differ from those born at or after term. The second chapter deals with effects and efficacy of ET and accordingly with its limits assessed by bilirubin epuration (elimination in direct correlation with the plasma level) ET is indicated in certain frequent, severe pathological conditions at birth: infection and septicemia (very good effects); abnormal neonatal adaptation: acute cerebral affection (good effects); states of shock, abnormal blood picture, respiratory distress due to hyaline membrane disease (effects variable and disputed, fair at best). Finally, reference is made to ET in certain conditions (severe hepatic failure, hyperammoniemia, amino-acidopathies, intoxications) in which as a rule ET has little effect. In spite of the progressive eradication of Rhesus disease, ET has not outlived its usefulness; heparinized or CPD blood is to be preferred.","group":"g1","id":"286de8eb-45a1-462c-a3a9-0435c567205d","_showDetails":false},"2c964657-939b-4a81-80d7-9efcba0b7835":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1974 to 1979>","accession":"5191302","title":"Pharmacological approaches to the acceleration of fetal lung maturation","authors":["Avery M.E."],"date":"1975//","keywords":["*adverse drug reaction","*amnion fluid","*fetus","*gestational age","*hyaline membrane disease","*monkey","*placental transfer","*pregnancy","*rabbit","*sheep","*betamethasone","*corticosteroid","*corticotropin","*dexamethasone","*diamorphine","*glucocorticoid","*hydrocortisone","*isoflupredone","*isoxsuprine","*lung surfactant","*methylprednisolone","*pilocarpine","*thyroxine"],"journal":"British Medical Bulletin","language":"English","volume":"31","number":"1","isbn":"0007-1420","address":"Dept.

The fundamental problem in the disease is assumed to be surfactant deficiency, either on the basis of immaturity or on the basis of postnatal utilization in excess of the capacity for adequate synthesis. In either event, it is assumed that differentiation of alveolar type II cells would be essential for continued production of the surfactant that is, in turn, essential for normal lung function. The salient features of the work described to date are that cortisol, even in physiological concentrations, would appear to be a means of accelerating lung maturity, and indeed would appear to be the critical timer of lung maturation in the event of premature onset of labour. It is equally apparent that the lung can mature in the absence of fetal cortisol production, as in infants born with congenital adrenal hyperplasia or congenital absence of the adrenals. Continued increased cortisol activity is certainly not necessary for on going surfactant synthesis since, once the capability of the cells to make the surfactant is achieved, there is no need for continued administration. Thus, it would appear that cortisol is a switch or a timer of lung maturity. The ability to detect the likelihood of the disease by the measurement of the L:S (lecithin; phosphatidylcholine:sphingomyelin) ratio in the amniotic fluid or by the 'shake test' (Clements, Platzker, Tierney, 1972) enables one to identify infants at risk with reasonable certainty. A protein component of the pulmonary surfactant has been identified, and, if it proves to be specific, should provide an even better means of assessing lung maturity from amniotic fluid. If it is safe from the maternal point of view to delay labour for 24 hours or more, it would appear useful to try administration of glucocorticoid to the mother in an attempt to induce the capacity for surfactant synthesis by the fetal lung. The evidence to date suggests that administration of cortisol before 32 weeks of gestation will be beneficial and there is no reason to believe that it would not be beneficial after 32 weeks in the case of infants who are at risk. The use of betamethasone is probably to be preferred pending further studies, since it is less likely to be protein bound and may cross the placenta more readily than does cortisol. Evidence on that point is not conclusive, however. The observations are consistent with the generalization that there may be hormonal or drug induced alterations in the timing of maturity of certain types of cells.","group":"g1","id":"2c964657-939b-4a81-80d7-9efcba0b7835","_showDetails":false},"b3e9f8e2-72e5-44cc-901b-af76376d65b4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1974 to 1979>","accession":"6093636","title":"Radiologic diagnosis of massive pulmonary hemorrhage of the newborn","authors":["Bomsel F.","Couchard M.","Larroche Cl.

Although the mortality rate of a treated tension pneumothorax remains high, almost certain death will follow an untreated tension pneumothorax in HMD.","group":"g1","id":"b6eee449-ce81-4130-9845-91569ca6236d","_showDetails":false},"522ae7c0-1c72-4995-8e9a-6914da34f167":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase <1974 to 1979>","accession":"5001822","title":"Pulmonary oedema with normal capillary pressure.

Three types of lesions were observed. Although not specific, they were very characteristic because of sequential events: pulmonary edema (interstitial and endoluminal), hyaline membrane disease and diffuse interstitial fibrosis. The initial lesion is pulmonary capillary congestion, with marked increase of vascular permeability. This increase is selective, with considerable leakage of plasma proteins and fibrin, but preventing the passage of polymorphonuclear cells. Subsequently, the alveolar and endothelial cells are destroyed. The surfactant system is disturbed, with insufficient production and inactivation by the edema leading to atelectasia, which is responsible for more lesions. In the absence of lysis by the polymorphonuclear cells and elimination in the sputum or by the capillary and lymphatic drainage, the fibrin is replaced as in any inflammatory process by diffuse interstitial fibrosis. This fibrosis is irreversible and responsible for terminal ARDS.","group":"g1","id":"522ae7c0-1c72-4995-8e9a-6914da34f167","_showDetails":true},"7b3a1ae2-3860-435d-a0b4-149885dc7b99":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 2 of 2","accession":"4135362","title":"Plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency in a child with terminal pulmonary hyaline membrane disease","authors":["Harkness R.A.","Darling J.A.B.","Bain A.D.","Syme J."],"date":"1973//","keywords":["article","autopsy","*diarrhea","*edema","*enzyme blood level","*enzyme deficiency","fatality","*hyaline membrane disease","*hypolipoproteinemia","major clinical study","*plasma","*phosphatidylcholine sterol acyltransferase","*phospholipid","unclassified drug","*cholesterol h 3"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"48","number":"11","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"Dept.

The therapeutic regimen during the intake period 1961 to 1966 was uniform enough to compare outcome in this group. Twenty one were of such severity as to require negative pressure ventilation, with only occasional short term manually controled positive pressure assistance. With few exceptions these children developed normally. However, perceptual problems became apparent as the children reached school age. The average developmental level of infants of less than 2,000 g birth weight was less than that above 2,000 g, but both were within a normal range. Respirator infants were not distinguishable from the population from which they were drawn, suggesting that severity of the initial disease does not seriously affect eventual intelligence in survivors. No cases of cerebral palsy, microcephalus, or hydrocephalus were identified, suggesting the absence of intraventricular hemorrhage in survivors. Genetic and socioeconomic status of parents seemed to play a significant role in the child's eventual developmental achievement, as judged by sibling's development and parental educational and achievement background. There were no serious residual pulmonary symptoms at 6 yr of age attributable to CHMD or its treatment. With 2 exceptions, pulmonary symptoms were minimal in childhood, both severely symptomatic children improved after 3 yr. One of these children, and one other, showed more than minimal changes on X ray suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. All 3 were respirator treated infants and had been severely ill and all became oxygen dependent for many days. Seven infants had abnormal pulmonary function tests, 2 obstructive in type and 5 restrictive, all minimal and without recognizable exercise limitation. One child had a persistent ductus arteriosus after 6 mth which required surgical correction. No child had cicatricial retrolental fibroplasia. Somatic growth was abnormally slow in some children, possibly related to early iatrogenic malnutrition. The number and severity of residua was thought to be minimal for this population and encouraged the continuation of follow up studies as the population of survivors and modes of therapy change.","group":"g1","id":"6c1127c1-9158-4678-95ff-91c3a8c46c9a","_showDetails":false},"2eeffc40-9b4a-4bfd-9124-a697991d2330":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 2 of 2","accession":"4116187","title":"The autolysis of neonatal pulmonary cells in vitro: an ultrastructural study","authors":["Finlay Jones J.M.","Papadimitriou J.M."],"date":"1973//","keywords":["*autolysis","*basement membrane","*cell","*degeneration","*electron microscopy","*endothelium","*epithelium cell","*hyaline membrane disease","in vitro study","*lung","*lung alveolus cell","*lung alveolus epithelium","*necrosis","*newborn","rat","theoretical study","*tissue culture"],"journal":"Journal of Pathology","language":"English","volume":"111","number":"2","isbn":"0022-3417","address":"Dept.

Loss of mitochondrial granules, breaking up to polyribosomes and blebbing of cytoplasmic contents at the lumenal aspects of the cells characterized the autolytic process. The blebs in type II cells are ribosome filled and after 1 hr probably fragment into the alveolar spaces. The type I cell swellings, however, remain intact. Between 15 min and 1 hr the maximum and minimum thicknesses of type I epithelial cell extensions are significantly increased when compared to normal controls; the thickness of the basement lamina, however, remains constant. It is suggested that this blebbing is agonal. It is not until 1 1/2 hr that cellular lysis occurs and at this time few normal type I cells remain attached to the underlying basement lamina. Type II cells also detach and many are seen disintegrated in the air spaces. Generally cytoplasmic changes precede nuclear changes. Endothelial cells also display changes in the early stages of cell death. Although the brunt of the initial injury appears to be taken by the smooth surfaced vesicles, mitochondrial, nuclear and ergastoplasmic changes become increasingly prominent after 1 hr. The degenerative changes preceding cell death and subsequent lysis in this in vitro system are likely to be similar to those occurring in neonatal lungs once the infant has died. Many changes occurr in the first 50 min, in particular epithelial cell swelling and this must be taken into consideration in the ultrastructural analysis of human pulmonary necropsy specimens. Denuded basement lamina with loss of type I and II cells are not a feature of this system until 1 1/2 hr so it is unlikely that findings of cellular necrosis and denuded basement laminae in conditions such as hyaline membrane disease would be a post mortem change, provided specimens were taken within an hour of death.","group":"g1","id":"2eeffc40-9b4a-4bfd-9124-a697991d2330","_showDetails":false},"384ee7ab-460c-4e33-b9f4-7fbd5ff9ba01":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 2 of 2","accession":"4216636","title":"Acute pulmonary X ray changes in hyaline membrane disease treated with artificial ventilation and positive end expiratory pressure (PEP)","authors":["Giedion A.","Haefliger H.","Dangel P."],"date":"1973//","keywords":["*arterial oxygen tension","*artificial ventilation","diagnosis","*hyaline membrane disease","*internal medicine","*lung ventilation","major clinical study","methodology","*mortality","*pneumomediastinum","*pneumopericardium","*pneumothorax","*thorax radiography","*interstitial emphysema"],"language":"English","volume":"1","number":"3","address":"Dept.

It may tentatively be assumed that it serves to keep the feto maternal circulation patent and to remove fibrin deposits from placental villi. Such a function seems to be all the more important since both the placenta and the umbilical vessels lack fibrinolytic activity. Fibrin degradation products (FDP) are not normally demonstrable in the blood. A comparison between appropriate for gestational age (i.e. birth weight >10 <90 percentile) (AGA) and small for gestational age (i.e. birth weight <10 percentile) (SGA) infants of corresponding gestational ages revealed no noticeable differences. Thus, a reduced intrauterine growth rate does not seem to influence the development of the factors of the fibrinolytic system. The fibrinolytic system is fully developed at about 6 mth of age. The present investigation of infants 0-1 yr of age may serve as a basis for further studies of children's diseases involving the fibrinolytic system, e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation or primary fibrinolysis. Such complications may appear in a variety of disorders. The fibrinolytic system of infants with IRDS or other respiratory disturbances was not found to differ from that in an asymptomatic group of infants. These findings argue against the hypothesis of a primary deficiency of the fibrinolytic system being a factor in the pathogenesis of idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). FDP may appear in both severe and mild diseases in newborns. Their presence may indicate DIC, the existence of a more marked fibrinolytic component or local tissue damage. The appearance of FDP in infants with IRDS may be a bad prognostic sign and must generally speaking be regarded as being of pathologic significance. The findings with the histochemical method of Todd question the postulated lack of plasminogen in the lungs of infants with hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The results argue, if anything, against an alteration activator of the intrapulmonary fibrinolytic system being of any major importance in the formation of hyaline membranes. The findings are also compatible with the present results obtained in the investigation of blood of infants with IRDS in which no primary deficiency of the fibrinolytic system could be demonstrated.","group":"g1","id":"484f178f-2bfe-4a0f-a8c9-c5aabefb7a8b","_showDetails":true},"41174f8a-caa7-4e6e-8635-0c6a77318053":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Extracellular matrix structure and tissue stiffness control postnatal lung development through the lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/Tie2 signaling system.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2013-0147OC","authors":["Mammoto, Tadanori","Jiang, Elisabeth","Jiang, Amanda","Mammoto, Akiko"],"date":"2013//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Biomechanical Phenomena","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Elasticity","Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","*Extracellular Matrix/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-5/df [Deficiency]","Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-5/ge [Genetics]","*Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-5/me [Metabolism]","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Receptor, TIE-2/ge [Genetics]","*Receptor, TIE-2/me [Metabolism]","Signal Transduction"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"49","number":"6","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23841513"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Physical properties of the tissues and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in organ development. Recently, we have reported that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/Tie2 signaling controls postnatal lung development by modulating angiogenesis. Here we show that tissue stiffness modulated by the ECM cross-linking enzyme, lysyl oxidase (LOX), regulates postnatal lung development through LRP5-Tie2 signaling. The expression of LRP5 and Tie2 is up-regulated twofold in lung microvascular endothelial cells when cultured on stiff matrix compared to those cultured on soft matrix in vitro. LOX inhibitor, beta-aminopropionitrile, disrupts lung ECM (collagen I, III, and VI, and elastin) structures, softens neonatal mouse lung tissue by 20%, and down-regulates the expression of LRP5 and Tie2 by 20 and 60%, respectively, which leads to the inhibition of postnatal lung development (30% increase in mean linear intercept, 1.5-fold increase in air space area). Importantly, hyperoxia treatment (Postnatal Days 1-10) disrupts ECM structure and stiffens mouse lung tissue by up-regulating LOX activity, thereby increasing LRP5 and Tie2 expression and deregulating alveolar morphogenesis in neonatal mice, which is attenuated by inhibiting LOX activity. These findings suggest that appropriate physical properties of lung tissue are necessary for physiological postnatal lung development, and deregulation of this mechanism contributes to postnatal lung developmental disorders, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"41174f8a-caa7-4e6e-8635-0c6a77318053","_showDetails":true},"18dfa67d-a1e7-49e9-ac4c-0aa0bbdefd61":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 2 of 2","accession":"4047755","title":"Cerebral hypoxia as the primary event in the pathogenesis of the 'shock lung syndrome'","authors":["Moss G.","Staunton C.","Stein A.A."],"date":"1971//","keywords":["*brain","*brain hypoxia","dog","*hyaline membrane disease","*hypoxia","*lung","*shock","*shock lung","theoretical study"],"journal":"Surgical Forum","language":"English","volume":"Vol.22","isbn":"0071-8041","address":"Rensselaer Polytechn.

This system of quantitative evaluation was applied to various in vitro and in vivo models for surfactant inactivation and to an experimental model for hyaline membrane disease. The results indicated that there are at least two forms of surfactant inactivation: a coagulative form which may represent a mechanism of surfactant damage in lung diseases, characterized by fibrinogen rich alveolar exudate and formation of hyaline membranes, and a non coagulative and partially reversible form which may occur in edematous conditions of the lung. Evaluation of washing from fetal lungs indicated that surfactant lipoprotein undergoes significant changes during late stages of fetal development, and that the phospholipid to protein ratio of the surfactant fraction is a convenient parameter tor determining the state of surfactant maturation. Under certain conditions, in utero induced fetal distress may result in hypersecretion of surfactant into the alveoli prior to breathing, thereby predisposing to postnatally manifested surfactant deficiency.","group":"g1","id":"53546be7-ab74-4847-a0ae-48a8712be10a","_showDetails":true},"be0a7f5a-1bc7-462a-ad59-06e2f6c4215b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 1 of 2","accession":"293128565","title":"Perinatal cerebral intraventricular hemorrhage","authors":["Harcke Jr. H.T.","Naeye R.L.","Storch A.","Blanc W.A."],"date":"1972//","keywords":["autopsy","*brain hemorrhage","brain ventricle hemorrhage","Caucasian","hyaline membrane disease","hypoxia","infant","malnutrition","newborn","perinatal mortality","pneumonia","prematurity","stillbirth"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"80","number":"1","isbn":"0022-3476","address":"H.T.

Delay for at least 24 hours was achieved in 77% of the mothers. In these unplanned deliveries, early neonatal mortality was 3.2% in the treated group and 15.0% in the controls (p 0.01).

A series of normal newborns served as a control. Acid base balance and P[aO;) levels were followed concurrently. In normal full term or premature infants, at birth, values of lactate and pyruvate are respectively: 2.5 +/-0.5 mEq/1 and 0.09 +/-0.01 mEq/1. These values subsequently fall to reach adult levels by 36-48 hr of age. Infants presenting with asphyxia at birth have lactate levels significantly raised above normal. These values generally return to normal within the first 12-24 hr of life. In RDS, blood lactate levels of surviving infants differ from the normal only between 25 and 72 hr of life. The prognosis can therefore be established by measuring the blood lactate. There is a significant relationship between the blood lactate and the cumulative Apgar score (sum of Apgar score at 1. 5 and 10 min). It permits a precise evaluation of the importance of pennataj asphyxia and has a prognostic value. As a general rule, most fatal cases snowed a low cumulative Apgar score combined with high lactate levels during the first 3 hr of life. A cumulative score under 10 with lactate levels above 8.5 mEq/1 during the first 3 hr of life is fatal for the majority of infants. Infants with postasphyxia syndrome show a low cumulative score and an elevated blood lactate. The prognosis is very poor in cases of hyaline membrane disease complicated by perinatal asphyxia and elevated blood lactate levels. A sudden rise in blood lactate during the course of a RDS, with neurologic signs, is a sure sign of intracranial hemorrhage. The rise in blood lactate reflects the status of the cardiovascular system and the P[aOj) which affects the degree of tissue oxygenation. The role of right to left shunts is mentioned. By way of illustration, several clinical cases are presented in which the different parameters described were followed, thus permitting a better understanding of the phystopathology of the RDS.","group":"g1","id":"e79f8058-14df-4959-878f-b5a034784cb3","_showDetails":false},"2349b44d-6324-43ac-ba06-0a8f0c730662":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 1 of 2","accession":"293090016","title":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyaline membrane disease","authors":["Altstatt L.B.","Dennis L.H.","Sundell H."],"date":"1971//","keywords":["adult","autopsy","bleeding","*disseminated intravascular clotting","general aspects of disease","*hyaline membrane disease","laboratory","newborn","newborn disease","patient","fibrin"],"journal":"Biology of the Neonate","language":"English","volume":"19","number":"1-3","isbn":"0006-3126","address":"L.B.

Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is a transmembrane receptor that plays essential roles in normal and pathological vascular development and binds two distinct ligand families: vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and class 3 semaphorins (Sema3). Although Nrp1 is critical for systemic vascular development, the importance of Nrp1 in pulmonary vascular morphogenesis is uncertain. We hypothesized that Sema3-Nrp1 and Vegf-Nrp1 interactions are important pathways in the orchestration of pulmonary vascular development during alveolarization. Complete ablation of Nrp1 signaling would therefore lead to interruption of normal angiogenic and vascular maturation processes that are relevant to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We have previously shown that congenital loss of Sema3-Nrp1 signaling in transgenic Nrp1(Sema-) mice resulted in disrupted alveolar-capillary interface formation and high neonatal mortality. Here, pathohistological examination of Nrp1(Sema-) survivors in the alveolar period revealed moderate to severe respiratory distress, alveolar hemorrhaging, abnormally dilated capillaries, and disintegrating alveolar septa, demonstrating continued instability of the alveolar-capillary interface. Moreover, consistent with a reduced capillary density and consequent increases in vascular resistance, hypertensive remodeling was observed. In contrast, conditional Nrp1 deletion beginning at postnatal day 5 had only a transient effect upon alveolar and vascular development or pneumocyte differentiation despite an increase in mortality. Our results demonstrate that although Sema3-Nrp1 signaling is critical during fetal pulmonary development, Nrp1 signaling does not appear to be essential for alveolar development or vascular function in the postnatal period.","group":"g1","id":"5378f389-9a3f-44a3-8d42-a09d43c23e91","_showDetails":true},"6009c23b-39fa-49a4-be34-5400a7c154ff":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 1 of 2","accession":"291075872","title":"Kmloulveolar microtithiusis of the lung","authors":["Pollice L.","Pirrelli A."],"date":"1970//","keywords":["autopsy","chronic obstructive lung disease","coughing","cyanosis","disease course","dyspnea","emphysema","enzyme deficiency","etiology","heart muscle","hyaline membrane disease","immunity","infection","*lung","lung disease","lung fibrosis","lung infection","pneumonia","publication","radiography","rare disease","sputum","tissue","X ray","calcium salt","glycoprotein","organic matter"],"language":"Italian","volume":"48","number":"1","address":"L.

Early measurement of organ-specific tissue VEGF levels might allow identification of infants at high risk for these diseases, but is not clinically feasible. Urine VEGF is easily measured and useful in early diagnosis of several diseases., OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to assess the correlation of urine VEGF levels measured in the first postnatal month with subsequent BPD or ROP diagnosis and to determine whether various infant characteristics influence urine VEGF levels., METHODS: 106 subjects born at <29 weeks' gestation and surviving to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age were selected from an existing database and biorepository. Urine VEGF and total protein were measured in 2-3 samples per subject., RESULTS: Urine VEGF/protein levels increased by 72% per week (p < 0.0001) during the first postnatal month. In multivariable analysis controlling for postnatal age, lower VEGF/protein was associated with higher levels of mechanical respiratory support (p = 0.006), male gender (p = 0.001) and early sepsis (p = 0.003) but not with fraction of inspired oxygen. Lower urine VEGF/protein and mechanical ventilation were each associated with BPD and ROP. In analyses adjusted for respiratory support, lower urine VEGF/protein and ROP remained associated but urine VEGF/protein and BPD did not., CONCLUSIONS: Low urine VEGF/protein levels in the first postnatal month are associated with mechanical ventilation, BPD, and ROP.

In the fetus, pulmonary vascular tone is dependent on chemical factors (blood gases). The surface tension forces are of great importance in the lungs of the newborn. Towards the 6th month of intrauterine life, alveolar cells appear to secrete a tensioactive substance on the surface of the alveoles. This surfactant can lower the surface tension when the lung volume diminishes during expiration; it thus ensures alveolar stability and constitutes an antiatelectatic factor. The deficiency in surfactant appears to be the cause of a number of respiratory distress syndromes in the newborn, particularly those grouped under the name of hyaline membrane disease. At birth, the respiratory tract contains a certain quantity of fluid, the presence of which makes easier the penetration of air during the initial respiratory movements. The study of blood gases is easy in the newborn at the level of the capillary blood, but the determination of pulmonary volumes and outputs is far more difficult and necessitates complicated techniques.","group":"g1","id":"9626190a-b171-4ab8-93ef-e0a30de5cc6e","_showDetails":true},"4f5f6568-c735-4b0d-8b35-051dd95e1bec":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 1 of 2","accession":"287082844","title":"Nasotracheal intubation as a substitute for tracheostomy","authors":["Connelly J.P."],"date":"1967//","keywords":["abscess","airway","airway obstruction","angioneurotic edema","brain tumor","bronchopneumonia","child","cystic lymphangioma","diaphragm hernia","general condition","goiter","hyaline membrane disease","infant","lung insufficiency","meningitis","*nasotracheal intubation","nasotracheal tube","obstruction","paralysis","patient","respiratory distress","respiratory tract disease","secretions","*tracheostomy","tracheotomy","tube","velocity","plastic"],"journal":"Clinical Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"6","number":"3","isbn":"0009-9228","address":"J.P.

A polyvinyl nasotracheal tube was inserted, numerous bronchial plugs were removed in this way, and after the regulation of respiration the patient improved. The tube had to remain in place for 4 days. The indications for nasotracheal intubation are: pulmonary insufficiency in cases of diaphragmatic hernia, hyaline membrane disease etc.; respiratory obstruction associated with increased tracheobronchial secretions; mechanical obstruction by angioneurotic edema, struma, cystic hygroma, laryngeal palsy etc., failure of motor pathway from brain tumors or abscesses, meningitis, etc. A nasotracheal tube seems best suited for cases calling for speed and ease of establishing an airway, acute, respiratory problems, children under 3 yr of age, especially infants, and cases with only moderate tracheobronchial secretions.

Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations estimated adjusted odds ratios of adverse outcomes. Intensive care treatment was more common for neonates of women with thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism and primary hypothyroidism were associated with sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea, and apnea. Iatrogenic hypothyroidism was associated with sepsis and neonatal anemia. Hyperthyroidism was also associated with rare outcomes (prevalence, <1%) including cardiomyopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and neonatal thyroid diseases. Hyperthyroid non-Hispanic black women had higher odds of term infants that weighed <2,500 g, and hypothyroid non-Hispanic white women had higher odds of large-for-gestational-age infants. These analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity due to interaction. Associations were similar in analyses restricted to term infants.

Placentas and umbilical cords were investigated histopathologically for chorioamnionitis and funisitis., RESULTS: The overall frequency of clinical and histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) was 8.3% and 23.2%, respectively. The frequency of HCA was 47.3% and 83.3% in mothers delivered <32 weeks and <30 weeks, respectively. Maternal demographic and clinical findings and also leukocyte and C-reactive protein values were not indicative of HCA. Infants of mothers with HCA had significantly lower Apgar scores together with higher SNAP-PE-II and CRIB scores. These infants had increased mechanical ventilator and surfactant requirements, higher incidences of patent ductus arteriosus, early sepsis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and higher mortality rates. The effect of HCA on neonatal morbidity and mortality was more prominent than the effect of low birthweight and lower gestational age., CONCLUSION: Chorioamnionitis not only causes premature deliveries, but is also associated with neonatal complications and increased mortality. Clinical findings and infectious markers in mother or infant do not predict the diagnosis of histological chorioamnionitis. Therefore, placental histopathology may have a role in predicting neonatal outcome in premature deliveries, especially those below 30 weeks. Copyright © 2013.

CHD were coded according to ICD9-CM. Cluster multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between CHD and mortality and selected morbidities [neonatal infection, ultrasound brain abnormalities, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)] adjusting for potential confounders., RESULTS: Seventy-one patients had CHD [19.3 , 95 % confidence interval (CI) 15.1-24.2 ]. The most common lesions were isolated atrial and ventricular septal defects (31.1 and 26.8 %, respectively), pulmonary valvar stenosis (12.7 %), and tetralogy of Fallot (5.6 %). Compared with other infants, CHD patients showed significantly higher GA and frequency of small for gestational age (SGA, i.e., birth weight <=3rd centile). After adjustment for GA, sex, SGA, presence of extracardiac malformations or chromosomal anomalies, and region of birth, CHD patients had a significantly higher likelihood of infection, BPD, ROP, and, after 27 weeks gestation only, hospital mortality. The increased risk of ROP appeared to be partly due to infection., CONCLUSIONS: In very preterm/VLBW infants CHD are more prevalent than in the general liveborn population, and confer an increased risk of death and serious morbidities independently of other risk factors. These results may be useful to better tailor prognostic assessment and diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for these children.","group":"g1","id":"b192d248-ee1b-452d-9615-f6f72d63d9c9","_showDetails":true},"89dc8b03-9839-44f3-aa24-0f88b918f837":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Mesenchymal stem cells protect against neonatal rat hyperoxic lung injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2013.778969","authors":["Zhang, Hongshan","Fang, Jianpei","Wu, Yanyun","Mai, Yougang","Lai, Wenyu","Su, Haobin"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20130327//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis","Aquaporin 5/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/su [Surgery]","Cell Tracking","Cells, Cultured","Disease Models, Animal","Green Fluorescent Proteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Green Fluorescent Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation","Mesenchymal Stem Cells/me [Metabolism]","Peptides/me [Metabolism]","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Time Factors","Transfection","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]","bcl-2-Associated X Protein/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Expert opinion on biological therapy","volume":"13","number":"6","isbn":"1471-2598","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23534609"],"address":"England","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a significant global health problem and currently lacks effective therapy.

Despite advances in neonatal healthcare the number of BPD cases worldwide continues to increase. One approach to overcoming the premature arrest in lung development seen in BPD is to stimulate neonatal angiogenesis via delivery and engraftment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). One such population is resident to the pulmonary microvasculature and expresses both FOXF1 and c-KIT. Previous studies have shown that c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPCs are highly sensitive to elevated levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) and are decreased in premature infants with BPD and hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse models. We hypothesize that restoring EPCs through transplantation of c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPCs derived in vitro from pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), will stimulate neonatal angiogenesis and alveolarization in mice with hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Methods: Utilizing a novel ESC line with a FOXF1:GFP reporter, we generated ESC-derived c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPCs in vitro. Using a second ESC line which contains FOXF1:GFP and tdTomato transgenes, we differentiated ESCs towards c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPCs and tracked them in vivo after injection into the neonatal circulation of hyperoxia-injured mice. After a recovery period in room air conditions, we analyzed c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPC engraftment and quantified the number of resident and circulating endothelial cells, the size of alveolar spaces, and the capillary density after EPC transplantations. Results and conclusion: Herein, we demonstrate that addition of BMP9 to the directed endothelial differentiation protocol results in very efficient generation of c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPCs from pluripotent ESCs. ESC-derived c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPCs effectively engraft into the pulmonary microvasculature of hyperoxia-injured mice, promote vascular remodeling in alveoli, increase the number of resident and circulating endothelial cells, and improve alveolarization. Altogether, these results provide a proof-of-principle that cell therapy with ESC-derived c-KIT+FOXF1+ EPCs can prevent alveolar simplification in a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model.

We investigated the role of amniotic fluid stem cells (AFS) in an adult rat model of hyperoxia lung injury., METHODS: Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were, at birth, randomly exposed to moderate hyperoxia or room air for 14 days and a single dose of human amniotic fluid stem (hAFS) or human Fibroblasts (hF), cells was delivered intratracheally (P21). At P42 animals were euthanized and lung tissue examined using histology, immunohistochemistry, PCR, and ELISA. hAFS cells characterization and homing were studied by immunofluorescence., RESULTS: In rats treated with hAFS and hF cells 16S human rRNA fragment was detected. Despite a low level of pulmonary hAFS cell retention (1.43 +/- 0.2% anti-human-mitochondria-positive cells), the lungs of the treated animals revealed higher secondary crest numbers and lower mean linear intercept and alveolar size, than those exposed to hyperoxia, those left untreated or treated with hF cells. Except for those treated with hAFS cells, moderate hyperoxia induced an increase in protein content of IL-6, IL-1beta, as well as IF-gamma and TGF-1beta in lung tissues. High VEGF expression and arrangement of capillary architecture in hAFS cell group were also detected., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with hAFS cells has a reparative potential through active involvement of cells in alveolarization and angiogenesis.

Therefore, this study aimed to identify potential miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of BPD in VLBW preterm infants., METHODS: A case-control study (15 subjects with BPD and 15 sex-matched control subjects without BPD) was conducted to investigate the expression profiles of 365 miRNAs in the peripheral blood of VLBW preterm infants at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (called the older-age set). The expression levels of identified miRNAs were further evaluated in a subsample of blood collected during the first 2 weeks post-natal age (called the younger-age set). Possible biological functions and pathways implicated in the target genes regulated by the miRNAs were explored using database predictions., RESULTS: A 4-miRNA signature (miR-152, miR-30a-3p, miR-133b, and miR-7) with aberrant expression levels at 36 weeks, derived from a supervised classification with internal cross-validation, discriminated the subjects with BPD from those without BPD with an accuracy of 0.91.

There was partial recovery of the pulmonary phenotype in the WT-BPD model treated with the MIF agonist, and in the MIFTG mice treated with the MIF antagonist., CONCLUSIONS: These data point to the careful regulatory balance exerted by MIF in the developing lung and response to hyperoxia and support the potential therapeutic value of small molecule MIF modulation in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"5a94e90b-d5fe-4cbc-b31c-40f933eb8dea","_showDetails":true},"0e21a1e2-e712-45e4-bf34-7072ac97ac55":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Response of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiogenesis-related genes to stepwise increases in inspired oxygen in neonatal rat lungs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2013.21","authors":["Keenaghan, Michael","Cai, Charles L","Kumar, Dharmendra","Valencia, Gloria B","Rao, Madu","Aranda, Jacob V","Beharry, Kay D"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20130205//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Female","Male","*Neovascularization, Pathologic/ge [Genetics]","*Oxygen/ad [Administration & Dosage]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","Rats","*Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"73","number":"5","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23385964"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is an inflammatory lung disease that afflicts preterm infants requiring supplemental oxygen and is associated with impaired pulmonary angiogenesis.

Infants with BPD were mechanically ventilated., RESULTS: Infants who developed BPD (n = 120) had a younger gestational age (31.0 +/- 2.1 weeks vs. 34.3 +/- 1.5 weeks) and lower birth weight (1,490 +/- 360 g vs. 1,880 +/- 520 g) than infants who did not develop BPD (n = 100).

New BPD is characterized as having alveolar simplification. We reported previously that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) deficiency increased susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury in adult mice, and this was associated with decreased expression of cytochrome P450 1A enzymes and increased lung inflammation. Whether AhR protects newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification is unknown. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that decreased activation of the pulmonary AhR augments hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification and lung inflammation in newborn mice. Experimental groups included one-day old wild type (WT) and AhR dysfunctional (AhRd) mice exposed to 21% O2 (air) or 85% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 days. Exposure of newborn WT mice to hyperoxia resulted in increased protein, enzyme and mRNA expression of the AhR-regulated lung cytochrome P450 1A1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 enzymes, suggesting that hyperoxia increases activation of the pulmonary AhR. On the other hand, in the AhRd mice, hyperoxia induced the AhR-regulated enzymes to a lesser extent probably due to the dysfunctional AhR in these mice. Alveolar simplification and lung inflammation was increased in mice exposed to hyperoxia compared with those exposed to air, and AhRd mice were more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification and lung inflammation compared with WT mice. These findings suggest that decreased activation of the pulmonary AhR in newborn AhRd mice augments hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification and lung inflammation in these mice.

The pathogenesis of BPD involves early inflammation and remodeling of the premature lung., AIM: To search for the novel predictive marker of BPD development, we studied serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), an innate immune mediator, in preterm infants., METHODS: Serum NGAL concentrations at birth were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The reference levels were determined in 52 infants having no anomalies or inherited diseases. The levels and clinical variables were assessed in association with BPD., RESULTS: Geometric means (95%CI) of serum NGAL levels at birth of infants having no underlying diseases were 32.4 (22.1-47.5), 58.6 (47.9-71.8), and 126.2 (99.0-168.7) ng/mL for <31, 31-36 and >36 gestational weeks (GW), respectively (p<0.001). These levels positively correlated with neutrophil (p<0.0001) or monocyte counts (p<0.0001). The median NGAL levels (307.8 ng/mL) and neutrophil counts (4141/muL) at birth of 16 preterm infants (<31 GW) who developed BPD were higher than those (42.9 ng/mL and 1357/muL) of 20 infants (<31 GW) who did not (p<0.0001 and p=0.012), respectively. In multivariable analysis for 36 infants born less than 31 GW, higher NGAL levels (>= 82 ng/mL) but not neutrophil counts at birth had a significant association with developing BPD (gestational-age adjusted odds ratio [OR]=37.45 [3.08-455.49], p<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: High serum levels of NGAL at birth could be an early sensitive marker for BPD in preterm infants, because their levels were physiologically low.

Severe BPD is often complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH) that significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, cell proliferation and survival, and inflammation by modulating multiple signaling pathways, particularly the nuclear transcription factor, NF-kappaB, and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Aberrant GSK-3beta signaling is linked to BPD. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of GSK-3beta is beneficial in preventing hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, an experimental model of BPD. Newborn rats were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (90% oxygen), and received daily intraperitoneal injections of placebo (DMSO) or SB216763, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3beta, for 14 days. Hyperoxia exposure in the presence of the placebo increased GSK-3beta phosphorylation, which was correlated with increased inflammation, decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis, and increased pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. However, treatment with SB216763 decreased phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65, expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and lung inflammation during hyperoxia. Furthermore, treatment with the GSK-3beta inhibitor also improved alveolarization and angiogenesis, and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. These data indicate that GSK-3beta signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, and that inhibition of GSK-3beta is beneficial in preventing inflammation and protecting alveolar and vascular structures during hyperoxia. Thus, targeting GSK-3beta signaling may offer a novel strategy to prevent and treat preterm infants with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"1382fe5b-c5e1-4435-a489-ef49e858430e","_showDetails":true},"3f560a69-4e31-43f2-a670-a53f0b73ed67":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"The CD95/CD95L pathway is involved in phagocytosis-induced cell death of monocytes and may account for sustained inflammation in neonates.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2012.196","authors":["Gille, Christian","Dreschers, Stephan","Leiber, Anja","Lepiorz, Florian","Krusch, Matthias","Grosse-Opphoff, Julia","Spring, Barbel","Haas, Martin","Urschitz, Michael","Poets, Christian F","Orlikowsky, Thorsten W"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20121226//","keywords":["Adult","Animals","*Apoptosis","Cells, Cultured","Culture Media, Conditioned/me [Metabolism]","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Escherichia coli/ge [Genetics]","Escherichia coli/me [Metabolism]","Escherichia coli/py [Pathogenicity]","*Fas Ligand Protein/me [Metabolism]","*Fetal Blood/im [Immunology]","Flow Cytometry","Green Fluorescent Proteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Green Fluorescent Proteins/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Inflammation/bl [Blood]","*Inflammation/im [Immunology]","Inflammation/mi [Microbiology]","Inflammation/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","*Monocytes/im [Immunology]","Monocytes/mi [Microbiology]","Monocytes/pa [Pathology]","*Phagocytosis","Signal Transduction","fas Receptor/df [Deficiency]","fas Receptor/ge [Genetics]","*fas Receptor/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"73","number":"4 Pt 1","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23269121"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The propensity for sustained inflammation after bacterial infection in neonates, resulting in inflammatory sequelae such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and periventricular leucomalacia, is well known, but its molecular mechanisms remain elusive.

It can usually be caused by several pathological processes that endanger the long-term lung development, such as inflammation and immune dysfunction., Methods: In this study, a bioinformatics approach was applied to identify the differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs). We downloaded the transcriptional profiles (GSE32472 dataset) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Cell type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT), microenvironment cell populations counter (MCPcounter), and Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumor tissues using Expression data (ESTIMATE) were used for the analysis of the immune cell infiltration landscape of BPD. A weighted co-expression network was subsequently constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to screen candidate differentially expressed immune related genes (DEIRGs)., Results: GSEA results indicated that immune-related pathways were mainly involved in BPD. Ten significantly different immune cell types were observed between BPD and normal groups. A total of 228 DEGs in the turquoise module were identified, and 31 DEIRGs were further identified. Cluster of the differentiation 8 alpha (CD8A) expression was down-regulated in BPD, and its expression was validated by the GSE25286, GSE25293, GSE99633 datasets and qRT-PCR. In addition, CD8A expression was closely associated with immune cells infiltration, especially T cells CD8 and neutrophil., Conclusion: A distinct immune cell infiltration landscape was found between BPD and normal group. CD8A can be a novel candidate biomarker for BPD, which plays an essential role in the onset and progress of hyperoxia-related BPD via the disruption of immune cell functions.

Recent findings indicate that RAGE may also have a regulative function in apoptosis, as well as in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion. Unlike other organs, lung tissue in adulthood and during organ development shows relatively high levels of RAGE expression. Thus a role for the receptor in lung organogenesis and homeostasis may be proposed. To evaluate the role of RAGE in lung development and adult lung homeostasis, we generated hemizygous and homozygous transgenic mice overexpressing human RAGE, and analyzed their lungs from the fourth postnatal day to adulthood. Moderate RAGE hyperexpression during lung development influenced secondary septation, resulting in an impairment of alveolar morphogenesis and leading to significant changes in morphometric parameters such as airspace number and the size of alveolar ducts. An increase in alveolar cell apoptosis and a decrease in cell proliferation were demonstrated by the terminal deoxy-nucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling reaction, active caspase-3, and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Alterations in elastin organization and deposition and in TGF-beta expression were observed. In homozygous mice, the hyperexpression of RAGE resulted in histological changes resembling those changes characterizing human bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). RAGE hyperexpression in the adult lung is associated with an increase of the alveolar destructive index and persistent inflammatory status leading to \"destructive\" emphysema. These results suggest an important role for RAGE in both alveolar development and lung homeostasis, and open new doors to working hypotheses on the pathogenesis of BPD and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","group":"g1","id":"7a547cab-217b-4db6-8bf6-e4a34b7bb6bb","_showDetails":true},"05c1f213-3c72-48d0-b784-6767b2e061fd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Retinoic acid rescues alveolar hypoplasia in the calorie-restricted developing rat lung.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2012-0229OC","authors":["Londhe, Vedang A","Maisonet, Tiffany M","Lopez, Benjamin","Shin, Bo-Chul","Huynh, Jasmine","Devaskar, Sherin U"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20121018//","keywords":["Animals","*Caloric Restriction","Elastin/me [Metabolism]","Female","*Hyperplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Lung/em [Embryology]","*Maternal Exposure","Pregnancy","*Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Receptors, Retinoic Acid/me [Metabolism]","Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha","Signal Transduction","Transforming Growth Factor beta/me [Metabolism]","*Tretinoin/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"48","number":"2","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23087051"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Infants born with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are at increased risk of adverse pulmonary outcomes at birth, including meconium aspiration and persistent pulmonary hypertension. Preterm infants with IUGR are at especially high risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease hallmarked by alveolar hypoplasia. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence of BPD or death in preterm very low birth weight infants, its potential to reduce BPD or death in preterm infants with IUGR remains unknown. We used a well-characterized rat model of caloric restriction to mimic IUGR and determine the impact of IUGR on lung development. We hypothesized that retinoic acid treatment would preserve alveolar formation through increases in key signaling molecules of the retinoic acid signaling pathway. Our results showed that alveolar hypoplasia caused by caloric restriction can be reversed with refeeding, and that retinoic acid prevents the alveolar hypoplasia coincident with the increased expression of elastin and retinoic acid receptor-alpha and decreased transforming growth factor-beta activity in developing rat lungs. These findings suggest that alveolar hypoplasia attributable to caloric restriction is reversible, and raises the possibility that retinoic acid therapy may prove a useful strategy to prevent adverse pulmonary sequelae such as BPD in preterm infants with IUGR.","group":"g1","id":"05c1f213-3c72-48d0-b784-6767b2e061fd","_showDetails":true},"280708b8-ac6e-444b-8234-19663cb7b2a0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Sildenafil alleviates bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonatal rats by activating the hypoxia-inducible factor signaling pathway.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2012-0043OC","authors":["Park, Hyoung-Sook","Park, Jong-Wan","Kim, Hye-Jin","Choi, Chang Won","Lee, Hyun-Ju","Kim, Byung Il","Chun, Yang-Sook"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20121011//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/ge [Genetics]","*Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Cells, Cultured","Cyclic GMP/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Humans","Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/ge [Genetics]","*Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/me [Metabolism]","Infant, Newborn","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Neovascularization, Physiologic/de [Drug Effects]","Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/me [Metabolism]","*Piperazines/pd [Pharmacology]","Pregnancy","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/me [Metabolism]","Purines/pd [Pharmacology]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Signal Transduction/de [Drug Effects]","Sildenafil Citrate","*Sulfones/pd [Pharmacology]","TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/me [Metabolism]","Up-Regulation/de [Drug Effects]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"48","number":"1","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23065129"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major cause of morbidity in premature infants receiving oxygen therapy. Currently, sildenafil is being examined clinically to improve pulmonary function in patients with BPD. Based on the pharmacological action of sildenafil, the elevation of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in lung tissue is considered to underlie its beneficial effects, but this mechanism is not understood at the molecular level. Here, we examined the possibility that sildenafil helps the pulmonary system adapt to hyperoxic stress. To induce BPD, fetal rats were exposed to LPS before delivery, and neonates were exposed to hyperoxia, followed by intraperitoneal injections of sildenafil. Alveolarization was impaired in rats exposed to hyperoxia, and alveolarization significantly recovered with sildenafil. An immunohistochemical examination revealed that sildenafil effectively increased vascular distribution in lung tissue. Furthermore, the oxygen sensor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1/2alpha and the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were highly expressed in the lungs of sildenafil-treated rats. In human small-airway epithelial cells, HIF-1/2alpha and its downstream genes, including VEGF, were confirmed to be induced by sildenafil at both the protein and mRNA levels. Mechanistically, cGMP in airway cells accumulated after sildenafil treatment because of interfering phosphodiesterase Type 5, and subsequently cGMP activated HIF-mediated hypoxic signaling by stimulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This study provides a better understanding about the mode of action for sildenafil, and suggests that HIF can be a potential target for treating patients with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"280708b8-ac6e-444b-8234-19663cb7b2a0","_showDetails":true},"9355f08f-2c88-4023-bc2e-c53ddb2454e6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"IFN-gamma and IP-10 in tracheal aspirates from premature infants: relationship with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.22540","authors":["Aghai, Zubair H","Saslow, Judy G","Mody, Kartik","Eydelman, Riva","Bhat, Vishwanath","Stahl, Gary","Pyon, Kee","Bhandari, Vineet"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20120319//","keywords":["Body Fluids/ch [Chemistry]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","*Chemokine CXCL10/ip [Isolation & Purification]","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Interferon-gamma/ip [Isolation & Purification]","Male","Trachea"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"48","number":"1","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=22431160"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interferon-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10) are potent inflammatory mediators and contribute to acute lung injury in adults. Recently, a potential role for IFN-gamma and IP-10 in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been reported in animal models., OBJECTIVE: To study the association between IFN-gamma and IP-10 in tracheal aspirate (TA) and the development of BPD in premature infants., DESIGN/METHODS: TA samples collected within 48 hr after birth from 79 mechanically ventilated premature neonates [gestational age (GA) <30 weeks (w), birth weight (BW) <1,250 g (g)] were analyzed. IFN-gamma was measured in a subgroup of 38 infants by using a biochip multi-analyte immunoassay. The level of IP-10 was determined using a commercially available ELISA kit. Total protein in TA was measured by Bradford assay to correct for sampling related dilution. BPD was defined as the need of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)., RESULTS: Twenty infants (GA 26.4 +/- 1.9w, BW 860 +/- 201 g) survived without BPD at 36 weeks PMA and 59 infants (GA 25.5 +/- 1.5w, BW 751 +/- 163 g) died before 36 weeks PMA or developed BPD. The mean IFN-gamma level was higher in infants who died or developed BPD (9.7 +/- 2.8 vs. 3.1 +/- 1.1 pg/ml, P = 0.03). Similarly, the mean IP-10 level was higher in infants who died or developed BPD (63.4 +/- 17.5 pg/ml) compared to those who survived without BPD (18.5 +/- 7.5 pg/ml, P = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Higher IFN-gamma and IP-10 levels in TA samples are associated with the development of BPD or death in premature infants.

The results from previous studies are inconsistent regarding the role of proteinases and antiproteinases in the development of BPD. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2, and TIMP-1 levels in the serum of preterm infants at birth are related to the development of BPD., METHODS: Serum was collected from 62 preterm infants at birth and analyzed for MMP-8, MMP-9, TIMP-2, and TIMP-1 by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MMPs and TIMPs were compared in BPD (n=24) and no BPD groups (n=38). Clinical predictors of BPD (sex, birth weight, gestational age, etc.) were assessed for both groups. The association between predictors and outcome, BPD, was assessed by using multivariate logistic regression., RESULTS: Sex, birth weight, and mean gestational age were similar between the groups. BPD preterm infants had significantly lower TIMP-2 levels at birth compared with no BPD preterm infants (138.1+/-23.0 ng/mL vs. 171.8+/-44.1 ng/mL, P=0.027). No significant difference was observed in MMP-8, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 levels between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the TIMP-2 levels were predictive of BPD after adjusting for sex, birth weight, gestational age, proteinuric preeclampsia, and intraventricular hemorrhage (beta=-0.063, P=0.041)., CONCLUSION: Low TIMP-2 serum levels at birth may be associated with the subsequent development of BPD in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"c3ceb27a-90e7-4c6d-becd-60b32aa78405","_showDetails":true},"5af83cdc-dfeb-4381-b66e-746c6a7aa9b2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2013 to 2016>","title":"Polymorphisms of the gene encoding Kit ligand are associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.23018","authors":["Huusko, Johanna M","Mahlman, Mari","Karjalainen, Minna K","Kaukola, Tuula","Haataja, Ritva","Marttila, Riitta","Toldi, Gergely","Szabo, Miklos","Kingsmore, Stephen F","Ramet, Mika","Lavoie, Pascal M","Hallman, Mikko","Gen-BPD Study Group"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20140309//","journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"50","number":"3","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm3&NEWS=N&AN=24610823"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that affects infants born preterm.

Additional replication populations included infants born in Finland (n = 41 + 241) and Hungary (n = 29 + 40). All infants were of European origin. Results were controlled for risk factors of BPD. Kit ligand concentration in umbilical cord blood, collected from very preterm infants (n = 120), was studied., RESULTS: Six SNPs of KITLG and a haplotype including all eight genotyped SNPs were associated with moderate-to-severe BPD in the northern Finnish population. When all the populations were combined, SNP rs11104948 was significantly associated with BPD. Kit ligand concentration in umbilical cord blood of infants born very preterm was an independent risk factor of BPD., CONCLUSIONS: We show that KITLG polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to moderate-to-severe BPD.

Large aggregate surfactant was isolated from daily tracheal aspirates (TAs) for measurement of SP-B content, total protein, and phospholipid (PL)., RESULTS: Late administration of surfactant had minimal acute adverse effects. Clinical status as well as surfactant recovery and SP-B content in tracheal aspirate were transiently improved as compared to the controls; these effects waned after 1 d. The change in SP-B content with surfactant dosing was positively correlated with SP-B levels during treatment (r = 0.50, P = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: Low SP-B values increased with calfactant administration, but the relationship of this response to SP-B levels suggests that degradation is a contributing mechanism for SP-B deficiency and surfactant dysfunction.

CXCR2 deficiency abolished the transmigration of neutrophils into the alveolar lumen in IL-1beta-expressing mice, but did not alter the number of neutrophils in the parenchyma. The deletion of CXCR2 increased the alveolar chord length and reduced the survival of mice when IL-1beta was expressed from the pseudoglandular to the alveolar stages. The capillary configuration was highly abnormal in both IL-1beta/CXCR2(+/+) and IL-1beta/CXCR2(-/-) lungs, but in very different ways. The cellular area of the parenchyma and the total capillary area of IL-1beta/CXCR2(+/+) and IL-1beta/CXCR2(-/-) mice were smaller than those of control/CXCR2(+/+) and control/CXCR2(-/-) mice, but the ratio of capillary area to cellular area was similar in all four genotypes.

At PN5, hUC-MSCs (1 x 106, 5x 106,or 1x 107 cells per pup) were given intraperitoneally to newborn rats exposed to 75% O2 from birth; the controls received an equal volume of normal saline (NS). At PN14, the lung tissues, serum, and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) were collected for histologic examination, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio analysis, engraftment, myeoloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis, cytokine analysis, and western blot analysis of protein expression., Results: Compared to rat pups reared in RA, rat pups reared in hyperoxia had a significant lower survival rate (53.3%) (P < 0.01). Hyperoxia-exposed rats exhibited pulmonary inflammation accompanied by alveolar-capillary leakage, neutrophile infiltration, augmented myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, prominent alveolar simplification, and increased mean linear intercept (MLI), which was ameliorated by hUC-MSCs treatment. Increased oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production were also reduced. Importantly, the expression of Fas, an apoptosis-associated protein that was increasingly expressed in hyperoxia-exposed rats (P < 0.05), was downregulated after administration of hUC-MSCs (P < 0.05)., Conclusions: Our results suggest that intraperitoneal administration of high number hUC-MSCs (1 x 107 cells) may represent an effective modality for the treatment of hyperoxia-induced BPD in neonatal rats.

Extreme phenotypic variability exists among preterm infants of similar gestational ages, making it difficult to predict which infants are at increased risk for developing PH. Intrauterine growth retardation or drug exposures, postnatal therapy with prolonged positive pressure ventilation, cardiovascular shunts, poor postnatal lung and somatic growth, and genetic or epigenetic factors may all contribute to the development of PH in preterm infants with BPD. In addition to the variability of severity of PH, there is also qualitative variability seen in PH, such as the variable responses to vasoactive medications. To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with PH, a multi-pronged approach is needed. First, improved screening for and increased recognition of PH may allow for earlier treatment and better clinical outcomes. Second, identification of both prenatal and postnatal risk factors for the development of PH may allow targeting of therapy and resources for those at highest risk. Third, understanding the pathophysiology of the preterm pulmonary vascular bed may help improve outcomes through recognizing pathways that are dysregulated in PH, identifying novel biomarkers, and testing novel treatments. Finally, the recognition of conditions and exposures that may exacerbate or lead to recurrent PH is needed to help with developing treatment guidelines and preventative strategies that can be used to reduce the burden of disease.

Risk factors for BPD are complex and include prenatal infection and O(2) toxicity. BPD pathology is equally complex and characterized by inflammation and dysmorphic airspaces and vasculature. Due to the limited availability of clinical samples, an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease and its causal mechanisms and associated biomarkers is limited., OBJECTIVES: Apply genome-wide expression profiling to define pathways affected in BPD lungs., METHODS: Lung tissue was obtained at autopsy from 11 BPD cases and 17 age-matched control subjects without BPD. RNA isolated from these tissue samples was interrogated using microarrays. Standard gene selection and pathway analysis methods were applied to the data set. Abnormal expression patterns were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 159 genes differentially expressed in BPD tissues. Pathway analysis indicated previously appreciated (e.g., DNA damage regulation of cell cycle) as well as novel (e.g., B-cell development) biological functions were affected. Three of the five most highly induced genes were mast cell (MC)-specific markers. We confirmed an increased accumulation of connective tissue MC(TC) (chymase expressing) mast cells in BPD tissues. Increased expression of MC(TC) markers was also demonstrated in an animal model of BPD-like pathology., CONCLUSIONS: We present a unique genome-wide expression data set from human BPD lung tissue. Our data provide information on gene expression patterns associated with BPD and facilitated the discovery that MC(TC) accumulation is a prominent feature of this disease. These observations have significant clinical and mechanistic implications.","group":"g2","id":"fdcf88e1-0b0e-42f0-9694-30dc03beb207","_showDetails":true},"2c8c11fd-09a0-446c-9e72-e97c2a6716d6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"MicroRNA-mRNA interactions in a murine model of hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-13-204","authors":["Dong, Jie","Carey, William A","Abel, Stuart","Collura, Christopher","Jiang, Guoqian","Tomaszek, Sandra","Sutor, Shari","Roden, Anja C","Asmann, Yan W","Prakash, Y S","Wigle, Dennis A"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20120530//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Disease Models, Animal","Gene Expression Profiling","*Hyperoxia","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Injury/ge [Genetics]","*Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Membrane Glycoproteins/ge [Genetics]","Membrane Glycoproteins/me [Metabolism]","Mice","*MicroRNAs/me [Metabolism]","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/ge [Genetics]","Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/me [Metabolism]","*RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"BMC genomics","volume":"13","isbn":"1471-2164","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22646479"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease of premature neonates characterized by arrested pulmonary alveolar development. There is increasing evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) during lung organogenesis. The potential role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of BPD is unclear., RESULTS: Following exposure of neonatal mice to 80% O2 or room air (RA) for either 14 or 29 days, lungs of hyperoxic mice displayed histological changes consistent with BPD. Comprehensive miRNA and mRNA profiling was performed using lung tissue from both O2 and RA treated mice, identifying a number of dynamically regulated miRNAs and associated mRNA target genes. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that hyperoxia modulated genes involved in a variety of lung developmental processes, including cell cycle, cell adhesion, mobility and taxis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. MiR-29 was prominently increased in the lungs of hyperoxic mice, and several predicted mRNA targets of miR-29 were validated with real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Direct miR-29 targets were further validated in vitro using bronchoalveolar stem cells., CONCLUSION: In newborn mice, prolonged hyperoxia induces an arrest of alveolar development similar to that seen in human neonates with BPD. This abnormal lung development is accompanied by significant increases in the levels of multiple miRNAs and corresponding decreases in the levels of predicted mRNA targets, many of which have known or suspected roles in pathways altered in BPD. These data support the hypothesis that dynamic regulation of miRNAs plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of BPD.","group":"g3","id":"2c8c11fd-09a0-446c-9e72-e97c2a6716d6","_showDetails":true},"644d423e-cfde-44d4-b92e-9f827c02f123":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"Comparative genome analysis of 19 Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum strains.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-12-88","authors":["Paralanov, Vanya","Lu, Jin","Duffy, Lynn B","Crabb, Donna M","Shrivastava, Susmita","Methe, Barbara A","Inman, Jason","Yooseph, Shibu","Xiao, Li","Cassell, Gail H","Waites, Ken B","Glass, John I"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20120530//","keywords":["Animals","*DNA, Bacterial/ch [Chemistry]","*DNA, Bacterial/ge [Genetics]","Evolution, Molecular","Gene Transfer, Horizontal","*Genome, Bacterial","Humans","Molecular Sequence Data","*Sequence Analysis, DNA","*Ureaplasma/ge [Genetics]","Ureaplasma/ip [Isolation & Purification]","*Ureaplasma urealyticum/ge [Genetics]","Ureaplasma urealyticum/ip [Isolation & Purification]","Virulence Factors/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"BMC microbiology","volume":"12","isbn":"1471-2180","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22646228"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Ureaplasma urealyticum (UUR) and Ureaplasma parvum (UPA) are sexually transmitted bacteria among humans implicated in a variety of disease states including but not limited to: nongonococcal urethritis, infertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes, chorioamnionitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates. There are 10 distinct serotypes of UUR and 4 of UPA. Efforts to determine whether difference in pathogenic potential exists at the ureaplasma serovar level have been hampered by limitations of antibody-based typing methods, multiple cross-reactions and poor discriminating capacity in clinical samples containing two or more serovars., RESULTS: We determined the genome sequences of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) type strains of all UUR and UPA serovars as well as four clinical isolates of UUR for which we were not able to determine serovar designation. UPA serovars had 0.75-0.78 Mbp genomes and UUR serovars were 0.84-0.95 Mbp. The original classification of ureaplasma isolates into distinct serovars was largely based on differences in the major ureaplasma surface antigen called the multiple banded antigen (MBA) and reactions of human and animal sera to the organisms. Whole genome analysis of the 14 serovars and the 4 clinical isolates showed the mba gene was part of a large superfamily, which is a phase variable gene system, and that some serovars have identical sets of mba genes. Most of the differences among serovars are hypothetical genes, and in general the two species and 14 serovars are extremely similar at the genome level., CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genome analysis suggests UUR is more capable of acquiring genes horizontally, which may contribute to its greater virulence for some conditions. The overwhelming evidence of extensive horizontal gene transfer among these organisms from our previous studies combined with our comparative analysis indicates that ureaplasmas exist as quasi-species rather than as stable serovars in their native environment. Therefore, differential pathogenicity and clinical outcome of a ureaplasmal infection is most likely not on the serovar level, but rather may be due to the presence or absence of potential pathogenicity factors in an individual ureaplasma clinical isolate and/or patient to patient differences in terms of autoimmunity and microbiome.","group":"g3","id":"644d423e-cfde-44d4-b92e-9f827c02f123","_showDetails":false},"f9e5b939-bd36-46e8-bf4d-66a25b3ada06":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"Genetic polymorphisms of antioxidant enzymes as risk factors for oxidative stress-associated complications in preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10715762.2012.692787","authors":["Giusti, Betti","Vestrini, Anna","Poggi, Chiara","Magi, Alberto","Pasquini, Elisabetta","Abbate, Rosanna","Dani, Carlo"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20120613//","keywords":["*Antioxidants/me [Metabolism]","Catalase/ge [Genetics]","Catalase/me [Metabolism]","Child, Preschool","Cohort Studies","Genotype","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/me [Metabolism]","*Oxidative Stress","*Polymorphism, Genetic/ge [Genetics]","*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/ge [Genetics]","Risk Factors","Superoxide Dismutase/ge [Genetics]","Superoxide Dismutase/me [Metabolism]","Superoxide Dismutase-1"],"journal":"Free radical research","volume":"46","number":"9","isbn":"1029-2470","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22574884"],"address":"England","abstract":"We aimed to identify specific polymorphisms of genes encoding for superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 (cytoplasmic Cu/ZnSOD), SOD2 (mitochondrial MnSOD), SOD3 (extracellular Cu/ZnSOD) and CAT in a cohort of preterm infants and correlate their presence to the development of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We carried out a retrospective study to evaluate the allele frequency and the genotype distribution of polymorphisms of SODs and CAT in a population of preterm neonates (n = 152) with a gestational age <= 28 weeks according to the presence or absence of RDS, BPD, IVH and ROP. Moreover, we evaluated through the haplotype reconstruction analysis whether combinations of the selected polymorphisms are related to the occurrence of RDS, BPD, IVH and ROP. We found that rs8192287 SOD3 polymorphism is an independent protective factor for all grade IVH, while rs4880 and rs5746136 SOD2 polymorphisms are associated with a lower gestational age (rs4880, rs5746136) and birth weight (rs4880).

The rs8192287 SOD3 polymorphism is per se an independent predictor of a decreased risk of developing IVH.

While promising, the use of BMSC (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell) in the treatment of lung diseases remains controversial. We have assessed the therapeutic effects of BMSC in vitro and in vivo. In vitro co-culturing with injured lung tissue increased the migration-potential of BMSC; and SP-C (surfactant protein-C), a specific marker of AEC2 (type II alveolar epithelial cells), was expressed. Following intraperitoneal injection of BMSC into experimental BPD mice on post-natal day 7, it was found that BMSC can home to the injured lung, express SP-C, improve pulmonary architecture, attenuate pulmonary fibrosis and increase the survival rate of BPD mice. This work supports the notion that BMSC are of therapeutic benefit through the production of soluble factors at bioactive levels that regulate the pathogenesis of inflammation and fibrosis following hyperoxia.","group":"g1","id":"12fb53bf-e6af-4351-8bc1-81ee4ab1a3ff","_showDetails":true},"dea944b0-762d-457f-8e07-f478c1a2e812":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"Pentoxifylline and prevention of hyperoxia-induced lung -injury in neonatal rats.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2012.14","authors":["Almario, Beatriz","Wu, Shu","Peng, Jinghong","Alapati, Deepthi","Chen, Shaoyi","Sosenko, Ilene R S"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20120209//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Enzymes/me [Metabolism]","Female","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Injury/pc [Prevention & Control]","Macrophages/pa [Pathology]","*Pentoxifylline/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Edema/pc [Prevention & Control]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"71","number":"5","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22322387"],"address":"United States","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Oxygen exposure plays an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Severe BPD was associated with higher risks of mortality, more postnatal growth failure, long term respiratory and neurological developmental retardation. Inflammation plays a central role in alveolar simplification and dysregulated vascularization of BPD. There is no effective treatment to improve BPD severity in clinical practice. Our previous clinical study showed autologous cord blood mononuclear cells (ACBMNCs) infusion could reduce the respiratory support duration safely and potential improved BPD severity. Abundant preclinical studies have reported the immunomodulation effect as an important mechanism underlying the beneficial results of stem cell therapies in preventing and treating BPD. However, clinical studies assessing the immunomodulatory effect after stem cells therapy were rare. This study was to investigate the effect of ACBMNCs infusion soon after birth on prevention for severe BPD and long term outcomes in very preterm neonates. The immune cells and inflammatory biomarkers were detected to investigate the underlying immunomodulatory mechanisms., Methods: This single-center, prospective, investigator-initiated, non-randomized trial with blinded outcome assessment aimed to assess the effect of a single intravenous infusion of ACBMNCs in preventing severe BPD (moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks of gestational age or discharge home) in surviving very preterm neonates less than 32 gestational weeks. Patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital from July 01, 2018 to January 1, 2020 were assigned to receiving a targeted dosage of 5 x 107 cells/kg ACBMNC or normal saline intravenously within 24 h after enrollment. Incidence of moderate or severe BPD in survivors were investigated as the primary short term outcome. Growth, respiratory and neurological development were assessed as long term outcomes at corrected age of 18-24 month-old. Immune cells and inflammatory biomarkers were detected for potential mechanism investigation. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02999373)., Findings: Six-two infants were enrolled, of which 29 were enrolled to intervention group, 33 to control group. Moderate or severe BPD in survivors significantly decreased in intervention group (adjusted p = 0.021). The number of patients needed to treat to gain one moderate or severe BPD-free survival was 5 (95% confidence interval: 3-20). Survivors in the intervention group had a significantly higher chance to be extubated than infants in the control group (adjusted p = 0.018). There was no statistical significant difference in total BPD incidence (adjusted p = 0.106) or mortality (p = 1.000). Incidence of developmental delay reduced in intervention group in long term follow-up (adjusted p = 0.047). Specific immune cells including proportion of T cells (p = 0.04) and CD4+ T cells in lymphocytes (p = 0.03), and CD4+ CD25+ forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)+ regulatory T cells in CD4+ T cells increased significantly after ACBMNCs intervention (p < 0.001). Anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was higher (p = 0.03), while pro-inflammatory factor such as TNF-a (p = 0.03) and C reactive protein (p < 0.001) level was lower in intervention group than in control group after intervention., Interpretation: ACBMNCs could prevent moderate or severe BPD in surviving very premature neonates and might improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in long term. An immunomodulatory effect of MNCs contributed to the improvement of BPD severity., Funding: This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFC2701700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82101817, 82171714, 8187060625), Guangzhou science and technology program (202102080104).

However, prolonged exposure to high concentrations of oxygen causes hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI), which manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults and leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns (NBs). Nitric oxide (NO), NO synthases (NOSs), and angiopoietin (Ang) 2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HALI. However, the mechanisms of the contributions of NOS/NO and the relationship(s) between NOS/NO and Ang2 have not been addressed. In addition, the relevance of these moieties in adults and NBs has not been evaluated. To address these issues, we compared the responses in hyperoxia of wild-type (NOS [+/+]) and NOS null (-/-) young adult and NB mice. When compared with NOS2(+/+) adult controls, NOS2(-/-) animals manifest exaggerated alveolar-capillary protein leak and premature death. These responses were associated with enhanced levels of structural cell death, enhanced expression of proapoptotic regulatory proteins, and Ang2. Importantly, silencing RNA knockdown of Ang2 decreased the levels of cell death and the expression of proapoptotic mediators. These effects were at least partially NOS2 specific, and were development dependent, because survival was similar in adult NOS3(+/+) and NOS3(-/-) mice and NB NOS2(+/+) and NOS2(-/-) mice, respectively. These studies demonstrate that NOS2 plays an important protective role in HALI in adult animals. They also demonstrate that this response is mediated, at least in part, by the ability of NOS2 to inhibit hyperoxia-induced Ang2 production and thereby decrease Ang2-induced tissue injury.","group":"g1","id":"72dbb8dc-dae1-47e3-9c94-e60d3b794681","_showDetails":true},"4a1f27f5-4a01-4c85-ba87-87d2627960df":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"A quantitative analysis of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum compared with host immune response in preterm neonates at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.06625-11","authors":["Payne, Matthew S","Goss, Kevin C W","Connett, Gary J","Legg, Julian P","Bruce, Ken D","Chalker, Vicki"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20111221//","keywords":["Bacterial Load","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mi [Microbiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","C-Reactive Protein/an [Analysis]","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal","Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/mt [Methods]","Premature Birth","Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","Ureaplasma/im [Immunology]","*Ureaplasma/ip [Isolation & Purification]","Ureaplasma Infections/im [Immunology]","*Ureaplasma Infections/mi [Microbiology]","Ureaplasma Infections/pa [Pathology]","Ureaplasma urealyticum/im [Immunology]","*Ureaplasma urealyticum/ip [Isolation & Purification]"],"journal":"Journal of clinical microbiology","volume":"50","number":"3","isbn":"0095-1137","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22189123"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Multiplex, real-time PCR for the identification of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum was performed on nucleic acids extracted from sequential endotracheal aspirates obtained from preterm neonates born at <29 weeks of gestation and ventilated for more than 48 h admitted to two level 3 neonatal intensive care units.

No vaccine is available to provide active immunity against RSV, but live attenuated and subunit cloned surface protein vaccines are in development.","group":"g1","id":"bc818e8c-5ff2-4346-84d6-3353b592add7","_showDetails":true},"1c583a4a-2351-4943-b7b9-c79d5eb83c4d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"HLA and bronchopulmonary dysplasia susceptibility: a pilot study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/DMA-2011-0811","authors":["Rocha, Gustavo","Proenca, Elisa","Areias, Augusta","Freitas, Fatima","Lima, Bruno","Rodrigues, Teresa","Alves, Helena","Guimaraes, Hercilia"],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Case-Control Studies","Female","Gene Frequency","Genetic Association Studies","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease","*HLA Antigens/ge [Genetics]","Haplotypes","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Pilot Projects","Statistics, Nonparametric"],"journal":"Disease markers","volume":"31","number":"4","isbn":"0278-0240","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=22045425"],"address":"United States","abstract":"There is little data on the association between Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) of the preterm newborn. Our aim was to assess associations between HLA alleles and BPD susceptibility. We studied 156 preterm neonates (82 M/ 74 F) < 32 weeks gestational age, alive at 36 weeks gestational age. Detailed clinical data were collected. HLA typing was performed by PCR-SSO. HLA allele frequencies where determined by direct counting for BPD and no-BPD groups. Comparison between BPD and no BPD groups was performed using t-test, chi2 test or Fisher exact test and logistic regression as appropriate. Relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were also calculated as association measures. We diagnosed 56 (35.9%) neonates with mild BPD and 27 (17%) with moderate/ severe BPD. We found a significant association between HLA-DRB1*01 and mild BPD (OR=3.48[1.23-10.2]). The alleles HLA-A*24, -A*68, -B*51,-Cw*07, -Cw*14, -Cw*15 and -DRB1*01 presented a significant association with moderate/ severe BPD. When adjusted to gestational age and birth weight HLA-A*68 (OR=5.41[1.46; 20.05]), -B*51 (OR=3.09[1.11; 8.63]) and -Cw*14 (OR=4.94[1.15; 21.25]) were significantly associated with moderate/ severe BPD. Conclusion - Our findings suggest an association between HLA-A*68, -B*51 and -C*14 and BPD susceptibility, and that an autoimmune mechanism may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease.","group":"g1","id":"1c583a4a-2351-4943-b7b9-c79d5eb83c4d","_showDetails":true},"50abcb1a-ff74-406c-abbf-b7cd3dd63ddf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Neonatal revolution - the introduction of PEEP.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2011.03677.x","authors":["Brown, T C K"],"date":"2011//","keywords":["Airway Management/hi [History]","Airway Management/is [Instrumentation]","*Anesthesiology/hi [History]","History, 20th Century","Humans","Hyaline Membrane Disease/th [Therapy]","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Oxygen/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Pediatrics/hi [History]","*Positive-Pressure Respiration/hi [History]","Positive-Pressure Respiration/is [Instrumentation]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/th [Therapy]","Survival"],"journal":"Paediatric anaesthesia","volume":"21","number":"10","isbn":"1155-5645","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21981092"],"address":"France","abstract":"Fifty years ago, a baby born at 24-26 weeks was not considered viable.

The X-ray appearances of RDS disappeared. Unfortunately, one died of portal vein thrombosis because the drugs were administered by umbilical catheter, which were commonly used at the time.

We aim to reveal the relationship between amniotic fluid (AF) peptides and lung development by analyzing the differences in the composition of AF peptides at different gestational periods, thus providing a new means of prevention and treatment for BPD., Methods: Based on the stages of lung development, we collected AF by amniocentesis in two different gestational periods, using the 25th week of pregnancy as the cut-off. We conducted a peptide omics analysis of these AF samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Additionally, we verified the regulatory effects of hyperoxia and the peptide COL5A2 on BPD-related cells [(mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells] by 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, JC-1 staining, flow cytometry, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay., Results: There were 131 differentially expressed peptides, including 85 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated [fold change (FC) >=1.2 or <=1/1.2, P<0.05], in the >=25 weeks' gestation group compared to the <25 weeks' gestation group. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that the precursor proteins of the differentially expressed peptides between these two groups were involved in the regulation of the developmental process, anatomical structure development, and other biological processes, suggesting that these differential peptides may play a key role in lung development. We found peptide COL5A2 with the sequence GPPGEPGPPG and verified the regulatory effects of COL5A2 on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell viability, and ROS levels of MLE-12 cells by cell assays., Conclusions: In this study, peptidomic studies using AF from different gestational periods revealed that peptides in AF may be involved in lung development. They could be used in the future to assist in the postnatal development of preterm infants and provide new therapeutic prospects for BPD. Copyright 2023 Translational Pediatrics.

Genetic factors might contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia susceptibility., OBJECTIVES: To identify genetic variants involved in bronchopulmonary dysplasia through a genome-wide association study., METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 418 premature neonates (gestational age <28 wk), of whom 22% developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Two discovery series were created, using a DNA pooling strategy in neonates from white and African ancestry. Polymorphisms associated with the disease were confirmed in an independent replication population. Genes were then explored by fine mapping and associations were replicated in an external Finnish population of 213 neonates. Validated genes expression patterns were studied in rat lung, after air or hyperoxia exposure., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: SPOCK2 gene was identified by both discovery series. The most significant polymorphism (rs1245560; P = 1.66 x 10(-7)) was confirmed by individual genotyping, and in the replication population (P = 0.002). Fine mapping confirmed the association of rs1245560 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in both white and African populations with adjusted odds ratios of 2.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-6.40) and 4.87 (95% CI, 1.88-12.63), respectively. In white neonates, rs1049269 was also associated with the disease (odds ratio, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.51-6.82). These associations were replicated in the Finnish population. In newborn rat lungs, SPOCK2 mRNA levels markedly increased during the alveolar stage of lung development. After rat exposure to hyperoxia, SPOCK2 expression increased relative to air-exposed controls., CONCLUSIONS: We identified SPOCK2 as a new possible candidate susceptibility gene for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Its lung expression pattern points toward a potential role in alveolarization.","group":"g2","id":"df76eacb-bc80-4497-be4b-893d06bbeb4a","_showDetails":true},"95669161-4a51-4bdd-997a-6dee06fadf74":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"A comprehensive approach to the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.21508","authors":["Kugelman, Amir","Durand, Manuel"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20110803//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","Humans","Infant, Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Intubation, Intratracheal","*Postnatal Care/mt [Methods]","Premature Birth/pc [Prevention & Control]","Prenatal Care/mt [Methods]","Pulmonary Surfactants/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Respiration, Artificial","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/pc [Prevention & Control]"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"46","number":"12","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21815280"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The current bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is seen in infants born extremely premature, with less severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and who received prenatal steroids-\"new BPD\". The pathophysiology of BPD is based on an impairment of lung maturation with prenatal and postnatal multi-hit insults and genetic susceptibility. This multifactorial pathophysiology of BPD suggests that no single \"magic bullet\" will prevent it. Thus, to avoid BPD we need to implement a complex and comprehensive strategy. This strategy is based on ventilatory and non-ventilatory measures. The ventilatory route allows an individualized endotracheal intubation approach. Early lung recruitment with nasal respiratory support (nasal continuous positive airway pressure [NCPAP] or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation [NIPPV] / synchronized NIPPV [SNIPPV]) and the INSURE (intubation, surfactant and early extubation) approach are discussed. Initial treatment with NCPAP did not reduce the rate of BPD compared to endotracheal ventilation and surfactant administration. While NIPPV/SNIPPV may have short-term advantages over NCPAP, the effect on BPD needs to be further studied. During hospitalization the respiratory goals should aim for adequate oxygenation, permissive hypercapnia, and gentle ventilation. However, these goals were found to have short-term benefits but did not reduce significantly the rate of BPD. Selective use of a short course of low dose corticosteroids can be considered after the first or second week of life in infants who are unable to be weaned from the ventilator and are at high risk for BPD. Non-ventilatory measures include early nutritional support with fluid restriction, caffeine and consideration of vitamin A. Hemodynamic significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may be associated with BPD, but medical or surgical treatment of PDA were not shown to decrease BPD. Each component and the strategy as a whole needs to be further studied in large randomized prospective studies or by meta-analyses, especially in the target population of extremely premature infants who are the most prone to BPD.

Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) accelerates surfactant production in fetal type II pneumocytes (PN-II), protects epithelia from injury and is deficient in lungs developing BPD, highlighting its potential efficacy in neonates. Neonatal rats were treated with recombinant human (rh)KGF, betamethasone, or their combination for 48 hr prior to sacrifice after which body weight, surfactant, and tissue phosphatidylcholines (PC) were investigated at postnatal d3, d7, d15, and d21. Pneumocyte proliferation, surfactant protein (SP) expression and SP-B/C in lung lavage fluid (LLF) were also determined at d7 and d21 to identify broader surfactant changes occurring at the beginning and end of the initial alveolarization phase. While all treatments increased secreted surfactant PC, BM compromised animal growth whereas rhKGF did not. At d3 rhKGF was more effective in male compared to female rats. Single treatments became less effective towards d21. Neither treatment altered PC composition in LLF. BM inhibited PN-II proliferation and increased surfactant PCs at the expense of tissue PCs. rhKGF however increased surfactant PCs without decreasing other PC species. Whereas SP-B/C gene expression was induced by all treatments, the changes in secreted SP-B/C mirrored those observed for surfactant PC. Our results encourage investigation of the mechanisms by which rhKGF improves surfactant homoeostasis, and detailed examination of its efficacy in neonatal lung injury models with a view to implementing it as a non-catabolic surfactant-increasing therapeutic in neonatal intensive care.

The purpose of this study was to assess longitudinal changes in pulmonary function in infants with a history of BPD over the first 3 years of life, and the relationship to somatic growth. Spirometry was measured using the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique, and lung volumes measured by plethysmography. Eighteen infants (mean gestational age +/- SD 27.3 +/- 2.2 weeks, birthweight 971 +/- 259 g) underwent two lung function studies. Average age at first test was 58.8 weeks. Spirometry demonstrated significant reductions in forced expiratory volume in 0.5 sec (FEV(0.5), 76.0 +/- 15.9% predicted, Z-score -2.13 +/- 1.69), forced expiratory flow at 75% of expired forced vital capacity (FEF(75), 54.8 +/- 31.1%, -3.58 +/- 2.73), and FEF(25-75) (67.8 +/- 33.3%, -1.79 +/- 1.76). Group mean total lung capacity (TLC) was in the low normal range (82.9 +/- 13.5% predicted) and residual volume (RV)/TLC was mildly elevated (122.4 +/- 38.2% predicted). Repeat testing was performed an average of 32.7 weeks after initial testing. At re-evaluation, group mean lung volumes and flows tracked at or near their previous values; thus, in general, there was a lack of catch-up growth. However, compared to infants with below average or average somatic growth (as represented by g/day), infants with above average growth showed significantly greater improvements in percent predicted FVC, FEV(0.5), TLC, and RV/TLC (all P < 0.05, ANOVA). We conclude that longitudinal measures of pulmonary function in infants and young children with BPD demonstrate significant airflow obstruction and modest restriction, which tends to persist with time.

However, hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)A enzymes have been implicated in hyperoxic lung injury. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hyperoxia induces CYP1A1 and 1A2 enzymes by transcriptional activation of the corresponding promoters in vivo, and transgenic mice expressing the human CYP1A1 or the mouse 1A2 promoter would be more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than wild type (WT) mice. Adult WT (CD-1) (12week-old) mice, transgenic mice carrying a 10kb human CYP1A1 promoter and the luciferase (luc) reporter gene (CYP1A1-luc), or mice expressing the mouse CYP1A2 promoter (CYP1A2-luc) were maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia for 24-72h. Hyperoxia exposure of CYP1A1-luc mice for 24 and 48h resulted in 2.5- and 1.25-fold increases, respectively, in signal intensities, compared to room air controls. By 72h, the induction had declined to control levels. CYP1A2-luc mice also showed enhanced luc expression after 24-48h, albeit to a lesser extent than those expressing the CYP1A1 promoter. Also, these mice showed decreased levels of endogenous CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression after prolonged hyperoxia, and were also more susceptible to lung injury than similarly exposed WT mice, with CYP1A2-luc mice showing the greatest injury. Our results support the hypothesis that hyperoxia induces CYP1A enzymes by transcriptional activation of its corresponding promoters, and that decreased endogenous expression of these enzymes contribute to the increased susceptibilities to hyperoxic lung injury in the transgenic animals. In summary, this is the first report providing direct evidence of hyperoxia-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression in vivo by mechanisms entailing transcriptional activation of the corresponding promoters, a phenomenon that has implications for hyperoxic lung injury, as well as other pathologies caused by oxidative stress.

The phenotype of cultured fibroblasts was investigated by red oil O and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) staining. Cell necrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation were analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase release, cleaved caspase-3 activation and release of cytokines and chemokines into the supernatant, respectively., RESULTS: First, we characterized the phenotype of the cultured fibroblasts and found an absence of red oil O staining and 100% positive staining for alpha-SMA, indicating that cultured fibroblasts were myofibroblasts. Mechanical stretch increased necrosis and apoptosis by two- and three-fold, compared to unstretched samples. Incubation of monolayers with IL-10 prior to stretch did not affect necrosis but significantly decreased apoptosis.

A key histopathological feature of BPD is late lung growth retardation, in which the process of alveolarization is hindered and the mechanism of which is unclear. Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) promote the development of BPD via the inhibition of their target genes. MiR-495 has been reported to be involved in various lung diseases. However, the physiological function of miR-495 in BPD has not yet been fully understood., Methods: Differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral blood of patients with BPD were compared with those of normal controls. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the target genes of miR-495. A BPD neonatal rat model was established by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the amniotic sac of pregnant rats. The morphology of the lungs was observed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The expression of miR-495, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 4-like (NEDD4L), and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) was tested using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescent (IF) staining., Results: The expression of miR-495 was significantly increased in the peripheral blood samples of premature infants with BPD and verified using qRT-PCR. NEDD4L was proven to be the target gene of miR-495. Additionally, miR-495 expression was also increased in the lungs of rat pups with BPD at postnatal day (P) 3 compared with the control group. qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that NEDD4L expression was decreased while ENaC expression was increased at the transcriptional and translational levels. IF staining results showed that NEDD4L level was decreased while ENaC level was increased in the LPS-induced BPD rat model, which was consistent with abnormal changes in alveolar structure., Conclusions: The aberrant overexpression of miR-495 may contribute to the development of BPD by targeting NEDD4L-ENaC pathway, implying an imbalance in lung fluid clearance.

There was no statistical significant difference in the total intake of fluids, calories, glucose or protein and weight gain per day in both groups. The risk of developing BPD was slightly increased in infants with cumulative caloric intake below the minimal requirement of 1230 kcal/kg and a cumulative protein intake below 43.5 g/kg. Furthermore, the risk of developing BPD was significantly higher when infants had a cumulative fluid intake above the recommended 1840 ml/kg. In infants who developed BPD, the enteral nutrition was significantly lower than in non-BPD infants [456 ml/kg (IQR 744, 235) vs. 685 (IQR 987, 511)]. Infants who did not develop BPD reached 50% of total enteral feeding significantly faster [9.6 days vs. 11.5]., CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants developing BPD received less enteral feeding, even though it was well compensated by the parenteral nutrient supply.

Exposure to hyperoxia disrupts developmental signaling pathways and causes alveolar hypoplasia as seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia affecting preterm human newborns. Expanding literature suggests that epigenetic changes caused by environmental triggers during development may lead to heritable changes in gene expression. Given recent data on altered histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in lungs of humans and animal models with airspace enlargement/emphysema, we hypothesized that alveolar hypoplasia from hyperoxia exposure in neonatal mice is a consequence of cell cycle arrest and reduced HDAC activity and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. We exposed newborn mice to hyperoxia and compared lung morphologic and epigenetic changes to room air controls. Furthermore, we pretreated a subgroup of animals with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (AZM), known to possess antiinflammatory properties. Our results showed that hyperoxia exposure resulted in alveolar hypoplasia and was associated with decreased HDAC1 and HDAC2 and increased p53 and p21 expression. Furthermore, AZM did not confer protection against hyperoxia-induced alveolar changes. These findings suggest that alveolar hypoplasia caused by hyperoxia is mediated by epigenetic changes affecting cell cycle regulation/senescence during lung development.","group":"g1","id":"bb342250-3557-48f5-87d1-29c1cae974ae","_showDetails":true},"f3788288-97ba-4073-a693-9de90a1a319e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Subacute onset of abnormal gait and head drop in a 3-year-old with history of extreme prematurity.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0883073810382142","authors":["Brosch, Jared R","Sant, Roma V","Golomb, Meredith R"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20110121//","keywords":["Child, Preschool","Disease Progression","*Head/pp [Physiopathology]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","*Movement Disorders/pa [Pathology]","*Movement Disorders/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"Journal of child neurology","volume":"26","number":"3","isbn":"0883-0738","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21257840"],"address":"United States","abstract":"A 3-year-old boy who had been a 23-week premature infant had subacute onset of abnormal gait, which progressed to generalized weakness with severe weakness of neck extensors.

Mice expressing hIL-1beta from the late saccular to alveolar stage had smaller alveolar chord length, thinner septal walls, less airway remodeling and mucus metaplasia, and better survival than mice expressing hIL-1beta during the saccular stage. Human IL-1beta overexpression in the saccular stage was sufficient to cause a BPD-like illness in infant mice, whereas the lung was more resistant to hIL-1beta-induced injury at earlier and later developmental stages.","group":"g1","id":"d76de924-4043-4267-9eb1-846b40c52255","_showDetails":true},"0e2394fd-466d-4617-822b-a242e854fba8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Blood protein concentrations in the first two postnatal weeks that predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia among infants born before the 28th week of gestation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e31820a58f3","authors":["Bose, Carl","Laughon, Matthew","Allred, Elizabeth N","Van Marter, Linda J","O'Shea, T Michael","Ehrenkranz, Richard A","Fichorova, Raina","Leviton, Alan","Elgan Study Investigators"],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*Blood Proteins","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Chemokines/bl [Blood]","Chemokines/im [Immunology]","Cohort Studies","Cytokines/bl [Blood]","Cytokines/im [Immunology]","Female","*Gestational Age","Humans","*Infant, Newborn/bl [Blood]","*Infant, Premature/bl [Blood]","Odds Ratio","*Pneumonia/bl [Blood]","Pneumonia/co [Complications]","Pregnancy","Risk Factors"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"69","number":"4","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21150694"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Lung inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and may be accompanied by a systematic inflammatory response.

Good biomarkers of neutrophil oxidant activity and lung infection are needed. We tested whether glutathione sulfonamide, a product of glutathione oxidation by myeloperoxidase-derived hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and a potential new neutrophil oxidant biomarker, is detectable in endotracheal aspirates from ventilated preterm infants. As infectious organisms stimulate neutrophils to generate HOCl, we determined whether levels of HOCl-specific biomarkers were increased in samples that were bacterial culture positive. Glutathione sulfonamide was detected in 66 of 87 endotracheal aspirate samples. Levels correlated with myeloperoxidase activity and another HOCl-specific marker, chlorotyrosine. Median levels of glutathione sulfonamide (4-fold) and other biomarkers (2-fold) were significantly higher in culture positive aspirates.

LPS-mediated type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that trigger pulmonary neutrophil influx, alveolar matrix degradation and lung remodeling. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase (Nox)-dependent mechanisms mediate LPS-induced cytokine expression in AEC. We examined the role of p47phox in mediating LPS-dependent inflammatory cytokine expression in A549 cells (which exhibit phenotypic features characteristic of type II AEC) and elucidated the proximal signaling events by which Nox is activated by LPS. LPS-induced ICAM-1 and IL-8 expression was associated with increased superoxide formation in AEC. LPS-mediated oxidative stress and cytokine expression was inhibited by apocynin and augmented by PMA demonstrating that Nox-dependent redox signaling regulates LPS-dependent pro-inflammatory signaling in AEC. In LPS-treated cells, p47phox translocated from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region and co-localized with gp91phox. LPS also induced a temporal increase in p47phox serine304 phosphorylation in AEC. While inhibition of classical PKC and novel PKC with calphostin and rottlerin did not inhibit ICAM-1 or IL-8 expression, the myristolyated PKCzeta pseudosubstrate peptide (a specific inhibitor of PKCzeta) inhibited LPS-induced cytokine expression in AEC. Inhibition of PKCzeta also attenuated LPS-mediated p47phox phosphorylation and perinuclear translocation in AEC. Consistent with these data, LPS activated PKCzeta in AEC as evidenced by increased threonine410 phophorylation. We conclude that PKCzeta-mediated p47phox activation regulates LPS-dependent cytokine expression in AEC.

Thioredoxin (Trx) is an antioxidant that prevents oxidative stress-induced cell death, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The aim of this study was to determine the role of Trx in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury. Alveolar type II epithelial cells from fetal rat lung were exposed to hyperoxia in vitro in the presence or absence of recombinant human Trx (rhTrx 2 microg/ml). Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathways were detected by Western blotting. We also investigated the effects of rhTrx on the following antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase). Trx significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced cell death and increased cell viability. In addition, ROS generation in type II cells was inhibited by rhTrx under hyperoxic conditions. We demonstrated that rhTrx protected type II cells against hyperoxic injury via sustaining the extracellular signal regulated kinase and PI3K activation, and decreasing of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase and p38 activation. The results also showed manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were increased by rhTrx in type II cells exposed to hyperoxia.Taken together, these results demonstrate that rhTrx administration markedly attenuates hyperoxia-induced type II cell injury through reduction of ROS generation, elevation of antioxidant activities and regulation of both MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.

NO promotes alveolar growth. Inhaled NO (iNO) ameliorates the BPD phenotype in experimental models and in some premature infants. Arginosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and arginosuccinate lyase (ASL) convert L-citrulline to L-arginine; L-citrulline is regenerated during NO synthesis from L-arginine. Plasma levels of these NO precursors are low in PH. We hypothesized that L-citrulline prevents experimental O2-induced BPD in newborn rats. Rat pups were assigned from birth through postnatal day (P) 14 to room air (RA), RA + L-citrulline, 95% hyperoxia (BPD model), and 95%O2 + L-citrulline. Rat pups exposed to hyperoxia had fewer and enlarged air spaces and decreased capillary density, mimicking human BPD. This was associated with decreased plasma L-arginine and L-citrulline concentrations on P7. L-citrulline treatment significantly increased plasma L-arginine and L-citrulline concentrations and increased ASL protein expression in hyperoxia. L-citrulline preserved alveolar and vascular growth in O2-exposed pups and decreased pulmonary arterial medial wall thickness (MWT) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Increased lung arginase (ARG) activity in O2-exposed pups was reversed by L-citrulline treatment. L-citrulline supplementation prevents hyperoxia-induced lung injury and PH in newborn rats. L-citrulline may represent a novel therapeutic alternative to iNO for prevention of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"c4cdc109-c029-459f-a2fe-cbe83e7b0456","_showDetails":true},"694504dd-f3f6-47d7-aa0f-ba287e42656d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Serial changes of lung morphology and biochemical profiles in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia induced by intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide and postnatal hyperoxia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jpm.2010.091","authors":["Lee, Hyun Ju","Choi, Chang Won","Kim, Beyong Il","Kim, Ee-Kyung","Kim, Han-Suk","Choi, Jung-Hwan","Lee, Myong Jin","Yang, Eun Gyeong"],"date":"2010//","accessDate":"20100813//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Histocytochemistry","Humans","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Infant, Newborn","Interleukin-6/me [Metabolism]","Lipopolysaccharides/pd [Pharmacology]","Male","Pregnancy","Protein Carbonylation","*Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/ul [Ultrastructure]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Survival Analysis","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Journal of perinatal medicine","volume":"38","number":"6","isbn":"0300-5577","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=20707615"],"address":"Germany","abstract":"AIM: to investigate serial changes of lung morphology and biochemical profiles in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) induced by intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration and postnatal hyperoxia (85%)., METHODS: we evaluated histological changes of the lungs and compared the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and protein carbonyl in lung tissue on days 1, 7, and 14 after birth in a rat model of BPD., RESULTS: the inhibition of alveolarization was sustained in the LPS plus hyperoxia group from day 7 to 14, whereas alveolarization resumed in the hyperoxia group after oxygen exposure was withdrawn at day 7.

Oxidative stress (OS) is determinant for the onset of an unbalance between free radicals (FRs) production and antioxidant systems which plays a key role in pathogenesis of pathologies such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), grouped as 'free radical-related diseases' (FRD)., AIM: This study tests the hypothesis that OS markers levels in cord blood may predict the onset of FRD pathologies., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 168 preterm newborns of GA: 24-32weeks (28.09+/-1.99); and BW: 470-2480 gr (1358.11+/-454.09) were consecutively recruited. Markers of potential OS risk (non-protein bound iron, NPBI; basal superoxide anion, BSA; under stimulation superoxide anion, USSA) and markers of OS-related damage (total hydroperoxides, TH; advanced oxidation protein products, AOPP) were assessed in cord blood. Associations between FRD onset and OS markers were checked through inferential analysis (univariate logistic regression)., RESULTS: The development of FRD was significantly associated to high cord blood levels of TH, AOPP and NPBI (respectively p=0.000, OR=1.025, 95%CI=1.013-1.038; p=0.014, OR=1.092, 95%CI=1.018-1.172; p=0.007, OR=1.26995%CI=1.066-1.511)., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of TH, AOPP and, above all, NPBI, in cord blood are associated with increased risk for FRD. OS markers allow the early identification of infants at risk for FRD because of perinatal oxidant exposure. This can be useful in devising strategies to prevent or ameliorate perinatal outcome.

To investigate the relationship between pulmonary capillaries and alveolar formation, we partially embolized the pulmonary capillary bed., METHODS: Partial pulmonary embolization (PPE) was induced in chronically catheterized fetal sheep by injection of microspheres into the left pulmonary artery for 1 day (1d PPE; 115d gestational age; GA) or 5 days (5d PPE; 110-115d GA). Control fetuses received vehicle injections. Lung morphology, secondary septal crests, elastin, collagen, myofibroblast, PECAM1 and HIF1 alpha abundance and localization were determined histologically. VEGF-A, Flk-1, PDGF-A and PDGF-R alpha mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR., RESULTS: At 130d GA (term approximately 147d), in embolized regions of the lung the percentage of lung occupied by tissue was increased from 29 +/- 1% in controls to 35 +/- 1% in 1d PPE and 44 +/- 1% in 5d PPE fetuses (p < 0.001). Secondary septal crest density was reduced from 8 +/- 0% in controls to 5 +/- 0% in 1d PPE and 4 +/- 0% in 5d PPE fetuses (p < 0.05), indicating impaired alveolar formation. The deposition of differentiated myofibroblasts (23 +/- 1% vs 28 +/- 1%; p < 0.001) and elastin fibres (3 +/- 0% vs 4 +/- 0%; p < 0.05) were also impaired in embolized lung regions of PPE fetuses compared to controls. PPE did not alter the deposition of collagen or PECAM1. At 116d GA in 5d PPE fetuses, markers of hypoxia indicated that a small and transient hypoxic event had occurred (hypoxia in 6.7 +/- 1.4% of the tissue within embolized regions of 5d PPE fetuses at 116d compared to 0.8 +/- 0.2% of tissue in control regions). There was no change in the proportion of tissue labelled with HIF1 alpha. There was no change in mRNA levels of the angiogenic factors VEGF and Flk-1, although a small increase in PDGF-R alpha expression at 116d GA, from 1.00 +/- 0.12 in control fetuses to 1.61 +/- 0.18 in 5d PPE fetuses may account for impaired differentiation of alveolar myofibroblasts and alveolar development., CONCLUSIONS: PPE impairs alveolarization without adverse systemic effects and is a novel model for investigating the role of pulmonary capillaries and alveolar myofibroblasts in alveolar formation.","group":"g1","id":"fee7bc78-ab69-4688-98f9-9d4f549c7140","_showDetails":true},"7180f455-c0fd-4044-9413-95548c18ef52":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2022>","title":"Identification and immunological characterization of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related molecular subtypes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia based on machine learning.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.1084650","authors":["Tao, Ziyu","Mao, Yan","Hu, Yifang","Tang, Xinfang","Wang, Jimei","Zeng, Ni","Bao, Yunlei","Luo, Fei","Wu, Chuyan","Jiang, Feng"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20230109//","journal":"Frontiers in physiology","volume":"13","isbn":"1664-042X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm7&NEWS=N&AN=36699685"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a life-threatening lung illness that affects premature infants and has a high incidence and mortality. Using interpretable machine learning, we aimed to investigate the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes (ERSGs) in BPD patients. Methods: We evaluated the expression profiles of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes and immune features in bronchopulmonary dysplasia using the GSE32472 dataset. The endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene-based molecular clusters and associated immune cell infiltration were studied using 62 bronchopulmonary dysplasia samples. Cluster-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified utilizing the WGCNA technique. The optimum machine model was applied after comparing its performance with that of the generalized linear model, the extreme Gradient Boosting, the support vector machine (SVM) model, and the random forest model. Validation of the prediction efficiency was done by the use of a calibration curve, nomogram, decision curve analysis, and an external data set. Results: The bronchopulmonary dysplasia samples were compared to the control samples, and the dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes and activated immunological responses were analyzed. In bronchopulmonary dysplasia, two distinct molecular clusters associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress were identified. The analysis of immune cell infiltration indicated a considerable difference in levels of immunity between the various clusters. As measured by residual and root mean square error, as well as the area under the curve, the support vector machine machine model showed the greatest discriminative capacity. In the end, an support vector machine model integrating five genes was developed, and its performance was shown to be excellent on an external validation dataset. The effectiveness in predicting bronchopulmonary dysplasia subtypes was further established by decision curves, calibration curves, and nomogram analyses. Conclusion:  We developed a potential prediction model to assess the risk of endoplasmic reticulum stress subtypes and the clinical outcomes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients, and our work comprehensively revealed the complex association between endoplasmic reticulum stress and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

We report our first experience from such a selective early rescue use of surfactant in VLBW infants on HFOV., METHODS: After a deliberate ELR maneuver and \"optimal\" continuous distending pressure (CDP) finding during HFOV, used as primary ventilation mode for VLBW infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), surfactant was only given when an unsatisfactory oxygenation response to lung recruitment (as defined by CDP x FiO(2) > 5) was observed., RESULTS: Out of 144 VLBW infants on HFOV, 84 (58.3%) received surfactant and 60 (41.7%) did not.

However, the molecular and biochemical effects of iNO on developing human fetal lungs remain vastly unknown. By using a well-characterized model of human fetal alveolar type II cells, we assessed the effects of iNO and hyperoxia, independently and concurrently, on NO-cGMP signaling pathway and differentiation. Exposure to iNO increased cGMP levels by 40-fold after 3 d and by 8-fold after 5 d despite constant expression of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5). The levels of cGMP declined significantly on exposure to iNO and hyperoxia at 3 and 5 d, although expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) was sustained.

We now analyzed available multicenter data., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter study investigating genetic risk factors, clinical and outcome data and data of antenatal and postnatal treatment of infants with a birth weight below 1,500 g were prospectively recorded. The measures of infants treated with the new method of surfactant application were compared to those of infants who received standard care. The analysis was restricted to infants with a gestational age below 31 weeks (n=1,541)., RESULTS: 319 infants were treated with the new method and 1,222 with standard care. The need for mechanical ventilation during the first 72 h (29% vs. 53%, p<0.001), the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia defined as oxygen at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (10.9 % vs. 17.5%, p=0.004) and the rate of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the standard care group. Surfactant, theophyllin, caffeine and doxapram were significantly more often and analgetics, catecholamines and dexamethasone were significantly less frequently used in the treatment group., CONCLUSIONS: A new method of surfactant application was associated with a lower prevalence of mechanical ventilation and better pulmonary outcome. A prospective controlled trial is required to determine whether this approach is superior to standard care.

We show that GC (100 nM) stimulates (7- to 115-fold) and VitD (100 microM) suppresses (twofold) Lgl1 expression. RA (all-trans/9-cis, 10 microM) effects are biphasic.

Lgl1 promoter-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that these agents operated at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, the individual inhibitory effects of VitD and RA on GC induction of Lgl1 were abrogated when both agents were present, suggesting that steric hindrance may influence promoter accessibility. Analysis of the proximity (<50 base pairs) of binding sites for overlapping VitD and RA receptors to that of the GC receptor identified 81% of promoters in 66 genes (including Lgl1) important in human lung development compared with 48% in a random set of 1000 genes.

Clara cell secretory protein (CC10), a product of pulmonary Clara cells, has anti-inflammatory properties. Local down-regulation of CC10 has been associated with inflammatory lung disease. Increased serum levels of CC10 can indicate injury to alveolar-capillary integrity., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that extremely premature infants with a systemic fetal inflammatory response would have decreased concentrations of CC10 in tracheobronchial aspirates and that CC10 concentrations in umbilical cord serum of these infants would be increased, reflecting alveolar epithelial damage., METHODS: We measured CC10 concentrations in tracheobronchial aspirates of 42 ventilated extremely premature infants during their first week of life and in umbilical cord serum of 24 of them by ELISA. Standardized histological examination of the placenta, membranes and umbilical cord was used to identify infants with funisitis., RESULTS: Seventeen infants with funisitis had lower CC10 concentrations in tracheobronchial aspirates on days 1 (p < 0.01) and 3 (p < 0.05) than the remaining 25. Exogenous surfactant treatment was associated with higher CC10 concentrations on day 1 (p < 0.05). Initial leukocyte count correlated inversely with CC10 in tracheobronchial aspirates on days 1-5. Umbilical cord serum concentrations of CC10 did not differ between the infants with funisitis and the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Reduced anti-inflammatory CC10 concentrations in airways of extremely premature infants with a fetal inflammatory response might make their lungs susceptible for further postnatal injuries.

This case-control study sought to investigate the pathogenesis of BPD in preterm neonates by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)., Methods: First, RNA-seq samples were collected from 3 BPD and 3 healthy preterm neonates. Based on the sequencing data and microarray data sets, MERGE.57185.1, the key long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was identified from the differentially expressed lncRNAs and the key module by a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), a Venn diagram, and an expression analysis. Next, the differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that were strongly correlated to MERGE.57185.1 were identified in the protein-protein interaction networks and underwent a functional enrichment analysis and Spearman correlation analysis. Finally, the mRNA [i.e., eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A)] and miRNA (i.e., hsa-miR-6833-5p) with the strongest correlations to MERGE.57185.1 were identified as the downstream targets., Results: Among the 32 genes in the dark-red module and the 158 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 21 overlapping genes were identified. In the gene expression analysis, MERGE.57185.1 (an oncogene) was identified as the key lncRNA in BPD. The results of the multiple bioinformatics analysis showed that the mRNA and the miRNA with the strongest correlations to MERGE.57185.1 were hsa-miR-6833-5p (a suppressor gene) and EIF5A (an oncogene), respectively. Hsa-miR-6833-5p was lowly expressed in the BPD group, while EIF5A was highly expressed in the BPD group., Conclusions: This study identified 1 key upregulated lncRNA (i.e., MERGE.57185.1) in preterm neonatal BPD, and revealed the MERGE.57185.1/hsa-miR-6833-5p/EIF5A mechanism in preterm neonatal BPD from the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network.

BPD was associated with higher overall GM-CSF (beta (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.13;1.25); p < 0.05), lower overall latent TGF-beta1 (beta (95% CI) = -1.19 (-1.87, -0.39); p < 0.01) and total PL (beta (95% CI) = -0.64 (-1.23, -0.05); p < 0.05), and lower d 0 and 3 levels of VEGF (mean difference (95% CI) = -1.75 (-2.72, -0.77), p < 0.001; and -1.18 (-2.30, -0.06), p < 0.05, respectively) and TGF-alpha (mean difference (95% CI) = -0.73 (-1.42, -0.04), p < 0.05; and -1.01 (-1.64, -0.38), p < 0.01, respectively). Day 0 VEGF levels had the highest predictive value for BPD (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.87; p < 0.01). In conclusion, substantial alterations in BALF growth factor levels are present in infants developing BPD. An early imbalance in pulmonary growth factors may contribute to the developmental arrest of the lung seen in BPD., ABBREVIATIONS:","group":"g1","id":"b8281e57-549d-4ec5-a9c9-03a149e528fd","_showDetails":true},"f555d7ac-362d-4fe3-aa0d-ad7296b67687":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Conditional overexpression of connective tissue growth factor disrupts postnatal lung development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2009-0068OC","authors":["Wu, Shu","Platteau, Astrid","Chen, Shaoyi","McNamara, George","Whitsett, Jeffrey","Bancalari, Eduardo"],"date":"2010//","accessDate":"20090618//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis","Capillaries/gd [Growth & Development]","Cell Differentiation","Cell Proliferation","*Connective Tissue Growth Factor/me [Metabolism]","Elastic Tissue/me [Metabolism]","Elastic Tissue/pa [Pathology]","Epithelial Cells/en [Enzymology]","Epithelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","Fibroblasts/pa [Pathology]","Lung/en [Enzymology]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Fibrosis/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Fibrosis/pa [Pathology]","Signal Transduction"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"42","number":"5","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=19541844"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a member of an emerging family of immediate-early gene products that coordinates complex biological processes during development, differentiation, and tissue repair. Overexpression of CTGF is associated with mechanical ventilation with high tidal volume and oxygen exposure in newborn lungs. However, the role of CTGF in postnatal lung development and remodeling is not well understood. In the present study, a double-transgenic mouse model was generated with doxycycline-inducible overexpression of CTGF in respiratory epithelial cells. Overexpression of CTGF from Postnatal Days 1-14 resulted in thicker alveolar septa and decreased secondary septal formation. This is correlated with increased myofibroblast differentiation and disorganized elastic fiber deposition in alveolar septa. Overexpression of CTGF also decreased alveolar capillary network formation. There were increased alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and collagen deposition, and dramatic thickening in the peribronchial/peribronchiolar and perivascular regions in the double-transgenic lungs. Furthermore, overexpression of CTGF increased integrin-linked kinase expression, activated its downstream signaling target, Akt, as well as increased mRNA expression of fibronectin. These data demonstrate that overexpression of CTGF disrupts alveologenesis and capillary formation, and induces fibrosis during the critical period of alveolar development. These histologic changes are similar to those observed in lungs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"f555d7ac-362d-4fe3-aa0d-ad7296b67687","_showDetails":true},"ea3e6911-560b-4056-b444-b8cc741dcfa3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Maternal IL-1beta production prevents lung injury in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2008-0287OC","authors":["Backstrom, Erica","Lappalainen, Urpo","Bry, Kristina"],"date":"2010//","accessDate":"20090501//","keywords":["Acute Lung Injury/ge [Genetics]","Acute Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Acute Lung Injury/pp [Physiopathology]","Acute Lung Injury/pc [Prevention & Control]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Base Sequence","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","DNA Primers/ge [Genetics]","Disease Models, Animal","Doxycycline/pd [Pharmacology]","Female","Gene Expression/de [Drug Effects]","Gene Silencing","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Inflammation/co [Complications]","Inflammation/ge [Genetics]","Inflammation/pa [Pathology]","Inflammation/pp [Physiopathology]","*Interleukin-1beta/bi [Biosynthesis]","Interleukin-1beta/ge [Genetics]","Male","Maternal-Fetal Exchange","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Pregnancy","Pregnancy Complications/ge [Genetics]","Pregnancy Complications/pa [Pathology]","Pregnancy Complications/pp [Physiopathology]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Recombinant Proteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Recombinant Proteins/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"42","number":"2","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=19411613"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Little is known about the influence of maternal inflammation on neonatal outcome. Production of IL-1beta in the lungs of newborn infants is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Using bitransgenic (bi-TG) mice in which human (h) IL-1beta is expressed with a doxycycline-inducible system controlled by the Clara cell secretory protein promoter, we have shown that hIL-1beta expression causes a bronchopulmonary dysplasia-like illness in infant mice. To study the hypothesis that maternal hIL-1beta production modifies the response of the newborn to hIL-1beta, doxycycline was administered to bi-TG and control dams from Embryonic Day 0, inducing production of hIL-1beta by the bi-TG dams before hIL-1beta production started in their bi-TG fetuses, or from Embryonic Day 15, inducing simultaneous production of hIL-1beta by both the bi-TG dams and their bi-TG fetuses. In addition to the lungs, hIL-1beta was expressed at low levels in the uteri of bi-TG dams. Maternal inflammation preceding fetal inflammation increased the survival and growth of hIL-1beta-expressing pups, enhanced alveolarization, and protected the airways against remodeling and goblet cell hyperplasia. Maternal hIL-1beta production preceding fetal hIL-1beta production caused silencing of several inflammatory genes, including CXC and CC chemokines, murine IL-1beta, serum amyloid A3, and Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and suppressed the expression of chitinase-like lectins Ym1 and Ym2 in the lungs of infant mice. Maternal inflammation protects the newborn against subsequent hIL-1beta-induced lung inflammation and injury. In contrast, induction of hIL-1beta production simultaneously in bi-TG dams and their fetuses offered no protection against inflammatory lung disease in the neonate.","group":"g1","id":"ea3e6911-560b-4056-b444-b8cc741dcfa3","_showDetails":true},"7f11822e-6ab0-4275-80c9-8242771b5d38":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Antenatal and postnatal corticosteroid and resuscitation induced lung injury in preterm sheep.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-124","authors":["Hillman, Noah H","Pillow, J Jane","Ball, Molly K","Polglase, Graeme R","Kallapur, Suhas G","Jobe, Alan H"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20091215//","keywords":["*Adrenal Cortex Hormones/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Animals","Anti-Inflammatory Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*High-Frequency Ventilation/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","*Lung Injury/pc [Prevention & Control]","Lung Injury/ve [Veterinary]","Prenatal Care/mt [Methods]","Sheep","Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"Respiratory research","volume":"10","isbn":"1465-9921","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=20003512"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Initiation of ventilation using high tidal volumes in preterm lambs causes lung injury and inflammation.

We studied a cohort of infants <32 weeks gestational age (GA) and <1500 g, admitted to 12 hospitals in Northern Italy in 1999-2002. The association between BPD and WMD was estimated by generalised estimating equations and conditional logistic models, adjusting for centre, GA, propensity score for prolonged ventilation and other potential confounders. Directed acyclic graphs (DAG) were used to depict the underlying causal structure and guide analysis. Of the 1209 infants reaching 36 weeks, 192 (15.8%) developed BPD (supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks) and 88 (7.3%) ultrasound-defined WMD (cystic periventricular leukomalacia). In crude analysis, BPD was a strong risk factor for WMD [odds ratio (OR) = 5.9]. With successive adjustments, the OR progressively decreased to 3.88 when adjusting for GA, to 2.72 adding perinatal risk factors, and further down to 2.16 [95% confidence interval 1.1, 3.9] when ventilation was also adjusted for. Postnatal factors did not change the OR. Significant risk factors for WMD, in addition to BPD, were a low GA, a lower Apgar score, a higher illness severity score, ventilation and early-onset sepsis, while antenatal steroids, being small for GA, and surfactant were associated with a reduced risk. In conclusion, our data suggest that BPD is associated with an increased risk of WMD; most of the effect is due to shared risk factors and causal pathways. DAGs helped clarify the complex confounding of this scenario.","group":"g1","id":"7ef57165-6d55-400a-b88b-35c9123a5b08","_showDetails":true},"a62f3c35-f4e3-4400-badb-36971a30e52d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid peptidomics suggests a possible matrix metalloproteinase-3 role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00134-009-1646-6","authors":["Vento, Giovanni","Tirone, Chiara","Lulli, Paola","Capoluongo, Ettore","Ameglio, Franco","Lozzi, Simona","Cota, Francesco","Mosca, Fabio","Romagnoli, Costantino","Messana, Irene","Castagnola, Massimo","Inzitari, Rosanna"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20090925//","keywords":["*Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","*Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/an [Analysis]","*Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Intensive care medicine","volume":"35","number":"12","isbn":"0342-4642","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19779697"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is an important diagnostic source to investigate molecular changes occurring in lung disorders.

Two pools of samples from patients with and without BPD were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Several differentially expressed peptides were collected and sequenced. Moreover, samples from single donors were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to define the molecular mass values of various peptides and to quantify their expression. Levels of some matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors were also determined in single samples., RESULTS: Neonates of the BPD group (N = 16) showed significantly lower mean gestational age and birth weight with respect to the no-BPD group (N = 18; P < 0.0001).

Survivors face the challenges of short- and long-term complications. Among all complications, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the first important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Current treatment does not address this main preterm complication. Cord blood is regarded as a convenient source of stem cells. The paracrine bioactive factors of stem cells contribute to tissue repair and immune modulation. Our clinical studies and those of others have shown that cord blood cell infusion is both safe and possibly effective in the prevention and treatment of BPD. The therapeutic use of cord blood has emerged as a promising therapy. However, the genetic heterogeneity between control and intervention groups may reduce the comparability especially among small sample trials. The purpose of this study protocol is to investigate the effects of autologous cord blood mononuclear cell (ACBMNC) infusion on the prevention of BPD in very preterm monozygotic twins of less than 32 gestation weeks., Methods: In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multicenter clinical trial, 60 pairs of monozygotic twin preterm neonates of less than 32 weeks admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit are randomly assigned to receive intravenous ACBMNC infusion (targeted at 5 x 107 cells/kg) or placebo (normal saline) within 24 h after birth in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome will be survival without BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. The secondary outcomes will include the mortality rate, BPD severity, other common preterm complication rates, respiratory support duration, length and cost of hospitalization, and long-term respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes during a 2-year follow-up. Furthermore, we will perform single-cell RNA sequencing for cord blood cells and blood cells 3-10 days after intervention and detect whether reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines are present., Conclusion: This will be the first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to evaluate the efficacy of ACBMNC infusion to prevent BPD in monozygotic twin premature infants and investigate the underlying protective mechanisms.

Photograph protection of total parenteral nutrition reduces the peroxide load and has been shown to be associated with nutritional and biochemical benefits in animals and humans. It is unclear whether this reduction in peroxides from total parenteral nutrition leads to a reduction in the complications of prematurity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Our hypothesis was that shielding total parenteral nutrition from ambient light is linked to clinical benefits., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to determine whether photograph protection of total parenteral nutrition (light protected), as compared with no photoprotection (light exposed), reduces the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death in preterm infants., METHODS: The Canadian Neonatal Network provided data for infants born in 2006 at <28 weeks' gestation admitted to level 3 NICUs in Canada. A retrospective analysis was performed comparing bronchopulmonary dysplasia and death in infants who received light-exposed or light-protected parenteral nutrition. Data were analyzed by using logistic regression models. RESULTS . Thirteen NICUs offered partial light-protected (total parenteral nutrition bag only, intravenous tubing exposed) and 13 offered light-exposed parenteral nutrition; not a single NICU offered complete light-protected parenteral nutrition (total parenteral nutrition bag plus intravenous tubing). The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death was 66% with light-protected (n = 428) vs 59% with light-exposed (n = 438) parenteral nutrition., CONCLUSIONS: Partial photograph protection of total parenteral nutrition was not associated with a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death as compared with no photograph protection; this relationship is confounded by covariates with strong associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Partial photograph protection of total parenteral nutrition solutions confers no clinical benefit, while consuming valuable resources. A randomized, controlled trial is justified to determine whether there is a true \"cause-and-effect\" relationship between complete photoprotection of total parenteral nutrition and bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death.","group":"g1","id":"5e5df932-31b1-4228-b17e-4831bd85c27c","_showDetails":true},"fccf4d9e-5d29-4fdf-9881-a16371befd78":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Surfactant protein-A limits Ureaplasma-mediated lung inflammation in a murine pneumonia model.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181aabd66","authors":["Famuyide, Mobolaji E","Hasday, Jeffrey D","Carter, Heather C","Chesko, Kirsty L","He, Ju-Ren","Viscardi, Rose M"],"date":"2009//","keywords":["Animals","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/mi [Microbiology]","Cytokines/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Inflammation/mi [Microbiology]","Inflammation/pa [Pathology]","*Inflammation","Lung/cy [Cytology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/mi [Microbiology]","*Lung","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Nitric Oxide/me [Metabolism]","*Pneumonia/mi [Microbiology]","Pneumonia/pa [Pathology]","*Pneumonia/pp [Physiopathology]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A/ge [Genetics]","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A/me [Metabolism]","*Ureaplasma/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"66","number":"2","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19390477"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization stimulates prolonged, dysregulated inflammation in the lungs of preterm infants, contributing to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis.

To analyze the role of SP-A in modulating Ureaplasma-mediated lung inflammation, SP-A deficient (SP-A-/-) and WT mice were inoculated intratracheally with a mouse-adapted U. parvum isolate and indices of inflammation were sequentially assessed up to 28 d postinoculation. Compared with infected WT and noninfected controls, Ureaplasma-infected SP-A-/- mice exhibited an exaggerated inflammatory response evidenced by rapid influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung, and higher bronchoalveolar lavage TNF-alpha, mouse analogue of human growth-related protein alpha (KC), and monocyte chemotactic factor (MCP-1) concentrations. However, nitrite generation in response to Ureaplasma infection was blunted at 24 h and Ureaplasma clearance was delayed in SP-A-/- mice compared with WT mice. Coadministration of human SP-A with the Ureaplasma inoculum to SP-A-/- mice reduced the inflammatory response, but did not improve the bacterial clearance rate. SP-A deficiency may contribute to the prolonged inflammatory response in the Ureaplasma-infected preterm lung, but other factors may contribute to the impaired Ureaplasma clearance.","group":"g1","id":"fccf4d9e-5d29-4fdf-9881-a16371befd78","_showDetails":true},"d0a1d687-c8d0-4dc0-9733-a401fc094421":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Early biomarkers and potential mediators of ventilation-induced lung injury in very preterm lambs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-19","authors":["Wallace, Megan J","Probyn, Megan E","Zahra, Valerie A","Crossley, Kelly","Cole, Timothy J","Davis, Peter G","Morley, Colin J","Hooper, Stuart B"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20090310//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Connective Tissue Growth Factor/ge [Genetics]","Cysteine-Rich Protein 61/ge [Genetics]","Disease Models, Animal","Early Growth Response Protein 1/ge [Genetics]","Genetic Markers","Gestational Age","Interleukins/ge [Genetics]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","*Premature Birth","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","*Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","Respiration, Artificial/mt [Methods]","Sheep","Tidal Volume","Time Factors","Up-Regulation","Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","*Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury/ge [Genetics]","Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury/pc [Prevention & Control]"],"journal":"Respiratory research","volume":"10","isbn":"1465-9921","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19284536"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is closely associated with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in very preterm infants. The greatest risk of VILI may be in the immediate period after birth, when the lungs are surfactant deficient, still partially filled with liquid and not uniformly aerated. However, there have been very few studies that have examined this immediate post-birth period and identified the initial injury-related pathways that are activated. We aimed to determine if the early response genes; connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cysteine rich-61 (CYR61) and early growth response 1 (EGR1), were rapidly induced by VILI in preterm lambs and whether ventilation with different tidal volumes caused different inflammatory cytokine and early response gene expression., METHODS: To identify early markers of VILI, preterm lambs (132 d gestational age; GA, term approximately 147 d) were resuscitated with an injurious ventilation strategy (V(T) 20 mL/kg for 15 min) then gently ventilated (5 mL/kg) for 15, 30, 60 or 120 min (n = 4 in each). To determine if early response genes and inflammatory cytokines were differentially regulated by different ventilation strategies, separate groups of preterm lambs (125 d GA; n = 5 in each) were ventilated from birth with a V(T) of 5 (VG5) or 10 mL/kg (VG10) for 135 minutes. Lung gene expression levels were compared to levels prior to ventilation in age-matched control fetuses., RESULTS: CTGF, CYR61 and EGR1 lung mRNA levels were increased approximately 25, 50 and 120-fold respectively (p < 0.05), within 30 minutes of injurious ventilation. VG5 and VG10 caused significant increases in CTGF, CYR61, EGR1, IL1- , IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels compared to control levels. CTGF, CYR61, IL-6 and IL-8 expression levels were higher in VG10 than VG5 lambs; although only the IL-6 and CYR61 mRNA levels reached significance., CONCLUSION: CTGF, CYR61 and EGR1 may be novel early markers of lung injury and mechanical ventilation from birth using relatively low tidal volumes may be less injurious than using higher tidal volumes.","group":"g1","id":"d0a1d687-c8d0-4dc0-9733-a401fc094421","_showDetails":false},"01ed77bd-95cf-4f60-9a5c-78e9985dd797":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Alterations of the thioredoxin system by hyperoxia: implications for alveolar development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2008-0224OC","authors":["Tipple, Trent E","Welty, Stephen E","Nelin, Leif D","Hansen, Jason M","Rogers, Lynette K"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20090224//","keywords":["Age Factors","Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Carrier Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Humans","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Infant, Newborn","Mice","Mice, Inbred C3H","Oxidation-Reduction","Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","*Thioredoxin Reductase 1/me [Metabolism]","*Thioredoxins/me [Metabolism]","*Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"41","number":"5","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19244202"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Alterations in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contribute to alveolar simplification seen in animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and VEGF expression is redox regulated by thioredoxin (Trx)-1 in other diseases. The present studies tested the hypothesis that exposure to 85% O2 negatively impacts the Trx1 system and VEGF expression in the lungs of newborn mice. There was no effect of fraction of inspired oxygen on lung Trx1 or Trx reductase-1 protein levels; however, lung Trx1 protein was predominantly oxidized in the lungs of newborn mice exposed to 85% O2 by 24 hours of exposure. In room air (RA), lung Trx interacting protein (Txnip) levels decreased developmentally through Day 7 (1.0 +/- 0.06 [Day 1] vs. 0.49 +/- 0.10 [Day 3] vs. 0.29 +/- 0.03 [Day 7]; P < 0.01), whereas VEGF expression increased (1.25 +/- 0.16 [Day 1] vs. 4.35 +/- 1.51 [Day 3] vs. 13.23 +/- 0.37 [Day 7]; P < 0.01). Newborn mice exposed to 85% O2 had no developmental decrease in Txnip protein levels and a delayed increase in VEGF protein levels. Lung Txnip and VEGF protein levels were different than in corresponding RA controls at Day 3, before the detection of lung morphologic abnormalities in our model. Txnip and VEGF protein levels were inversely correlated in both the RA and hyperoxia-exposed groups (n = 18; R = -0.66; P = 0.003). In conclusion, oxidation of Trx1 and sustained Txnip expression in the lungs of newborn mice exposed to 85% oxygen is likely to severely attenuate normal Trx1 function. The inverse correlation of Txnip with VEGF expression suggests that decreased Trx1 function contributes to the observed lung developmental abnormalities.","group":"g1","id":"01ed77bd-95cf-4f60-9a5c-78e9985dd797","_showDetails":true},"ce030531-5d7e-46f0-bc9c-a8121dcb2da1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Patent ductus arteriosus therapy: impact on neonatal and 18-month outcome.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-2781","authors":["Madan, Juliette C","Kendrick, Douglas","Hagadorn, James I","Frantz, Ivan D 3rd","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network"],"date":"2009//","keywords":["*Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/th [Therapy]","Female","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Male","Multivariate Analysis","Prospective Studies","Time Factors","Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"123","number":"2","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19171637"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate therapy for patent ductus arteriosus as a risk factor for death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or necrotizing enterocolitis in extremely low birth weight infants., METHODS: We studied infants in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network Generic Data Base born between 2000 and 2004 at 23 to 28 weeks' gestation and at <1000-g birth weight with patent ductus arteriosus.

Patients who received supportive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus did not differ from subjects treated with indomethacin only for any of the outcomes of interest.

However, it is unknown whether chronic hypercapnia increases alveolar formation, nor if it has detrimental effects in other developing organs such as the brain., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether chronic hypercapnia accelerates early alveolar formation and increases neuronal cell injury in the developing mouse lung and brain, respectively., DESIGN: Mouse pups were exposed to 8% CO(2) + 21% O(2) starting at postnatal day (P) 2 until P7. Control animals were maintained in room air. Animals were sacrificed at P4 or P7, and lungs and brains were excised and analyzed., RESULTS: Exposure to 8% CO(2) resulted in an increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) which localized to the tips of developing alveolar buds, and also an increased number of alveolar buds at P7. Importantly, hypercapnic animals also demonstrated evidence of increased TUNEL-positive cells in the brain., CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to chronic hypercapnia may lead to early initiation of alveolar budding in the neonatal mouse, but may also lead to increased TUNEL-positive cells in the developing brain.

A standardized histologic examination was used to distinguish three groups: chorioamnionitis, funisitis, and controls without inflammation. Concentrations of the mediators steadily decreased. Funisitis was associated with lower concentrations of both proteins, which might impair their physiologic activities in pulmonary angiogenesis. An increase of the ratio angiopoietin-1/endostatin until day 7 of life indicated a shift of the mediators potentially favoring angiogenesis.

Inclusion criteria included a birth weight of 8 mg/dL) were determined. Infants with language delay and who were receiving speech therapy by 3 years were identified through developmental clinic charts and a tracking program and compared with infants who had normal language development., RESULTS: A total of 125 infants with birth weight of < or =1500 g were admitted to the NICU between January and October 2003. Fifteen infants died, and 110 were discharged from the hospital. A total of 102 (93%) of 110 infants had follow-up to the age of 3 years. Four infants were excluded (1 genetic disorder, 3 delayed hearing loss or recurrent ear infections). Twenty-four infants had a language delay and received speech therapy, whereas 74 infants had normal language development. There was no significant difference in peak total serum bilirubin level and duration of hyperbilirubinemia between the 2 groups. On logistic regression, only bronchopulmonary dysplasia was associated with language delay., CONCLUSIONS: Hyperbilirubinemia, defined as peak total serum bilirubin level or duration of elevated bilirubin in days, is not associated with language delay in premature infants. However, this issue deserves investigation, because other measures of bilirubin, such as unbound bilirubin, may be associated with language delay.","group":"g1","id":"c1f83205-6207-499d-87f4-c4ec816bd1b9","_showDetails":true},"2aad7625-dae3-49c5-b6a0-627e09024dbb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Hypoxic stress exacerbates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a neonatal mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000178798","authors":["Ratner, Veniamin","Slinko, Siarhei","Utkina-Sosunova, Irina","Starkov, Anatoly","Polin, Richard A","Ten, Vadim S"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20081204//","keywords":["Animals","*Animals, Newborn/ph [Physiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Glutathione/me [Metabolism]","Humans","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Hypoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Infant, Newborn","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Oxidative Stress/ph [Physiology]","Oxygen/me [Metabolism]","Protein Carbonylation/ph [Physiology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"Neonatology","volume":"95","number":"4","isbn":"1661-7800","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19052476"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Premature infants with lung injury often experience intermittent episodes of hypoxemia., OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether intermittent hypoxemia exacerbates oxidative stress and lung injury in neonatal mice in a hyperoxia-induced model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: For the BPD model, 3-day-old C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (65% O(2)) for 4 weeks (O(2) group) or to hyperoxia and intermittent (10 min daily) hypoxia (O(2) + H group). Upon completion of O(2) or O(2) + H exposure, the degree of pulmonary alveolarization and granulocytic infiltration were examined. The severity of oxidative injury in lungs was defined by tissue glutathione and protein carbonyl content. Data were compared to those in naive mice and mice subjected only to intermittent hypoxia., RESULTS: Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited a dramatic (p < 0.0001) decrease of alveolarization, significantly increased granulocytic infiltration (p < 0.0001) and increased protein carbonyl content (p = 0.04) compared to naive mice. However, O(2) + H mice demonstrated significantly (p = 0.03) fewer alveoli compared to their O(2) counterparts. This was associated with a significantly (p = 0.02) decreased pulmonary total/oxidized glutathione ratio and a significant (p = 0.03) elevation of protein carbonyl content., CONCLUSIONS: Thus, intermittent hypoxic stress during hyperoxic induction of BPD in mice potentiates oxidative stress in lung tissue and exacerbates alveolar developmental arrest.

This study aimed to explore the biological basis of PBS syndrome in CHD. Methods: Using a strategy that integrated RNA-seq, DIA-based proteomics, and untargeted metabolomics on 90 clinic samples, we constructed a \"gene-protein-metabolite\" network for CHD-PBS syndrome. We expanded the sample size and validated the differential genes and metabolites in the network through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Our findings revealed that the \"gene-protein-metabolite\" network of CHD-PBS syndrome included 33 mRNAs, four proteins, and 25 metabolites. JNK1, FOS, CCL2, CXCL8, PTGS2, and CSF1 were all poorly expressed in the PBS group during the sequencing stage, whereas arachidonic acid (AA) was highly expressed. During the validation stage, JNK1, AP-1, CCL2, and CXCL8 were poorly expressed, whereas PTGS2, CSF1, and AA were highly expressed. The area under the receiver operating curve was as follows: CSF1 [0.9635, 95%CI (0.9295, 0.9976)] >JNK1 [0.9361, 95% CI (0.8749, 0.9972)] >CXCL8 [0.8953, 95% CI (0.8222, 0.9684)] > CCL2 [0.8458, 95% CI (0.7676, 0.9241)] >AP-1 [0.7884, 95%CI (0.6869, 0.8899)]. The logistic regression model composed of CSF1 and JNK1 showed the greatest diagnostic value and significance for PBS syndrome. Conclusion:  PBS syndrome is characterized by low levels of FOS, AP-1, CCL2, CXCL8, and JNK1 and elevated levels of PTGS2 and CSF1, implying that the AA metabolism is abnormal and that the JNK/AP-1 pathway is inhibited. PBS syndromes, as a subtype of CHD, may have unique molecular changes. Background. Globally, coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death, and this would likely continue until 2030 (Mirzaei et al., 2009, 95, 740-746). According to the disease course, CHD can be classified as chronic stable CHD (or chronic coronary syndrome) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (Katus et al., 2017; Knuuti, 2019). Although stable CHD is not as lethal as ACS, it has a varied incidence range and patients with CHD have prolonged angina. Some symptoms of stable angina are alleviated with pharmacological therapy, but it cannot eliminate recurrent angina (Rousan et al., 2017). The clinical outcomes were not significantly improved in patients who underwent revascularization compared with those who received optimal pharmacological therapy (Shaw et al., 2008; Antman and Braunwald, 2020). A bottleneck appears to exist in CHD treatment, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can act as a favorable complement. Because of its individualized treatment approach, TCM is widely practiced in eastern civilizations (Teng et al., 2016). TCM has become a principal complement in western countries (Wieland et al., 2013). Like \"disease\" is used in western medicine, \"syndrome\" is used in TCM to comprehend anomalous human conditions on the basis of patients' symptoms, tongue, and pulse (Li et al., 2012). On the basis of disease-syndrome diagnose, a TCM doctor can subclassify CHD patients into various categories, such as phlegm and blood stasis (PBS) syndrome, cold congealing and Qi stagnation syndrome, and Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome. PBS syndrome has recently emerged as a hot research topic in the TCM field. Objective diagnosis, expert consultations, and efficacy evaluation scales have been developed for PBS syndrome (Ren et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2022). The concept of \"omics\" originates from the genome. It refers to the vocabulary generated by biological molecules at different levels to describe high-sequence molecular biological data resources (Dai and Shen, 2022). RNA, protein, and metabolites decipher the essence of complex etiologies, and the integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are becoming a promising research mode (Pan et al., 2022). Multi-omics studies have revealed the biological characteristics of APOE transgenic mice, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and plant tolerant to heavy metals (Singh et al., 2016; Lal et al., 2018; Mohler et al., 2020). Over the past few years, many academic achievements related to CHD-PBS syndrome have been accrued in the single-omic area. For example, Zhou identified the differential metabolites between PBS syndrome and Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome by using the urine samples of 1072 volunteers. Some of the specific metabolites of PBS syndrome are pyroglutamic acid, glutaric acid, glucose, mannitol, and xanthine (Zhou et al., 2019). Li's metabolomic study suggested that valine, leucine, isoleucine, and glycerol phospholipid metabolism could represent PBS syndrome (Zheng et al., 2022). Although some progress has been made in the understanding of PBS syndrome in CHD through the studies conducted, some issues still exist, such as a single-omics level, a lack of in-depth research, an inability to verify each other's research results, and a lack of validation of research conclusions. Overall, a systematic description of the biological foundation of PBS syndrome is lacking. Thus, the present study utilizes system biology methodologies and constructs a multi-omics network by integrating differential genes, proteins, and metabolites to systematically and comprehensively reveal the biological basis of CHD-PBS syndrome. The current study explored 1) the characteristics of the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome for CHD-PBS syndrome; 2) the \"gene-protein-metabolite\" network based on differential genes (DGs), differential proteins (DPs), and differential metabolites (DMs); 3) the key biological process and metabolic pathway most related to PBS syndrome; and 4) quantitative results and the diagnostic potential of biomarkers for PSB syndrome. Materials and methods. Multi-omics sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and clinical validation research strategy. We collected the blood samples from healthy subjects as well as CHD patients with PBS and non-phlegm and blood stasis (NPBS) syndrome to compare the differences between them by subjecting the samples to the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolomics analyses. Bioinformatics analysis identified differential molecules as well as related biological processes and pathways. Next, the \"gene-protein-metabolite\" network was constructed using the MetaboAnalyst database, String database, and Cytoscape software. We selected molecules with strong centrality and biological association as potential PBS syndrome biomarkers and recruited more volunteers for further validation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the ROC curve was utilized to assess the level and diagnostic efficacy of various molecules (Figure 1).

Our studies by cDNA array and immunohistochemistry revealed that hyperoxia decreased Hsp27 expression in newborn rat lungs. Western blot showed that hyperoxic treatment significantly decreased Hsp27 protein expression in cultured human lung epithelial cells (A549).

Previous studies have demonstrated that Dex usually down-regulates VEGF. In the present study we investigated the effect of Dex on brain growth and VEGF in the neonatal rat brain. The pups in each litter were divided into the vehicle (n=84) or Dex-treated (n=98) groups. Rat pups in the Dex group received one of three different regimens of i.p.

The total VEGF protein and mRNA expression of the three main VEGF splice variants (VEGF(120), VEGF(164), and VEGF(188)) were measured in the rat pup brain using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Treatment with Dex significantly decreased the gain of body and brain weight. The tapering and repeated doses of Dex significantly increased caspase-3 activity, VEGF protein and the expression of mRNA of VEGF(164) and VEGF(188) splice variants but the single dose did not.

Similarly, there was a significant rhCC10 dose and protein-dependent increase in surfactant protein (SP-B > SP-C > SP-A) and dose- and isoform-dependent increase in VEGF (VEGF189 > VEGF165 > VEGF121).

Cytochrome P4501A enzymes are induced by hyperoxia in animal models, but their role in human systems is unknown. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms of induction of CYP1A1 by hyperoxia in human lung cell lines. Three human lung cell lines were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 0-72 h, and CYP1A1 activities, apoprotein contents, and mRNA levels were determined. Hyperoxia significantly induced CYP1A1 activity and protein contents (2-4 fold), and mRNA levels (30-40 fold) over control in each cell line. Transfection of a CYP1A1 promoter/luciferase reporter construct, followed by hyperoxia (4-72 h), showed marked (2-6 fold) induction of luciferase expression. EMSA and siRNA experiments strongly suggest that the Ah receptor (AHR) is involved in the hyperoxic induction of CYP1A1. MTT reduction assays showed attenuation of cell injury with the CYP1A1 inducer beta-naphthoflavone (BNF). Our results strongly suggest that hyperoxia transcriptionally activates CYP1A1 expression in human lung cell lines by AHR-dependent mechanisms, and that CYP1A1 induction is associated with decreased toxicity. This novel finding of induction of CYP1A1 in the absence of exogenous AHR ligands could lead to novel interventions in the treatment of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"51bb1c17-99ea-4747-8e92-98ad410a8224","_showDetails":true},"b6aec875-1962-4771-958a-3b8fa6bba688":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Heritability of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, defined according to the consensus statement of the national institutes of health.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-2313","authors":["Lavoie, Pascal M","Pham, Chandra","Jang, Kerry L"],"date":"2008//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["British Columbia/ep [Epidemiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Consensus Development Conferences, NIH as Topic","*Diseases in Twins","Female","Follow-Up Studies","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ge [Genetics]","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Prevalence","Prospective Studies","Risk Factors","United States"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"122","number":"3","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18762515"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the magnitude of genetic effects on susceptibility and risk factors for bronchopulmonary dysplasia by using the clinically validated National Institutes of Health consensus definition as a demonstrated proxy for long-term respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely low birth weight infants., METHODS: We analyzed clinical data from twin pairs born at </=30 completed weeks of gestation in British Columbia, Canada, between 1993 and 2006. Differences in correlations between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs and model-fitting approaches were used to quantify the relative contributions of genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental effects., RESULTS: Among 318 twins of known zygosity, monozygotic twin pair similarities were greater than those observed for dizygotic pairs, which suggests significant heritability for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Placental growth factor concentrations in tracheal aspirate fluid were measured in 70 samples from 20 preterm infants during the first postnatal week., RESULTS: In immunohistochemical analyses, placental growth factor staining was seen in bronchial epithelium and macrophages in all groups. Distal airway epithelium positivity was observed mostly in fetuses and in preterm infants who died soon after birth. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 staining was seen in vascular endothelium in all groups and also in lymphatic endothelium in fetuses. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 staining in arterial endothelium was associated with higher and staining in venous endothelium with lower gestational age. In capillaries, less vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 staining was seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The mean placental growth factor protein concentration in tracheal aspirate fluid during the first postnatal week was 0.64 +/- 0.42 pg/mL per IgA-secretory component unit. Concentrations during the first postnatal week were stable. Lower placental growth factor concentrations correlated with chorioamnionitis and lactosyl ceramide positivity., CONCLUSIONS: The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 staining pattern seems to reflect ongoing differentiation and activity of different endothelia. Lower vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression in capillary endothelium in bronchopulmonary dysplasia might be a reflection of the dysregulation of vascular development that is characteristic of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"d2b1892d-4542-4aba-9163-1456e8b9a162","_showDetails":true},"0e4a6138-5b2d-469c-94dc-fc929c42d92c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Haplotypes of tumor necrosis factor gene and tracheal aspirate fluid levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e31817758f4","authors":["Kazzi, S Nadya J","Tromp, Gerard","Quasney, Michael W","Buhimschi, Irina A"],"date":"2008//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Chorioamnionitis/ep [Epidemiology]","Chorioamnionitis/ge [Genetics]","Chorioamnionitis/me [Metabolism]","Female","Gene Frequency","Genotype","*Haplotypes/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/me [Metabolism]","Male","Pregnancy","Risk Factors","Suction","*Trachea/me [Metabolism]","*Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/ge [Genetics]","*Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"64","number":"2","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18645461"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Individual variability in the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been attributed to genetic factors.

Recent studies in brain tissue samples have shown that nonphysiologic oxygen levels play a key role in induction of apoptosis in the developing brain. Estrogen is a well-established agent in neuroprotection and, therefore, is thought to be neuroprotective even in the premature brain. Astrocytes appear to have a critical role in protection and survival of neurons in the brain. As one of the glial cell types, they have a great potential for possible involvement in the mediation of estrogen neuroprotective effects. The aim of our study was to analyze whether astrocytes in cell cultures are damaged by hyperoxia and whether 17beta-estradiol (E2) can protect them against apoptosis. Additionally, we investigated the mechanism of the protection by E2, hypothesizing that it is mediated through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Cells underwent eightfold more apoptosis when cultivated in hyperoxia compared with normoxia. Addition of E2 reduced apoptosis in hyperoxia by more than 50%. Levels of ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were increased after hyperoxia compared with normoxia. Preincubation with E2 prior to exposure to hyperoxia resulted in decreased levels of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2. Hyperoxia induces apoptosis in C8-D1A cells, and E2 seems to be a protecting factor for astrocytes in hyperoxia. This effect is not mediated through up-regulation of pERK1/2.","group":"g1","id":"8c7ac9bf-d5d6-41ad-98cf-8929866f012c","_showDetails":true},"f080f1e8-37b9-4af6-bcdf-0608d48c0fd7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Genetic risk factors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e318184edeb","authors":["Kwinta, Przemko","Bik-Multanowski, Miroslaw","Mitkowska, Zofia","Tomasik, Tomasz","Legutko, Magdalena","Pietrzyk, Jacek Jozef"],"date":"2008//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Female","Gene Frequency","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Genotype","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/ge [Genetics]","Male","Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/ge [Genetics]","*Polymorphism, Genetic","Risk Factors","Sequence Analysis, DNA","Transforming Growth Factor beta1/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"64","number":"6","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18614962"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The aim of the study was to assess the association between bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and polymorphisms of genes coding for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF-[beta]1), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).

Infants born before 32 weeks of gestation are at a greater risk of developing BPD due to the need for respiratory support with higher oxygen requirement. Pulmonary vascular remodelling in early BPD can impose an additional burden on the right ventricle (RV) and RV dysfunction. This protocol outlines the study design and aims to formulate a prediction model to identify early BPD through the data generated from echo scans analysis., METHODS: The mixed-methods observational cohort feasibility study, which comprises three work-packages (WPs), will be conducted at the regional neonatal unit, University Hospital Plymouth, Plymouth, UK. WP-I will recruit 40 preterm infants; each participant will have two heart scans performed in the first ten days after birth (DABs). WP-II will collect the documentation of the participating preterm infants' parents in the study neonatal unit diaries in the first 10 DABs. WP-III will involve semi-structured interviews of 10-15 parents of participating preterm infants and 10-15 health professionals who participated in WP-I. The study recruitment will be conducted over 18-months. The start date is 01 June 2022. WP-I and WP-II recruitment will occur during this period, while WP-III recruitment will occur during the second half. The results are expected to be submitted for publication by mid-2024., DISCUSSION: This paper outlines the study design. If the study successfully identifies the most sensitive echo parameter in recognising the RV dysfunction associated with early BPD, it will be an important finding in constructing an early BPD prediction model., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT05235399.

Due to long-standing experience of early nCPAP as the primary respiratory support option in preterm infants, this approach is sometimes labeled 'the Scandinavian Model'. Mechanical ventilation is potentially harmful to the immature lungs and cohort studies have demonstrated that centers using more CPAP and less mechanical ventilation have reduced rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, there is a lack of evidence in the form of larger, randomized controlled trials to prove the superiority of either method. Surfactant is essential in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and has generally been reserved for infants on mechanical ventilation. With the development of INSURE (INtubation SURfactant Extubation), in which surfactant is administered during a brief intubation followed by immediate extubation, surfactant therapy can be given during nCPAP treatment further reducing need for mechanical ventilation.

Thirty-five preterm neonates (gestational age [GA] <or=31 weeks) with acute respiratory failure were enrolled. Of these, 23 neonates requiring ventilatory support within 2 h after birth comprised the mechanically ventilated group (MV group), and 12 neonates who were not ventilated made up the nonventilated group (NV group). Serum CC16 was measured (using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) within 2 h (T0) and at 72 h (T1) after birth, at day 14 of life (T2) and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (T3). The median CC16 concentrations were significantly higher in the MV group compared to the NV group at all times. Analysis with respect to differences observed in the group characteristics showed that GA, Apgar score at 5 min and mechanical ventilation were significant covariates of serum CC16 at T0. All neonates in the NV group and 18 cases in the MV group, respectively, survived discharge. Ventilated survivors with later bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; oxygen requirement at T3, n = 7) had significantly higher CC16 at all times compared to nonventilated neonates. Elevated serum CC16 levels at T2 were predictive of BPD development.

Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in both the pathogenesis and as a potential therapeutic of this disease. At this time, there is little direct evidence of the changes in NO production and metabolism that occur within BPD in humans. Animal models have implied that reduced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and NO production in the early stages of the disease may be critical factors. However, inflammation and hence iNOS expression, is also thought to play a role. In the present study we have utilized pathological samples to determine changes in the expression of NOS and NO metabolites within late stage BPD. It is our contention that within these samples iNOS expression is increased and associated with increased NO metabolite production. Mild immunostaining of all three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes (neuronal, inducible and endothelial) is observed in control lung with tight localization to the endothelium and epithelial airway. This tight localization was lost in samples from subjects with BPD. There was also a marked increase in iNOS expression throughout the lung tissue with strong coexistence with an epithelial cell marker cytokeratin. NO reaction products are altered with BPD as evidenced by increased S-nitrosothiol (SNO) and strong nitrotyrosine (NO(2)Y) imunoreactivity.

We hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide therapy would not influence concentrations of plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of the Nitric Oxide Chronic Lung Disease Trial, we collected blood samples at specified intervals from a subpopulation of 100 infants of <1250 g birth weight who received inhaled nitric oxide (20 ppm, weaned to 2 ppm) or placebo gas for 24 days. Plasma was assayed for total protein and for 3-nitrotyrosine and carbonylation by using immunoassays., RESULTS: The demographic characteristics and primary outcome for the infants were representative of the entire group of infants who were in the Nitric Oxide Chronic Lung Disease Trial. For all infants at baseline, before receiving study gas, the concentration of total protein was inversely correlated with the respiratory severity score, and plasma carbonyl was positively correlated with severity score, supporting an association between oxidative stress and severity of lung disease. Infants who survived without bronchopulmonary dysplasia had 30% lower protein carbonylation concentrations at study entry than those who had an adverse outcome. At each of 3 time points (1-10 days) during exposure to study gas, there were no significant differences between control and treated infants for concentrations of plasma protein, 3-nitrotyrosine, and carbonylation., CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled nitric oxide treatment for premature infants who are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia does not alter plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress, which supports the safety of this therapy.","group":"g1","id":"4f100897-0ac8-4b2e-8752-b083469e70fa","_showDetails":true},"0c8d0db8-d99e-4c33-bf53-38cbd03c0180":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"High tidal volume ventilation activates Smad2 and upregulates expression of connective tissue growth factor in newborn rat lung.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e318163a8cc","authors":["Wu, Shu","Capasso, Letizia","Lessa, Andrea","Peng, Jinghong","Kasisomayajula, Kalyani","Rodriguez, Maria","Suguihara, Cleide","Bancalari, Eduardo"],"date":"2008//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Connective Tissue Growth Factor","Immediate-Early Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Immediate-Early Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Interleukin-6/ge [Genetics]","Interleukin-6/me [Metabolism]","Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Lung Diseases/et [Etiology]","*Lung Diseases/me [Metabolism]","Lung Diseases/pa [Pathology]","Lung Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]","Phosphorylation","*Positive-Pressure Respiration/ae [Adverse Effects]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","*Signal Transduction","*Smad2 Protein/me [Metabolism]","Smad7 Protein/me [Metabolism]","*Tidal Volume","Time Factors","Transforming Growth Factor beta/me [Metabolism]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Up-Regulation"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"63","number":"3","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18287961"],"address":"United States","abstract":"High tidal volume (V(T)) ventilation plays a key role in ventilator induced lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

To identify the potential signaling pathways mediating high V(T) induction of CTGF, newborn rats were ventilated with high V(T) for 1 or 3 h. Temporal expression of TGF-betas, p-Smad2, Smad7, and CTGF was analyzed. High V(T) ventilation did not change gene expression of TGF-betas and Smad7 but induced rapid and sustained expression of p-Smad2 that precedes increased CTGF expression. CTGF and p-Smad2 were localized in bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar walls and septa. These data suggest that high V(t) ventilation activates the Smad2 pathway, which may be responsible for downstream induction of CTGF expression in newborn rat lungs.","group":"g1","id":"0c8d0db8-d99e-4c33-bf53-38cbd03c0180","_showDetails":true},"1d3ef659-2e9b-406d-b2af-baf5df53d0af":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Oxidative stress in fetal lambs exposed to intra-amniotic endotoxin in a chorioamnionitis model.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e31815f653b","authors":["Cheah, Fook-Choe","Jobe, Alan H","Moss, Timothy J","Newnham, John P","Kallapur, Suhas G"],"date":"2008//","keywords":["Amniotic Fluid","Animals","Biomarkers/bl [Blood]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cy [Cytology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Chorioamnionitis/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Chorioamnionitis/me [Metabolism]","Chorioamnionitis/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Fetal Organ Maturity","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Injections","Interleukin-1beta/me [Metabolism]","Interleukin-8/me [Metabolism]","Lipopolysaccharides/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Lung/em [Embryology]","Lung/en [Enzymology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Oxidative Stress","Peroxidase/me [Metabolism]","Peroxiredoxins/me [Metabolism]","Pregnancy","Protein Carbonylation","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A/ge [Genetics]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein B/ge [Genetics]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein B/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Sheep","Superoxide Dismutase/me [Metabolism]","Time Factors"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"63","number":"3","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18091343"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Chorioamnionitis is a risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

The study goal was to measure enzyme activity for preterm infants during the first week of life., METHODS: Blood samples were collected from umbilical arterial lines or the radial artery of 44 preterm infants (gestational age range: 25-30 weeks) on days 0, 2, and 5 after delivery. Erythrocyte CAT and c-GPx activities were evaluated, while clinical data were obtained and the correlations of enzyme activity and BPD status were examined., RESULTS: There was no correlation between enzyme activity and gestational age or birth weight. Packed red cell transfusion did not affect enzyme activity and there was no difference in CAT activity between the patient groups. C-GPx activity from preterm infants with BPD was significantly lower than those of preterm infants without BPD on day 5., CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte c-GPx may play an important role in the development of BPD.

BPD is the most common pulmonary sequela of prematurity and is often fatal; however, there remains no FDA-approved therapies to treat or prevent BPD. Sildenafil is increasingly used off-label in premature infants despite scant safety and efficacy data. Sildenafil reduces lung injury and preserves normal vasculature in preclinical models, and improves outcomes in children with pulmonary hypertension, and thus is a promising candidate for BPD. Following phase I studies, we developed the phase II SIL02 trial to describe the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary effectiveness of intravenous and enteral sildenafil in premature infants at risk for BPD. SIL02 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-cohort, sequential dose-escalating trial of enteral or intravenous (IV) sildenafil dosed every 8 h for up to 34 days. The target IV doses were 0.125, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/dose in cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively; while the enteral doses will be double the IV doses. Eligible infants must be < 29 weeks' gestation at birth and requiring respiratory support at 7-28 days' postnatal age. Adverse events and preliminary effectiveness will be compared by treatment group. Using the final population PK model, empirical Bayesian estimates will be generated for each patient. Preliminary effectiveness will be measured by the incidence of moderate to severe BPD or death at 36 weeks and change in the BPD risk estimation.

The lung pathology in BPD is characterized by impaired alveolar and capillary development.

In contrast, the steady-state mRNA and protein levels of two major cysteine protease inhibitors, cystatin B and C, were unchanged. Correlating with these alterations, the activity of cysteine proteases in lung tissue homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was significantly higher in the BPD group. The levels of cathepsin B, H, and S increased and cathepsin K decreased with advancing gestation. All cathepsins, except for cat K, were immunolocalized to macrophages in BPD. In addition, cathepsin H and cystatin B were colocalized in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. Cathepsin L was detected in some bronchial epithelial, endothelial, and interstitial cells. Cathepsin K was localized to some perivascular cells by in situ hybridization., CONCLUSIONS: Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate an imbalance between cysteine proteases and their inhibitors in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"ec03eb6a-8773-43da-9eb2-9af5dfdf1536","_showDetails":true},"f11ade36-a225-448c-a360-a78b121cea96":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Gene expression profiling in lung fibroblasts reveals new players in alveolarization.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00108.2007","authors":["Boucherat, Olivier","Franco-Montoya, Marie-Laure","Thibault, Christelle","Incitti, Roberto","Chailley-Heu, Bernadette","Delacourt, Christophe","Bourbon, Jacques R"],"date":"2007//","accessDate":"20071002//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","Female","*Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Expression Regulation/de [Drug Effects]","Homeodomain Proteins/ge [Genetics]","Lung/cy [Cytology]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/ph [Physiology]","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Alveoli/cy [Cytology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/ph [Physiology]","Rats"],"journal":"Physiological genomics","volume":"32","number":"1","isbn":"1094-8341","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17911382"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Little is known about the molecular basis of lung alveolarization. We used a microarray profiling strategy to identify novel genes that may regulate the secondary septation process. Rat lung fibroblasts were extemporaneously isolated on postnatal days 2, 7, and 21, i.e., before, during, and after septation, respectively. Total RNA was extracted, and cRNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix rat genome 230 2.0 microarrays. Expression levels of a selection of genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. In addition to genes already known to be upregulated during alveolarization including drebrin, midkine, Fgfr3, and Fgfr4, the study allowed us to identify two remarkable groups of genes with opposite profiles, i.e., gathering genes either transiently up- or downregulated on day 7. The former group includes the transcription factors retinoic acid receptor (RXR)-gamma and homeobox (Hox) a2, a4, and a5 and genes involved in Wnt signaling (Wnt5a, Fzd1, and Ndp); the latter group includes the extracellular matrix components Comp and Opn and the signal molecule Slfn4. Profiling in whole lung from fetal life to adulthood confirmed that changes were specific for alveolarization. Two treatments that arrest septation, hyperoxia and dexamethasone, inhibited the expression of genes that are upregulated during alveolarization and conversely enhanced that of genes weakly expressed during alveolarization and upregulated thereafter. The possible roles of these genes in secondary septation are discussed. Gene expression profiling analysis on freshly isolated cells represents a powerful approach to provide new information about differential regulation of genes during alveolarization and pathways potentially involved in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g3","id":"f11ade36-a225-448c-a360-a78b121cea96","_showDetails":true},"5dcf0e16-31b6-4ae7-ae7a-e056d31e3fcd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Enterococcal colonization of infants in a neonatal intensive care unit: associated predictors, risk factors and seasonal patterns.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-7-107","authors":["Hufnagel, Markus","Liese, Cathrin","Loescher, Claudia","Kunze, Mirjam","Proempeler, Heinrich","Berner, Reinhard","Krueger, Marcus"],"date":"2007//","accessDate":"20070916//","keywords":["Anti-Bacterial Agents/pd [Pharmacology]","Anti-Bacterial Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Disease Susceptibility/mi [Microbiology]","Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial","*Enterococcus/de [Drug Effects]","*Enterococcus/ip [Isolation & Purification]","Female","Germany/ep [Epidemiology]","Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","Humans","Infant","Infant, Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal","Male","Prospective Studies","Risk Factors","Seasons"],"journal":"BMC infectious diseases","volume":"7","isbn":"1471-2334","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17868474"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: During and shortly after birth, newborn infants are colonized with enterococci. This study analyzes predictors for early enterococcal colonization of infants in a neonatal intensive care unit and describes risk factors associated with multidrugresistant enterococci colonization and its seasonal patterns., METHODS: Over a 12-month period, we performed a prospective epidemiological study in 274 infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. On the first day of life, we compared infants with enterococcal isolates detected in meconium or body cultures to those without. We then tested the association of enterococcal colonization with peripartal predictors/risk factors by using bivariate and multivariate statistical methods., RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the infants were colonized with enterococci. The three most common enterococcal species were E. faecium (48% of isolates), E. casseliflavus (25%) and E. faecalis (13%). Fifty-seven percent of the enterococci found were resistant to three of five antibiotic classes, but no vancomycin-resistant isolates were observed. During winter/spring months, the number of enterococci and multidrug-resistant enterococci were higher than in summer/fall months (p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001, respectively). With respect to enterococcal colonization on the first day of life, predictors were prematurity (p = 0.043) and low birth weight (p = 0.011). With respect to colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci, risk factors were prematurity (p = 0.0006), low birth weight (p < 0.0001) and prepartal antibiotic treatment (p = 0.019). Using logistic regression, we determined that gestational age was the only parameter significantly correlated with multidrug-resistant enterococci colonization. No infection with enterococci or multidrugresistant enterococci in the infants was detected. The outcome of infants with and without enterococcal colonization was the same with respect to death, necrotizing enterocolitis, intracerebral hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia., CONCLUSION: In neonatal intensive care units, an infant's susceptibility to early colonization with enterococci in general, and his or her risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci in particular, is increased in preterm newborns, especially during the winter/spring months. The prepartal use of antibiotics with no known activity against enterococci appears to increase the risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci.","group":"g1","id":"5dcf0e16-31b6-4ae7-ae7a-e056d31e3fcd","_showDetails":true},"06f23f96-6a08-496f-83c0-7da0668630ff":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Surfactant function and composition in premature infants treated with inhaled nitric oxide.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-0095","authors":["Ballard, Philip L","Merrill, Jeffrey D","Truog, William E","Godinez, Rodolfo I","Godinez, Marye H","McDevitt, Theresa M","Ning, Yue","Golombek, Sergio G","Parton, Lance A","Luan, Xianqun","Cnaan, Avital","Ballard, Roberta A"],"date":"2007//","keywords":["Administration, Inhalation","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/ph [Physiology]","Male","*Nitric Oxide/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Pulmonary Alveoli/ch [Chemistry]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/ph [Physiology]","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/ch [Chemistry]","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/ph [Physiology]","Surface Tension/de [Drug Effects]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"120","number":"2","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17671061"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide treatment of premature infants at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia would not adversely affect endogenous surfactant function or composition., METHODS: As part of the Nitric Oxide Chronic Lung Disease Trial of inhaled nitric oxide, we examined surfactant in a subpopulation of enrolled infants.

All polymorphisms were analyzed by means of a commercially available reverse dot-blot kit., SETTING: Tertiary neonatal intensive care unit., PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five consecutive preterm newborns., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two variants were particularly analyzed: -550G > C and R52C. The first one is known to be associated with lower protein synthesis when included in specific haplotypes. The homozygous and heterozygous -550G > C mutations were significantly associated with protective effects regarding different lung outcome variables, including shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, hours of continuous positive airway pressure and lower number of hemotransfusions. In contrast, the heterozygous R52C mutation was associated with unfavorable outcome, including higher bronchopulmonary dysplasia prevalence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that these associations were independent of gestational age and birth weight. In addition, four groups of patients were defined on the basis of haplotype combinations. Those known to be associated with low serum MBL2 levels were linked to a better outcome in terms of factors such as hours of mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, number of hemotransfusions and bronchopulmonary disease development., CONCLUSIONS: The four haplotype combination groups may have a potential diagnostic use as opposite risk factors for lung disease of prematurity.","group":"g1","id":"42637505-b535-4d75-b0eb-34ac13ef7ddb","_showDetails":true},"2ab8bb7d-d48f-4232-a531-b0b8bf22de52":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Up-regulation of connective tissue growth factor in hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e3180987202","authors":["Chen, Chung-Ming","Wang, Leng-Fang","Chou, Hsiu-Chu","Lang, Yaw-Dong","Lai, Yi-Ping"],"date":"2007//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis","Blotting, Western","Body Weight","Collagen/ge [Genetics]","*Collagen/me [Metabolism]","Connective Tissue Growth Factor","Disease Models, Animal","Hyperoxia/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Immediate-Early Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Immediate-Early Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Immunohistochemistry","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Organ Size","Oxygen","Pulmonary Fibrosis/et [Etiology]","Pulmonary Fibrosis/ge [Genetics]","*Pulmonary Fibrosis/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Fibrosis/pa [Pathology]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Time Factors","Up-Regulation"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"62","number":"2","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17597657"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Pulmonary oxygen toxicity plays an important role in the lung injury process that leads to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Polymorphism of the genes involved in basic lung function and alveolar stability, lung differentiation and pulmonary host defense may influence the risk. Natural selection has refined the genes responsible for cardiopulmonary adaptation and resistance against pneumonia in term and near-term infants. Before the era of antibiotics, however, virtually all very preterm infants died of asphyxia, respiratory failure or infections. Today, the degree of prematurity plays a dominant role in susceptibility to serious lung disease. In addition, genetic polymorphism and constitution modulate the risk of RDS and BPD that have different, partly overlapping predisposition. According to twin studies, the genetic impact on the risk of RDS and BPD among preterm and very preterm infants is 35-65%. Individual disease genes generally have low penetrance. Large-scale genetic studies are required as part of neonatal and perinatal research in order to learn about the risk factors and to investigate pharmacogenetics.

Because these have been generally studied only in whole lung, we focused specifically on mesenchymal and epithelial cells freshly isolated at various developmental stages. In fibroblasts, the most striking developmental change was a peak (fourfold the prenatal level) of membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP transcript during alveolarization, consistent with the known crucial role of MT1-MMP in this process. TIMP-1 and -2 mRNAs transiently increased on postnatal d (pn) 3. In alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), MMP-2 expression was maximal on fetal d (f) 19 when alveolar type II cells (ATII) differentiate and on pn5; by contrast, MT1-MMP expression changed little and TIMP-1 expression decreased with advancing gestation. In cells expressing in vitro the ATI phenotype, TIMP-1 and -2 activities were nine- and fivefold those in cells expressing ATII features, respectively, whereas ATII presented higher MMP-2 activity and were the only cell type to express MMP-9. This indicates higher remodeling potential for ATII. Pulmonary mesenchymal and epithelial cells have therefore quite distinct MMP/TIMP expression patterns. Changes in cell compartments should be specifically documented in developing lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia in which changes in MMP activities have been reported.","group":"g1","id":"0511bf33-490c-4665-8edd-5c4782aeb515","_showDetails":true},"d75d736f-03be-4bb6-8df7-a8f6b44f5907":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Retinoids increase lung elastin expression but fail to alter morphology or angiogenesis genes in premature ventilated baboons.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/pdr.0b013e318053661d","authors":["Pierce, Richard A","Joyce, Belinda","Officer, Susan","Heintz, Catherine","Moore, Carla","McCurnin, Donald","Johnston, Carl","Maniscalco, William"],"date":"2007//","keywords":["Animals","Capillaries/ch [Chemistry]","Capillaries/gd [Growth & Development]","Elastin/an [Analysis]","Elastin/ge [Genetics]","*Elastin/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/ch [Chemistry]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","*Neovascularization, Physiologic/ge [Genetics]","Papio","Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/an [Analysis]","*Premature Birth","*Pulmonary Alveoli/bs [Blood Supply]","Pulmonary Alveoli/ch [Chemistry]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Ventilation","Receptor, TIE-1/ge [Genetics]","*Retinoids/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Up-Regulation","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"61","number":"6","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17426644"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Retinoids regulate elastin synthesis by alveolar myofibroblasts and affect angiogenesis pathways, both of which are processes critical for alveolar development.

A total of 157 cases were enrolled and divided into a BPD group (n = 60) and a non-BPD group (n = 97) according to whether BPD was present. The general condition, fluid intake, and fluid overload of the two groups of neonates within 1 week after birth were compared. The logistic regression was used to assess the association between infant characteristics and BPD. The ROC curve was used to assess how well the 7 day cumulative fluid overload predicted BPD, and to identify an optimal cut off for prediction., Results: The comparison of the patients' general condition revealed that the neonates in the BPD group had a younger GA, lower BW, lower 5-min Apgar score, longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and higher incidence of intrauterine infections and administration of surfactants (P < 0.05). The differences in the other indicators were not statistically significant between the two groups. The logistic regression analysis revealed that a younger GA, the presence of intrauterine infection, and a 7-day cumulative fluid overload were the risk factors for the development of BPD. A ROC curve was plotted with the 7-day cumulative fluid overload as the test variable and BPD as the status variable. The area under the curve was 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.664-0.826, P = 0.042), with a sensitivity of 76.7% and a specificity of 70.1%, corresponding to a 7-day cumulative fluid overload of 36.2%., Conclusion: A younger GA, the presence of intrauterine infection, and a 7-day cumulative fluid overload were risk factors for the development of BPD.

RT-PCR and ELISA were used to detect mRNA and cytokine levels from culture media, respectively., RESULTS: We found that PMNs did not produce IL-10 mRNA or release IL-10 but did produce IL-8 mRNA by 1 h. PBMCs did produce IL-10 mRNA after 4 h (with IL-8 mRNA expression by 1 h). LPS-stimulated PBMCs released IL-10 to a maximum of 1,038 pg/ml/5 million cells (56 femtomolar). Equimolar doses of exogenous IL-10 or DEX produced up to 83% inhibition of IL-8 from PMNs. Exogenous IL-10 was more potent than DEX, on an equimolar basis, with regard to IL-8 release from PBMCs (90 vs. 33% respectively at a 10 nanomolar level). No inhibition of IL-8 release by IL-10 or DEX was observed at 100 femtomolar level. IL-10 and DEX did not have an additive inhibitory effect on IL-8 release., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that for the newborn: (1) PBMCs produce IL-10 far below the level needed to inhibit a submaximal release of IL-8 from PMNs or PBMCs, and (2) exogenous IL-10 was equipotent or more potent than therapeutic levels of DEX on inhibition of IL-8 from these cells. Further studies are needed to determine if exogenous IL-10 may be useful in the treatment of BPD or other inflammatory disorders of the newborn.","group":"g1","id":"3344061b-31b9-4334-8acf-4b170aec72fd","_showDetails":true},"e4a4f3dc-2a1f-4cda-ac43-4eff4c7fb989":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Impact of subclinical chorioamnionitis on maternal and neonatal outcomes.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00016340601022793","authors":["Miyazaki, Ken","Furuhashi, Madoka","Matsuo, Keitaro","Minami, Kojiro","Yoshida, Kana","Kuno, Naohiko","Ishikawa, Kaoru"],"date":"2007//","keywords":["Adolescent","Adult","Amniotic Fluid/me [Metabolism]","*Anti-Bacterial Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Bed Rest","Biomarkers/an [Analysis]","C-Reactive Protein/an [Analysis]","Chorioamnionitis/di [Diagnosis]","Chorioamnionitis/mo [Mortality]","*Chorioamnionitis/th [Therapy]","Delivery, Obstetric","Female","Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Leukocyte Elastase/an [Analysis]","Pregnancy","*Pregnancy Outcome","Pregnancy Trimester, Second","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica","volume":"86","number":"2","isbn":"0001-6349","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17364282"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis is considered to be one of the main causes of preterm labor and has been associated with an adverse perinatal outcome in preterm infants. The controversy about the benefits/risks of delaying labor is a critical issue concerning the management of chorioamnionitis., METHODS: The database between July 2001 and March 2006 was reviewed for women with singleton pregnancies between 22 and 28 weeks of gestation and with chorioamnionitis diagnosed on admission by amniotic fluid neutrophil elastase level. Women were classified according to the severity of chorioamnionitis (group A, amniotic fluid neutrophil elastase level of 0.15-1 microg/ml; B, 1-10 microg/ml; and C, > or = 10 microg/ml). During expectant management, serum C-reactive protein levels monitored the remission and aggravation of chorioamnionitis. Following deliveries, placentas were examined for histologic chorioamnionitis., RESULTS: One hundred women were enrolled (group A, 38; B, 34; C, 28). The latency period until delivery was significantly longer in group A than in groups B and C. C-reactive protein levels just before delivery were higher than those on admission in 61% of the overall cases. Histologic chorioamnionitis and funisitis were manifested in 90.4% and 65.5%, respectively. Intrauterine fetal demise (4 cases) and neonatal and postneonatal deaths during admission (10 cases) were observed. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was the most common major morbidity noted in groups B and C., CONCLUSION: Chorioamnionitis could be controlled but is hard to cure. Higher levels of amniotic fluid neutrophil elastase are associated with a shorter interval from admission to delivery in women with subclinical chorioamnionitis.","group":"g1","id":"e4a4f3dc-2a1f-4cda-ac43-4eff4c7fb989","_showDetails":true},"a4368126-0696-43f3-8d43-9dd1dca43f11":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Postnatal dexamethasone therapy and cerebral tissue volumes in extremely low birth weight infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2006-1354","authors":["Parikh, Nehal A","Lasky, Robert E","Kennedy, Kathleen A","Moya, Fernando R","Hochhauser, Leo","Romo, Seferino","Tyson, Jon E"],"date":"2007//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["*Brain/ah [Anatomy & Histology]","*Dexamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Female","*Glucocorticoids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Humans","*Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male","Organ Size"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"119","number":"2","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17272615"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to relate postnatal dexamethasone therapy in extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight of < or = 1000 g) to their total and regional brain volumes, as measured by volumetric MRI performed at term-equivalent age., METHODS: Among 53 extremely low birth weight infants discharged between June 1 and December 31, 2003, 41 had high-quality MRI studies; 30 of those infants had not received postnatal steroid treatment and 11 had received dexamethasone, all after postnatal age of 28 days, for a mean duration of 6.8 days and a mean cumulative dose of 2.8 mg/kg. Anatomic brain MRI scans obtained at 39.5 weeks (mean) postmenstrual age were segmented by using semiautomated and manual, pretested, scoring algorithms to generate three-dimensional cerebral component volumes. Volumes were adjusted according to postmenstrual age at MRI., RESULTS: After controlling for postmenstrual age at MRI, we observed a 10.2% smaller total cerebral tissue volume in the dexamethasone-treated group, compared with the untreated group. Cortical tissue volume was 8.7% smaller in the treated infants, compared with untreated infants. Regional volume analysis revealed a 20.6% smaller cerebellum and a 19.9% reduction in subcortical gray matter in the dexamethasone-treated infants, compared with untreated infants. In a series of regression analyses, the reductions in total cerebral tissue, subcortical gray matter, and cerebellar volumes associated with dexamethasone administration remained significant after controlling not only for postmenstrual age but also for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and birth weight., CONCLUSIONS: We identified smaller total and regional cerebral tissue volumes in extremely low birth weight infants treated with relatively conservative regimens of dexamethasone. These volume deficits may be the structural antecedents of neuromotor and cognitive abnormalities reported after postnatal dexamethasone treatment.","group":"g1","id":"a4368126-0696-43f3-8d43-9dd1dca43f11","_showDetails":true},"7d4c06c2-ec2f-40bb-a7d4-ae740f96145b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: an update.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12098-007-0032-z","authors":["Bhandari, Anita","Bhandari, Vineet"],"date":"2007//","keywords":["Antioxidants/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","Chronic Disease","Combined Modality Therapy","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","Disease Progression","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Incidence","India","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Male","Nitric Oxide/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Prognosis","Risk Assessment","Severity of Illness Index","Survival Rate"],"journal":"Indian journal of pediatrics","volume":"74","number":"1","isbn":"0019-5456","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17264460"],"address":"India","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease associated with premature birth and characterized by early lung injury.

The hypothesis of the current study is that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the pro-inflammatory TNFalpha gene place preterm infants at increased risk for BPD. Preterm infants (105 in number) with birthweights <or=1 kg, who survived to at least 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) or discharge were enrolled into this study. They were stratified for BPD according to their need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 weeks PMA (non-, mild-, moderate-, or severe-BPD). DNA was extracted from these infants and subjected to analyses for the TNFalpha SNPs: -1,031, -863, -857, -308, and -238. The PHASE software (version 2.1) was used to reconstruct haplotypes and estimate their frequencies within the study population. Differences in birth weight (P < 0.001) and gestational age (P < 0.001), but not in racial distribution between the groups were found. Haplotype-specific analysis revealed no significant association between BPD severity and any of the 5-marker common haplotypes with 10 or more copies in this study population.

Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to confirm the establishment of the BPD model. The mRNA levels were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR). Protein expression levels were determined using western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence., Results: As confirmed by HE staining, the neonatal rat model of BPD was successfully established. Compared to that in the control group, claudin-18 and claudin-4 expression decreased in the hyperoxia group. Expression of beta-catenin in the WNT signaling pathway decreased, whereas that of p-GSK-3beta increased. Expression of the AEC II marker SFTPC initially decreased and then increased, whereas that of the AEC I marker podoplanin increased on day 14 (P < 0.05). Similarly, claudin-18, claudin-4, SFTPC and beta-catenin were decreased but podoplanin was increased when AEC line RLE-6TN exposed to 85% hyperoxia. And the expression of SFTPC was increased, the podoplanin was decreased, and the WNT pathway was upregulated when claudin-18 was overexpressed., Conclusions: Claudin-18 downregulation during hyperoxia might affect lung development and maturation, thereby resulting in hyperoxia-induced BPD. Additionally, claudin-18 is associated with the canonical WNT pathway and AECs transdifferentiation.
