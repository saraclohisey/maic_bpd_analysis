AB  - RATIONALE: Premature infants exposed to mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or increased O2 often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a neonatal chronic lung disease, characterized by a reduced alveolarization. We previously linked reduced Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor regulating cell pluripotency and survival, to lung growth arrest. Since type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII cells) are alveolar progenitor cells, we studied the impact of hyperoxia on Klf4 in newborn lungs and ATII homeostasis; and the functional role of Klf4 in ATII survival and signaling. METHOD(S): Animal studies: Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 or room air for 28 days. Mice with ATII-specific ablation of Klf4 were studied during late lung development. Cell culture studies: Overexpression (Klf4OE) and deletion of Klf4 (Klf4del) in murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) was induced using a doxycycline-inducible sleeping beauty transposon system and CRSPR/Cas9 technique, respectively, followed by hyperoxia (85% O2) or room air. Cell viability was assessed by MTT or BrdU assay and apoptosis by Caspase assay. RESULT(S): (1) Klf4 was localized in lung epithelial cells of human and mice during lung development using CDH1, aquaporin 5, and surfactant protein C (SfptC) as markers. Decreased Klf4 abundance in lungs of newborn mice after hyperoxia was related to reduced alveolar cell-specific markers (SftpC and aquaporin 5) and lung growth arrest. (2) Hyperoxia did not only decrease Klf4 protein and mRNA expression in cultured MLE-12, but also inhibited cell survival. Klf4OE and Klf4del induced apoptosis of MLE-12, and diminished epithelial cell marker expression (E-Cadherin, SftpB, SftpC). Klf4OE aggravated hyperoxia-induced reduced MLE-12 proliferation. Mechanistically, Klf4OE blocked Stat3 and activated Smad2 signaling; conversely, Klf4del activated Stat3 and inhibited Smad2 activity. Finally, we confirmed the importance of Klf4 in ATII homeostasis by showing a reduced number of ATII cells in mice with a SftpC-specific ablation of Klf4 during late lung development. CONCLUSION(S): We identified a novel Klf4-Stat3- Smad2 axis in ATII cell homeostasis that hyperoxia disrupts in ATII cells and in lungs of newborn mice, suggesting Klf4 as potential novel target regulating lung regeneration after neonatal hyperoxia.

AB  - Introduction Neonatal respiratory distress in extremely premature infants is not unexpected. However, in the presence of accelerating postnatal pulmonary disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) may not be the primary cause of lung pathology. We describe a premature infant with severe respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilatory support, with an underlying diagnosis of ABCA3 deficiency. Case Report A male infant born at 25-weeks gestation at a regional hospital was intubated and mechanically ventilated at birth. Chest X-ray demonstrated pulmonary interstitial emphysema. High frequency ventilation, diuresis, and systemic corticosteroid continued throughout the first 3 months of life. Genetic testing revealed two distinct ABCA3 gene missense mutations: (i) p.E29ZV, the most common pathogenic ABCA3 mutation; and (ii) p.R1081W, previously reported in ABCA3 deficiency and positioned close to other disease-causing mutations. Parental sequencing provided trans confirmation of the mutations. Following ABCA3 deficiency diagnosis, the care team recommended that ongoing care was futile. Treatment with daily systemic steroids and azithromycin continued as transfer to our facility for a second opinion and ongoing management. CT chest demonstrated areas of "crazy paving patterning," cystic changes and air trapping, suggestive of both BPD and surfactantopathy. Corticosteroids were continued, hydroxychloroquine initiated, and the infant was weaned to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). With gastrostomy tube placement, the infant's respiratory status worsened, intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation ensued with eventual extubation to NIPPV. Following pulse therapy with methyl-prednisone (30 mg/kg/day x 3 days) tachypnea improved, enabling weaning to high flow nasal cannula. Repeat CT chest demonstrated worsening cystic changes and diffuse ground glass opacities. Discussion ABCA3 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease with more than 150 unique disease-causing mutations. Limited knowledge surrounding genotype and phenotype correlations in children with compound heterozygous, partial function mutations, challenges diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic decision-making. The optimal therapeutic approach remains uncertain as combinations of macrolides, steroids and hydroxychloroquine have been applied with varying outcomes. The present case highlights the pathogenic significance of surfactantopathies in infants with severe, recalcitrant respiratory distress. Considerable gaps in knowledge continue to confound the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of infants with severe BPD and ABCA3 deficiency.

AB  - Introduction MIRAGE syndrome, a new form of syndromic adrenal hypoplasia, is caused exclusively by germline de novo heterozygous SAMD9 mutations. Variable intellectual development, adrenal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, anemia, recurrent infections, genital underdevelopment and myelodysplastic syndromes have been described as key features; and only a few case reports in extremely low birth weight (ELBW). Early detection is critical for adequate multi-disciplinary interventions. Case Presentation A thirteen-month-old male, former 26-week preterm, was admitted to the neonatal ICU due to respiratory distress. Pregnancy was complicated by intrauterine growth restriction, placenta previa, and oligohydramnios. His Apgar was 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. He required mechanical ventilation for two months and tolerated CPAP and room air before discharge. His neonatal course was characterized by frequent platelet transfusions due to thrombocytopenia, vasopressors and hydrocortisone to control hypotension. In the setting of an acute decompensation, he was diagnosed with right adrenal hemorrhage. Evaluation of adrenal axis was notable for low levels of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone, with all other parameters within normal limits. Ambiguous genitalia, hypospadias and bifid scrotum were noted. Fludrocortisone was started. His karyotype was XY. He was readmitted twice during his first year for bronchiolitis requiring intubation. He was discharged on supplemental oxygen. Bone marrow aspiration revealed myelodysplastic syndrome with multilineage dysplasia secondary to monosomy 7. Workup revealed low total IgG level and subclasses, with no response to tetanus and Hib vaccines. He was placed on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin and antimicrobial prophylaxis. Whole genome sequencing identified SAMD9 mutation. Discussion MIRAGE Syndrome includes Myelodysplasia, recurrent Infection, Restriction of growth, Adrenal hypoplasia, Genital phenotypes, and Enteropathy. SAMD9 mutations cause this novel multisystem disorder and are associated with loss of chromosome 7. This mutation was recently identified, and few case reports have been described. Laboratory studies have found low T, B, and NK cell numbers and low NK cell function, yet normal T and B cell function after mitogen stimulation. Fatal infections, premature birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and developmental delay have been described. Our patient (and both parents) had sequencing done, which revealed a novel de novo variant on one allele of the SAMD9 gene (c 2471 G>A p. Arg 824Gln). The variant changes an amino acid from arginine to glutamine at the 824th amino acid in the gene. Early suspicion in ELBW infants with BPD, adrenal/gonadal failure, and infections is fundamental, because timely management is crucial for survival. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Lung disease originating between the late canalicular and mature alveolar period remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Understanding structural abnormalities contributing to late developmental stage disease is limited by the rarity of access to normal and diseased whole human lungs across this age span and methods for standardized imaging and measurement. The Lung Molecular Atlas Program Human Tissue Core created a data and biospecimens repository to fill this gap by seeking pediatric research donations recovered through the national transplant network. Radiologic and microscopy techniques were applied to define age and disease related variations. Method(s): Lungs were recovered en bloc after in-situ cold preservative vascular flush. Expedited shipping minimized cold ischemic time. Upon arrival the lung was intubated, briefly ventilated (PIP < 25, PEEP = 4), suctioned and then scanned at a static inflation pressure by ultra-high-resolution CT (helical, 0.67mm slice, 0.102 x 0.102 x 0.123 mm resolution, spiral pitch factor 0.348, <2min scan). A unique ID and grid approach was applied for tissue blocking. PFA fixed thick sections were cleared (CUBIC) and stained with fluorescence-tagged antibodies (Nkx2.1, smooth muscle actin and PECAM) and for elastin with hydrazide. Result(s): The BioRepository for INvestigation of Diseases of the Lung (BRINDL) contains over 200 human full lung sets, including 53 normal, by history and histopathology, spanning mid-late gestation to adult age, and an additional 13 bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 17 pulmonary hypoplasia, 4 developmental delay in alveolar structure for age, 19 medial smooth muscle hypertrophy suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Our warm and cold ischemic times were 1.0 + 3.8 and 23.7 + 7.9 hours, respectively (mean+SD). High quality is suggested by RNA integrity (RIN) on representative samples (8.2+0.8, n=14). CT scan resolution, about twice that of clinical HRCT, allowed airway skeletonization, 3D reconstructions and virtual bronchoscopy, extended to approximately the 15th generation airway branch. Quantitation demonstrates differences in airway length and diameters related to age. 3D reconstruction and morphometry of distal airways and vessels marked by actin, elastin and PECAM was accomplished in CUBIC cleared thick tissue sections identified by CT scan coordinates. Conclusion(s): Our strategy to bring lungs intact to the HTC dramatically improved quality and implementation of standardized, protocol-driven procedures. Minimal post-mortem damage was detected and unique measurements of pediatric lung airway and vessel development are provided.

AB  - Rationale: Recent findings suggest that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) decreases bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants of maternal Black/African American race/ethnicity (AA) but not in infants of maternal non-Hispanic White race (White). We assessed whether inhaled NO therapy and the development of BPD is characterized by changes in the urinary metabolome, and whether changes in the metabolome correlate with genetic ancestry independent of race/ethnicity. Method(s):Using 171 preterm infants of three racial/ethnic groups from the Trial of Late Surfactant Study (TOLSURF), global metabolic profiles were measured on urine collected at study entry prior to iNO initiation (6-14 days postnatal age, off iNO) and again after receiving iNO at 20, 10 and 5 ppm (23-30 days postnatal age). Continental genomic ancestry was inferred from genome-wide SNP genotypes. Changes in individual metabolites (Metabolon, Inc.) were assessed using ANOVA, and shifts in the global metabolome were evaluated using a principal component analysis and random forests. Changes in metabolites that correlate with levels of African genomic ancestry were examined using linear regression adjusting by race/ethnicity, and a sensitivity analysis was performed within each racial/ethnic group. Result(s): We detected 1033 different biochemicals, of which 262 varied by postnatal age, 208 by race/ethnicity, and 52 by BPD at 36 weeks PMA (p<0.05). In AA but not White infants, BPD cases had significantly decreased levels of 3 neurotransmitters (histamine, N-acetylhistamine, serotonin with BPD Yes/No ratios of 0.20, 0.81, 0.63) and increased cystine and cysteine sulfinic acid (1.29, 1.29). Comparing time point 2 vs 1, levels of kynurenate, an inflammatory metabolite of typtophan, were significantly reduced in BPD infants of all racial/ethnic groups (0.63-0.81); in AA but not White infants, cysteine and metabolites were reduced in BPD infants (0.51-0.70), and polyamines (putrecine, spermidine, 4.43, 1.46) were increased in No BPD infants. African genomic ancestry was significantly correlated with increased levels of the xenobiotic 4-methylbenzenesulfonate following iNO therapy (p=4.6x10-6). Conclusion(s):In a cohort of high-risk premature infants, we identified individual urinary metabolites and pathways that were associated with the development of BPD in the context of iNO therapy, with several occurring in AA but not White infants. Our findings implicate differences in metabolism by race/ethnicity and African genetic ancestry that may contribute to respiratory outcome, and are consistent with observed epidemiological data on rates of BPD following iNO treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Pulmonary vasculitides are challenging due to their rarity, variable clinical presentation, and overlap with more common entities. We present a case of idiopathic, medium sized vessel pulmonary vasculitis in a patient with worsening pulmonary hypertension. Case Summary: A 10 year-old female with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (twin birth at 26 weeks gestation), left upper pulmonary vein stenosis (LUPVS), worsening pulmonary hypertension (PH), ASD status post fenestrated closure, with persistent hypoxemia, worsening dyspnea and exercise intolerance following ASD closure and worsening PH by ECHO while on ambrisentan, tadalafil, and treprostanil. Repeat chest CTs showed increasing ground glass opacities, cystic lucencies consistent with BPD, spotty septal thickening and intermittent hilar adenopathy. Her pulmonary function declined significantly over the past 1.5 years, most recently with FVC 50% predicted and FEV1 44% predicted with bronchodilator response. Cardiac catheterization showed a mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure of 49 mmHg with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 11 mmHg. Lung biopsy showed medium-sized pulmonary arterial vasculitis with Tcell rich inflammation, pneumonitis, pleuritis, marked fibrointimal proliferation with luminal occlusion and no evidence of PVOD. The idiopathic PAH genetic panel was negative. Rheumatology concluded that this was idiopathic medium vessel pulmonary vasculitis after extensive work-up, including ANCA-antibodies, was negative. She was treated with IV pulse steroids and cyclophosphamide with initial improvement and was discharged home on nocturnal BIPAP. She developed worsening dyspnea a couple weeks after discharge. Echo demonstrated worsening RV function, severe septal flattening (previously moderate), bidirectional shunting across her ASD fenestration (previously predominantly left to right), and RV ejection fraction decreased to 31% (previously 37.7). She was given pulse steroids and continued monthly cyclophosphamide as scheduled with improved RV function and a decrease in TR peak gradient to 57 mmHg, down from 130 mmHg. Discussion(s): This case is unusual because idiopathic medium vessel vasculitis is extremely rare in the lung, as it usually affects the coronaries in Kawasaki disease and systemic vessels in polyarteritis nodosa. Although protocols of treatment have been established in ANCA positive capillaritis with pulse steroids and cyclophosphamide, the optimal medications to use for medium vessel vasculitis remains unclear. Pulmonary vasculitis is a known cause of pulmonary hypertension, but in her case, was likely multifactorial with her underlying BPD and pulmonary vein stenosis. Her unusual chest CT guided the need for lung biopsy, which was key to confirm the diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is an inflammatory chronic lung disease with major morbidity for premature infants. We previously demonstrated immunomodulatory roles for monocytes in tracheal aspirates from premature infants in the neonatal period. Cross-talk between pulmonary epithelial cells and innate immune cells in evolving BPD is not well understood. In this study, we characterized the transcriptome of pulmonary epithelial cells from patients at risk for BPD. Method(s): Tracheal aspirates were prospectively collected from intubated premature infants born at less than 29 weeks gestation and hospitalized at the UWNICU. Samples were collected at day of life (DOL) 0-3 (N=2), 7-10 (N=5), 14-17 (N=3), and 28-31 (N=7). BPD was defined as oxygen dependence on DOL 28 and classified as mild, moderate, or severe at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). CD45-EPCAM+epithelial cells were isolated by FACS for RNASeq analyses. Data analysis was performed with R, using Limma and edgeR packages. Noncoding genes and genes with counts <1 were excluded. Gene Enrichment analyses were performed with Enrichr. In parallel, submerged primary epithelial cell cultures were established from unprocessed tracheal aspirates using selective PneumaCult-EX media. Result(s): 16 samples were analyzed from 9 patients for RNASeq with 1000 CD45-EPCAM+epithelial cells per sample. EPCAM and Vimentin mRNA were highly expressed in these samples. 414 differentially expressed genes were identified between the first and second timepoints. Between DOL 0-3 and 28-31, expression of the IL-33 receptor ST2 decreased by 65-fold, and expression of IL-20RA and IL-13 RA2 increased by 271-fold and 88-fold, respectively. In addition to differences in cytokine signaling, we identified decreases in epithelial structural gene expression including DSG3 (135-fold), COL5A1 (146-fold), KRT6A (59-fold), and KRT14 (22-fold). Two GOBP processes implicated in comparisons of DOL 0-3 and 28-31 samples are cilium movement (p=4.74x10-9, q=8.65x10-6) and cilium assembly (p=1.03x10-5, q=6.29x10-3). In primary epithelial cultures from the tracheal aspirates, nearly 100% of cells were positive for EPCAM, and approximately 30% co-expressed vimentin. All study patients were diagnosed with moderate to severe BPD at 36 weeks PMA. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization and establishment of primary epithelial cell cultures from human premature infants at risk for BPD. We identified several immunomodulatory (IL-33, IL-13, IL-20), structural (KRT6A, KRT14, COL5A1, DSG3), and functional (cilia) pathways of interest with changes in mRNA expression over the first month of life. Future studies will include epithelial-monocyte coculture experiments to study paracrine signaling in premature infants at risk for BPD. (Figure Preseted) .

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants, but mechanisms causing alveolar simplification are not well understood. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-17~92 expression is severely attenuated in human patients who died from BPD and confirmed this in a murine disease model. Global deletion of miR-17-92 results in fatal neonatal respiratory failure from alveolar epithelial hypoplasia. We have previously presented that partial miR-17~92 deletion, or "haploinsufficiency" (HI), causes neonatal alveolar simplification reminiscent of that seen in BPD models; however, the effect of HI on pulmonary and cardiovascular function during murine aging has not been characterized. Rationale: We hypothesize that miR-17~92 HI causes decreased pulmonary function and pulmonary hypertension reminiscent of a BPD-like phenotype without oxygen exposure. Method(s): miR-17~92flox/flox and Tg-Sox2Cremice were mated to produce HI (Tg-Sox2Cre/miR-17-92+/flox ) and control (C: miR-17-92+/flox ) offspring. Using H&E stained slides, analyses for alveolar count and area were performed using ImageQuant Pro (n=3- 6/group). Pulmonary resistance, elastance and compliance were measured by FlexiVent (n=6- 9/group). Right Ventricular Systolic Pressure (RVSP), measured by Millar, assessed cardiovascular function (n=2-4/group). Markers for alveolar type 1 (Hopx) and type 2 (Sftpc) epithelial cells were quantified using Western blot (n=8/group). Data analyzed by one- and twoway ANOVA or unpaired t-test where appropriate. Significance noted at p<0.05. Result(s): Alveolar counts were significantly less in HI vs C at P28 (52.9 vs 77.1) and P56 (43.3 vs 73.8). Alveolar area was enlarged in HI vs C at P28 (1103.1 vs 943.2 mum2) and P56 (1102.7 vs 839.5 mum2). At P28, pulmonary resistance was increased in HI (0.797 vs C:0.326 cmH20.s/mL) but compliance and elastance did not differ. RVSP is increased in HI vs C at P28 (17.6 vs 12.6 mmHg) and P56 (23.8 vs 15.9 mmHg). Hopx was similar between HI and C (2.30 and 1.49) at P14 and increased in C at P28 (4.24); this increase did not occur in HI (2.96). Sftpc was increased in P14-HI (2.35) compared to P14-C (1.34), P28-C (1.43) and P28-HI (1.50). Conclusion(s): Our data reveals that miR-17~92 HI causes persistent alveolar simplification correlating with increased pulmonary resistance and developmental deficits in alveolar type 1 epithelial cells. Increased RVSP is consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The above constellation of characteristics are seen in traditional oxygen induced BPD models; this HI mo Del provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the biologic impact of miR-17~92 on alveolar and vascular simplification without oxygen as a confounder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute chorioamnionitis contributes to premature birth, and is associated with postbirth complications. How chorioamnionitis impacts neonate's developing immune system has not been well defined., METHODS: Blood from extremely preterm infants (<=28 wk gestation) was drawn at the first, second, and fourth week of life. Blood was either left unstimulated or stimulated for 4 h with PMA/ionomycin. mRNA expression of transcription factors in unstimulated cells (RORC, TBET, GATA3, and Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3)) and inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6) in unstimulated and stimulated cells were analyzed. Data were analyzed based on the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, funisitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., RESULTS: At 1 wk of life, exposure to funisitis, but not maternal chorioamnionitis was associated with an increased expression of RORC and RORC/FOXP3 ratio. These increases in RORC and RORC/FOXP3 ratio were sustained over the 4 wk of follow-up. Leukocytes from infants who developed BPD had increased stimulated and unstimulated IL-4 at the first week of life, but these increases were not sustained over time. In contrast, infants with mild BPD had a sustained decrease in stimulated IL-2., CONCLUSION: Chorioamnionitis exposure, in particular to funisitis, lead to enhanced Th17-like responses that persist for 4 wk after birth. Infants who later developed BPD did not exhibit a strikingly distinct immune profile.

AB  - Rationale: Preterm infants often require oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation, ultimately leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is typically characterized by failed alveolar formation and perturbed matrix remodeling. Prior studies from our group showed that Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor important in cell homeostasis is reduced in lungs of newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia. Moreover, Forkhead-Box-Protein O1 (FoxO1) has recently been shown to regulate matrix remodelling. Since alveolar myofibroblasts are crucial during alveolarization and fibrotic processes, we hypothesized that reduced alveolar formation after hyperoxia is mechanistically linked to dysregulated Klf4 and FoxO1 signaling in lung fibroblasts. Method(s): (1) Newborn C57Bl/6N mice were exposed to 85% O2 (hyperoxia) or 21% O2 (normoxia) until postnatal day 28 (P28). (2) Primary neonatal murine lung fibroblasts (pnF) were isolated and exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia for up to 48 hours. Overexpression (OE) and knockdown of Klf4 (del) in cultured fibroblast were achieved by doxycycline-inducible sleeping beauty transposon system and siRNA technique, respectively. Viability, proliferation and apoptosis (MTT, BrdU and Caspase3 assay), migration (Boyden chamber assay) and gene expression of pnF and MEFs were assessed. Result(s): (1) Hyperoxia reduced Klf4 mRNA and protein expression in lungs of newborn mice at P28. Gene expression of TGFbeta, PAI-1 (TGFbeta target gene) and alphaSMA protein (a marker of myofibroblasts) were higher in lungs after hyperoxia. Moreover, Klf4 was co-localized with alphaSMA-positive cells using immunofluorescence staining. (2) Exposure to TGFbeta reduces Klf4 expression; hyperoxia and Klf4del blocks migration, and Klf4del induces proliferation and apoptosis of pnF. Additionally, loss of Klf4 increased mRNA expression of matrix markers (CTGF, collagen Ialpha1 & IValpha1) and PDGFRalpha as an indicator of myofibroblasts. Conversely, Klf4OE increases adhesion, viability, and expression of elastin, whereas proliferation and migration are reduced in fibroblasts. These effects of Klf4OE abrogate in part hyperoxia-induced changes in fibroblasts. (3) Klf4del induced expression FoxO1 mRNA and influence FoxO1 target genes (FASLG, CAT, CyclinB1) as well as cytoplasmatic sequestration; conversely, Klf4OE blocked translocation of FoxO1 to the cytoplasm and enhance nuclear localization in MEFs. Conclusion(s): Our study does not only demonstrate a novel functional role of Klf4 in fibroblast activation and fibrotic processes after hyperoxia, but it also identifies a new Klf4-FoxO1 axis as a novel regulator of neonatal lung fibroblast homeostasis, suggesting Klf4 as a new therapeutical target in hyperoxia-induced lung injury.

AB  - RATIONALE: Alveolar formation, a postnatal process, is the most important and the least understood phase of lung development. Arrested alveogenesis is a prominent feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a neonatal chronic lung disease, while destruction of alveoli in adults is characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). PDGFA signaling has been shown to be critical for alveogenesis in mouse. However, its specific postnatal role in secondary crest myofibroblast (SCMFs) during alveogenesis remains to be determined. METHOD(S): We conditionally inactivated Pdgfra at the onset of postnatal alveolar development in SCMFs of Gli1creERT2;Pdgfra;mTmG mice. Impact of Pdgfra deficiency on alveogenesis was determined by histology, immunofluorescent staining, quantitative PCR, and RNAseq analyses. The role of PDGFRa was further studied in vitro with fibroblasts isolated from PN5 neonatal lungs. RESULT(S): Postnatal lack of Pdgfra profoundly arrested alveolar formation resulting in a phenotype characteristic of human BPD. Unlike germline mutations of Pdgfra, there was no change in cellular proliferation nor apoptosis. Similarly, there was no significant alteration in differentiation of lung mesodermal or alveolar epithelial cells. Transcriptome of isolated SCMFs identified a total of 1808 differentially expressed genes, including transcription factors and signaling molecules as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Elastin mRNA was moderately reduced, but its distribution was clearly abnormal. Lack of Pdgfra disrupted expression of Loxl1, Loxl4, Fbn2, and Fbln5, all members of the elastogenic gene cluster. In addition, expression of Egf and Tgfb1 was altered in the mutant SCMFs. Results consistent with these findings were also found in human postmortem BPD lung tissue. In vitro, blocking PDGFA signaling decreased elastogenic gene expression associated with increased Egf and decreased Tgfb mRNAs. This effect was reversible by inhibiting EGF or activating TGFbeta signaling. CONCLUSION(S): These observations illustrate the mechanisms by which postnatal PDGFA/PDGFRa during alveolar formation controls a battery of elastogenic genes via a secondary tier of signaling networks, composed of EGF and TGFbeta pathways.

AB  - Respiratory failure in the newborn constitutes a diagnostic challenge after established bronchopulmonary dysplasia criteria. In entities that diffusely compromise the pulmonary parenchyma such as interstitial diseases of childhood, the challenge is even greater. We present the case of a preterm newborn with pulmonary disease due to ABCA 3 deficiency. A 45 days old male patient, with a history of pre-term birth from a multiple biamniotico bicorionic gestation. Born at 36.5 weeks. He presented with chronic ventilatory failure with multiple unsuccessful extubation attempts. At birth. a dose of exogenous surfactant was administered, he was weened of the ventilator but shortly after develops pneumothorax requiring reintubation and high frequency ventilation, with improvement of the clinical state. A second extubation attempt was preformed 8 days later, however, this failed due to significant respiratory deterioration, requiring ventilatorY and inotropic support. Studies are carried out for late neonatal sepsis, with isolation of Staphylococcus aureus, for which specific management was administered. Three additional doses of surfactant were administered, showing no improvement in respiratory status. Do to torpid evolution he was sent to our institution for further work up. Upon admission studies for sepsis, immunodeficiency, cmv infection were done all of which were negative. He was seen by the pediatric pulmonology service upon admission. Radiologically one was able to see mixed opacities on all four quadrants. A chest CT is performed where extensive parenchymal involvement was evident, just as seen on initial chest X ray studies. Additionally, wall thickening of the interlobular septa and ground glass. With all of the above a pulmonary biopsy was performed. Histopathological study of lung tissue showed: A. Thickening of the pulmonary interstitium with hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes and desquamation in the alveolar lumen. B. Morphological abnormality of the lamellar bodies with dense accumulations inside "fried egg image". Findings suggesting ABCA 3 transporter mutation The ABCA 3 deficiency is usually diagnosed in the neonatal period with severe and fatal pulmonary disease at presentation. In the chronic form it manifests during the first year of life with extensive pulmonary involvement. It is produced by mutations in the gene that codes for ABCA 3 and produces alteration in the transport of lipids in lamellar bodies with an altered or absent production of pulmonary surfactant, which is related to its clinical presentation. For this reason, the study of the lamellar bodies in lung biopsy of these patients is essential to establish the diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a severe chronic lung disease of prematurity which is marked by neutrophilic inflammation, alveolar hypoplasia, ECM degradation and pulmonary hypertension. We have previously demonstrated that exosomes are implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD (JCI Insight, 2018, PMID: 29515035). OBJECTIVE(S): To demonstrate that exosomes released from activated neutrophils (PMNs) act as pathogenic entities in BPD. METHOD(S): 1. Human (n=50 patients): Tracheal aspirates from infants with severe BPD were compared to those from gestation matched non diseased control infants for PMN exosome proportion (CD66b+). Neutrophil elastase (NE) content and collagen breakdown product (Ac-PGP) was analyzed in severe BPD (n=25) vs control infant (n=25) tracheal aspirates. 2. In vitro: PMNs were activated by exposure to hyperoxia and bacterial formulated peptide (fMLP) or LPS for and were compared to quiescent/normoxia controls. Exosomal NE was determined by ELISA. 3. In vivo: Activated vs quiesent PMNs were administered to neonatal WT C57BL6 mice intranasally from PN 3-14, every 72 hours with and without hyperoxia. Lung morphometry (radial alveolar counts), pulmonary functions (flexivent), assessment of pulmonary hypertension (fultons index) were conducted at PN14. BALF was collected at PN 14 and assessed for markers of collagen breakdown (Ac-PGP by MS) and cytokines by multiplex. General methods: Exosomes were extracted by ultracentrifugation of exosome containing PMN supernate or tracheal aspirates as published before. Purity, size and concentration of all preparations were determined by Nanosight NS300 (Malvern). Ac-PGP analyzed by mass spectrometry. RESULT(S): Infants with severe BPD had increased PMN exosomes, NE and Ac-PGP in their tracheal aspirates, as compared to control infants. Activated PMN exosomes expressed increased NE compared to quiescent exosomes. Activated PMN exosomes, when administered to normoxia mice lead to BPD phenotype marked by alveolar hypoplasia (RAC), increased RVH (fultons index) and increased pulmonary resistance. Activated PMN exosomes worsened and exaggerated the BPD phenotype in hyperoxia exposed mice. Diseased mice lung bronchoalveoar lavage showed increased NE and increased collagen degradation product Ac-PGP. Statistical significance was determined by p value less than 0.05 for all experiments. CONCLUSION(S): Bacterial products and hyperoxia activate PMNs to release PMN exosomes. Exosomes from activated PMN carry increased NE and cause BPD like phenotype and ECM degradation in vivo. These findings reveal a potent mechanism for PMN exosome mediated proteolytic lung damage in BPD which may lead to future therapeutics development.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious pulmonary condition associated with premature birth. Underlying lung disease in neonatal BPD has recently been described by reader-based scoring of pulmonary MRI to classify parenchymal features and predict short-term outcomes. While manual scoring has some degree of subjectivity, ultrashort-echo-time (UTE) MRI yields CT-like densities and so can be used to objectively quantify parenchymal abnormalities, without requiring ionizing radiation or anesthesia/sedation. We quantitatively assess lung-density distributions of neonatal BPD using UTE MRI and compare with clinical severity and reader-based scoring. Method(s): 55 neonates with and without NICHD-defined BPD (31 severe, 9 moderate, 7 mild, 8 non-BPD controls) underwent quiet-breathing pulmonary UTE MRI (3D-resolution=0.7mm) in a NICU-sited 1.5T scanner (post-menstrual-age at MRI=40+/-3 weeks), with no sedation ordered for MRI. Parenchymal abnormalities on MRI were scored by two radiologists using modified Ochiai-score categories (range 0-2: hyperexpansion; emphysema [region number/size]; fibrous/interstitial opacities; subjective impression). Lungdensity distributions were generated from whole-lung segmentations of UTE images. Image intensities were normalized to muscle to yield volumetric-density (air-to-muscle, ~0-1 g/cm3). Hyperinflation (ratio of total-lung-volume [TLV] to body-surface-area [BSA]) and percent-TLV in six density bins (ranges [g/cm3]: Bin1~0-0.2, Bin2~0.2-0.4, Bin3~0.4-0.6, Bin4~0.6-0.8, Bin5~0.8-1, Bin6>1) were calculated and compared with mean scores from corresponding categories. Result(s): Individual density distributions varied widely among BPD patients, compared to Gaussian distributions in control patients centered at 0.51+/-0.15 g/cm3 (expected for normal neonatal lung tissue). Prominent low-density and/or high-density regions were obvious in the histograms of severe patients (Figure). Combined high-density and low-density volume (percent-TLV in Bin1+Bin5+Bin6) significantly differentiated patients with severe BPD from non-BPD (P<0.00001), mild BPD (P=0.002), and moderate BPD patients (P=0.013). Hyperinflation separated hyperexpansion scores of 0 or 2 (P<0.001). High-density volume (percent-TLV in Bin5+Bin6) separated fibrous/interstitial opacities scores of 0 or 2 (P<0.001). Low-density volume (percent-TLV in Bin1) did not separate emphysema scores (number/size/combined), potentially due to low visual contrast between low-density and normal-density tissue. Combined highdensity and low-density volume (percent-TLV in Bin1+Bin5+Bin6) separated subjective impression scores of 0, 1, or 2 (0 and 1, P=0.004; 1 and 2, P=0.016; 0 and 2, P<0.001). Conclusion(s): Pulmonary UTE MRI can objectively quantify parenchymal density abnormalities in neonates with BPD, without ionizing radiation or anesthesia/sedation; quantification compares well to reader scoring. Serial quantitative MRI assessments may be used in the future to evaluate efficacy of individualized treatments, yielding personalized clinical care in preterm infants at increased risk for severe respiratory disease trajectories.

AB  - Introduction: Spirometry is currently the most commonly performed clinical test of respiratory function. It has limited use in young children, in individuals with developmental delay and can be insensitive to early respiratory impairments. Oscillometry is an alternative technique that requires only passive tidal breathing and cooperation on the part of the patient and offers sensitive and detailed information about lung function. Oscillometry makes use of an externally applied pressure/flow or acoustic wave signals and their consequent effects on airway pressures and flows to provide a measure of respiratory system impedance which in turn may be resolved into resistance and reactance. Four oscillometry devices are commonly used clinically: the Jaeger MasterScreen IOS; the Quark i2m; the Resmon Pro and the TremoFlo C-100. While the underlying physical principles behind these devices are the same, the specifics of how the pressure waves are generated differ between devices. This may cause systematic differences in the results between devices. This study aims to compare device outputs in 30 pediatric patients and quantify the extent to which oscillometry results differ between devices. Method(s): Three groups will be compared: healthy control subjects, asthmatic patients and patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Participants will be between the ages of 5 and 18 years of age. Each patient will be assessed on the four oscillometry devices in random order followed by spirometry. The parameters of interest are: (1) low frequency resistance (R5), (2) frequency dependence of resistance (R5-20), (3) low frequency reactance (X5), (4) resonance frequency (Fres) and (5) integrated area of low frequency reactance (AX). Result(s): The first control subject demonstrated wide variability in results between devices. For some measures, certain devices were similar, but not for other measures. For R5 (cm H2O/(L/s)), MasterScreen IOS: 2.07, Quark i2m: 1.40, Resmon Pro: 1.17, TremoFlo c-100: 1.39. Conclusion(s): Preliminary results suggest wide variability between the devices even in healthy subjects. Further collection of data from both healthy children and those with asthma or bronchopulmonary dysplasia is ongoing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Premature infants are often given supplemental O2 with/without ventilatory support (increasingly nasal CPAP) to aid in maintenance of oxygenation and ventilation. While mechanical ventilation has historically increased the likelihood of developing airway diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma with associated airway hyperreactivity (AHR), it is unknown if CPAP has adverse effects on developing lungs and promote AHR. There is increasing interest in the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as hyaluronan in adult lung diseases. In the present study, we explored the effects of stretch on hyaluronan production in developing human airway cells (specifically smooth muscle) and the effects of low molecular weight hyaluronan (HALMW) vs. high molecular weight hyaluronan (HAHMW) on ASM contractility and proliferation, with the hypothesis that HALMW is increased by stretch, with detrimental consequences Methods & Results: Treatments with 1 mu M HALMW (151 - 300 kDa) or 1 mu M HAHMW (1.01 - 1.8 MDa) were performed on serum starved human fetal airway smooth muscle (fASM) cells derived from tracheobronchial tissues of 18-22 week gestation fetuses (a period of rapid airway growth and proximate to survival age in prematurity; Mayo IRB approved protocol). Additionally, fASM cells were subjected to cyclic mechanical forces to simulate breathing (5% oscillatory stretch) or CPAP (5% static with 5% oscillatory stretch) using a Flexcell FX-5000 tension system. Cells with cyclic stretch showed an increase in CD44 mRNA and protein. At 24 h, an increase in hyaluronan synthase (HAS) 2 and 3 was observed in cells treated using cyclic stretch compared to non-stretched cells: an effect not observed in CPAP-treated cells. Similarly, an increase in hyaluronidase (HYAL) 2 was observed in cyclically stretched cells, but not in the CPAP counterpart. As a functional assessment, treated cells were loaded with fura 2-AM and intracellular [Ca2+] was measured in response to histamine. Cyclically stretched cells showed reduced intracellular [Ca2+] responses. Cells treated with HALMW exhibited an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] response. Conclusion(s): In developing airways, stretch leads to upregulation of hyaluronan synthesis through an increase in Has 2 and 3. Along with increased degradation, as a result of an upregulation of Hyal 2, this may cause a buildup of HALMW with downstream effects on enhanced [Ca2+]i Thus, reducing HALMW may represent a novel approach to blunting the detrimental effects of stretch in developing airways.

AB  - Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is a disorder characterized by a peculiar facial appearance, heart anomalies, and intellectual disability. The heart defects are pulmonic stenosis, atrial septal defect, and hypertrophic cardiomyo-pathy. Sparse and friable hair, hyperkeratotic skin lesions, and a generalized ichthyosis-like condition could be also present. Most cases are sporadic although autosomal dominant transmission has been reported. In the present study we describe a patient with a BRAF gene mutation (NM-004333.4:c.770 A > G, p.Gln257Arg) detected through whole exome sequencing and clinical manifestations of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. Patient also presented microcephaly, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and esophageal atresia, clinical data not previously reported. In conclusion, we describe a Mexican patient with cardiofa-ciocutaneous syndrome and a mutation in the BRAF gene; however, our family has clinical data not previously observed in these patients, representing an expanded phenotype.

AB  - Background Ureaplasma spp. are known to reside in the urogenital tract in adults and newborn children. In most cases, Ureaplasma spp. colonization is not harmful to the host. However, Ureaplasma spp. are also known to be involved in non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in adults and may also be connected to infertility. In pregnant women, there is speculation that Ureaplasma spp. may cause complications in pregnancy and lead to preterm labor. In preterm newborns Ureaplasma spp. colonization is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. As azithromycin is first choice treatment either in adult as well as in newborn infections resistance to macrolides affects successful therapy. However, little is known about the susceptibility of Ureaplasma spp. In this study we assessed the prevalence of genital Ureaplasma spp. colonization and the prevalence of resistance associated mutations to macrolides. Methods Genital samples of 512 women visiting our Dutch STI clinic who were routinely screened for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) were retrospectively tested with Ureaplasma spp. PCR (Amplisens). Of these patients 13% (66/512) were positive for CT and 1% (5/512) for NG. Forty five Ureaplasma positive samples were selected to determine mutations that could confer macrolide resistance by sequencing domain V of the 23S RNA gene. Results In total 78%(401/512) samples were positive for Ureaplasma spp. Prevalence of Ureaplasma spp. was significantly higher (p<0.05) among the CT positive samples 88%(58/66) and the NG positive samples 80%(4/5). None of the 45 samples contained mutations associated with macrolide resistance. Conclusion We found a higher prevalence of Ureaplasma spp. in a female patient cohort visiting an STI clinic compared to other studies. However, no resistance associated mutations to macrolides were detected. Higher prevalence of Ureaplasma spp. in STI positive samples underscores its sexually transmitting potential. .

AB  - Since the introduction of thoracoscopy in pediatric surgery, the classic surgical technique for esophageal atresia (EA) was adapted, resulting in less postoperative pain and superior cosmetic result. We evaluate the outcomes and the quality of life (QOL) of patients with EA under procedures with minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Method(s): All cases from a single general institution which underwent MIS over a 6 year period were reviewed. Operative details and complications were examined. PedsQL TM (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) was applied to the patients parents. Result(s): 14 patients were included. 13 of them had a distal fistula and 1 was without fistula. In 11 patients fistula ligation and primary esophageal anastomosis was performed, in 1, due the low weight (900 g) and the severe condition of the patient, only a fistula ligation and gastrostomy was performed. The 2 patients with a long gap (the first with distal fistula and the second without fistula) were managed with initial pouch alignment with thoracoscopic stich and a delayed esophageal anastomosis. The mean gestational age was 35 weeks (28-41), birth weight 2459 grams (900-4015). Only 4 of them had antenatal diagnosis. Regarding the morbidity, 6 had VACTER Association, 2 had central nervous system malformations, 2 had any trisomy (Down syndrome, Edwards Syndrome) and 1 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The mean operative time was 2,7 hours (2-4) and all of the patients used a pleural tube. They were fed after 12 days (4-29). No cases required conversion. In this series, only the patient with Edward Syndrome passed away. In the early outcomes, 1 patient required a reoperation, due an anastomotic leak. 3 developed pneumothorax and 2 chylothorax, and needed management under thoracic tube. In the medium and long outcomes, 7 patients developed stenosis and required endoscopic dilatations (mean 4, 1 up to 12). In 2 patients Nissen procedure was performed. One of them had an Hiatal Hernia and the other had gastroesophageal reflux. The patients have been followed from 1 year up to 6 years. They were contacted and 57% reported no troubles with feeding by mouth, 29% some difficulties and in 2 patients (Down Syndrome and broncopulmonary dysplasia) were being fed by gastrostomy tube. Regarding the quality of life measure, the mean score for PedsQL TM was 76 (PedsQLTM Score 0-100; where higher score indicates better quality of life). The lowest score (17) belongs to a patient with a severe pulmonary dysplasia, who requires permanent ventilation support. Conclusion(s): The thoracoscopic approach is a safe alternative in patients with EA, with excellent exposure and visibility of anatomic landmarks and little associated morbidity. This group has a good QOL, except for the patient who has an associated condition. In this case the QOL is influenced by the patient's morbidity. Further collaborative studies are needed to know if the surgical aproach has any influence on the QOL of the patients with this condition.

AB  - AIM: To assess the contemporary maternal and neonatal outcomes following expectant management of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) prior to 24 weeks' gestation and to identify prognostic indicators of this morbid presentation., METHODS: We performed a systematic review in the Pubmed and EMBASE databases to identify the primary (perinatal mortality, severe neonatal morbidity and serious maternal morbidity) and secondary (neonatal survival and morbidity) outcomes following expectant management of previable PPROM., RESULTS: Mean latency between PPROM and delivery ranged between 20 and 43 days. Women with PPROM <24 weeks had an overall live birth rate of 63.6% and a survival-to-discharge rate of 44.9%. The common neonatal morbidities were respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and sepsis. The majority of neonatal deaths within 24 h post birth were associated with pulmonary hypoplasia, severe intraventricular haemorrhage and neonatal sepsis. The common maternal outcomes were chorioamnionitis and caesarean sections. The major predictors of neonatal survival were later gestational age at PPROM, adequate residual amniotic fluid levels, C-reactive protein <1 mg/dL within 24 h of admission and PPROM after invasive procedures., CONCLUSION: Pregnancy latency and neonatal survival following previable PPROM has improved in recent years, although neonatal morbidity remains unchanged despite recent advances in obstetric and neonatal care. There is heterogeneity in management practices across centres worldwide.

AB  - Background: Heparin resistance can be very challenging to manage especially in the presence of critical illness and acute VTE. Heparin resistance is defined as the situation where patients require large doses of heparin to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. Heparin resistance can be explained by several mechanisms these include low antithrombin III (ATIII) levels, increased heparin clearance levels, high levels of factor VIII and/or fibrinogen and elevations in the levels of heparin-binding proteins (CHEST 2012). ATIII deficiency is the most common cause of heparin resistance. The condition can be congenital and or acquired. Other clinically relevant conditions that can present with heparin resistance are the use of high doses of heparin during extracorporeal circulation, use of asparaginase therapy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, most of these conditions effect the ATIII levels (Durrani J, et al. Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives 2018). Several cases of heparin resistance in the presence of ATIII deficiency have been published in the literature however, all of the case reports were with the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH). To our knowledge, there have been no cases published that describe the approach to overcoming heparin resistance in patients treated with the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Also, there is very limited evidence on the maximum dose of enoxaparin for pediatric patients. Objective(s): We report a case to identify a strategy for therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with a heparin resistance due to antithrombin deficiency Methods: Chart review. Result(s): Patient is a 4-month-old male delivered at 28 weeks gestation. He has been in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) since birth and has had a complicated history of pulmonary hypertension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis. Patient developed a PICC line associated DVT in the left axillary and left subclavian veins and was started on enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg q12 h for the duration of at least 6 weeks. Anti-Xa was checked 4 hours after 3rd dose and it was subtherapeutic at 0.15 (target range 0.5-1). Subsequently, the dose of enoxaparin was increased to 1.8 mg/kg q12 h. Anti-Xa was repeated and it remained subtherapeutic at 0.23. The dose of enoxaparin was further increased to 2 mg/kg however, anti-Xa remained subtherapeutic at 0.19. Despite escalating doses of LMWH, we were unable to reach therapeutic anticoagulation and the target anti-Xa levels. Antithrombin deficiency was suspected and ATIII level was ordered. ATIII was below the normal range at 35%. Enoxaparin dose was increased again to 2.5 mg/kg and the subsequent anti-Xa was on the lower end of the therapeutic range at 0.51. Several days after anti-Xa was re-checked and it was again subtherapeutic at 0.35. The enoxaparin dose was increased to 3 mg/kg. Anti-Xa was repeated and it was within the therapeutic range at 0.53. Patient remained on this dose and anti-Xa levels were checked every 48 hrs, and they have been within the therapeutic range. Conclusion(s): We described a complicated case of acute DVT in a patient with a heparin resistance secondary to ATIII deficiency. Identification of heparin resistance can present a challenge for hematologists and other practitioners especially when managing patients with an acute VTE. There is no guideline recommendation for the anticoagulation strategy in this situation. Our approach was to gradually increase the dose of LMWH while monitoring anti-Xa levels closely. Prompt recognition of heparin resistance led to a good outcome in our patient.

AB  - Introduction: Recurrent and persistent pneumonia is one of the common reasons for referral and continues to be a major challenge. There are limited data on underlying causes of persistence or recurrence of pneumonia in children. This study aimed to ascertain the etiology and clinical profile of recurrent and persistent pneumonia in tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka city. Method(s): A descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in admitted recurrent and persistent pneumonia patients in tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka City during June 2015 to May 2016. Among the enrolled population, 100 recurrent and persistent pneumonia patients were finally studied and analyzed after completing the inclusion criteria. Recurrent pneumonia was defined as 2 or more episodes of pneumonia in a single year or 3 or more episodes ever, with radiographic clearing between occurrences. Persistent pneumonia was defined as features of lower respiratory tract infection with radiological evidence of infiltrates or consolidation in lungs persisting for 30 days or more, despite receiving antibiotics for minimum 10 days. The following investigations such as CXR, CBC with film, TB screening, CRP, blood culture, USG of chest, HRCT, bronchoscopy, contrast swallow of esophagus in T position, stool for fecal fat, sweat chloride test, serum IgG, IgA, IgM level, T-cell, B- cell marker, echocardiography, pleural fluid study, X-ray PNS, saccharine test were performed according to cases. Patients were followed-up regularly. Result(s): Among 100 cases, 66 were male and 34 female, ages ranging from 2 months to 14 years with a mean age of 3.92 +/- 3.75 years. Seventy-six (76%) were recurrent pneumonia and 24 (24%) were persistent pneumonia. Etiology of recurrent and persistent pneumonia was determined in 83 cases. The most common causes of recurrent pneumonia were recurrent aspiration (21%: GIT aspiration -18.4% and foreign body aspiration - 2.6%), cystic fibrosis (19.7%), pulmonary tuberculosis (7.9%), congenital heart disease (6.6%) and immunodeficiency (3%). The most common causes of persistent pneumonia were recurrent aspiration (37.5%: GIT aspiration - 20.8% and foreign body aspiration - 16.7%), pulmonary tuberculosis (12.5%), congenital cystic adenomatous malformation of the lung (4.2%), interstitial lung disease (4.2%) and cystic fibrosis (4.2%). Less common causes were immunodeficiency, cerebral palsy, spinal muscular atrophy, Down syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BOOP, bronchial asthma. Conclusion(s): Aspiration pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, congenital heart disease and immunodeficiency, congenital cystic adenomatous malformation of the lung and interstitial lung disease are common causes of recurrent and persistent pneumonia.

AB  - Background: Lung transplantation is the final treatment modality for end-stage lung disease and the survival rate has recently improved. Korea is a latecomer in lung transplantation, but the number of cases is gradually increasing since the first lung transplantation in a child was performed in 2011. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes and survival rate of children between the ages of 0 and 18 years who received a lung transplant at the Asan Medical Center between August 2011 and December 2018. A total of 14 children underwent lung transplantation. Result(s): The mean age of the lung transplant recipients was 11.1+/-5.2 years (1.7-18.6 years), and 7 were male and 7 were female among the 14 children. Nine children underwent bilateral whole lung transplantation, 4 underwent bilateral lobar lung transplantation, 1 underwent right lobar lung and left whole lung transplantation, and there was one patient who received heart-lung transplantation. The reasons for lung transplantation were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (5 of 14 patients, 35.7%), chemotherapy induced lung injury (2 of 14, 22.0%), cystic fibrosis (2 of 14, 14.3%), primary pulmonary hypertension (1 of 14, 7.1%), interstitial lung disease after HSCT (1 of 14, 7.1%), lung injury induced by humidifier disinfectant (1 of 14, 7.1%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (1 of 14, 7.1%), and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (1 of 14, 7.1%). Most patients received intensive care (9 of 14, 64.3%) including extracorporeal life support (6 of 14, 42.9%) before lung transplantation. Among the 14 children, only 2 patients died (14.3%), 1 patient died of fungal infection and 1 patient died of postoperative bleeding. The mean observation period was 2.0+/-2.4 years. The one-year survival rate was 87.5% (7/8). Among the complications after lung transplantation, there were 3 cases of changing the immunosuppressants due to adverse drug reactions, and 2 cases of diaphragm palsy. In addition, polyneuropathy, fungal infection, postoperative bleeding, right pulmonary vein stenosis and sepsis each occurred in one case. Conclusion(s): In Korea, pulmonary complication after HSCT was the main cause of lung transplantation, unlike other countries. Although the follow-up period is not sufficient to evaluate late outcome of lung transplantation, early outcome of lung transplantation in Korea was comparable to the results from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. Lung transplantation can be an accepted treatment option for end stage lung disease in Korean children.

AB  - Preterm birth: Recent data suggest preterm birth is on the rise, worldwide. Some long-term birth cohorts from Brazil point in this direction and the consequences on children' respiratory health outcomes are quite significant.1 Recent studies estimate that 11.3-13.8% of births are premature.1 Considering that there are 2.7 million births per year in Brazil, it can be estimated that over 70,000 preemies are born below 32 weeks of gestation, with 25,000 under 28 weeks. These are significant numbers that should impact gravely on any health system. Large advances in the management of premature infants, such as prenatal use of systemic corticosteroids, availability of surfactants, and less aggressive ventilatory support have provided significant result improvements in the infants' lung function. However, these newborns are exposed to the extrauterine environment very early in the saccular phase of lung development.2 Even with minimally invasive ventilation techniques, there remain negative consequences in the subsequent growth of the airways and the vascular bed of the lungs.3 These negative functional consequences mainly include a variable obstructive spirometric pattern and gas exchange surface reduction (by lung diffusion capacity testing, DLCO), resulting in increased respiratory morbidity, increased ventilatory vulnerability to viral infections, and limitation of physical exercise. Lung Development: Premature birth significantly affects the normal lung development process, particularly in the alveolar stage, favoring a pulmonary structure with larger and smaller alveoli and a reduction in the number of pulmonary microcapillaries.4 Consequently, there is a reduction in alveolar surface available for gas exchange. Another consequence of this "rarefication" of the pulmonary parenchyma is the reduction in the elastic recoil of the lung, which is the main force that gives support to the small airways. The reduction in elastic recoil favors airway collapse during expiration, similar to what is observed in adults with pulmonary emphysema; this leads to reduction in expiratory flows, air trapping, and increase in functional residual capacity. These changes appear clinically and radiologically as pulmonary hyperinflation; clinically there is poor response to treatment with bronchodilators.4 Long-term outcome: In adolescents and adults diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (DBP), the association of reduction of the airway exchange surface and reduction in expiratory flow will cause a significant decrease in respiratory reserve. This average reduction in cardiopulmonary capacity has not been uniformly documented; it can be completely asymptomatic in relatively sedentary individuals,5 but it can also be a limiting factor in the practice of competitive physical activities, which require, in addition to maximal alveolar ventilation, intense gas exchange The reduction in maximal expiratory flows is a common finding in premature infants, and it is detectable even in asymptomatic late premature infants.6 In extreme preterm infants, ventilatory obstruction is the most notable functional abnormality, observed from the first months of life to adulthood.7 This reduction in ventilatory reserve is the main cause of hospitalization in preterm infants in the first 2 years of life, generally precipitated by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections.8 The obstructive pattern is most pronounced in premature infants with a diagnosis of BPD: 83% of premature infants diagnosed with BPD will persist with significant spirometric abnormalities throughout a good part of the first decade of life. Clinical and functional data obtained at 11 years of age in preterm infants born less than 26 weeks of gestation (EPICure study) show that 26% had a diagnosis of asthma and 56% had obstructive changes in baseline spirometry.5 A review of spirometric studies in BPD survivors shows that ventricular abnormalities persist in most individuals, even in those who received surfactant at birth.2 A systematic review on the relation of pulmonary function with prematurity showed that functional deficits are proportional to prematurity, with an average percentage deficit in FEV1 of 7.2% and 19.9%, respectively, in premature infants with and without BPD.9 It is also important to mention that the mean deficits of pulmonary function in preterm infants have been declining in the last 30 years, most likely due to advances in perinatal care.9 Several studies have also shown an increase in the prevalence of bronchial hyperreactivity and bronchodilator response in children and adolescents born prematurely compared to full-term infants.5 The presence of partial or total reversibility of obstruction observed in pulmonary function tests supports the use of bronchodilators in preterm infants, especially if this spirometric reversibility is associated with improvement of respiratory symptoms and control of exacerbations. These patients are generally treated, both in adolescence and in adulthood, with antiasthma medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids for the prevention of recurrent wheezing. A clear benefit has not been definitively demonstrated and its use should be indicated with caution.10 Exhaled nitric oxide measurement (a marker of lower airway inflammation) is low in premature infants, suggesting that the predominant change is structural rather than inflammatory. Changes resulting from extreme prematurity prevent these subjects from reaching their peak pulmonary function, which usually occurs between 25 and 30 years of age and, therefore, functional decline begins at a lower level, increasing the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease later in life.2,9 Conclusion(s): Premature birth modifies the natural process of lung growth, and perinatal events and medical interventions can add further damage. With time, premature infants with no/minimal neonatal respiratory compromise should be quite healthy, with a trend towards normalization of pulmonary function over the years. However, for the most extreme preterm infants, structural changes are permanent, but outcomes are variable. Many will continue with chronic respiratory symptoms, recurrent wheezing, obstructive ventilation, and reduced cardiopulmonary capacity. The therapeutic options both to prevent further losses of lung capacity or recurrent significant respiratory events are quite limited. Asthma drugs are the only available options and they will work in only a fraction of these individuals. New research looking at novel options for treating these children differently than asthmatics is deemed necessary.

AB  - Objectives and Study: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is devastating disease which develops in neonates, especially in premature infants. Even though survival rate of prematurely born infant has been increased, mortality or complications caused by NEC has not been decreased. The pathogenesis has been unclear. The concentration of Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is higher in neonate than in adult, which was reported as a component of innate immune response in neonates. In the present study, whether MIF could be associated with gastrointestinal immunity in prematurely born neonates. Method(s): MIF concentration was measured by Enzyme-linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA) using sera of neonates within 10 days after birth. Statistical analyses were performed between MIF concentration and gestational age, prenatal factors, prematurity related diseases including feeding intolerance or NEC. The sera and its blinded clinical informations were obtained from Biobank of Korea. Result(s): Total 77 neonates were included between 2013 and 2017. Of them, 26 were born prematurely with less than 34 weeks of gestation. Serum MIF concentration was higher in neonates born < 34 than in neonates born >=34 weeks of gestation (4924.7+/-3953.9 vs 2766.5+/-2104.3 pg/mL, p=0.004). MIF concentrations according to delivery mode (vaginal delivery or Cesarian section), prenatal problems including prolonged rupture of membrane, placental insufficiency, and maternal diseases or feeding formula (breast milk or cow milk) were not statistically significantly different, respectively. Prematurely born neonates with suspected or confirmed NEC had higher MIF concentration than prematurely born neonates without NEC (N=9, 7074.9+/-4485.2 vs N=17, 3526.9+/-2419.7 pg/mL, p=0.045). MIF concentrations were not significantly different according to respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriousus, sepsis, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respectively. Conclusion(s): The high serum concentration of MIF in the early postnatal period of premature infants might be associated with development of NEC.

AB  - Background & Aim: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)have been safely and effectively used to treat lung and heart diseases. However, cell product variability and limited survival post transplantation has led to varying degrees of clinical success. Recent evidence suggest that exosomes rather than stem cell engraftment and differentiation mediate MSC regenerative effects. Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles that a play a key role in intercellular and interorgan communications. Therefore, exosome therapy has emerged as a new therapeutic alternative to MSCs. One of the challenges for the transition of exosomes from the bench to the bedside is the generation of high quantity GMP-compliant products. Thus, we aimed to develop a production methodology of Wharton's Jelly MSC (WJMSC)derived exosomes in a bioreactor and test the hypothesis that the exosome product would significantly reduce neonatal lung injury in a preclinical model of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia. Methods, Results & Conclusion(s): WJMSCs were isolated from Wharton's Jelly and expanded to passage 1. After harvest, 30 x 106 cells were loaded into the quantum bioreactor (Terumo BCT)and expanded for 1 week to achieve 4.05 x 108 cells. Serum-free aMEM conditioned media was collected every 24 hours for 96 hours for exosome precipitation by ultracentrifugation. NanoSight analysis of the final products revealed a production of 15.0 x 1012+/- 0.32 x 1012 total particles with an average mode size of 111+/-4.78 nm. Furthermore, protein analysis revealed positive expression of exosome markers CD9, CD63, and CD81. To test the regenerative potential of this product, we treated newborn Sprague-Dawley rats (n=9/group)exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (85% O2)from postnatal day 1-14 at day 3 with 1 x 1010 total particles (EXO)or placebo (PL). The degree of lung vascular remodeling, alveolarization, and pulmonary hypertension was then assessed. Results confirmed a significant lung protective effect of the EXO treatment in the hyperoxia groups by the demonstration of decreased percentage of muscularized vessels (67 +/- 9% in PL vs 14 +/- 7% in EXO, P<0.001), increased lung vascular density (6 +/- 1 vessels/field in PL vs 11 +/- 1 vessels/field in EXO, P<0.05), improved alveolar structure (mean linear intercept: 72 +/- 7 microm in PL vs 55 +/- 2 microm in EXO, P<0.001), and decreased right ventricular pressure (25+/-1 mmHg in PL vs 21+/-1 mmHg in EXO, P<0.05). Together, these results support the use of bioreactors to produce high quantity of viable EXO for the treatment of neonatal lung injury.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Background & Aim: We previously showed that human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs)are a viable source of cell therapy for established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This work has culminated in a first-in-human clinical trial in babies with established BPD. In this current study, we sought to assess the therapeutic potential of hAEC-derived EVs (hAEC-EVs)in an experimental model of BPD. Methods, Results & Conclusion Methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)was introduced to C57bl6 mouse fetuses intra-amniotically at E16 prior to exposure to 65% oxygen (hyperoxia)at birth. hAEC-EVs were injected intravenously on postnatal day (PND)4. One cohort of mice were culled on either postnatal day PND7 or PND14, while another cohort were kept in hyperoxia until PND 28, following which they were recovered under normoxia conditions for a further 2 weeks or 6 weeks for cardiovascular assessment. Result(s): The isolated hAEC-EVs had distinct cup shaped morphology with average size of 80-140nm. ALIX, Grp94 and HLA-G were expressed in EVs, and Pathway enrichment analysis showed that endothelin signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway were enriched in hAEC-EVs. In the mouse model of experimental BPD, hAEC-EV administration improved tissue-to-airspace ratio and septal crest density in a dose-dependent manner. hAEC-EVs reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)on PND7. The improvement of lung injury was associated with the increase of the percentage of type II alveolar cells (AT2s)at both PND7 and 14. Surprisingly, neonatal hAEC-EV delivery reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, mitigated pulmonary hypertension and prevented right ventricle hypertrophy that associated with BPD-like lung injury at week 6. These improvements persisted till week 10. All these observations showed that HAEC-EVs mitigate the BPD lung injury through decreasing inflammation, activating local AT2 niche and reversing pulmonary artery remodeling. Conclusion(s): hAEC-derived EVs had similar therapeutic effects to hAECs in this mouse model of experimental BPD. hAEC-derived EVs improved lung structure and reduced lung inflammation in a manner similar to that achieved using hAECs. EVs repaired lung injury partly through the activation of local stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, hAEC-EV administration had long term benefit in improving lung function, preventing pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle hypertrophy.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Purpose of study Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) may serve as potential therapeutic agents for BPD. UC-MSCs have higher proliferative abilities, longer lifespan, and secrete greater amounts of regenerative factors when compared to adult tissue-derived MSCs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of UCMSCs in an in-vitro model of hydrogen peroxide-induced BPD. Methods used MSCs derived from human UC Wharton's jelly met the criteria for MSCs per the International Society for Cellular Therapy. Rat lung epithelial cells (RLE-6) were used to model the lung epithelium. RLE-6 cells were separated as follows: i. Control (grown at standard cell conditions), ii. Injured (100 muM H2O2 for 1 hour), and iii. Treated (100 muM H2O2 for 1 hour + 50% UC-MSC conditioned media). Experiments included cell proliferation, wound healing, production of extracellular reactive oxygen species, RNA expression of caspase-6 and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2). Summary of results Compared to Control, RLE-6 proliferation after H2O2 injury to the cells decreased by 51% versus a decrease of 4% in the Treated group (p<0.05). Four hours after creating a wound in RLE-6 cells, Control group had healed by 14% while the Injured group reached 33% closure and the Treated group had 48% closure (p<0.05). H2O2 increased oxidant injury by 1.7-fold whereas the Treated group decreased oxidant injury to 0.5-fold of Control (p<0.05). Caspase-6 mRNA expression increased after injury and was lower in treated cells. SOD-2 expression was similar in all groups. Protein analyses are currently ongoing. Conclusions UC-MSCs may potentially improve alveolar epithelial cell proliferation, wound healing, and abate oxidant injury. Further studies will optimize the concentration of UCMSC conditioned media and examine mitochondrial function.

AB  - Purpose of study The study of the developing microbiome in the context of neonatal lung health and disease is a growing area of interest. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a debilitating lung disease affecting preterm infants and leads to significant morbidity. In neonates, there is a complex relationship between the development of the gastrointestinal microbiota and the regulation of immune function. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the differences in the intestinal microbiota between preterm infants who develop BPD and those who do not, as well as the effect of antibiotic exposure on the neonatal microbiota in these cohorts. Methods used Stool specimens were collected from very low birth weight (VLBW) infants born <1500 g BW during the first six weeks of life. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. Overall bacterial diversity and relative abundance were determined in each sample. BPD was defined as need for supplemental oxygen >21% for>28 days. The primary outcome was diversity of gut microbiota at the genus level among infants with/without BPD along with antibiotic exposure taken into consideration for each comparison. Summary of results Among all preterm infants exposed to early antibiotics, microbial diversity was significantly decreased in those who developed BPD compared to those who did not. In infants who developed BPD and were exposed to antibiotics, there is a significant increase in the relative abundance of Escherichia/Shigella and Streptococcus in comparison to infants that developed BPD without antibiotic exposure. Among the antibiotic exposed cohort, the relative abundance of Veillonella is significantly decreased in infants with BPD compared to the infants who did not develop BPD. Conclusions Our study suggests that VLBW infants who develop BPD have decreased microbial diversity and display significant changes in the composition of their intestinal microbiota compared to those without BPD. Early antibiotic exposure also leads to distinct microbiota changes in this cohort. These results highlight the potential for restoration of a healthy gut microbiome in the prevention/treatment of BPD.

AB  - Purpose of study Cell-free heme is pro-oxidant and cytotoxic, causing cellular oxidant injury and inflammation. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which is inducible by heme, is the key enzyme of intracellular heme catabolism. HO-1 plays a protective role in the neonatal murine lung against hyperoxiainduced abnormal lung development, an animal model for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hemopexin (HPX) is a heme-binding plasma protein that delivers heme for cellular uptake, but its potential protective role in hyperoxia has not been studied. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that cell-free heme contributes to abnormal lung development in hyperoxiaexposed neonatal mice and that treatment with HPX protects from the deleterious effects of hyperoxia. Methods used Newborn C57BL/6 mice on postnatal day 4 (P4) were administered either intramuscular (IM) injections of saline (vehicle control), HPX, or HPX plus aurothioglucose (ATG, a HO-1 inducer). Mice were then exposed to either 21% (room air) or 85% oxygen (hyperoxia) from P4-14 to induce lung injury. At P6, 8, and 10, HPX administration was repeated in the treatment groups. Weights were monitored and dams were switched daily. Lung morphology, lung tissue mRNA, plasma heme, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed at P14. Summary of results Gene expression analysis revealed hyperoxia increased mRNA levels for genes involved in inflammation such as CXCL1 (KC/GRO) (10.0+/-1.9 fold) and PTGS2 (COX2) (3.6+/-1.1 fold) and in fibrosis, such as TGFbeta2 (3.7 +/-0.7 fold) and ACTA2 (2.8+/-0.7 fold)(all p<0.05; ANOVA n=4). ELISA analysis demonstrated hyperoxia also elevated plasma IL-6. Mean linear intercept (MLI; inversely correlated with alveolar development) was increased from 40.1+/-1.1 mum (room air) to 69.2+/-1.1 mum (hyperoxia) in vehicle control group. Administration of HPX alone or HPX plus ATG did not show protective effect on alveolar development, inflammatory gene expression, or plasma IL-6 levels. Circulating heme was not significantly different between room air and hyperoxia-exposed P14 mice. Conclusions Cell-free heme was not increased in hyperoxia exposure, even though pro-inflammatory signaling in both lungs and plasma were increased. Treatments with either IM hemopexin alone or combined with ATG failed to attenuate alveolar injury in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A persistent increase in the number of lung fibroblasts (LFs) is found in the interstitium of the lungs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which leads to lung fibrosis. P16 methylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) is a major methyltransferase-specific inhibitor. This study investigated the effects of 5-aza-CdR on LFs in vitro from a hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis model in newborn rats., METHODS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting were performed to determine P16 gene methylation status and protein expression after LFs were treated with 0 mumol/L, 0.5 mumol/L, 1.0 mumol/L, and 5.0 mumol/L 5-aza-CdR for 120 hours. Proliferation was assessed by an MTT assay after LFs were treated with 0 mumol/L, 0.5 mumol/L, 1.0 mumol/L, and 5.0 mumol/L 5-aza-CdR for 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours. At the final time point, cells were also analyzed by flow cytometry to identify any change in their cell cycle profiles., RESULTS: A methylated P16 gene promoter was detected in hyperoxia LFs. Following treatment with 5-aza-CdR, partial methylation and demethylation was detected. The expression protein's level of the P16 gene was significantly higher in the 5.0 mumol/L 5-aza-CdR-treated group compared with that in the control group (p < 0.01). The cell growth rate at each tested time point was lower in the 5-aza-CdR-treated group compared with that in the control group after 72 hours (p < 0.01). Flow cytometry revealed that the cells in the 1.0 mumol/L and 5.0 mumol/L 5-aza-CdR-treated groups were apparently arrested in the G0/G1 phase and that the number of cells in the S phase was significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: 5-aza-CdR inhibits the growth of the LFs in hyperoxia-induced neonatal BPD rats in vitro by demethylating the P16 gene.

AB  - Purpose of study The therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been established in animal models of lung injury. Most studies administer these novel agents intravenously or intratracheally. We hypothesized that intranasal delivery of MSCs was feasible and effective in restoring lung alveolarization and vasculogenesis in a rat model mimicking neonatal lung disease. Methods used Human umbilical cord cells were isolated and characterized to meet the minimum criteria for MSCs. In a hyperoxia-induced rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), MSCs (500,000 cells/20 mL) were administered intranasally on days 4, 10, and 20. On day 21, animals underwent a forced swim test followed by necropsy. Lung slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (Alveolarization), von Willebrand factor (Vasculogenesis), Masson's trichrome (Fibrosis), and a-SMA (Muscularization). Lung lysates from each group (Control, BPD, and BPD+MSC) were analyzed with a rat cytokine array kit. Summary of results Newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia demonstrated the characteristic arrest in alveolar growth and decrease in lung vasculature. Intranasal delivery of MSCs was well tolerated, migrated to the lungs, and fully restored alveolarization and vascularization. Hyperoxia-exposed animals had a 41% increase in medial wall thickness compared to animals housed in 21% O2. MSCs reduced pulmonary artery medial wall thickness by 29%. Protein lysate from the BPD+MSC group had increased expression of VEGF, HGF, FGF, MMP2, Neprilysin, and VCAM-1.Growth velocity and exercise tolerance did not differ among groups. Conclusions Intranasal delivery of MSCs can be safely delivered to the lungs and provides a noninvasive and effective approach to current cell-based approaches for treating lung disease. The beneficial effects of MSCs can be attributed to their expression of pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Purpose of study Inflammation driven by alveolar macrophage IL-1beta production significantly contributes to the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Our lab has established that thioredoxin reductase-1 (TXNRD1) inhibition is protective in murine models of ALI and BPD, primarily driven by the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activation. These studies tested the hypothesis that TXNRD1 inhibition decreases IL-1beta production and increases Nrf2 dependent antioxidants in alveolar macrophages. Methods used Immortalized murine alveolar macrophages (MH-S) were cultured in the presence or absence of 0.05 mg/ ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or 0.5 mM auranofin (AFN). AFN inhibited TXNRD1 activity by 90% and was associated with increased nuclear Nrf2 accumulation. Summary of results Within 2 hour, IL-1beta mRNA levels, assessed by qRT-PCR, were 200-fold greater in LPS-treated MH-S cells than in vehicle-treated cells. In contrast, IL-1beta mRNA levels were increased by 100-fold in LPS-treated cells cultured in the presence of AFN. When compared to controltreated cells, IL-1beta protein levels, assessed by ELISA at 6 hour, were 18-fold greater in LPS-treated cells but only 10-fold greater in LPS +AFN cells. Levels of glutathione (GSH), a key intracellular antioxidant, measured at 24 hour by Tietze recycling assay, were 1.4-fold greater in LPS-treated MH-S cells when compared to controls. In the presence of AFN, LPS treatment increased GSH levels by 2.5-fold. Conclusions Our novel data indicate that TXNRD1 inhibition attenuates LPS mediated increases in IL-1beta in alveolar macrophages. We speculate that attenuated IL-1beta expression and enhanced endogenous antioxidant responses contributes to improved outcomes in our murine models of ALI and BPD.

AB  - Purpose of study Cross-talk between the intestinal microbiome and the lung and its role in lung health is of growing interest. In preterm neonates, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a debilitating lung disease with significant morbidity. Perinatal exposure to antibiotics disrupts the neonatal microbiome and may have long-term impacts on the developing preterm lung. The purpose of this study is to determine the additive effect of perinatal antibiotics and hyperoxia exposure on BPD severity and the microbiome in a neonatal murine model. Methods used Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type mice were treated with perinatal antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, vancomycin) from E17 to PND 5 via oral gavage. Control dams received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Neonatal pups were exposed to hyperoxia (95% oxygen) for 4 days or room air. Intestinal tissue was collected on PND 8 and 21 and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Lung tissue collected on PND 21 was analyzed for alveolarization and pulmonary vascularization. Summary of results Intestinal microbiome beta diversity was statistically different between antibiotic and PBS treated pups at PND 21 in hyperoxia and room air groups. In antibiotic treated groups, beta diversity was statistically different at PND 21 between pups exposed to hyperoxia compared to room air controls. Alpha diversity was decreased in antibiotic groups at PND 21. Hyperoxia exposure adversely impacted alveolarization and pulmonary vascularization across all groups, however, pups also exposed to perinatal antibiotics had statistically higher mean linear intercept and decreased microvessel number and radial alveolar count when compared to controls. Conclusions Our data suggests that alterations in the intestinal microbiome with perinatal antibiotics may influence lung development and repair after injury in a murine model. In our study, pups exposed to perinatal antibiotics and hyperoxia developed a worse phenotype of BPD including both impaired vascularization and alveolar simplification when compared to pups exposed to hyperoxia alone. This study has great implications for the important role of the intestinal microbiome in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm neonates.

AB  - Purpose of study Airway microbial dysbiosis and neutrophilic inflammation are associated with BPD. Our group has previously found that g proteobacteria abundance is increased and lactobacilli abundance is decreased in infants developing severe BPD. The mechanism by which airway microbial dysbiosis contributes to BPD is poorly understood. We hypothesized that airway microbial dysbiosis leads to neutrophilic inflammation causing BPD-like phenotype in mice. Methods used 1. Gnotobiotic (GN;germ-free) mice and non-GN (NGN) mice were exposed to 21% O2versus 85% O2 for baseline comparison 2. GN and NGN mice were monocolonized with g proteobacteria (E coli 1 x106 cfu/20 ul of saline intranasally) versus saline at P3, P6 and P9 and P12 to determine the effect of g proteobacteria monocolonization in both 21% and 85% 3. GN and NGN mice exposed to 85% O2+g proteobacteria (double hit model of BPD-JCI Insight, 2018; PMID:29515035) were treated with a respiratory probiotic combination (total 1 x106 cfu/20 ul of saline intranasally) versus saline at P3, P6, P9 and P12 to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the respiratory probiotic combination. Lungs were harvested for histology, protein, and RNA following pulmonary function test (PFT) at P14. Echo were done at P28. Markers of neutrophilic inflammation were tested. Summary of results 1. GN mice in 85% O2 showed protected lung structure (RAC) and function (PFT) compared to NGN mice in 85% O2. NGN mice lungs in 21% vs 85% O2 showed no baseline differences in microbial diversity and abundance based on 16S sequencing and bioinformatics 2. g proteobacteria monocolonization in NGN and GN mice induced alveolar hypoplasia (decreased RAC), decreased function (PFT), increased neutrophilic inflammation (Ac-PGP, MPO, neutrophil counts),and evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in both 21% vs 85% O2 3. Respiratory probiotic combination treatment in the double hit BPD murine model, improved lung structure and function, decreased neutrophilic inflammation, and decreased signs of PH. Conclusions Airway microbial dysbiosis (increased g proteobacteria and decreased respiratory probiotic bacteria) cause neutrophilic inflammation leading to BPD in mice. Use of respiratory probiotic combination provides therapeutic benefits in murine BPD.

AB  - Purpose of study Yeh demonstrated a decrease in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants <1500 grams treated with budesonide in surfactant (BIS) (2008, 2016). The dose used (0.25 mg/kg) may be too high. Methods used 24 extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGAN) intubated between 3-14 days of age at 4 centers were treated with up to 5 daily doses of BIS at 3 sequential dosing levels (0.025, 0.5, 0.1 mg/kg). Infants were excluded if treated with steroids or for PDA. DSMB reviewed response and AEs at each level before proceeding. Clinical outcomes at 28 d, 36 and 40 wk, along with blood budesonide and tracheal aspirate cytokine levels were determined to assess budesonide pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory effects (data pending). Infants were matched with surfactant-treated infants from Trial Of Late SURFactant (TOLSURF). Summary of results Only 25 of 272 (9%) ELGAN screened were enrolled at the 3 dosing levels over 12 months. 1 infant was withdrawn. Table 1 All 21 surviving infants required respiratory support at 28d. 17% survived w/o BPD at 36 wk and 29% at 40 wk. None of the 4 deaths or serious AEs were judged to be treatment related. Budesonide blood levels at each dose were proportional to those reported by Yeh. Conclusions With current clinical management, only very low GA, fragile infants are currently intubated at 3-14 days of age and many receive treatment for PDA, which limits candidates for BIS therapy. There was no apparent improvement in clinical outcome for high risk infants treated with all doses BIS compared to surfactant alone. Response to intratracheal BIS may be limited in infants<26 wk due to immaturity and multifactorial disease.

AB  - Purpose of study Neonatal chronic lung disease, also known as, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is a debilitating disease of preterm infants with high morbidity and mortality. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown therapeutic benefits in animal models of lung injury and repair. Human preterm MSCs will have superior therapeutic efficacy in protection of lung injury in murine BPD. Our aims are: (1) To generate commercial grade human preterm MSCs and their cell free conditioned media; and (2)Determine in vitro properties and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of human preterm MSCs. Methods used Human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly MSCs from preterm infants (Gestational age (GA) <28 weeks) and term infants (GA >37 weeks) were isolated and cultured according to our modified protocols and in vitro growth, differentiation, and secreted factors were analyzed utilizing duplication time, Western immunoblot, and proteomics analysis. In vivo therapeutic potential assessed in hyperoxia exposed murine BPD model measuring lung inflammation, lung injury, and pulmonary hypertension; and was compared to murine pups kept in a normoxic environment. Summary of results in Human preterm MSCs had shorter duplication and differentiation time as well as a higher concentration of cardiopulmonary protective secreted factors compared to term MSCs. Intravenous administration of preterm MSC conditioned media protected from lung inflammation, alveolar loss, and pulmonary hypertension compared with term MSC conditioned media; and was comparable to pups kept in normoxic environement. Conclusions Human preterm umbilical cord MSC conditioned media has superior cardiopulmonary protection in murine BPD and can serve as a therapeutic candidate for BPD.

AB  - Case report A male infant was born at 37 weeks via c/s for non-reassuring fetal heart tones, decreased fetal movement, and polyhydramnios to a G3P2 mother with obesity, alcohol use during pregnancy, and poorly controlled gestational diabetes (HbA1C 8.5%). Apgar scores were 1/5/7. Arterial cord gas showed pH 6.93, CO2 115, and base deficit -11. Sarnat exam was consistent with moderate encephalopathy and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. He was placed on high frequency oscillatory ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), dopamine, and hydrocortisone shortly after admission. Echo on day of life (DOL) 1 showed mild left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and a moderately hypertrophic and dilated right ventricle with depressed function. Hydrocortisone and iNO were unable to be weaned for more than two weeks due to cardiovascular instability. Echo on DOL 8 showed severe right ventricular hypertrophy and a flat, thickened intraventricular septum. Serial echoes over the following week showed progression of septal hypertrophy with evolving LV hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with peak gradient of 90 mmHg. The infant also developed sinus tachycardia >200 bpm with worsened dynamic outflow tract obstruction and hypotension that improved with esmolol. Due to the rapidly progressive nature of his ventricular hypertrophy, a metabolic and genetic work-up was initiated; ultimately negative for common heritable causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Hydrocortisone was weaned off DOL 16, and serial echoes on DOL 18-23 revealed significant and rapid improvement suggestive of steroid-induced HCM complicating mild HCM in an infant of a diabetic mother (IDM). Discussion Steroid-induced HCM is well described in premature infants, particularly among very low birthweight infants treated for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, to our knowledge there are no reports of term infants of diabetic mothers with hypertrophy developing worsening HCM secondary to hydrocortisone use. This may be an under-appreciated side effect of hydrocortisone in the IDM population and should be considered in cases of prolonged cardiovascular instability.

AB  - Purpose of study Despite advances in medical management of preterm infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major concern. A hallmark of BPD is impaired alveolar formation, and poor postnatal growth and inadequate nutrition contribute. One molecular mediator important in alveolar formation is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg). We demonstrated that postnatal growth restriction (PGR) reduces lung PPARg protein abundance in male rat pups only. We also showed the simultaneous decrease in circulating levels of the PPARg activator docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) only in male rat pups. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) facilitates the transport of DHA to the nucleus to enhance PPARg transcriptional activity. However, the effect of PGR and DHA supplementation on FABP4 protein levels in the rat lung is unknown. We hypothesize that PGR and supplemental DHA will alter lung FABP4 protein abundance in a sex and DHA dose-dependent manner in rat pups. Methods used We induced postnatal grown restriction by randomizing newborn rat pups into litters of 8 (control) or litters of 16 (PGR). Each litter was randomized to receive diets supplemented with DHA at 0.0%, 0.01% (Low), and 0.1% (High). Pup weights were measured every other day. Western blotting was used to measure FABP4 protein abundance in the lung at postnatal day 21. Summary of results Results are PGR as% sex-matched control +/-SD (*=p<0.05). Rat pups in the PGR group weighed significantly less than control by postnatal d5 and continued to weigh less through d21 on all DHA diets. In male rat lungs, PGR did not affect FABP4 protein abundance (89%+/-9%). However, DHA resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in FABP4 protein abundance (Low 47%+/-21%*; High 54%+/-36%*). In female rat lungs, PGR increased FABP4 protein abundance (148%+/-19%*), while DHA again resulted in a dose dependent decrease in FABP4 (Low 47%+/-21%*; High 54%+/-36%*). Conclusions We conclude that PGR and supplemental DHA alter lung FABP4 protein abundance in a sex and DHA dose-dependent manner in rat pups. We speculate that DHA supplementation downregulates total FABP4 protein abundance in association with increased nuclear localization. Ongoing studies are evaluating the effects of DHA on FABP4 nuclear localization and transcription of PPARg target genes.

AB  - Purpose of study Perinatal exposure to inflammatory stress (chorioamnionitis, sepsis) is an independent risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a sex-specific response to various stimuli injurious to the lung, with injury being more significant in males vs. females. Whether there is a sex-specific response to TLR4 mediated lung injury in the neonatal period is unknown. Methods used Neonatal(P0) male and female mice were exposed to LPS(IP; 5 mg/kg; 0/1/5 hours and 7 days). Lung surface area (SA), medial linear intercept(MLI) and airspace area(ASA) were determined(Metamorph). Baseline expression of TLR4 innate immune signaling was examined by Western blot and qPCR. The expression of pro-inflammatory target genes and signaling pathways previously demonstrated to show sex-specific differences in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury was assessed. n=4-6 animals per group, all performed in triplicate. Summary of results Early postnatal LPS exposure caused significant lung injury in both male and female mice, as measured by decreased SA, increased MLI and ASA (p<0.05). The degree of injury was not significantly different between sexes. The baseline expression of TLR4, MyD88, p50, p65, and cRel was similar in male and female neonatal mice. Interestingly, LPS exposure significantly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory target genes previously demonstrated to be associated with neonatal lung injury (IL-6, IL-1beta, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and TNF-alpha), and this did not differ between male and female mice. Previous studies have implicated NFkB signaling in sex-specific response to neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Here, NFkB activity, as measured by inhibitory protein degradation and p65/p50 nuclear translocation, was similar in LPSexposed neonatal male and female mice. Conclusions Pulmonary expression of key regulators of TLR4 innate immune signaling is similar in male and female neonatal mice. In contrast to hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, TLR4 mediated injury is not sex specific. These results suggest that there may be unique mechanisms of injury following exposure to LPS-induced systemic inflammatory stress, and targeting these pathways may attenuate lung injury in both male and female high-risk infants.

AB  - Introduction: PTB complications are the leading causes of death in children under the age of 5; there are currently no effective means to diagnose or treat PTB or PTB-associated fetal inflammation, which can lead to the development of cerebral palsy or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that we could block IL-1beta-induced enhanced peripheral leukocyte migration (a diagnostic for pending PTB), PTB and protect the fetal lung and brain by targeting the IL-1beta receptor 1 (IL1R1) using the novel rytvela, an all-D allosteric receptor antagonist. IL-1beta is an apex cytokine produced in response to sterile or infectious PTB stimuli and induces PTB in mice. We monitored the effectiveness of rytvela in the maternal peripheral leukocyte migration assay, timing of delivery and neutrophil invasion (NI) of maternal uterus and fetal lung and brain. Method(s): Twenty-three timed-pregnant CD1 mice at gestational day (GD)16 were administered IL-1beta (3 mug, i.u.) or saline and two s.c. injections of rytvela (1 mg/kg/12h) or saline every 12h. Mice (n=5-7 per treatment group) were euthanized at PTB or 24h post-labor-induction. The maternal uterus and the fetal brain and lung were collected, stained for neutrophils using a combination of Ly6G mAb and Hoechst 33342 dsDNA-binding dye, and visualized using confocal microscopy. Furthermore, whole blood was collected via cardiac puncture and leukocytes were isolated via erythrocyte sedimentation. Leukocyte migration activity to a chemotactic stimulus was assessed in a Boyden chamber. Statistical significance was tested using one-way ANOVA, p<0.05. Result(s): 85% of IL-1beta-alone-treated mice delivered preterm within 24h (p<0.05), and their fetuses were visually smaller and unhealthy compared to controls. IL-1beta-alone treatment also increased peripheral leukocyte migration (p<0.05) and significantly greater neutrophil density in the uterus (p<0.05), fetal brain (p<0.05) and fetal lung (p=0.087). All effects of IL-1beta were blocked in the rytvela co-treated mice, and the fetuses were healthy. Conclusion(s): We have established that the maternal IL1R1 is an important upstream target for blocking PTB and fetal inflammation. Further, the leukocyte migration assay (LMA), a diagnostic for PTB, mimics both neutrophil invasion of maternal uterus and fetal organs and therefore is an assay that monitors rytvela effectiveness. Therefore, the LMA may translate to be a valuable tool to use in asymptomatic women at risk of PTB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The substantial risk of iron overload is not routinely monitored in most of the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Japan; however, blood transfusion is an essential strategy for successfully treating preterm low-birth-weight infants., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the iron status and clinical features of infants with a birth weight of <1,500 g, i.e. very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs)., METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 176 (82.6%) patients from a total of 213 VLBWIs admitted to our NICU from 2009 to 2014. Clinical information was collected including maternal records and infant morbidity and treatment. Management strategies including enteral iron supplementation, erythropoietin administration and blood transfusion were allowed according to the consensus in Japan. The hematological status was surveyed from birth to 12 postnatal weeks of age. The iron status was determined according to serum iron, unbound iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin. The definition of hyperferritinemia was set as a value of >=500 ng/ml., RESULTS: Twenty-four (13.6%) infants displayed hyperferritinemia. A multiple logistic analysis selected 3 associated factors of hyperferritinemia: surgical ligation for patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis and moderate or severe states of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We also verified that the value of ferritin was significantly correlated with those of aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and C-reactive protein according to a multilinear regression analysis. After excluding the ferritin data of these outliers, we did not observe any factors associated with hyperferritinemia., CONCLUSIONS: Hyperferritinemia might be associated with oxygen radical diseases and susceptibility to infection.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate whether a targeted management according to information of intra-amniotic infection or inflammation improves pregnancy management and neonatal outcome in women with preterm labor (PTL). Study Design: Prospective cohort study (2008-2017) including singleton pregnancies with PTL<34.0 weeks without clinical chorioamnionitis and with an amniocentesis to rule out infection or IAI. Diagnosis of IAI was based on AF IL-6 Levels (>=13.4ng/mL). In addition to standard management of PTL, women with amniotic fluid glucose levels <5 mg/dL and/or with microorganisms at Gram stain and/or positive cultures, were treated with antibiotics being tocolysis discontinued and magnesium sulfate administered <32 weeks if delivery was imminent. Induction of labor was only considered if clinical chorioamnionitis, gestational age >34 weeks and depending on the virulence of microorganism isolated. An adverse neonatal outcome was defined by the occurrence of stillbirth/neonatal death or moderate/severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia or gastro-intestinal perforation or necrotizing enterocolitis or intra-ventricular haemhorrage grade III/IV or periventricular leukomalacia or early-onset sepsis or retinopathy of prematurity needing laser treatment. We evaluated the independence of infection or IAI to explain an adverse neonatal outcome by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): Two-hundred sixty-three women were included: 35(13%) with microbial-associated IAI (infection with IAI), 37(14%) with sterile IAI (IAI without infection), 12(5%) with microbial invasion of amniotic cavity (infection without IAI) and 179 (68%) women with non-infection/non-IAI. We found significant differences on latency to delivery between women with or without infection or IAI. The presence of infection or IAI was associated with an adverse neonatal outcome mainly due to a high rate of stillbirth. However, when we selected from women who achieved 24 weeks (n 257) those who were managed with antenatal steroids and antibiotics (n 128), the significant influence of infection or IAI on neonatal outcome disappeared. Conclusion(s): In women with PTL, the information of infection or IAI may be useful to individualize our management targeting those women who are inevitably going to deliver in the following days and avoiding unnecessary overtreatments (e.g. transfer to NICU hospitals, need of antenatal steroids) in those with non-infection/non-IAI.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a major issue affecting morbidity and mortality of surviving premature babies. Preterm newborns are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have a typical oxidation pattern in the early stages of this disease, suggesting the important role of oxidative stress in its pathogenesis. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a complex disease where knowledge advances as new investigative tools become available. The explosion of the "omics" disciplines has recently affected BPD research. This review focuses on the new evidence coming from microbiomics, metabolomics and proteomics in relation to oxidative stress and pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Since the pathogenesis is not yet completely understood, information gained in this regard would be important for planning an efficacious prevention and treatment strategy for the future.Copyright © 2019 Capasso, Vento, Loddo, Tirone, Iavarone, Raimondi, Dani and Fanos.

AB  - Background: Advances in neonatal care have resulted in improved survival for very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs). However, the main factors that lead to early weight Z-score [standard deviation score (SDS)] changes during hospital stay in VLBWIs still need to be studied more. Objective(s): In this study we aimed to investigate the differences in specific factors that relate to VLBWIs' early weight Z-score changes as the scientific basis for clinical practice of VLBWIs during the entire hospital stay. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed baseline characteristics, nutrition management, clinical outcomes, and complications between non-catch-down (NCD) ( weight SDS >=-0.67) and catch-down (CD) groups ( weight SDS <-0.67) in VLBWIs during hospital stay. Result(s): A total of 227 infants (NCD group = 117, CD group = 110) met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The NCD group received higher parenteral lipids (g/kg/d) from day 5 to day 7 and higher enteral feeding volume (mL/kg/d) from day 5 to week 5. The NCD group had higher protein:energy ratios at day 2 to day 4 and day 7 and higher total energy (kcal/kg/d) during the first six weeks. The NCD group had lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC). Conclusion(s): This study showed that adequate parenteral lipid and energy at the first week of life and earlier enhanced enteral feeding volume might significantly improve the VLBWIs' weight Z-scores during hospital stay. The VLBWIs with catch-down growth might be more prone to developing BPD and PNAC.Copyright © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pediatrics.

AB  - Introduction: the aim of this case report is to present that oral L-citrulline supplementation may attenuate chronic pulmonary hypertension and reduce oxygen requirement in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Important clinical findings: a boy, with a birth weight of 700 g, born by cesarean section after 25 weeks of pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia, was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. He was ventilatory dependent for the next 3 months with significantly increased oxygen requirements. A severe stage of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, complicated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, was diagnosed. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and oral sildenafil was included in the therapy of chronic pulmonary hypertension. The results of screening echocardiograms and increased plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentrations, suggested right ventricle dysfunction. The main intervention: at the beginning of the sixth month of hospitalization, oral supplementation of L-citrulline in a single dose of 150 mg/kg/day was introduced and continued for 70 days. During the first 3 weeks after L-citrulline was started, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and he was never intubated again until he was discharged. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentrations decreased significantly during the first month of L-citrulline administration and became stable until the termination of L-citrulline supplementation. At discharge, the patient required 22%-25% concentration of oxygen supplemented intermittently, exclusively during feeding. Conclusion(s): these results indicate that L-citrulline supplementation may deserve coverage as an additional, potentially beneficial alternative in the prophylaxis or therapy of chronic pulmonary hypertension in newborns.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The incidence and mortality rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remain very high. Therefore, novel therapies are imminently needed to improve the outcome of this disease. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) show promising therapeutic effects on oxygen-induced model of BPD. In our experiment, UC-MSCs were intratracheally delivered into the newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia, a well-established BPD model. This study demonstrated that UC-MSCs reduce elastin expression stimulated by 90% O2 in human lung fibroblasts-a (HLF-a), and inhibit HLF-a transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. In addition, the therapeutic effects of UC-MSCs in neonatal rats with BPD, UC-MSCs could inhibit lung elastase activity and reduce aberrant elastin expression and deposition in the lung of BPD rats. Overall, this study suggested that UC-MSCs could ameliorate aberrant elastin expression in the lung of hyperoxia-induced BPD model which may be associated with suppressing increased TGFbeta1 activation.Copyright © 2017

AB  - Trophic functions for macrophages are emerging as key mediators of developmental processes, including bone, vessel, and mammary gland development. Yolk sac-derived macrophages mature in the distal lung shortly after birth. Myeloid-lineage macrophages are recruited to the lung and are activated under pathological conditions. These pathological conditions include bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common complication of preterm birth characterized by stunted lung development, where the formation of alveoli is blocked. No study has addressed causal roles for immune cells in lung alveolarization. We employed antibody-based and transgenic death receptor-based depletion approaches to deplete or prevent lung recruitment of immune cell populations in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD. Neither neutrophils nor exudate macrophages (which might include lung interstitial macrophages) contributed to structural perturbations to the lung that were provoked by hyperoxia; however, cells of the Csf1r-expressing monocyte/macrophage lineage were implicated as causal mediators of stunted lung development. We propose that resident alveolar macrophages differentiate into a population of CD45+ CD11c+ SiglecF+ CD11b+ CD68+ MHCII+ cells, which are activated by hyperoxia, and contribute to disturbances to the structural development of the immature lung. This is the first report that causally implicates immune cells in pathological disturbances to postnatal lung organogenesis. Copyright © 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - Objective: To assess the benefits and risks of antenatal corticosteroid therapy for women at risk of preterm birth or undergoing pre-labour Caesarean section at term and to make recommendations for improving neonatal and long-term outcomes. Options: To administer or withhold antenatal corticosteroid therapy for women at high risk of preterm birth or women undergoing pre-labour Caesarean section at term. Outcome(s): Perinatal morbidity, including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infection, hypoglycemia, somatic and brain growth, and neurodevelopment; perinatal mortality; and maternal morbidity, including infection and adrenal suppression. Intended Users: Maternity care providers including midwives, family physicians, and obstetricians. Target Population: Pregnant women. Evidence: Medline, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to September 2017. Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and key words related to pregnancy, prematurity, corticosteroids, and perinatal and neonatal mortality and morbidity were used. Statements from professional organizations including that of the National Institutes of Health, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Canadian Pediatric Society were reviewed for additional references. Randomized controlled trials conducted in pregnant women evaluating antenatal corticosteroid therapy and previous systematic reviews on the topic were eligible. Evidence from systematic reviews of non-experimental (cohort) studies was also eligible. Validation Methods: This Committee Opinion has been reviewed and approved by the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Committee of the SOGC and approved by SOGC Council. Benefits, Harms, and/or Costs: A course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy administered within 7 days of delivery significantly reduces perinatal morbidity/mortality associated with preterm birth between 24 + 0 and 34 + 6 weeks gestation. When antenatal corticosteroid therapy is given more than 7 days prior to delivery or after 34 + 6 weeks gestation, the adverse effects may outweigh the benefits. Evidence on long-term effects is scarce, and potential neurodevelopment harms are unquantified in cases of late preterm, term, and repeated exposure to antenatal corticosteroid therapy. Guideline Update: Evidence will be reviewed 5 years after publication to evaluate the need for a complete or partial update of the guideline. If important evidence is published prior to the 5-year time point, an update will be issued to reflect new knowledge and recommendations. Sponsors: The guideline was developed with resources provided by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada with support from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (APR-126338). Summary Statements: 1. Trials enrolling pregnant women from 24 + 0 to 34 + 6 weeks gestation at high risk of preterm birth show that antenatal corticosteroid therapy significantly reduces perinatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, and intraventricular hemorrhage (Moderate).2. Evidence from cohort studies shows a significant reduction in perinatal mortality among infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroid therapy at less than 24 weeks gestation (Low).3. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy administered to women at risk of preterm delivery between 34 + 0 and 36 + 5 weeks gestation decreases neonatal respiratory morbidity (Moderate).4. There is an increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia among infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroid therapy at 34 + 0 to 36 + 5 weeks gestation (Moderate).5. Administration of antenatal corticosteroid therapy decreases respiratory distress syndrome and need for mechanical ventilation in infants of women undergoing elective pre-labour Caesarean delivery at term (Moderate).6. Limited evidence is available on long-term outcomes following antenatal corticosteroid therapy in cases of elective pre-labour Caesarean delivery at term gestation. However, there are concerns regarding the cognitive functioning of children exposed to antenatal corticosteroid therapy prior to elective Caesarean section at term gestation (Low).7. Betamethasone has been more commonly used in studies evaluating the effect of antenatal corticosteroid therapy. In indirect comparisons, betamethasone shows greater reductions in chorioamnionitis, respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic lung disease compared with dexamethasone. In direct comparisons, dexamethasone is associated with a greater reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage and lower length of neonatal intensive care unit stay compared with betamethasone. Effects on other outcomes are generally similar (Low).8. The likelihood of preterm delivery and also the gestational age need to be carefully considered when contemplating the use of antenatal corticosteroid therapy among pregnant women. The efficacy of such therapy is highest when the course is given 24 hours to 7 days prior to delivery. Administration more than 7 days before delivery leads to reduced benefit and potentially unnecessary adverse effects (Low).9. Repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy are associated with a reduction in respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, and use of surfactant (Moderate).10. Birth weights and head circumferences are decreased in infants exposed to multiple courses compared with those exposed to a single course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy (High).11. There is limited evidence on the long-term effects of repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy. Follow-up from a large trial indicated higher risks of neurosensory disability and of a composite of death or severe disability (neuromotor, neurosensitive, neurocognitive) in children exposed to multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy and born at term (Moderate).12. Few trials of antenatal corticosteroid therapy in multifetal pregnancies are available. Subgroup analyses show that effects of antenatal corticosteroid therapy are not different between multifetal pregnancies and singleton pregnancies (Low).13. Evidence from cohort studies shows benefits of antenatal corticosteroid therapy are greater in multifetal pregnancies when antenatal corticosteroid therapy is administered within 7 days prior to delivery (Low).14. Evidence on the effects of antenatal corticosteroid therapy in diabetic women is scarce, and no comparative study has been conducted in this subpopulation (Low).15. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy leads to an increase in maternal blood glucose levels up to 1 week after the initiation of the first dose (Low).16. There is an absence of evidence on the effects of antenatal corticosteroid therapy among women with obesity, and no comparative study has been conducted in this subpopulation (Low).17. Responsiveness of growth-restricted fetuses to antenatal corticosteroid therapy remains largely unknown (Low).18. A lower frequency of major brain lesions, but a higher frequency of body size below the 10th centile at school age is observed in cohort studies of small for gestational age infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroid therapy (Low).19. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy may induce transient variations in fetal body movements including a potential reduction in fetal movements in the first 3 days following therapy initiation (Low).Recommendations: Gestational Age Considerations 1. One course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be routinely administered to women at 24 + 0 to 34 + 6 weeks gestation who are at high risk for preterm delivery within the next 7 days (Strong, Moderate).2. Women between 22 + 0 weeks and 23 + 6 weeks gestation at high risk of preterm birth within the next 7 days should be provided with a multidisciplinary consultation regarding the high likelihood for severe perinatal morbidity and mortality and associated maternal morbidity. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy may be considered if early intensive care is requested and planned (Conditional, Low).3. The balance of risks and benefits does not support routine administration of antenatal corticosteroid therapy for women at 35 + 0 to 35 + 6 weeks gestation who are at high risk for preterm birth in the next 7 days (Conditional, Moderate).4. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should not be routinely administered to women at 36 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks gestation who are at risk for preterm delivery (Conditional, Moderate).5. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy may be administered between 35 + 0 and 36 + 6 weeks gestation in select clinical situations after risks and benefits are discussed with the woman and the pediatric care provider(s) (Conditional, Moderate).6. Elective pre-labour Caesarean section should be performed at or after 39 + 0 weeks gestation to minimize respiratory morbidity (Strong, Low).7. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should not be routinely administered to women undergoing pre-labour Caesarean section at term gestation (including at 37 and 38 weeks gestation) (Strong, Low).Agents, Dosage, Regimen, and Target Timing 8. When antenatal corticosteroid therapy is indicated, women should receive a course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy (i.e., either 2 doses of betamethasone 12 mg given by intramuscular injection 24 hours apart or 4 doses of dexamethasone 6 mg given by intramuscular injection 12 hours apart) (Strong, Moderate).9. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be administered to women requiring medically indicated delivery only when the plan to proceed with delivery within 7 days has been finalized and gestational age criteria for antenatal corticosteroid therapy are met (Strong, Low).10. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be routinely administered to women in spontaneous preterm labour characterized by regular uterine contractions associated with significant cervical dilation or significant cervical change on repeated examination when gestational age criteria for antenatal corticosteroid therapy are met. Regular contractions in the absence of cervical dilation/change, or a short cervical length in the absence of regular contractions, are not indications for antenatal corticosteroid therapy (Strong, Low).11. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be routinely administered at the time of diagnosis to women with preterm premature rupture of membranes, when gestational age criteria are met (Strong, Low).12. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be administered to women with significant antepartum hemorrhage when the risk of delivery within 7 days is high and the gestational age criteria for such therapy are met (Strong, Low).13. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be administered to asymptomatic patients with vasa previa or placenta previa when the risk of delivery within 7 days is high and the gestational age criteria are met (Strong, Low).14. In cases where the diagnosis of preterm labour has not been firmly established (i.e., no documented cervical change and dilatation <3 cm), and the woman is being transferred to a higher level of care for further assessment, antenatal corticosteroid therapy should not be administered prior to transfer (Strong, Low).15. If the risk of preterm delivery decreases significantly following administration of the first dose of antenatal corticosteroid therapy, cancellation of the second dose of corticosteroids should be considered. If the second dose is cancelled and a high risk of preterm birth arises subsequently at less than 34 + 6 weeks gestation, 1 dose or 1 course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be considered, depending on gestational age and the duration since the first dose (Strong, Low).16. If the woman remains undelivered beyond 7 days after the first antenatal corticosteroids course, the balance of risks and benefits does not support further routine administration of antenatal corticosteroid therapy even if the risk of preterm delivery increases subsequently. The gestational age and the time interval since the first course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy (at least 14 days) should be taken into account when considering a rescue course. A single rescue course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy may be administered after risks and benefits are discussed with the woman (Conditional, Moderate).Subpopulations and Special Consideration 17. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be administered according to the same indications and in the same gestational age range to women with twin or higher-order multifetal pregnancies as for singleton pregnancies (Conditional, Low).18. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should not be administered to women with multifetal pregnancies in the absence of a high risk of preterm birth within the next 7 days (Conditional, Low).19. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be administered to diabetic women at the same dosage, according to the same indications, and in the same gestational age range as that recommended for non-diabetic women (Conditional, Low).20. Close attention should be paid to control of maternal blood glucose among women with diabetes in the days following antenatal corticosteroid therapy because of anticipated elevations in maternal blood glucose levels (Strong, Low).21. Because of the transient elevation of blood glucose levels induced by corticosteroids, gestational diabetes screening should be delayed for a minimum of 1 week following antenatal corticosteroid therapy (Strong, Low).22. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be administered to women with obesity at the same dosage as that recommended for women without obesity (according to the same indications and in the same gestational age range) because there is insufficient evidence to guide dosage adjustments by maternal weight (Conditional, Low).23. There is insufficient evidence to withhold routine antenatal corticosteroid therapy in cases of suspected fetal growth restriction with a high risk of preterm birth. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be administered according to the same indications and in the same gestational age range as in normal pregnancies after risks and benefits are discussed with the woman (Conditional, Low).24. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should not be administered to women with suspected fetal growth restriction at the time of diagnosis unless there is a high risk of preterm birth within the next 7 days (Conditional, Low).25. Women should be informed of the potential for a transient reduction in fetal movements and advised to consult with their health care professional if this occurs (Strong, Low).Copyright © 2018 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) affect 16-25% of premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), contributing significantly to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA omega-3) can improve vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and inflammation under pathophysiological conditions. However, the effects of PUFA omega-3 supplementation in BPD-associated PH are unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of PUFA omega-3 on pulmonary vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and inflammatory response in a hyperoxia-induced rat model of PH. From embryonic day 15, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were supplemented daily with PUFA omega-3, PUFA omega-6, or normal saline (0.2 ml/day). After birth, pups were pooled, assigned as 12 per litter, randomly assigned to either air or continuous oxygen exposure (fraction of inspired oxygen = 85%) for 20 days, and then euthanized for pulmonary hemodynamic and morphometric analysis. We found that PUFA omega-3 supplementation improved survival, decreased right ventricular systolic pressure and RVH caused by hyperoxia, and significantly improved alveolarization, vascular remodeling, and vascular density. PUFA omega-3 supplementation produced a higher level of total omega-3 in lung tissue and breast milk and was found to reverse the reduced levels of VEGFA, VEGF receptor 2, angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), endothelial TEK tyrosine kinase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and nitric oxide concentrations in lung tissue and the increased ANGPT2 levels in hyperoxia-exposed rats. The beneficial effects of PUFA omega-3 in improving lung injuries were also associated with an inhibition of leukocyte infiltration and reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. These data indicate that maternal PUFA omega-3 supplementation strategies could effectively protect against infant PH induced by hyperoxia.Copyright © 2018 the American Physiological Society and American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects extremely preterm infants and remains - despite improvements in neonatal intensive care - a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Cell-therapeutic strategies employing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to modulate lung development in BPD models. Objective(s): Herein, we evaluate the potential of human amniotic fluid (hAF)-SC and hAF-SC with upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as cell-therapeutic agents for BPD. Method(s): Preterm rabbit pups were raised in normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (>=95% O2). Hyperoxia-exposed pups randomly received an intraperitoneal injection of fibroblasts, naive hAF-SC, or hAF-SC-VEGF on postnatal day (PN) 0. On PN7, surviving pups were tested for pulmonary (forced oscillation technique) and vascular (pulmonary artery Doppler ultrasound) function, and lungs were processed for morphometric measurements of parenchymal and vascular structure and inflammation. Result(s): Intraperitoneal injection of cells resulted in homing to the lungs. The lungs of hyperoxia-exposed animals displayed parenchymal and vascular structural and functional damage reminiscent of BPD, which was significantly improved after treatment with hAF-SC-VEGF. Treating hyperoxia-exposed animals with naive AF-SC attenuated only the lung inflammation and the vascular structural defect. Treatment with fibroblasts, which were used as a cellular control, did not lead to any improvements. Conclusion(s): hAF-SC with upregulated VEGF expression display enhanced potential to prevent/reverse lung injury in preterm rabbits, whereas naive hAF-SC only show a moderate therapeutic potential. These results point towards an added value of VEGF delivered by hAF-SC in the treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The innate immune system has evolved to play an integral role in the normally developing lung and brain. However, in response to oxidative stress, innate immunity, mediated by specific cellular and molecular programs and signaling, contributes to pathology in these same organ systems. Despite opposing drivers of oxidative stress, namely hyperoxia in neonatal lung injury and hypoxia/ischemia in neonatal brain injury, similar pathways-including toll-like receptors, NFkappaB and MAPK cascades-have been implicated in tissue damage. In this review, we consider recent insights into the innate immune response to oxidative stress in both neonatal and adult models to better understand hyperoxic lung injury and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury across development and aging. These insights support the development of targeted immunotherapeutic strategies to address the challenge of harnessing the innate immune system in oxidative stress diseases of the neonate.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Induction of lung maturation by prenatal steroid treatment has become the standard of care for pregnant women at risk for preterm birth. In addition to the beneficial effects on lung maturation, prenatal steroids have been shown to reduce the incidence of neonatal death, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and intraventricular hemorrhage. However, little is known about the role of interindividual differences in corticoid sensitivity arising from polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene., OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of GR polymorphisms N363S (rs56149945), R23K (rs6190), and BclI (rs41423247) on neonatal outcome., METHODS: The GR polymorphisms N363S, R23K, and BclI were examined in 10,490 very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants from 49 German tertiary level neonatal units (German Neonatal Network, GNN) with respect to neonatal outcome., RESULTS: Infants carrying the BclI genotype were at higher risk to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (OR 1.12 per BclI allele, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23, p = 0.013) in a logistic regression model adjusted for gestational age, mechanical ventilation, and small for gestational age status. A similar relative risk was seen in the children (89.4%) who received antenatal betamethasone treatment (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.27, p = 0.003), whereas no such effect was detectable in infants without antenatal steroids. N363S and R23K did not show any stable association with neonatal outcome parameters., CONCLUSION: Except for a slightly higher risk of BPD in carriers of the GRBclI variant, the GR gene polymorphisms BclI, N363S, and R23K did not affect neonatal outcome parameters in this large multicenter cohort of VLBW preterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patent ductus arteriosus is a common problem frequently encountered in preterm infants. We aimed to study the risk factors associated with reopening of patent ductus arteriosus and their short term outcomes in preterm infants. METHOD(S): A total of 162 preterm infants born between November 2013 and December 2015 with gestaional age less than 32 weeks and treated for hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus are included in our study. RESULT(S): 113(69.8%) showed permanent closure and 49(30.2%) infants revealed symptoms of reopening after effective closure of patent ductus arteriosus. Low birth weight and small gestational age were more common in reopening group. Multivariete analysis showed that sepsis and multiple courses of drug treatment were independent factors affecting reopening of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (OR: 3.01, 95% CI 1.48-6.13, p = 0.002) and (OR: 2.67, 95% CI 1.23-5.82, p = 0.013) respectively. Reopened group had a remarkable higher rate of developing necrotising nnterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity than the closed group. (16.3% vs 4.4%, p = 0.01, 55.1% vs 28.3%, p = 0.001 and 55.1% vs 23.0%, p = 0.0001 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Late neonatal sepsis and the need of multiple drug courses to close patent ductus arteriosus are risk factors affecting the reopening of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants.Copyright © © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the magnitude of the correlation between neonatal outcomes of twins and demonstrate how this information can be used in the design of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in women with twin pregnancies. Design(s): Secondary analysis of data from 12 RCTs. Setting(s): Obstetric care in multiple countries, 2004-2012. Population or sample: 4504 twin pairs born to women who participated in RCTs to assess treatments given during pregnancy. Method(s): Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated using log-binomial and linear models. Main Outcome Measure(s): Perinatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, neonatal intensive care unit admission, birthweight, low birthweight and two composite measures of adverse neonatal outcome. Result(s): ICCs for the composite measures of adverse neonatal outcome were all above 0.5, indicating moderate to strong correlation between adverse outcomes of twins. For individual neonatal outcomes, median ICCs across trials ranged from 0.13 to 0.79 depending on the outcome. An example illustrates how ICCs can be used in sample size calculations for RCTs in women with twin pregnancies. Conclusion(s): The correlation between neonatal outcomes of twins varies considerably between outcomes and may be lower than expected. Our ICC estimates can be used for designing and analysing RCTs that recruit women with twin pregnancies and for performing meta-analyses that include such RCTs. Researchers are encouraged to report ICCs for neonatal outcomes in twins in their own RCTs. Tweetable abstract: Correlation between neonatal outcomes of twins depends on the outcome and may be lower than expected.Copyright © 2018 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common, heterogeneous disease in premature infants. We hypothesized that quantitative CT techniques could assess lung parenchymal heterogeneity in BPD patients across a broad age range and demonstrate how pathologies change over time. Method(s): A cross-sectional, retrospective study of children age 0-6 years with non-contrast chest CT scans was conducted. BPD subjects met NICHD/NHLBI diagnostic criteria for BPD and were excluded for congenital lung/airway abnormalities or other known/suspected pulmonary diagnoses; control subjects were not premature and had normal CT scan findings. Radiologic opacities, lucencies, and spatial heterogeneity were quantified via: 1) thresholding using CT-attenuation (HU); 2) manual segmentation; and 3) Ochiai reader-scoring system. Clinical outcomes included BPD severity by NICHD/NHLBI criteria, respiratory support at NICU discharge, wheezing, and respiratory exacerbations. Result(s): Heterogeneity (standard deviation) of lung attenuation in BPD was significantly greater than in controls (difference 36.4 HU [26.1-46.7 HU], P < 0.001); the difference between the groups decreased 0.58 HU per month of age (0.08-1.07 HU per month, P = 0.02). BPD patients had greater amounts of opacities and lucencies than controls except with automated quantification of lucencies. Cross-sectionally, lucencies per Ochiai score and opacities per manual segmentation decreased with time. No approach measured a statistically significant relationship to BPD clinical severity. Conclusion(s): Opacities, lucencies, and overall heterogeneity of lungs via quantitative CT can distinguish BPD patients from healthy controls, and these abnormalities decrease with age across BPD patients. Defining BPD severity by clinical outcomes such as respiratory support at several time points (vs a single time point, per current guidelines) may be meaningful.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Extremely preterm infants are at high risk for morbidities including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity likely related to their exposure to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species early in life. Selenium is a trace mineral contributes to the proper function of multiple systems including immunity, redox regulation, and inflammation via the "selenoenzymes" glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and selenoprotein P. Given that selenium accretion via the placenta occurs primarily during the third trimester, preterm neonates are born selenium deficient. While the role of selenium in animals and adults is better described, publications are lacking in the neonatal population regarding consequences of selenium deficiency or toxicity, accurate monitoring of levels, and proper enteral and parental dosages. This review highlights the role of selenium as it relates to the optimal function of antioxidant systems in extremely preterm infants in order to highlight the gaps in knowledge as it relates to the pathogenesis and prevention of morbidities in this population.Copyright © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background aims Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease characterized by disrupted lung growth, is the most common complication in extreme premature infants. BPD leads to persistent pulmonary disease later in life. Alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s), a subset of which represent distal lung progenitor cells (LPCs), promote normal lung growth and repair. AEC2 depletion may contribute to persistent lung injury in BPD. We hypothesized that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AECs prevent lung damage in experimental oxygen-induced BPD. Methods Mouse AECs (mAECs), miPSCs/mouse embryonic stem sells, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hUCMSCs), human (h)iPSCs, hiPSC-derived LPCs and hiPSC-derived AECs were delivered intratracheally to hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. Cells were pre-labeled with a red fluorescent dye for in vivo tracking. Results Airway delivery of primary mAECs and undifferentiated murine pluripotent cells prevented hyperoxia-induced impairment in lung function and alveolar growth in neonatal mice. Similar to hUCMSC therapy, undifferentiated hiPSCs also preserved lung function and alveolar growth in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal NOD/SCID mice. Long-term assessment of hiPSC administration revealed local teratoma formation and cellular infiltration in various organs. To develop a clinically relevant cell therapy, we used a highly efficient method to differentiate hiPSCs into a homogenous population of AEC2s. Airway delivery of hiPSC-derived AEC2s and hiPSC-derived LPCs, improved lung function and structure and resulted in long-term engraftment without evidence of tumor formation. Conclusions hiPSC-derived AEC2 therapy appears effective and safe in this model and warrants further exploration as a therapeutic option for BPD and other lung diseases characterized by AEC injury.Copyright © 2017 International Society for Cellular Therapy

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious neonatal pulmonary condition associated with premature birth, but the underlying parenchymal disease and trajectory are poorly characterized. The current National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NHLBI definition of BPD severity is based on degree of prematurity and extent of oxygen requirement. However, no clear link exists between initial diagnosis and clinical outcomes. Objective(s): We hypothesized that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of structural parenchymal abnormalities will correlate with NICHD-defined BPD disease severity and predict short-term respiratory outcomes. Method(s): A total of 42 neonates (20 severe BPD, 6 moderate, 7 mild, 9 non-BPD control subjects; 40+/-3-wk postmenstrual age) underwent quiet-breathing structural pulmonary MRI (ultrashort echo time and gradient echo) in a neonatal ICU-sited, neonatal-sized 1.5 T scanner, without sedation or respiratory support unless already clinically prescribed. Disease severity was scored independently by two radiologists. Mean scores were compared with clinical severity and short-term respiratory outcomes. Outcomes were predicted using univariate and multivariable models, including clinical data and scores. Measurements and Main Results: MRI scores significantly correlated with severities and predicted respiratory support at neonatal ICU discharge (P<0.0001). In multivariable models, MRI scores were by far the strongest predictor of respiratory support duration over clinical data, including birth weight and gestational age. Notably, NICHD severity level was not predictive of discharge support. Conclusion(s): Quiet-breathing neonatal pulmonary MRI can independently assess structural abnormalities of BPD, describe disease severity, and predict short-term outcomes more accurately than any individual standard clinical measure. Importantly, this nonionizing technique can be implemented to phenotype disease, and has potential to serially assess efficacy of individualized therapies.Copyright © 2018 by the American Thoracic Society.

AB  - Over the last few years, scientific interest in the cytokine IL-17A has intensified as its role in human health and disease has been elucidated. Discovered almost a quarter century ago, IL-17A is known to have poor biologic activity when acting alone, but attains robust actions when working synergistically with potent mediators of proinflammatory immune responses, such as IL-6 and IL-8. IL-17A is produced by specialized innate immune cells that protect host barriers from the outside world. Like sentries, these innate immune cells can "sound the alarm" through increased production of IL-17A, causing activation and recruitment of primed neutrophils and monocytes when pathogens escape initial host defenses. In this way, IL-17A promulgates mechanisms responsible for pathogen death and clearance. However, when IL-17A pathways are triggered during fetal development, due to chorioamnionitis or in utero inflammatory conditions, IL-17A can instigate and/or exacerbate fetal inflammatory responses that increase neonatal morbidities and mortality associated with common neonatal conditions such as sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This review details the ontogeny of IL-17A in the fetus and newborn, discusses how derangements in its production can lead to pathology, and describes known and evolving therapies that may attenuate IL-17A-mediated human conditions.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most prevalent sequelae of premature birth, for which therapeutic options are currently limited. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a potential therapy for prevention or reversal of BPD. Series of cases: We report on two infants with severe BPD in whom off-label treatment with repeated intravenous doses of allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs were administered. We analyzed the temporal profile of serum and tracheal cytokines and growth factors as well as safety, tolerability and clinical response. The administration of repeated intravenous doses of MSCs in two human babies with severe and advanced BPD was feasible and safe and was associated with a decrease of pro-inflammatory molecules and lung injury biomarkers. Both patients were at very advanced stages of BPD with very severe lung fibrosis and did not survive the disease. Conclusion(s): MSCs are a promising therapy for BPD, but they should be administered in early stages of the disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Progesterone prophylaxis is widely used to prevent preterm birth but is not licensed and there is little information on long-term outcome. Objective(s): To determine the effect of progesterone prophylaxis in women at high risk of preterm birth on obstetric, neonatal and childhood outcomes. Design(s): Double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. Setting(s): Obstetric units in the UK and Europe between February 2009 and April 2013. Participant(s): Women with a singleton pregnancy who are at high risk of preterm birth because of either a positive fibronectin test or a negative fibronectin test, and either previous spontaneous birth at <= 34 weeks+0 of gestation or a cervical length of <= 25 mm. Intervention(s): Fibronectin test at 18+0 to 23+0 weeks of pregnancy to determine risk of preterm birth. Eligible women were allocated (using a web-based randomisation portal) to 200 mg of progesterone or placebo, taken vaginally daily from 22+0 to 24+0 until 34+0 weeks' gestation. Participants, caregivers and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment until data collection was complete. Main Outcome Measure(s): There were three primary outcomes, as follows: (1) obstetric - fetal death or delivery before 34+0 weeks' gestation; (2) neonatal - a composite of death, brain injury on ultrasound scan (according to specific criteria in the protocol) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia; and (3) childhood - the Bayley-III cognitive composite score at 22-26 months of age. Result(s): In total, 96 out of 600 (16%) women in the progesterone group and 108 out of 597 (18%) women in the placebo group had the primary obstetric outcome [odds ratio (OR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.22]. Thirty-nine out of 589 (7%) babies of women in the progesterone group and 60 out of 587 (10%) babies of women in the placebo group experienced the primary neonatal outcome [OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.03]. The mean Bayley-III cognitive composite score of the children at 2 years of age was 97.3 points [standard deviation (SD) 17.9 points; n = 430] in the progesterone group and 97.7 points (SD 17.5 points; n = 439) in the placebo group (difference in means -0.48, 95% CI -2.77 to 1.81). Limitation(s): Overall compliance with the intervention was 69%. Harms: There were no major harms, although there was a trend of more deaths from trial entry to 2 years in the progesterone group (20/600) than in the placebo group (16/598) (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.42). Conclusion(s): In this study, progesterone had no significant beneficial or harmful effects on the primary obstetric, neonatal or childhood outcomes.The OPPTIMUM trial is now complete. We intend to participate in a comprehensive individual patient-level data meta-analysis examining women with a singleton pregnancy with a variety of risk factors for preterm birth. Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN14568373. Funding(s): This trial was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and managed by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) on behalf of the MRC-NIHR partnership.Copyright © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most challenging chronic lung disease for prematurity, with difficulties in early identification. Given lncRNA emerging as a novel biomarker and the regulator of ferroptosis, this study aims to develop a BPD predictive model based on ferroptosis-related lncRNAs (FRLs)., METHODS: Using a rat model, we firstly explored mRNA levels of ferroptosis-related genes and ferrous iron accumulation in BPD rat lungs. Subsequently, a microarray dataset of umbilical cord tissue from 20 preterm infants with BPD and 34 preterm infants without BPD were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Random forest and LASSO regression were conducted to identify diagnostic FRLs. Nomogram was used to construct a predictive BPD model based on the FRLs. Finally, umbilical cord blood lymphocytes of preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestational age and term infants were collected and determined the expression level of diagnostic FRLs by RT-qPCR., RESULTS: Increased iron accumulation and several dysregulated ferroptosis-associated genes were found in BPD rat lung tissues, indicating that ferroptosis was participating in the development of BPD. By exploring the microarray dataset of preterm infants with BPD, 6 FRLs, namely LINC00348, POT1-AS1, LINC01103, TTTY8, PACRG-AS1, LINC00691, were determined as diagnostic FRLs for modeling. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of the model was 0.932, showing good discrimination of BPD. In accordance with our analysis of microarray dataset, the mRNA levels of FRLs were significantly upregulated in umbilical cord blood lymphocytes from preterm infants who had high risk of BPD., CONCLUSION: The incorporation of FRLs into a predictive model offers a non-invasive approach to show promise in improving early detection and management of this challenging chronic lung disease in premature infant, enabling timely intervention and personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common complication of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants, and inflammatory regulation plays a role in the development of the BPD. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has an important role in airway inflammation and therefore can be used as a marker of airway injury. The study aimed to compare the changes between IL-6 and oxidative stress marker with 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) from serum and tracheal aspiration (TA) in VLBW preterm infants following development of BPD., METHODS: This birth cohort study enrolled 80 VLBW preterm infants, including 26 who developed BPD. All infants completed the study and survived at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. IL-6 and 8-OHdG concentrations from serum and TA on Day 1 and Day 28 after birth were measured using immunoassay., RESULTS: IL-6 and 8-OHdG in serum and TA were higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group on the 1st day after birth (p < 0.05). The IL-6 and 8-OHdG levels in TA fluid were persistently increased on the 28th day of life in the BPD group (p < 0.05). The TA IL-6 was positively correlated with 8-OHdG levels on the 1st day (r = 0.64, p < 0.05) and 28th day of life (r = 0.76, p < 0.05). Based on receiver operating characteristic curves as a predictor of BPD development, TA IL-6 (cutoff, 456.8 pg/mg) had 81.5% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity, whereas TA 8-OHdG (cutoff, 4.4 ng/mg) had a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 64.4%., CONCLUSION: Persistent inflammation with oxidative DNA damage in the respiratory tract may be a crucial mechanism in BPD.

AB  - The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is currently undefined, however apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is considered as a key mechanism. The present study was performed in a BPD rat model to determine the role of ER stress-induced apoptosis. In total, 48 preterm Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups that included the BPD group and the control group. The rats in the BPD group were continually exposed to 85% hyperoxia, during the time that the rats in the control group were exposed to room air. Eight rats in each group were euthanized at 7, 14, and 21 days after exposure. Alveolarization was assessed by performing radial alveolar counts (RAC). Apoptosis in lung cells was evaluated by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect pulmonary expression of ER chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78), ER stress-associated apoptosis proteins c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and the caspase-12. Compared with the control group, hyperoxia exposure resulted in lower RAC and significant apoptosis. Furthermore, BPD rats were found to have increased mRNA and protein expression of GRP78, caspase-12, CHOP, and JNK. These data demonstrate that ER stress-induced apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of BPD.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate the association between vaginal Ureaplasma species (spp.) and the subsequent occurrence of chorioamnionitis (CAM), perinatal death, neonatal morbidity, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments (NDIs) at 3 years of age. We analyzed 55 pregnant women with singleton pregnancy who had preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) at < 28+0 weeks of gestation, and delivered between 22+0 and 31+6 weeks at our tertiary hospital in 2007-2016. NDIs were defined as either cerebral palsy or developmental delay evaluated at 1.5 and/or 3 years old. The presence of Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis were evaluated using urea-arginine broth and Mycoplasma PPLO Agar. The presence of Ureaplasma spp. in the vagina was positive in 41%. Vaginal Ureaplasma spp. was a significant risk factor for CAM; however, it was not significantly associated with the occurrence of perinatal death, pulmonary hypoplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia defined as oxygen required and occasional ventilatory assistance required at week 36 as modified (BPD36), or NDIs. The crude odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of Ureaplasma spp. for the occurrence of CAM was 9.5 (1.10-82) (p = 0.041). In very preterm birth infants with pPROM, CAM, BPD36, and NDIs occurred in 78, 60, and 36%, respectively. Vaginal Ureaplasma spp. was a significant risk factor for CAM in very preterm birth infants with pPROM. The incidences of BPD36 and NDIs in such infants were very high, nearing 3/5 and 1/3, respectively.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are mainly created by hyperoxia exposure. However, these models do not fully recapitulate BPD pathophysiology as observed in clinical practice. To find a better BPD model, we established a rat 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model and analyzed the pathologic features of the lungs. Method(s): The rat OIR model was established by exposing newborn rats (P0) to 50% and 10% oxygen (hyperoxia and hypoxia) on alternating days for 14 days. Lungs were harvested immediately on postnatal day 14 (P14) and on P18 after 4 days of normoxia exposure for hematoxylin and eosin staining, antialpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) immunohistochemistry and Picrosirius red staining of collagen. Retinas were obtained to confirm successful model establishment by isolectin B4 staining of retinal vasculature. Result(s): OIR rats presented with fewer and enlarged alveoli, and the septal walls were thicker than those in age-matched controls. alpha-SMA immunohistochemistry indicated increased abundance of myofibroblasts in OIR rats. At P18, alpha-SMA-positive myofibroblasts were present at extremely low levels from the alveolar walls of control rats, while OIR rats showed myofibroblast persistence. The amount of collagen in OIR rats was also higher than that in control rats at both P14 and P18 as evidenced by Picrosirius red staining. Conclusion(s): Alveolar changes observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, prolonged and stronger alpha-SMA expression and augmented collagen accumulation resemble the histopathology of BPD, suggesting that the rat 50/10 OIR model is suitable for use in BPD research.Copyright © 2018 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation

AB  - The patient was born at 25 5/7 weeks of gestation to a 25-year-old mother and a 26-year-old father. The parents are healthy, African American, and denied consanguinity. Prenatal history was unremarkable until dilated and short cervix was noted at 25 weeks by ultrasound. Nonreassuring fetal heart tracing resulted in delivery though cesarean section. She was admitted to the neonatal ICU, required intubation for 4 days, and oxygen supplementation through nasal cannula for 3 months until discharge. During this time, she was noted to have abnormal posturing and limited pronation and supination of forearms bilaterally. Radiographs showed radioulnar synostosis (Fig. 1). She developed amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia during early infancy, requiring weekly platelet and monthly packed red blood cell transfusions. The patient presented to our institution for bone marrow transplant evaluation at 6 months of age. Clinical genetics consultation was requested because of features including epicanthal folds, short philtrum, overlapping fingers, and acetabular dysplasia (Fig. 1). Features related to prematurity were noted, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, patent foramen ovale with mild pulmonary stenosis, and bilateral nephrocalcinosis. Bone marrow transplant was performed at 9 months of age, after which the patient's condition stabilized. The transplant was complicated by grade 1 mucositis and cutaneous graft versus host disease, which resolved with treatment. The patient is meeting milestones when corrected for prematurity and is doing well at 15 months. She maintains limited elbow pronation and supination, overlapping fingers, and diminished extension at the interphalangeal joints of the middle fingers (Fig. 1). Radiographs at 21 months showed bilateral bowing and overlapping proximal ulna and radius with dysplastic appearance of the proximal radial metaphysis. There is fusion of the partially ossified right capitate and hamate and questionable fusion of the same carpal bones on the left (Fig. 1). Hearing tests performed in office showed no evidence of sensorineural or conductive hearing loss.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a form of chronic lung disease of infancy, which mostly affects premature infants with significant morbidity and mortality. Premature infants who require to be treated for conditions including respiratory distress syndrome have a higher risk of developing BPD. In spite of the improvement in clinical methods, the incidence of BPD has not reduced. In the present review, the pathogenesis of BPD is described along with the treatments available at present and the role of nursing in the management of BPD. Emerging preventive therapies for BPD are also discussed, including the use of recombinant human superoxide dismutase, which has been proven effective in reducing respiratory injury and its long-term effects.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate factors affecting N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) in preterm infants and the ability of NTproBNP to predict haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HsPDA). Prospective cohort study of 51 infants < 30 weeks gestation. Blood NTproBNP and heart ultrasound were performed on day of life 3, 10, 28 and 36 weeks corrected age. NTproBNP levels analysed for prediction of HsPDA. The effect of gestational age, ventilation, hypoxia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), creatinine and haemoglobin levels on NTproBNP levels were investigated. Infants with HsPDA had higher mean (SD) day 3 NTproBNP (1840 pmol/L (1058) versus 178 pmol/L (140) p < 0.001). Receiver operator curves of day 3 NTproBNP for prediction of day 3 and day 10 HsPDA had an area under the curve of 0.98 and 0.94, respectively. A chosen day 3 NTproBNP value of >= 287 pmol/L for the prediction of day 3 HsPDA correctly classified 92% (sensitivity 92%, specificity 92%). NTproBNP demonstrated only modest ability to predict severe BPD. Chronological but not gestational age affected NTproBNP. Ventilation, hypoxia and haemoglobin levels did not influence NTproBNP but creatinine level was positively correlated. Conclusion(s): Day 3 NTproBNP is a useful biomarker to predict HsPDA and may be a valuable tool in future trial design.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Hyperoxia induces activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in newborn rat lungs. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on lung development and RAS expression in neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxia. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to either room air (RA) or oxygen-enriched atmosphere (O2) treatment from postnatal days 1 to 14. Human MSCs (1 x 105 cells) in 0.03 mL of normal saline (NS) were administered intratracheally on postnatal day 5, and four study groups were obtained: RA + NS, RA + MSCs, O2 + NS, and O2 + MSCs. The lungs were excised for cytokine, expression of RAS components, and histological analyses on postnatal day 14. Body and lung weights were significantly lower in rats reared in hyperoxia than in those reared in RA. The rats reared in hyperoxia and treated with NS exhibited significantly higher tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 levels, mean linear intercept (MLI), and expression of angiotensin II, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, and angiotensin-converting enzyme than those reared in RA and treated with NS or MSCs did. Administering MSC to hyperoxia-exposed rats reduced TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels, improved MLI, and decreased expression of angiotensin II, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, and angiotensin-converting enzyme to normoxic levels. Thus, human MSCs attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung injury through inhibition of the RAS in newborn rats.Copyright © 2018, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is one of the most significant pathologies, which affects life quality of preterm infants. More than 50 years, scientists from all over the world have shed light on most of the issues related to BPD. Despite these remarkable advances in the study of this issue, many knowledge gaps and blind spots still present in the comprehension of BPD and require more detailed study. Material(s) and Method(s): We had provided literature review of up to date information about BPD for clear understanding of unsolved issues. Results and discussion: Analysis of various literary sources has shown that today there is disparate information on many issues concerning BPD. A review of the world and local literature has shown that the available evidence base on the therapy of patients with BPD only affects the management of patients during the newborn stage and recommendations for the management of this category of patients at home. Conclusion(s): We had find lack of information about postneonatal period management and intensive care. BPD is still an actual issue for study.Copyright © 2018 Drug Invention Today.

AB  - Objective: To find out the incidence and associations of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm neonates. Design(s): Descriptive cohort. Method(s): All consecutively born neonates <33 weeks gestation requiring oxygen or respiratory support during first 3 days of life were enrolled from a level III neonatal unit in Chandigarh, India. Those with malformations were excluded. Placenta was examined for histological chorioamnionitis in preterm rupture of membranes and/or preterm spontaneous onset of labour. Serum Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase levels were estimated on day 3 of life. All recruited neonates were followed up till discharge or death. Result(s): Out of 250 neonates enrolled, 170 (68%) survived till day 28 and BPD developed in 19 (11.2%) infants. The mean gestation and birth weight were significantly lower in infants who developed BPD. Chorioamnionitis (clinical 5.3% vs 1.9%, P=0.375; and histological 37.5% vs 16.7%, P<0.001), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (52.6% vs 8.9%, P<0.001), median (IQR) sepsis episodes [2 (2,3) vs 1 (1,2), P<0.001], invasive ventilation (84.2% vs 11.3%, P<0.001), and duration of ventilation [56 (4) d vs 4 (5) d, P=0.001] were significantly higher in infants with BPD. Serum MDA, SOD and Catalase levels were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion(s): Chorioamnionitis, PDA and sepsis were significantly associated with BPD.Copyright © 2017, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - In bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), decreased angiogenesis and alveolarization is associated with pulmonary cell death and inflammation. It is commonly observed in premature infants who required mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. Since enhanced interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression has been reported in infants with BPD, it was hypothesized that a decrease in IL-6 may enhance lung inflammation and decrease hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury in mice. In the current study, newborn wild-type (WT) and IL-6 null mice were treated with 85% O2 (hyperoxia) or 21% O2 (normoxia) for 96 h. Although the increased volume and decreased quantity of alveoli was triggered by hyperoxia in WT and IL-6 null mice, transcription and translation of proinflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-10, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and pulmonary cell death (caspase stimulation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining) were significantly enhanced in IL-6 null mice compared with WT mice. These results suggest that the crosstalk between inflammation and cell death may be involved in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in BPD. Future treatment approaches for bronchopulmonary dysplasia should be based on the suppression of cytokine expression.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication in preterm newborns. It occurs due to early exposure to high-oxygen and ventilation therapy. The mechanisms of disrupted alveolarization and vascular development associated with BPD were unclear. Deferoxamine (DFO) has been reported to reduce mortality and lung injury in mice after chlorine exposure. The effect of DFO in the treatment of BPD has not been explored. This study aimed to investigate the effect of aerosolized DFO administration in a mouse model of BPD. A mouse model of oxygen-induced BPD was established by postnatal hyperoxia (75% oxygen for 7 days) and DFO [17 mg/(kg.day)] (BPD+D) or aerosolized vehicle (BPD+V) administered for 14 days. The mice were anesthetized and sacrificed after 14 days treatment before removing the lungs for analysis. An exogenous continuous aerosol of DFO exerted a biological effect on BPD mice. The BPD+DFO group showed a better weight gain compared with the BPD+V group. Furthermore, the treatment of DFO exhibited a reduced pathological severity and increase expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and CD31, and activated downstream vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. The results showed that C57BL/6 mice exposed to hyperoxic environment and treated with aerosolized of DFO solution, obviously promoted the pulmonary vascularization and alveolarization. The HIF-1alpha/VEGF signaling pathway mediated this process. The findings indicated that treatment with an exogenous continuous aerosol of DFO might be a potential therapeutic strategy for BPD.Copyright © 2018, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by the premature arrest of alveolar development. Antenatal exposure to inflammation inhibits lung morphogenesis, thereby increasing the risk for the development of BPD. Here, we investigated whether vitamin D (VitD) enhances alveolar development in antenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats, which is a model for BPD. We used an established animal model of BPD, and random assignment to the control group, LPS group, or LPS with VitD group. Levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin-4 were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IFN-gamma producing CD8+ T cells were assessed by flow cytometry, and the methylation status of the VitD-response element (VDRE) was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing PCR. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in maternal serum samples collected from 86 pregnant women in a prospective birth cohort enrolled from 2012 to 2013. Our results showed that VitD effectively alleviated the simplification of the lung alveolar structure in BPD rats and suppressed LPS-induced IFN-gamma expression in the lung and spleen tissues. Further investigation revealed that VitD suppressed IFN-gamma production in CD8+ T cells. Specifically, VitD increased the methylation percentage of the VDRE in the IFN-gamma-promoter region and suppressed LPS-induced expression of IFN-gamma. Additionally, we observed an association between maternal VitD exposure during pregnancy and neonatal IFN-gamma levels in a prospective birth cohort, with a trend similar to that observed in the animal model. Our data suggested that supplementation of VitD could suppress IFN-gamma production, resulting in improved alveolar development in an LPS-induced BPD rat model.Copyright © 2018 Liu, Chen, Li, Huang and Zhang.

AB  - Background Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with preterm birth in singletons, particularly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and intraventricular haemorrhage. The evidence regarding the beneficial effects of ACS in twin pregnancies is less clear. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of ACS on neonatal mortality and morbidity in twins at risk of preterm (<37 weeks gestation) birth. Methods A cohort study design was used to analyse anonymised routinely collected data on all twin deliveries between 1996 and 2014 as recorded in the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank. Those who received ACS (dexamethasone or betamethasone) and those who did not were classified as exposed and unexposed respectively. Outcomes included: stillbirth, neonatal death, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, as well as specific neonatal events, namely, RDS, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, neonatal seizure and necrotising enterocolitis. A composite adverse outcome variable was created for neonates with one or more of the pre-specified neonatal events. Multilevel mixed-effect generalized linear models were used to evaluate effect of ACS on neonatal morbidity and mortality. Associations are presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Propensity score matched fixed effects models were used to account for confounding by indication. Results The study included 3312 babies; 1686 babies whose mothers had received ACS and 1626 babies whose mothers had not. The propensity score matched fixed effects model showed that ACS administration was not significantly associated with RDS [RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.67, 1.27)], bronchopulmonary dysplasia [RR 1.05 (0.78, 1.41)] or the composite adverse neonatal outcome [RR 1.11 (0.92, 1.34)]. ACS administration was associated with a reduction in still-birth rate [RR 0.46 (0.30, 0.69)] but associated with increased admission to neonatal unit [RR 1.23 (1.07, 1.40)], intraventricular haemorrhage [RR 2.4 (1.15, 5.02)] and neonatal deaths [RR 3.15 (1.34, 7.39)]. Conclusion This study suggests that ACS (using the same administration protocols as for singleton pregnancy) is associated with a significant reduction in stillbirth rate in twins but with an increased rate of neonatal death, intraventricular haemorrhage and neonatal unit admission. There was no effect on the rates of RDS and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It is possible that twin pregnancies respond to ACS differently from singletons. There is a need for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of ACS in multiple pregnancies and to find the optimum dose and timing for this to be effective.

AB  - Background: Data characterizing the co-occurrence of complications of prematurity, and associated clinical and economic burden, among extremely preterm infants (born at gestational age [GA] < 28 weeks) are limited. Objective(s): To evaluate the co-occurrence of medical claims for complications of prematurity among extremely preterm infants in the US, and assess the impact on clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization. Design/Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of the US Premier Perspective hospital claims database. Infants born at GA <28 weeks with an admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during birth hospitalization, and with discharge to home (no transfer to another facility) or death after 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), were identified during 2009-2015. Cohorts were created based on the presence of 0, 1, or >2 complications of prematurity (from the following 5: retinopathy of prematurity [ROP], bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD], intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH], hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia). Complications were identified based on primary or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes during the index hospitalization. A limitation is that hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia may not have been coded consistently due to the brevity of symptoms in relation to a long hospitalization. In-hospital mortality after 36 weeks PMA, length of stay, readmission rates, charges and costs were determined for each of these cohorts. Result(s): 12,050 extremely preterm infants were included in the analysis; of these, 20.4% had no complications, 34.8% had 1, and 44.9% had >2. By individual complication, 49.7% had ROP (any stage), 40.9% had BPD, 29.0% had IVH (any grade), 10.1% had hyperglycemia, and 14.2% had hypoglycemia. Sex and race were similar across cohorts (Table 1). The number of complications increased with decreasing GA. Severity of ROP and IVH was generally higher among infants with concurrent complications: 14.7% of infants with >2 complications had ROP stage >3 vs 4.2% of infants with 1 complication; 14.3% of infants with >2 complications had IVH grades 3-4 vs 3.8% of infants with 1 complication. Infants with >2 complications were more likely to have co-occurrence of ROP, BPD or IVH (BPD/ROP: 51.1%; IVH/ROP: 35.6%; BPD/IVH 30.7%) than a combination of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with ROP, BPD or IVH (ROP/hypoglycemia: 16.8%; ROP/hyperglycemia: 14.3%; BPD/hypoglycemia 13.9%; BPD/hyperglycemia 12.1% IVH/hypoglycemia 8.8% IVH/hyperglycemia 8.1%). In-hospital mortality after 36 weeks PMA, 1-year readmission, length of stay, healthcare charges, and costs were generally increased with co-occurrence of complications, and were substantially higher among those with >2 complications than among those with 0 or 1 complication (Table 2). Conclusion(s): This analysis of US claims data indicates that complications of prematurity frequently co-occur. Co-occurrence is associated with increased severity of complications, and with an incremental increase in mortality, 1-year readmission, length of hospital stay and costs.

AB  - Background and purpose: Of the animal models used for the study of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the rodent has advantages over other species: At birth the rats have a stage of lung development equivalent to that of premature humans; in addition, their reproductive cycles and gestation period are of short duration (O'Reilly, 2015). Most animal models use hyperoxia cycles, but introducing intermittent episodes of hypoxemia (inspiratory oxygen fraction of 8% to 10%) mimics more closely the clinical scenario to which preterm infants are exposed, and the deleterious effect of hyperoxia is potentiated (Berger & Bhandari, 2014). We sought to generate a model of BPD based on Ratner's hyperoxia/hypoxia model (Ratner et al., 2007), to evaluate the histopathological and morphometric changes and measure the expression levels of genes associated with the development of BPD. Method(s): All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Tecnologico de Monterrey, and were approved by our institution's independent institutional review board. One-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Harlan Laboratories) were maintained at the vivarium of the school of Medicine, housed in cages kept on a 12 h light-dark cycle at 24 degree C. Dams were permitted food and water ad libitum and pups were reared with alternate dams during the time of experimentation. Litter size ranged from 8 to 12 pups. We followed closely the model described by Ratner in 2007, with a modification consisting of terminating the exposure on the 13th postnatal day instead of the 14th. Result(s): Hyperoxia-hypoxia exposure resulted in a significantly decreased bodyweight at the 12th day of exposure, and survival rate of exposed pups was 80% on day 13, compared to un-exposed littermates. On radial alveolar count (RAC), exposed pups exhibited poor alveolar septation and enlarged terminal air sacks. The RAC median was 3 on exposed group and 6 in the unexposed group, p = 0.01, U Mann-Whitney test. We found significant changes in the gene expression of BPD associated biomarkers in exposed pups at the end of the experiment; monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (ccl2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp1), angiopoietin 1 (angpt1), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), fibroblast growth factor (fgf), hypoxia inducible factor-1 (hif1), transforming growth factor a1 (tgf-a1), keratinocyte growth factor (kgf), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 precursor (flt-1) compared to age-matched unexposed controls. Conclusion(s): Our model resembles human disease. Significant modifications were observed in the expression of biomarkers and damage generation, manifest as a decreased alveolar count in the group exposed to hyperoxia/hypoxia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic debilitating lung disease of preterm infants leading to arrested alveolar development with long term morbidity and high mortality. Current therapies lack effectiveness and cause undesirable side effects. Our work utilizing bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells conditioned-media (MSC-CM) have shown protective effects in mouse BPD models. Analysis of the MSC-CM identified Osteopontin (Opn) and Macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf1), as key mediatros (biomarkers) leading to protection against BPD. Our pilot feasibility study demonstrated feasibility of detection of Opn and Csf1 in tracheal aspirate fluid (TAF) of preterm infants via immunoassay. Objective(s): We hypothesized that the lack of above MSC biomarkers at birth leads to development of BPD via uncontrolled TGF-b1 activity. Our objectives were to determine the levels of Opn, Csf1, and active TGF-b1 in the TAF of preterm infants in the first week of life and correlate them with later development and severity of BPD. Design/Methods: Infants less than 32 weeks' gestational age and/or less than 1500 gms birth weight who were intubated within 24 hours of life were enrolled into the study. The first TAF sample was obtained at intubation before any exogenous surfactant administration. The second sample was obtained at extubation or on the 4th day of life if still intubated. Levels of Opn, Csf1, TGF-b1, and secretory IgA were analyzed using immunoassay. Secretory IgA was used as control to correct for TAF volume. Infants were followed prospectively for outcome data including the development of BPD (oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age). Result(s): To date, 29 infants have been enrolled and TAF samples obtained. Subjects were similar in their baseline maternal and neonatal characteristics. Standard curves were used from our pilot study to analyze data. 19 of 29 subjects developed BPD. Levels of Opn and Csf1 were lower at birth for BPD infants when compared with infants who did not develop BPD (Opn 9 versus 18 ng/mL; Csf1 2010 versus 3266 pg/mL). BPD infants failed to suppress M1 macrophage surge with a higher TGF-b1 levels when compared with infants who did not develop BPD (TGF-b1 153 versus 123 pg/mL). Conclusion(s): MSC biomarkers, Opn and Csf1, prevent BPD at birth by suppression of lung inflammation (M1 macrophage surge and active TGF-b1). Further work is underway to determine the target pathways involved in BPD protection.

AB  - Introduction: Ovarian stimulation syndrome (OSS) in an infrequent disorder, in preterm infants under 30 weeks gestation. The are very few cases described in the literature. The immaturity, lack of gonadal axis feed-back or mutations in the FSH receptor genes, may explain its physiopathology. We present the case of a 26-week neonate with this syndrome. Case summary: 26-week newborn with extremely low weight (460g) born by emergency cesarean section due to severe maternal preeclampsia with loss of fetal wellbeing. She had an Apgar 4/6. She needed to be admitted to NICU for 3 months, where she was hemodinamically stable and presented pathologies due to her immaturity, such as: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis grade 1, and cerebral haemorrhage grade IV. At 2 months of age genital swelling began to appeared, including clitoris, minor and major labia, reaching upper part of inferior extremities and hypogastrium. An ultrasound was performed to rule out vascular and lymphatic pathology. Some investigations were performed: kidney and liver function, electrolytes and proteins, and all of them were normal. Hormonal investigations shown elevated serum oestradiol levels (232pg/mL), LH (14UI/L), and FSH (25,2UI/L), 17. OH-progesterone levels were normal. An ovarian ultrasound was performed finding a normal uterus size and morphology (20x10x10mm), normal right ovary and a simple cyst (18mm) in the left ovary. We decided to maintain an expectant attitude. When she was discharged the edema was limited to genital area. She had monthly follow-up observing a progressive disappearance of the edema. Conclusion(s): A pathognomonic sign characterizes OSS, which is edema. Ovarian cysts are observed in most of the cases described in the literature. It is convenient to identify this disorder by clinical signs to avoid both performing useless investigations and misdiagnosis. It is also important to know that it does not need treatment.

AB  - Background: Despite advances in neonatal care, management of infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD) remains dificult. Objective(s): To describe the multidisciplinary care model and five-year outcomes of the Newborn and Infant Chronic Lung Disease (NeoCLD) Program at The Children's Hospital Of Philadelphia (CHOP). Methods/Results: The CHOP NeoCLD program was established in 2010 to improve the care of infants with extremely severe BPD. Given the chronic and multi-system involvement nature of this disease, we took a complex care multidisciplinary team approach for this program. The care team includes a broad set of health care professionals including physicians from neonatology, pulmonary medicine, cardiology, general surgery, ENT, and also nurses, dieticians, respiratory therapists, physical/occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, case managers and psychosocial support team. Team members work closely together through multidisciplinary rounds, case conferences and frequent family interactions. A series of educational activities was carried out to increase knowledge level of nurses and front-line clinicians. In addition, a prospective data set was created to track patient information and outcome. For each infant demographic data, presence of pulmonary hypertension (diagnosed by echocardiogram or CT-angiography), need for iNO or other pulmonary vasodilators, and discharge condition including tracheostomy placement, gastric tube/fundoplication, and discharge respiratory support were collected. A total of 223 premature infants with sBPD were consecutively admitted. Mean gestational age was 26 2.1 weeks (+SD) and birth weight 771 358 grams. Mean PMA at referral was 39 8 weeks. One hundred and twenty infants (53.8%) were diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. Severe airway malacia and stenosis was identified in 57 infants (25.7%). A total of 110 infants were treated with iNO (49.3%). Despite extremely severe BPD, the majority of these infants (85.2%) survived till NICU discharge. Of the 190 survived infants, 72 (37.9%) infants required mechanical ventilation via tracheotomy and only 37 (19.5%) were discharged without any respiratory support. Sixty (26.9%) infants were discharged on sildenafil, and 115 (60.5%) infants underwent gastrostomy with or without fundoplication to manage severe reflux and feeding dificulties. Conclusion(s): In addition to severe lung disease, the medical course of infants in this cohort was complicated by high rates of airway pathology, pulmonary vascular disease, and feeding dificulty. The care needs of infants with sBPD are significant and extend beyond discharge. A complex care multidisciplinary team management is important for successful survival and continuation of proper management beyond NICU discharge in this patient population.

AB  - Background Hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). NrF2-mediated induction of NADPH quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and other phase II antioxidant enzymes are known to protect the tissues from hyperoxic injury. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that sulforaphane will protect human pulmonary cells from hyperoxic toxicity via NrF2-mediated mechanisms, and that cells carrying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NrF2 gene will display decreased inducibility by sulforaphane. Design/Methods: H441 cells grown in room air were transfected with plasmids containing the wild type or mutated Nrf2/NQO1 promoters and treated with various concentrations of sulforaphane or DMSO. Transcriptional activation of Nrf2 was studied using the dual luciferase assay. In another experiment, H441 cells were grown in room air or hyperoxic conditions (80%O2 5%CO2) and were treated with DMSO or 1 uM sulforaphane. MTT assay and cell counts were performed to assess the cell viability. Result(s): Sulforaphane induced NrF2 and NQO1 promoter activity in H441 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion (Figure 1). We also found that cells with wild type NrF2 gene had 20-30% induction of promoter activity with sulforaphane. In cells carrying each of the 6 mutants of the Nrf2 gene, there was a significant attenuation of the basal promoter activity. However, the cells containing the mutant Nrf2 constructs were still inducible. Sulforaphane significantly increased cell viability compared to controls upon exposure to hyperoxia at 12 h as determined by cell number and at 24 h as determined by the MTT assay (figure 2). Conclusion(s): Our experiments support the hypothesis that sulforaphane protects human pulmonary cells from hyperoxic toxicity via NrF2-mediated mechanisms. Further studies may help to develop innovative strategies that can lead to the prevention and/or treatment of BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most frequent causes of long-term morbidities in preterm infants. Many factors including prematurity, mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, or genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of BPD. Among these factors, antenatal infection and inflammation also play an important role. During the inflammatory process, which emerges as a result of different causes as prenatal, postnatal infection, mechanical ventilation, hypoxic injury, and hyperoxic damage many proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines play a role. Some studies have investigated the correlation between BPD and proinflammatory cytokines as interleukin (IL)-1, -6, -8, TNF-alpha, and anti-inflammatory cytokines as IL-10. Some studies have also demonstrated the potentially significant role of IGF-1, which involves pulmonary alveolarization and healing of tissue injuries, in the development of BPD. Lower levels of IGF-1 at birth have been shown to increase stepwise during the first 8 weeks of life, whereas others described an association between decrease in IGF-I levels during early postnatal period and development of BPD. Serum IGF-1 levels increase in line with gestational age; however, in infants who developed BPD, the IGF-1 levels do not increase. Also, in infants who develop BPD, serum IGF-1 levels are reported significantly lower when compared with those without BPD. In the light of these data, IGF-1 has been thought to play a role in the development of BPD by effecting alveolar angiogenesis especially through VEGF signalization. In this study, we aimed to assess the correlations between the development of BPD in premature infants, IGF-1 levels in serum, and tracheal aspirate (TA) and cytokine levels in TA measured at different time steps postnatally. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled premature infants born at <= 32 gestational weeks who were hospitalized and followed up in the NICU. On postnatal 1st, 3rd, 7th, 21st, and 28th days, serum IGF-1 levels and IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels in tracheal aspirate fluid samples of those infants being intubated were examined. Tracheal aspirate samples were collected during routine endotracheal suction on the first day of life. Result(s): A total of 40 premature neonates were studied. Mean gestational age was 29.41 +/- 2.23 weeks, and their mean birth weight was 1,256.85 +/- 311.48 g. BPD was detected in 35% of cases. Mean gestational week and birth weight of the cases that developed BPD were 30 +/- 3 weeks and 1,150 +/- 295 g, respectively. Serum IGF-1 levels on postnatal 1st, 3rd, 7th, 21st, and 28th days in cases that developed BPD were found to be statistically significantly lower when compared with those without BPD (p < 0.01). Levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha in tracheal aspirate samples were significantly higher in cases with BPD than levels of cases without BPD (p < 0.05), whereas IGF-1 levels in these samples did not differ statistically significantly based on the presence of BPD (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): According to our data, lower serum IGF-1 levels during the first month of life are associated with development and severity of BPD. In turn, such association is not detected as for what concerns tracheal aspirate levels. However, increased cytokine levels in tracheal aspirate samples are detected in preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - The objective of this study was to reveal hub pathway cross-talk for premature newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) based on the pathway enrichment analysis and Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV) method. The inference of key pathway cross-talk consisted of four parts: i) Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs); ii) detecting differentially expressed pathways (DEPs); iii) computing discriminating score (DS) for each pair of DEPs or cross-talk and investigating seed cross-talk through the random forest (RF) algorithm and iv) extracting hub cross-talk dependent on the MCCV method. The results showed that a total of 132 DEGs and 137 DEPs were obtained across BPD patients and normal controls. Using the DS and RF algorithm, 10 seed DEP cross-talk were detected. By conducting the MCCV on seed cross-talk, 3 hub cross-talk for BPD were uncovered: i) The pair of pathways role of interleukin-17F (IL-17F) in allergic inflammatory airway diseases and role of IL-17A in psoriasis; ii) the pair of pathways role of IL random forest 17A in psoriasis and IL-17A signaling in fibroblasts and ii) the pair of pathways IL-17A signaling in airway cells and role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in the pathogenesis of influenza. These 3 hub cross-talk among DEPs might give an insight to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the premature newborns with BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Development of inflammatory reactions (biotrauma) is the primary mechanism of lung injury during mechanical ventilation (MV). Cytokines play a key role in this process. This open randomized study looked at the influence of different methods of respiratory support on interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 serum levels in very preterm infants. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included very preterm infants (gestation age <= 32 weeks) with respiratory distress syndrome who were treated with MV. Within the first 3 days of life, before extubation infants were randomized into two groups: nonsynchronized noninvasive ventilation (NV) (n = 19) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 18). The third group included 10 infants ventilated longer than 3 days (comparison group). The levels of ILs in blood serum were measured by ELISA on the 3rd and 14th days of life. Result(s): Forty-seven infants were studied (19 in the NV and 18 in the CPAP group, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the groups on the 3rd and 14th days of life. However, statistically significant reduction of IL-6 concentrations was observed in the NV group on the 14th day of life compared with the initial ones (p < 0.05). Longer duration of MV (rS = 0.3; p < 0.05), death (rS = 0.3; p < 0.05), incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death (rS = 0.34; p < 0.05) were associated with higher IL-6 levels on the 3rd day of life. Longer duration of noninvasive respiratory support (rS = 0.5; p < 0.05), longer neonatal intensive care unit stay (rS = 0.44; p < 0.05), BPD or death (rS = 0.33; p < 0.05), and moderate BPD (rS = 0.35; p < 0.05) were associated with higher IL-6 levels on the 14th day of life. Levels of IL-8 assessed on the 3rd and 14th days of life did not correlate with total duration of respiratory support, incidence of BPD, or mortality. Conclusion(s): In this study, NV was associated with a statistically significant reduction of serum IL-6 levels in preterm infants within the first 14 days of life as opposed to CPAP and could be protective against BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a major role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and bone metabolism in the body. It is involved in innate and acquired immune responses, autoimmune responses, and suppression of cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, vitamin D regulates cardiovascular function and hormones such as insulin. It is also suspected that vitamin D is involved in embryogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation. In terms of respiratory development, type II alveolar cells express vitamin D receptor and stimulate the synthesis and secretion of surfactant in response to vitamin D. The role of vitamin D in pulmonary development, maturation, and postnatal respiratory disease has become a new field of study. The association between vitamin D deficiency and preterm diseases such as sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is under study. Fetus does not produce vitamin D and relies on transplacental passages. In case of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants, vitamin D deficiency is more common because of the short gestational period, delays in enteral nutrition, and inability to be exposed to sunlight during neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported the association between vitamin D levels at birth and respiratory morbidities in VLBW infants in Korea. In this study, we investigated the incidence and demographic differences of preterm respiratory morbidities according to vitamin D levels at birth (ITable 11). Anzeige Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted in the Soon Chun Hyang University, Bucheon Hospital (South Korea) from November 2013 to November 2017. We collected blood samples on the first day of life from 230 VLBW infants. They were then followed up for detection and reporting of respiratory morbidities. Patients who were (1) transferred to other hospitals (n = 19); (2) died before 36 weeks' gestational age (n = 18); or (3) whose blood samples were not collected immediately after birth (n = 5) were excluded. VLBW infants with different 25 (OH) D levels were compared with regard to demographic features, maternal diseases, respiratory morbidities, and other neonatal diseases. Results and Discussion: A total of 188 patients were enrolled. The mean serum 25(OH) D level at birth was 13.4 +/- 9.3 ng/mL. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency ( < 20 ng/mL) was 79.8%, and 44.1% of preterm infants had severe vitamin D deficiency ( < 10 ng/mL). Out of the 188 preterm infants, 133 (70.7%) developed RDS and 55 (29.3%) developed BPD. Logistic analysis showed that low serum 25(OH) D level ( < 20 ng/mL) was an independent risk factor for RDS (odds ratio [OR]: 4.87, p < 0.0001) BPD (OR: 6.19, p = 0.004), pulmonary hemorrhage (OR: 3.91, p < 0.0001), and retinopathy of prematurity (OR: 6.11, p = 0.016) ([Table 21). Conclusion(s): Our study shows that the occurrence of vitamin D deficiency at birth in preterm, VLBW infants is extremely high, affecting around four out of five such preterm infants. Moreover, a low vitamin D status looks associated with the occurrence of respiratory morbidities in such population; however, the nature of this association needs further elucidation ([Table 31). A limitation of our study is the small study sample; nonetheless, our findings warrant additional studies on the association between vitamin D level and neonatal morbidities.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common sequelae of premature birth. The term was coined by Northway et al. in 1967 to indicate a chronic pulmonary condition observed in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome treated with high oxygen concentrations and mechanical ventilation [1]. This disease, later named "old BPD", was histopathologically characterized by intense airway inflammation, heterogeneous lung injury, and parenchymal fibrosis [2]. Since its first description, the definition of BPD has undergone several revisions. Currently, BPD is most often defined using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consensus criteria based upon oxygen requirement (>=28 days), gestational age (<32 weeks vs >=32 weeks) and severity (mild, moderate, severe) depending on oxygen use and/or respiratory support at 36 weeks postmenstrual age or at 56 days of postnatal age [3]. Nevertheless, efforts are being made to refine this definition [4]. Many advances in neonatal-perinatal medicine (prenatal steroids, surfactant replacement, and gentler ventilation strategies), shifted the demographic characteristics of BPD to extremely preterm infants, born with structurally immature lungs and underdeveloped pulmonary vasculature [5]. The early disruption of normal lung development by preterm birth would evolve into aberrations in both alveolarization and pulmonary vasculogenesis. These abnormalities have defined the concept of "new BPD" which is histopathologically characterized by simplification of the parenchyma and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature [6-9]. Preventive strategies (prevention of infections, optimization of nutrition and ventilation) have been proven to minimize lung injury; nevertheless, to date BPD remains without satisfactory therapies [10]. Currently, research has focused on identification of biomarkers to advance detection, to improve prognostic outcome, and to begin an appropriate treatment that can prevent later complications of BPD. In this regard, the "omics" sciences are promising approaches to identify novel biomarkers. Metabolomics, one of the newer "omics", has the ability to identify changes in metabolites caused by interaction between specific pathophysiological states, gene expression and environment. The application of clinical metabolomics in BPD has been described in literature and the results may be promising [11-14]. This information, combined with data from genetic and epigenetic studies, will contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic tools, the discovery of molecular pathways associated with the development and progression of the disease and the identification of new therapeutic targets. In conclusion, the goal of biomarkers identification should be to obtain tailored therapies for each individual patient, thereby reducing side effects and improving response to treatment.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is seen commonly in preterm neonates. The pathogenesis of this condition remains poorly understood. ADAMTS18 is a member of ADAMTSs that has been implicated in development and various malignancies. Gene array analysis of a murine model of hyperoxic-induced BPD indicated that Admats18 is a novel gene associated with BPD, yet little is known about its actual functions in vivo. Here, we used an Adamts18 knockout (KO) mouse model to further investigate the role of ADAMTS18 in lung development and BPD progression. Adamts18 mRNA was expressed at different stages of lung development, particularly at the tips of growing bronchial branches of embryonic day (E) 14.5. Adamts18 KO mice exhibited occluded small airways, enlarged airspace, and significantly decreased radial alveolar count, leading to alveolar simplification with a reduction in the overall surface area for gas exchange. Aberrant elastin distribution and reduced pulmonary microvasculature were also seen in KO mice. Together, this first characterization of ADAMTS18 in BPD-like lung dysplasia provides new insight to diagnose or treat BPD clinically. (Figure presented).

AB  - Lung-protective pharmacotherapies preventing development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in infants are widely investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of inhaled N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the oxidative and protease imbalance in lungs of newborn guinea pigs under prolonged hyperoxia. The studied groups included: "hyperoxia" (n=12, 70% O2, 14 days), "hyperoxia+NAC" (n=6, 250 mg/kg of NAC introduced by nebulizer on alternate days on hyperoxia exposure), "control" (n=12, room air). Hyperoxia exposure resulted in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by bronchoalveolar lavage cells, 1,9-fold increased level of products reacting with thiobarbituric acid (TBARP), low glutathione peroxidase activity and glutathione (G-SH) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (30% and 68% of controls respectively); elevated alpha1-antitrypsin (A1-AT), neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteases MMP2 and MMP9 in lung homogenates (141%, 286%, 132%, and 176% of controls respectively) (for all p<0,05 versus controls). In "hyperoxia+NAC" group, ROS generation was reduced as compared to group "hyperoxia" (1,9 times, p<0,05); glutathione peroxidase, G-SH, TBARP and elastase levels did not differ significantly from the group "control", the activity of A1-AT was 3,8-fold higher than in controls (p<0,05), MMP2 and MMP9 levels remained elevated. Lung morphometry revealed normal proportion between alveolar spaces and septa area after NAC inhalations. Thus, inhaled NAC caused normalization of redox balance and improved elastase/A1-AT ratio in lungs of newborn guinea pigs exposed to prolonged hyperoxia.

AB  - Background: Premature infants, who require high O, often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a neonatal chronic lung disease, characterized by a reduced alveolarization. Prior studies showed that lung growth arrest is linked to reduced Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor regulating cell pluripotency and survival. Aim(s): To study (1) spatiotemporal expression of Klf4 in type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII) in human and murine lung development; (2) if hyperoxia-induced lung injury is linked to reduced Klf4 in ATII cells. Method(s): (1) Investigation of human fetal and murine lungs. (2) Newborn mice or cultured murine ATII cells (MLE-12) were exposed to 85% O (HYX) or room air (NOX). Klf4 was overexpressed in MLE-12 using sleeping beauty transposon system. Result(s): (1) Klf4 was localized in CDH1 or surfactant protein C (SfptC) positive cells during human and murine lung development, respectively, by immunofluorescence. (2) Decreased SftptC and aquaporin 5 coupled with reduced radial alveolar count and increased mean linear intercept after HYX was related to diminished lung Klf4 gene and protein expression. Lower cell survival of MLE-12 and increased markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition after HYX were linked to reduced Klf4 mRNA and protein abundance. Overexpression of Klf4, however, aggravated the anti-proliferative effect of HYX on MLE-12. Conclusion(s): Our study does not only identify Klf4 in epithelial cells during murine and human lung development, but also as a potential novel regulator of AECII homeostasis in hyperoxia-induced lung injury, and thereby also as a target to enable lung regeneration.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HALI) is one of the major contributor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a devastating lung disease in premature infants, the mechanisms of which are not fully characterized. Here we report that the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is upregulated in hyperoxia exposed neonatal mice lungs as well as in human neonatal lungs with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and BPD as an adaptive response to survive hyperoxia. Inhibition of TREM-1 function using siRNA approach or deletion of TREM-1 gene in mice showed increased alveolar damage and mortality of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice. The treatment of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice with agonistic TREM-1 antibody resulted in decreased lung inflammation, increased alveolarization and was associated with decreased necroptosis regulating protein receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). Mechanistically, we show that TREM-1 alleviates pulmonary alveolar injury and inflammation through down regulating RIPK3 mediated necroptosis in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice. These data show that that activating TREM-1, enhancing angiopoietin 1 signaling or blocking RIPK3 mediated necroptosis pathway may act as new therapeutic interventions to control adverse effects of hyperoxia on the development of BPD.

AB  - Background: Prolonged exposure to increased oxygen induces inflammation, matrix remodeling, and alveolar arrested in lungs of preterm infants, leading to Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been shown to be increased in tracheal aspirates of infants evolving BPD. Aim(s): We hypothesized that activation of IL-6 signaling is linked to impaired alveolarization; loss of IL-6 protects from neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Method(s): (1) Wildtype and IL-6 deficient newborn mice (IL-6-/-) or (2) cultured macrophages and lung epithelial cells were exposed to 85% O2 (HYX) or 21% O2 (NOX). Result(s): (1) HYX increased IL-6 mRNA and activates Stat3/SOCS3 signaling in lungs of WT mice. Quantitative lung morphometry showed increased mean linear intercept, alveolar surface area, and septal thickness, and reduced radial alveolar count, indicating impaired alveolar formation. Furthermore, microvessels (20-100mum) were reduced in lungs after HYX. In contrast, IL-6-/- were partially protected from these structural changes. Elastic fibers, elastin protein, and collagen Ialpha1 mRNA were significantly increased after HYX in IL-6-/- when compared to WT. Moreover, IL-6 deficiency protected from decreased lung expression of surfactant protein A (SP-A) and SP-C, and increased SP-D mRNA. (2) HYX induced the release of IL-6 from cultured macrophages; conditioned media of hyperoxia-exposed macrophages reduced survival of lung epithelial cells. Conclusion(s): Here, we do not only show that loss of IL-6 partially protects from neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury, but also the antiproliferative effect of macrophage secretome. This could offer novel therapeutic approaches for BPD.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of premature infants, is characterized by arrest of alveolarization and matrix remodeling. Myofibroblasts are crucial in both processes. Since the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) regulates cell homeostasis and fibroblast function, we studied the functional role of Klf4 in lungs of newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia and in primary neonatal lung fibroblasts (PnF). Method(s): (1) Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 (HYX) or 21% O2 (NOX) for up to 28 days. (2) Knockdown (siRNA) or overexpression (sleeping beauty transposon system) of Klf4 was induced in PnF or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), respectively, followed by exposure to HYX or NOX for up to 48 hours. Result(s): (1) HYX markedly reduced Klf4 mRNA and protein expression at P7 and P28 in lungs. Gene expression of TGFbeta, PAI-1 and alphaSMA protein (indicator of myofibroblasts) were higher in lungs after HYX. Immunostaining showed a localization of Klf4 in myofibroblasts (alphaSMA-positive cells). (2) Exposure of PnF to HYX decreased Klf4 protein. Both Knockdown of Klf4 and HYX reduced migration and increased mRNA of CTGF, collagen Ialpha1 & IValpha1 and PDGFRalpha. Proliferation was not affected by loss of Klf4. In contrast, overexpression of Klf4 in MEFs confirmed the modulation of migration and ECM expression by Klf4 and abrogated the changes induced by HYX. Conclusion(s): We identify Klf4 as a novel key regulator of neonatal lung fibroblast homeostasis. Loss of Klf4 is intimately linked to myofibroblast activation, fibrosis and migration, eventually reducing thereby alveolar formation and contributing to the pathogeneis of BPD.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common adverse outcome of extreme preterm birth, can be caused by oxygen-related lung injury and is characterized by arrested alveolar development. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have lung protective effects. Conversely, BPD is associated with increased MSCs in tracheal aspirates. This apparent discrepancy is unexplored. We hypothesized that endogenous lung (L-)MSCs are perturbed in an oxygen-induced rat model mimicking BPD. Method(s): Rat pups were exposed to 21% or 95% O2 from postnatal day 0 to 10. On day 12, CD146+ L-MSCs were isolated and characterized. Epithelial and vascular repair potential were tested by scratch assay and endothelial network formation respectively, immune function by mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. Microarray analysis was performed using GSEA software. Result(s): L-MSCs isolated from hyperoxia rat pups had decreased CD73 expression and inhibited lung endothelial network formation. L-MSCs indiscriminately promoted epithelial wound healing and limited T-cell proliferation. Expression of anti-angiogenic genes of the axonal guidance cue pathway was increased after in vivo hyperoxia, whereas genes of the anti-inflammatory JAK/STAT and lung/vascular growth promoting FGF pathways were decreased. Conclusion(s): In vivo hyperoxia exposure alters the pro-angiogenic effects and FGF expression of L-MSCs. Additionally, decreased CD73 and JAK/STAT expression suggest decreased immune function. L-MSC function may be perturbed and contribute to BPD pathogenesis. These findings may lead to improvements in manufacturing exogenous MSCs with superior repair capabilities.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common, serious complication occurring in premature infants. Although clinical characteristics and pathologic changes are well described, the pathogenesis of alveolar dysplasia and interstitial fibrosis is less clear. Lung fibroblasts (LFs) are present in the extracellular matrix and serve essential roles during pulmonary epithelial injury and in response to fibrosis development in BPD. The current study investigated hyperoxia-induced proliferation of primary LFs in vitro and mechanisms that may be involved. Newborn rats were exposed to 90% oxygen, while control rats were kept in normal atmosphere. Primary LFs were isolated on postnatal day 3, 7 and 14. Hyperoxia-induced proliferation of LFs isolated on day 7 and 14 by accelerating the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Collagen type I protein secretion and mRNA expression on day 7 and 14 were increased by hyperoxia compared with the controls. Hyperoxia significantly increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and significantly increased collagen type I expression compared with the room air control group. The findings indicated that an increase in LF proliferation in response to hyperoxia was associated with ERK1/2 phosphorylation. This mechanism may contribute to over-proliferation of LFs leading to disturbed formation of normal alveoli.

AB  - Background: There is growing number of children in Ukraine born prematurely, who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) later, have different other respiratory disorders and oxygen dependence. The further observation of these children indicates they may form an acute and chronic respiratory system diseases in about 30% of cases. A prematurity and respiratory support may affect a pulmonary surfactant system and this may also influence on a development of respiratory morbidity. Material(s) and Method(s):. There was a single-centered, prospective study. A comprehensive examination of 103 premature. These children at 5 years were divided in different respiratory morbidity groups: BPD, asthma, viral wheezing and healthy children. The level of surfactant B protein detected at 5th day of life with ELISA kit. A single nuclear polymorphism (SNP) in rs11130866 C/T of surfactant protein B gene was detected with PCR. Result(s): The ROC analysis reviled a high diagnostic value of the surfactant protein B content in the neonatal period to predict the formation of bronchopulmonary disease in the age of 5 years (AUC -0,758 [0,667-0,848 95% CI]. The cut-off point on 40,75 ng/ml (sensitivity 75,4 %, specificity 74,8 %).). It has been established that the CC-C1580T polymorphism is found to be 3 times more common in children with viral wheezing (OR 3.2, p = 0.04426), the TT polymorphism C1580T is found in 6 times more often in children wtih bronchial asthma (OR 6.1, p = 0.05487). Conclusion(s): The level of surfactant protein B in serum in neonatal period and it's rs11130866 C/T SNP may be a predictors of respiratory morbidity at 5 years.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) affects 30-40% of preterm newborns. Treatments include ventilation strategies, systemic and inhaled therapeutics. We aim to develop a model of BPD replacing animal use by ex vivo respiratory tracts (RT) (Perinel, S. et al. Sci Rep 2017;7:43121). The model includes 3D-printed upper airways, a leporine RT in a sealed enclosure and a depression generator for passive ventilation. We set inspiratory time at 0.4s and tuned expiratory time to obtain respiratory rates of 30, 35 and 40 per min, common rates in BPD. First, we recorded physiological data using a pneumotachograph and a differential pressure sensor (Biopac system). Then, we assessed both lung ventilation using 81mkrypton and pattern of aerosol deposition in the RT using 99mtechnetium-DTPA (Philips Sidestream nebulizer) and SPECT/CT imaging. Average tidal volumes (mean +/- SD) are 38.42 +/- 8.31 mL, 38.16 +/- 7.87 mL and 33.87 +/- 7.82 mL and appear coherent with human data. Then we assessed regional ventilation on some RT (n = 12). Other RT (n = 6) were used to assess particle deposition. SPECT/CT acquisitions, ventilation and deposition, are coherent with data from literature (Fok, T.F et al., Pediatr Pulmonol 1996;21:301-309). Our model provides a reliable and reproducible tool to assess aerosol deposition in BPD-suffering newborns. We ought to use this model to improve inhaled therapies in BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in premature or very low weight patients. The preterm birth of child can generate serious consequences directly on the lung in its structure and development and may persist throughout life. The objective was to characterize the respiratory function of preschool patients with a history of prematurity. Method(s): Children from 5 to 10 years old, with a history of preterm birth. Subsequently anthropometry was performed and finally pulmonary function tests: impulse oscillometry with a team from the CareFusion company, With the NDD Easy One Pro equipment, Nitrogen Washing and Pulmonary Carbon Monoxide Diffusion were performed. The analysis was performed with STATA v.13. Result(s): 48 patients was incluided, 34 male y 14 females and 120 healthy patients. The spirometry showed that FVC (forced vital capacity) is maintained with the same behavior as in healthy children, unlike FEV1 (Forced Exhaled Volume 1sec), which is lower in premature patients with p 0.01, 11% presented obstructive pattern with 38% response to BD. In oscillometry, there was a significant difference in the resistance, both R5 and R20, with an increased R5 and R20 decreased in preterm infants. DLCO, no significant differences were found. In the Nitrogen wash, an increase in the LCI was found, which would tell us of a heterogeneity of the ventilation. Conclusion(s): Preterm infants show changes in their lung function compared with term children at school age with a decrease in FEV1 with preserved FVC; and increase of R5 with response to Bronchodilator so decreased reactance and Heterogeneity of ventilation with diffusion Conserved.

AB  - Introduction: Respiratory infections in preterm infants contribute to the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity, also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Next generation sequencing of microbial genes could replace traditional culturebased methods. Aim(s): We used next generation sequencing to identify microbial communities in tracheal aspirates (TA) obtained from ventilated preterm infants. Method(s): TA samples were obtained daily in the first week of life then twice weekly until day 28 or until extubation, from 47 ventilated preterm infants at two UK neonatal units. Total bacterial load was estimated by qPCR of the 16S bacterial rRNA gene from DNA extracted from TA cell pellet. Next generation paired end sequencing of the V3V4 region identified the microbes present. IL6 and IL8 concentration were measured in TA samples. Result(s): Sequencing results were positive in 47 of 276 samples (17%). Positive TAs were associated with higher microbial load and higher IL6 and IL8 concentrations, suggesting an infective process. Serial TA samples showed episodic peaks of microbial load. 93.6% of positive TAs contained a dominant operational taxonomic unit (>50% of reads) suggesting 28 infective episodes in 20 infants. The most commonly identified dominant genera was Staphylococci. Sequencing depth using this methodology was unable to identify organisms to a species level. Conclusion(s): Microbial DNA was not detectable in TA samples of preterm infants in the absence of infection most likely due to absence of microbes or below detection levels. 16S rRNA sequencing identified dominant genera suggesting respiratory infections, as evidenced by an increase in IL6 and IL8.

AB  - Introduction: The role of oxidative stress in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis has been proved. Taking into account the pathogenic aspects of BPD development, the severity of disease clinical implications can be the result of action of mutant antioxidant enzyme genes, such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Aims and objectives: The aim of the study is to establish genetic risk factors of BPD development. The objective is to investigate the genetic polymorphism frequency analysis of MnSOD gene at preterm infants with BPD to clarify its contribution to the formation of the disease. Method(s): 20 preterm infants with BPD and 36 premature infants without respiratory disorders have been included in the study. 3 allelic polymorphisms of MnSOD gene have been investigated: replacement of Thymine at position 58 to Cytosine (MnSOD 58 Ile/Thr), replacement of Cytosine at position 60 to Thymine (MnSOD 60 Leu/Phe), replacement of Cytosine at position 16 to Thymine (MnSOD 16 Ala/Val). Result(s): The frequency of occurrence of MnSOD 16 Ala/Val mutation in infants with BPD was 90% in comparison with 31.6% in the control group (twotailed Fisher's test (FT)=0.006; risk ratio=2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.36; 5.36). The most of children with BPD and the most of healthy preterm infants had the usual genotypes MnSOD 58 Ile/Ile (90% and 98.9% respectively, FT=1.000) and MnSOD 60 Leu/Leu (90% and 96.5% respectively, FT=1.000). Conclusion(s): The carriage of MnSOD 16 Ala/Val mutation could be considered as risk factor of the BPD development.

AB  - The majority of the extremely premature infants are affected by the development of chronic lung disease, i.e. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Driven by the exposure to mechanical ventilation and oxygen treatment after birth as well as preand postnatal infections, disease incidence steadily increases with improved survival rates (Rivera, L et al., Front. Pediatr., 2016). In order to possibly alleviate the debilitating and lifelong consequences especially of severe BPD, treatment of atrisk premature infants is needed as early as possible. Since BPD is diagnosed late in a premature neonate's hospital stay, we used highend protein screening in early plasma samples (n=30 infants, sampling day of life 17) to identify early biomarkers. Machine learning approaches were used to define a set of proteins associated with disease severity of later BPD. In particular, controls and mild BPD cases were separated well from moderate and severe cases by a characteristic protein signature together with the known risk factors gestational age, gender and early infections. The identified proteins were attributed to inflammation and cardiac strain as well as coagulation activation (extrinsic pathway), the latter mirroring tissue injury. The differential protein expression was driven by postnatal injury but not the degree of acute respiratory distress. Further associations of the protein signature was shown with imaging markers (lung MRI), i.e. indicators of interstitial remodeling and altered pulmonary blood flow. In conclusion, moderate and severe BPD can be separated from mild cases and controls by characteristic protein expression, allowing for early individualized treatment and monitoring..

AB  - Aim: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common type of chronic lung disease in infancy, for which no effective therapy is currently available. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of treatment with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in combina-tion with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on BPD-induced mouse lung injury, and discuss the underlying mechanism. Method(s): The BPD model was established by the exposure of neonatal mice to continuous high oxygen exposure for 14 days, following which 1x106 BMSCs and 5,000 U/kg rHuEPO were injected into the mice 1 h prior to and 7 days following expo-sure to hyperoxia. The animals received four treatments in total (n=10 in each group). After 14 days, the body weights, airway structure, and levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected using histological and immunohistochemical analyses. The effect on cell differentiation was observed by examining the presence of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) and VEGF using immunofluorescence. Result(s): Compared with the administration of BMSCs alone, the body weight, airway structure, and the levels of MMP-9 and VEGF. Conclusion(s): The results of the present study demonstrated that the intravenous injection of BMSCs significantly improved lung damage in thehyperoxia-exposed neonatal mouse model. Furthermore, the injection of BMSCs in combination with intraperitoneal injection of rHuEPO had a more marked effect, compared with BMSCs alone, and the mechanism may be mediated by the promoting effects of BMSCs and EPO. The results of the present study provided information, which may assist in future clinical trials.

AB  - Background: An association between neonatal systemic inflammation (SI) and postnatal growth has not been reported. We hypothesized that infants exposed to SI would show poor postnatal growth. Objective(s): To determine whether a neonatal marker of SI was associated with poor postnatal growth among very preterm infants (VPI) at 12 months corrected age (CE). Method(s): We studied singleton, appropriate gestational age (AGA) infants, <=32 weeks' gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) <= 1.5 kg without congenital malformations, enrolled since 2006-2016. Weight, length and head circumference were recorded at birth and at 12 months CE. Standardized Z-scores for weight (WZ), length (LZ) and head circumference (HCZ) at 12 months CE were calculated and we estimated their association with mean C-reactive protein (CRP) sampled on days 1-3-7-14-28 of life. Multiple linear regression and stratified analysis were performed. Result(s): Ninety six infants, 38 (38.8%) males, with 29.2+/-2.5 weeks GA, 1.155+/-0.312 Kg BW, -0.42+/-0.79 WZ, 0.51+/-0.78 LZ and 0.43+/-0.78 HCZ at birth were studied. The mean neonatal CRP was 2.5 +/-3.8 mg/L. Growth failure was present in 15 (15.6%) infants at 12 months CE. Decreases in WZ and LW (beta -0.052+/-0.023; p 0.028 and beta -0.074+/-0.024; p 0.003 respectively) were significantly associated with higher mean CRP. HCZ was not significantly associated with mean CRP levels (beta 0.009+/-0.021; p 0.680). The association remained significant in infants with prenatal corticosteroids exposure and neonatal complications (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis) from the non-exposed groups. Conclusion(s): SI is associated with poor postnatal growth. Serial CRP may be useful marker for identifying infants at risk for postnatal growth failure.

AB  - Introduction: There is an association between juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and chronic lung disease. These pulmonary disorders are multiple - interstitial (ILD) or non-inflammatory - depending on the type of underlying JIA - mainly polyarticular or systemic. In children, because of absence of accurate and multi-center data, the management of these chronic lung diseases remain difficult. Objective(s): This work aimed to constitute a national cohort of JIA patients presenting chronic lung disease. Method(s): A retrospective multicenter study was conducted. The cases between 2007 and 2018 were obtained from appeal of French Medical societies (SOFREMIP, RespiRare, SFR, CRI, database of pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension). JIA was defined according to ILAR criteria; all had to have chronic pulmonary disease. Exclusion criteria were: age at onset> 18 years old, systemic JIA, other documented auto-immune or auto-inflammatory disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic lung infection, pulmonary primitive malformation. Data regarding clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic and evolution items were collected. Result(s): 8 files were selected; 4 met the study criteria. All patients had positive rheumatoid factor polyarticular JIA, with female predominance (3/4), mean age at rheumatism onset of 11.5 years (7.5-16). They all had disabling polyarthritis, involving small/big articulations, mostly symmetrical, involving neck in 3/4 and hips in 1/4 patients, Xray erosions in 2/4 patients. All had markedly erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32-107 mm, mean=65), hypergammaglobulinemia (14.8- 30.8 g/l, mean=22.5), high titers of CCP antibodies, elevated antinuclear antibodies (>1/320) - with specificities in patient 4 (SSA/SSB/ RNP without criteria for any connective tissue disease); patient 2 had positive TRAK antibodies without functional consequences. Each patients had different subtypes of ILD (Table 1). Pulmonary symptoms at diagnosis were: cough (2/4), exercise dyspnea (2/4), dyspnea at rest (1/4), hemoptysis (1/4 - patient 4), digital clubbing (1/4 - patient 2), auscultation abnormalities (2/4). In patient 2, ILD/fibrosis was related to SFTPC mutation. She had familial history of dominant inheritance of lung fibrosis and 2 ascendants with inflammatory rheumatic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, unclassified). Treatment was based on oral steroids, that could be associated with variable immunomodulation. In contrast to methotrexate - used in all patients, Etanercept was associated in patient 2 with ILD worsening, that improved at treatment discontinuation. Among all patients at last visit, patient 2 was the only who needed nutritive and respiratory support, and died at age of 15 years old, 13 years after lung disease beginning, on a graft waiting list. Conclusion(s): The chronic pulmonary diseases related to JIA are extremely scarce. In this cohort only ILD form was observed in positive rheumatoid factor polyarticular JIA patients. Treatment strategies of both combined diseases were heterogeneous: oral corticosteroid was used in all, methotrexate did not seem to aggravate ILD, conversely to etanercept. The long-term interest will be to propose consensual recommendations for management of these patients. Informed consent had been obtained from the parents (Table Presented) .

AB  - Objective: To address a rare cause of hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. Abstract: Ureaplasma infection associated with hyperammonemia is a serious medical condition described mostly in newborns and transplant patients. Ureaplasma infection can lead to preterm growth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and pneumonia. In sexually active females it can cause vaginosis and pelvic inflammatory disease, while in males it can result in urethritis. Progressive elevation of ammonia leads to cerebral edema, convulsion, and death. Common causes of hyperammo-nemia include a urea cycle defect, OTC deficiency, medications like valproic acid, fulminant liver failure, and transplant patients. In a majority of the transplant patients, infection has a fatal outcome. In a healthy state, ammonia is generated as a byproduct of amino acid metabolism and then converted to urea for excretion in urine. Only in disseminated Ureaplasma infection does the organism release free ammonia generated by the hydrolysis of urea in systemic circulation. The released ammonia is then converted back into urea in the liver providing more substrate. We describe a case of an adolescent with Ureaplasma infection that developed hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. Case presentation: A 14 year-old female with a history of AML was admitted to a tertiary care center for increasing lethargy, poor feeding, and low-grade fever. Her laboratory data reveals a normal hemogram and metabolic panel with normal renal and liver tests. Her ammonia level was found to be severely elevated at 500 mug/dL. Blood, CSF, and urine cultures were obtained and child was started on empirical parenteral antibiotic treatment. Shortly after admission the patient developed focal seizures and increasing lethargy. She continued to have fevers and her cultures remained negative. EEG showed generalized slowing. MRI revealed an affected cingular gyrus insular cortex. Due to increasing lethargy, seizure, and an elevated ammonia level, the patient was started on CRRT and intermittent hemodialysis. The patient's ammonia level after renal replacement therapy continued to rebound and stayed between 250-350 mug/dL. On hospital day 8, her urine PCR revealed Ureaplasma parvum. The patient received doxycycline for 10 days with complete resolution of fever and neurological symptoms and she was discharged home. Conclusion(s): Ureaplasma infection complicated with hyperammonemia is a serious medical problem which can cause severe brain damage and fatality. Though commonly seen in newborns or transplant patients, clinicians should be aware of Ureaplasma infection and include it in the differential diagnosis of hyperammonemia. Prompt diagnosis by PCR and treatment of this entity will alleviate cerebral edema and CNS morbidity.

AB  - Background: Preterm infants are deficient in vitamin A, which is essential for growth and development of the diaphragm. Preterm infants often require mechanical ventilation (MV) for respiratory distress. In adults, MV is associated with the development of ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. We assessed the impact of MV on the preterm diaphragm and the protective effect of vitamin A during MV. Methods: Preterm lambs delivered operatively at ~131 days gestation (full gestation: 150 days) received respiratory support by synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation for 3 days. Lambs in the treated group received daily (24 h) enteral doses of 2500 IU/kg/day vitamin A combined with 250 IU/kg/day retinoic acid (VARA) during MV, while MV control lambs received saline. Unventilated fetal reference lambs were euthanized at birth, without being allowed to breathe. The fetal diaphragm was collected to quantify mRNA levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, atrophy genes, antioxidant genes, and pro-inflammatory genes; to determine ubiquitin proteasome pathway activity; to measure the abundance of protein carbonyl, and to investigate metabolic signaling. Results: Postnatal MV significantly decreased expression level of the neonatal MHC gene but increased expression level of MHC IIx mRNA level (p < 0.05). Proteasome activity increased after 3 days MV, accompanied by increased MuRF1 mRNA level and accumulated protein carbonyl abundance. VARA supplementation decreased proteasome activity and FOXO1 signaling, down-regulated MuRF1 expression, and reduced reactive oxidant production. Conclusion:  These findings suggest that 3 days of MV results in abnormal myofibrillar composition, activation of the proteolytic pathway, and oxidative injury of diaphragms in mechanically ventilated preterm lambs. Daily enteral VARA protects the preterm diaphragm from these adverse effects.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic pulmonary disease of premature neonates. While ventilation with supplemental O2 is required for development and survival of the premature neonate, it increases the risk of BPD. Both hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress and transient hypoxia resulting from apneic events increase recruitment and activation of myeloid cells to the lungs. Activated myeloid cells release myeloperoxidase (MPO), which oxidizes chloride ions to hypochlorous acid causing oxidative damage and cell death. If myeloid cell recruitment, activation, and MPO release contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD, then inhibiting MPO oxidant production should protect against hyperoxia-induced lung injury. N-acetyl lysyltyrosylcysteine amide (KYC) is a tripeptide inhibitor of MPO that prevents the generation of toxic oxidants by shuttling high energy peroxy radicals in the iron-heme active site into the glutathione pathway. In order to test the hypothesis that inhibiting MPO prevents hyperoxia-induced lung damage, Sprague-Dawley neonatal rat pups were exposed to ten days (P1-P10) of hyperoxia (>90% O2) and injected twice daily with either 5 mg/kg KYC or vehicle control (PBS). KYC treatment reduced myeloid cell counts and MPO and Cl-Tyr levels in the lungs of hyperoxic neonatal pups. Additionally, KYC-treated pups had increased microvascular and alveolar complexity as well as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) levels. These data provide evidence that myeloid cell recruitment and activation and MPO-induced oxidative damage are significant contributors to hyperoxia-induced lung injury in the developing lungs, and that KYC is an effective inhibitor of MPO-dependent oxidative damage to neonatal lungs.Copyright © 2018

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease, which is characterized by alveolar dysplasia and impaired vascularization in premature infants. BPD can develop pulmonary hypertension (PH) in adolescence and adulthood. This is corroborated by previous reports showing that hyperoxic exposure in newborn mice caused PH in adult mice. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal cells (EndoMT), a biological process where endothelial cells (ECs) progressively lose their specific markers and gain mesenchymal phenotype, is one of the contributing factors for development of PH. It has been shown that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) augments the magnitude of EndoMT in ECs. This was attenuated by enhancing FAO via overexpression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), a rate-limiting step of the carnitine shuttle. However, no information is available on whether hyperoxic exposure reduces FAO, resulting in EndoMT in lung ECs. We hypothesized that hyperoxic exposure causes EndoMT by modulating FAO in lung ECs. To test this hypothesis, mouse fetal lung EC line (MFLM-91U) and primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) for 24 h. Some cultures were placed in air for 1, 3, or 7 days post exposure (air recovery). We found that hyperoxic exposure followed by air recovery reduced FAO as determined by the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer. The levels of markers for mesenchymal cells (i.e., vimentin, CD44, Snail1, Snug, Twist1, and alpha-SMA) were increased, while the EC markers (i.e., vWF, PECAM-1/CD31 and CD34) were reduced in lung ECs exposed to hyperoxia followed by air recovery. Surprisingly, gene deletion of Cpt1a attenuated hyperoxia-induced reduction of CD34 and CD31 gene expression. In conclusion, hyperoxic exposure followed by air recovery causes EndoMT in lung ECs, and inhibition of FAO rescues this phenotype. These findings may provide therapeutic approach targeting Cpt1a to preventing PH in BPD patients.Copyright © 2018

AB  - Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects pre-term infants whose lungs are unable to support life outside of the womb. These babies receive therapeutic oxygen which compensates for poor lung function but also causes oxidative damage to lung epithelium, resulting in a simplified lung marked by larger and fewer alveoli. We identified thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) as a protein of interest in the pathogenesis of BPD since Trx1 is cytoprotective against hyperoxic cell death. Using a perinatal hyperoxic mouse model of BPD, pulmonary Trx1 activity inversely correlates with atmospheric oxygen tension following birth and hyperoxic treatment. Therefore, we tested if impairment of lung epithelial Trx1 promotes BPD pathogenesis. Trx1 floxed mice (Trx1fl) were bred to mice expressing cre recombinase driven by the surfactant protein C promoter (sftpc-cre) to generate a mouse with Trx1 deficient lung epithelial cells. Although expected genotypic ratios were detected at birth, lethality was noted in Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice as early as 14 days of age. The LD50 for Trx1 deficient mice was 20 days old, while Trx1 heterozygote littermates appeared normal (p<0.001, n=12-17). Upon autopsy, large air-filled pneumatoceles were noted across multiple lobes of Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice. Similar to BPD, Trx1 deficient mice had a simplified lung marked by an increase in mean linear intercept and airspace size with decreased airspace numbers and radial alveolar count. Similar to mice treated with perinatal hyperoxia, Trx1 deficient lungs had fewer alveolar type 2 cells detected by surfactant protein b and thyroid transcription factor 1 immunohistochemistry. This work demonstrates that impairment of Trx1 in lung epithelial cells causes respiratory pathologies consistent with BPD. Ongoing studies seek to define the temporal nature of lung pathogenesis and test the overarching hypothesis that Trx1 serves as a molecular sensor of atmospheric oxygen tension in lung epithelium during alveolar development and perinatal hyperoxic injury.Copyright © 2018

AB  - Background: Neonatal care has drastically improved, resulting in survival of extremely premature babies and increased incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) associated comorbidities. Among that, pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) has high mortality and morbidity. The diagnosis of BPD-PH is difficult since the symptoms overlap with severe BPD. Cardiac catheterization is a highly invasive gold standard procedure for diagnosing PH. Our hypothesis was that unique inflammatory biomarkers in tracheal aspirates from preterm babies are associated with BPD-PH. These biomarkers may reflect underlying inflammatory pathways involved in development of BPD-PH Methods: We collected tracheal aspirates from a small cohort of infants at the Penn State Children's Hospital NICU. Patients with confirmed clinical diagnosis based on NHLBI classification of severe BPD (n=6), BPD-PH (as diagnosed based on echocardiogram findings) (n=6), and term control babies (n=5) were enrolled for the study. Samples were digested; iTRAQ labeled and analyzed via mass spectrometry using ABSciex 5600 Triple TOF and protein identification was accomplished using ProteinPilotTM4.5Beta software. Significantly different proteins in the groups were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen). Result(s): Over 700 different proteins were identified using Proteinpilot software. Applying very stringent local false discovery rate estimation, approximately 200-330 proteins were confidently identified in each sample. Twenty-two proteins and 16 proteins were significantly differentially (under or over) expressed when comparing control vs. BPD group and control vs. BPD-PH groups, respectively. Four proteins were common in these two datasets, but were differentially expressed namely lysozyme C precursor, lactotransferrin isoform 1 precursor, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor precursor, and mucin-5B precursor (MUC-5B); MUC-5B precursor had the most statistically significant differential log ratio expression. IPA analysis of these four proteins showed relevant pathways between NFKB (complex), RELA, CDKN1A, TNF, TP53, and PRKCD. Conclusion(s): Our pilot project revealed four proteins whose expression was significantly different in severe BPD vs. BPD-PH; IPA analysis predicted specific underlying inflammatory pathways. Further investigation into these proteins is warranted to explore potential for biomarkers for early diagnosis and target therapies.

AB  - Background: Group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH) is caused by hypoxemia resulting from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and FGF receptor 1 and 2 (FGFR1/2) levels are elevated in PH patients. Additionally, FGF2 is elevated in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia. We have shown that endothelial FGFR1/2 signaling is important for response to injury. We hypothesize that FGF2 and endothelial FGFR1/2 signaling promotes endothelial cell survival and elaboration of signals that protect against PH. Method(s): The Tie2-Cre transgene was used to conditionally regulate Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 expression in endothelial cells. We also generated an inducible constitutively active FGFR1 (caFGFR1). Mice with the genotypes Tie2-Cre;Fgfr1f/f;Fgfr2f/f (DCKO), Fgf2-/-, and Tie2-Cre;RosartTA;Tre-caFgfr1 were challenged with 10% hypoxia for two weeks, followed by cardiac catheterization to measure right ventricular pressure (RVP). We also engineered a microfluidic device to simulate physiologically relevant blood vessels. Result(s): Compared to control littermates, DCKO mice in hypoxia developed worse RVP, increased RV hypertrophy, and decreased RV function, demonstrating worsening PH. Furthermore, mice with a global deletion of Fgf2 developed more severe PH than DCKO mice when challenged in hypoxia. Notably, mice with endothelial overexpression of caFGFR1 showed RVP similar to control mice in normoxia. In microfluidic devices, primary pulmonary endothelial cells from DCKO mice altered smooth muscle cell morphology resulting in extracellular matrix deformation. Conclusion(s): We conclude that loss of endothelial FGFR1/2 worsens hypoxia-induced PH and RV function in vivo and alters smooth muscle cell physiology in vitro. Furthermore, FGF2 is important for the pathogenesis of Group 3 PH and acts at least in part through the endothelial FGFR1/2 pathway. We show that overexpression of constitutively active FGFR1 in endothelial cells prevents hypoxia induced PH in vivo. Our data suggest that activation of endothelial FGF signaling protects against Group 3 PH, the opposite of what is reported in Group 1, and regulates endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cell interactions.

AB  - Background & Objective: In this study we describe a case of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) occurringina preterm newborn died in the perinatal period. BWS is a rare genetic disorder: cardinal features include macroglossia, exomphalos, lateralized overgrowth, hyperinsulinism, ad-renal cortex cytomegaly and pancreatic adenomatosis. Method(s): A 26-year-old pregnant woman presented with pre-eclampsia, leading to preterm labor at the 27th week of gestation. Apgar index of the female newborn at birth was 5, with insurgence of a respiratory distress syndrome and hypoglicemia. The newborn died 44 hours after birth in the neonatal intensive care unit, and autopsy was performed. Tissue samples were formalin-fixed and routinely processed. Sections were stained with H&E, and pancreas specimens were immunostained with anti-synaptophysin and anti-Chromogranin antibodies. Result(s): At autopsy, the newborn showed: anasarca; birthweight 2 standard deviation score above the mean values, macroglossia, generalized visceromegaly including lung, hearth, liver, pancreas and kidney, ectopic adrenal gland in a paraovarial site, exomphalos with incarcerated and ischemic intestinal loops. At histology, we observed cytomegaly of the adrenal cortex, hyaline membrane disease of the immature lungs, a marked hyperplasia of the Langerhans islands of the pancreas and in-creased hepatic haematopoiesis. Conclusion(s): The case of BWS here reported is characterized by a dra-matic clinical course. Hyperinsulinism and hypoglicemia should be con-sidered a sign of poor prognosis, particularly when associated with pre-term birth and immaturity. The marked hyperplasia of the endocrine pancreas confirms that, in BWS infants with non-responsive marked hy-perinsulinism, surgery with partial pancreatectomy should be considered.

AB  - Aims & Objectives: Pulmonary vascular air embolism is a rare complication of positive pressure ventilation in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. The exact mechanism of the air leaking in the vascular space is less likely to be clinically explained. Methods A case report. Results A premature baby born at 26 weeks of gestation weighing 940 g, was transferred at the age of 10 hours to our NICU, diagnosed with pulmonary air leak syndrome,treated with surfactant, mechanical ventilatory support and vasosopressors. On admission intubated, ventilated with positive pressure, FiO2 100%, hypotensive, oliguric, generally edematous, an initial oxygen saturation 70%, a heart rate of 120/min, and a weak pulse. An umbilical vein catheter was inserted. Chest X-ray revealed signs of respiratory distress syndrome, with normal cardiac appearance. He was treated with SIPPV +VG ventilation, (PEEP 6 cm H2O), a second dose of surfactant. His respiratory and circulatory condition started to improve. Suddenly, 10 hours later clinical condition deteriorated with a drop in oxygen saturation to 44% and hypotension. Chest X-ray had no signs of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Parameters of mechanical ventilation were increased, recruitment performed, but with poor results.He was globally cyanotic, two hours later lower half of the body from the umbilicus became completely pale. In a few minutes revascularisation started, but heart sounds were silent, with bizarre ECG,He passed away shortly thereafter. The postmortem examination revealed hyaline membrane disease with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, diffuse hypoxic multiorgan damage. Conclusions The post-mortem examination was unable to disclose the cause of this massive fatal air embolism.

AB  - Objective We aimed to investigate biological biomarkers in maternal blood, amniotic membrane, amniotic fluid, urine, and vaginal discharge to prevent preterm birth. Methods To determine the biomarkers for early detection of preterm delivery, 40 cytokines were measured with amniotic fluid of pregnant women using cytokine array and we screened cytokines of amniotic fluid between preterm women and normal pregnant women. Next, the 16S rRNA sequencing method using the next generation sequencing with urine, blood, and vaginal fluid in pregnant women was used to compare metagenomes that differed between preterm and normal groups. Lastly, we identified the biomarkers in maternal blood and amniotic membrane using methylation array. After screening, we performed the experiments for the validation in large samples. Results After cytokine array in amniotic fluid, the 15 pro-inflammatory cytokines(IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, TNF-alpha, MMP3, MMP8, MMP9, MIP-1a and MIP-1P) were significantly higher in preterm birth group. IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17alpha, and G-CSF were significantly different among the 15 pro-inflammatory analyzed by ELISA. In urine metagenome of 73 non-pregnant women and 74 pregnant women, Bacillus was increased about 374 times in maternal urine, and Lactobacillus and Atopobium was increased in preterm women. Specially, premature babies born to mothers with increased Lactobacillus, Ureaplasma, Megashaera, Apotobium, Fusobacterium, Sneathia and Prevotella in the urine showed diseases such as hyaline membrane disease, germinal matrix hemorrhage, pneumomediastinum, respiratory distress syndrome and urinary tract infection. We tried to find metagenome related to preterm birth in maternal vaginal fluid. In this study, it was found that Bacteriodes and Prevotella were significantly increased in vaginal fluid of preterm pregnant women. One of the probiotics found in Kimchi and Lactobacillus were significantly decreased in vaginal fluid of preterm pregnant women. Furthermore, IL-7 was correlated with a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in Bacteroides. After methylation array and experiments for validation, there were significant differences in the methylation of the KIMB gene in the maternal blood between preterm and normal groups and in the methylation of the KIMC and KIMD in the amnion (p<0.05, respectively). Conclusion We found several candidate biomarkers related to preterm birth in amniotic fluid, urine, urine, blood, and amniotic membrane. We are trying to do experiments to identify candidate markers in the population. In near future, we hope the development of biomarker to predict preterm birth using non-invasive method from pregnant women.

AB  - We have previously showed that human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) can be a viable source of cell therapy for established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from pro-regenerative cells could be a potential remedy by transporting proteins, lipids, mRNA and microRNA. Here we characterized hAEC-derived EVs and assessed their efficacy on neonatal lung injury where BPD-like injury was achieved using a combination of antenatal inflammation and postnatal hyperoxia. The isolated hAEC-EVs had distinct cup shaped morphology with average size of 40-120nm. ALIX (96kDa), Grp94 (92kDa) and HLA-G (38kDa) were expressed in EVs and Pathway enrichment analysis showed that endothelin signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway were enriched in hAEC-EVs. In mouse model of BPD-like lung injury, we observed that hAEC-EVs improved tissue-to-airspace ratio and septal crest density in a dose-dependent manner. hAEC-EV administration reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The improvement of lung injury was associated with the increase of the percentage of type II alveolar cells. Surprisingly, neonatal hAEC-EV delivery reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, mitigated pulmonary hypertension and prevented right ventricle hypertrophy that associated with BPD-like lung injury, and this persisted until to 10 weeks of age. These findings suggest that hAEC-derived EVs can be a potential cell-free therapy for babies at risk of developing BPD.

AB  - Background: Since the first description of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) three decades ago, alveolar formation remains poorly understood. In contrast, there is detailed understanding of early lung development (branching morphogenesis). The relevance of the latter to BPD is uncertain. Objective(s): To identify the principal genetic regulators of alveogenesis, information that is necessary for preventing or treating BPD. Method(s): We devised a unique, cell-specific, genetic targeting of select signaling pathways including TGF-beta, PDGFA and IGF1 during postnatal alveolar formation in mice. Next generation RNA sequencing revealed conserved genes that are in common amongst the 3 models. The relevance of the mouse genetic studies was examined in human postmortem BPD lung samples. We inactivated the receptors for TGF-beta, or platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA) or IGF1, in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMFs) which drive alveogenesis and generated 3 mouse models. Result(s): All mice developed respiratory distress shortly after birth. All mice also developed profound arrested alveolar formation (BPD phenocopy). The severity of the phenotype, added to SCMFs representing only 10-11.3% of total lung cells, is strong evidence for the robustness of these 3 central signaling pathways in alveolar formation. RNAseq and bio-informatics using sorted mutant and control SCMFs revealed a cluster of 117 genes in common amongst the 3 mutant lungs. Conclusion(s): Our innovative approach identified genes that participate in alveogenesis. These genes are dysregulated in human BPD lung samples. We show for the first time that one of the pathway's functions in alveolar formation parallels the function of antenatal steroid used as therapy to improve alveogenesis.

AB  - Lung immaturity is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants, especially those born <28 weeks of gestation. These infants are at high risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a lung disease caused by insufficient surfactant production and immaturity of saccular/alveolar type II epithelial cells in the lung. RDS treatment includes oxygen and respiratory support that improve survival but also increase the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease characterized by arrested alveolarization, airway hyperreactivity, and pulmonary hypertension. The mechanisms regulating normal alveolar development and how injury disrupts normal development to cause BPD are not well understood. We examined the role of the matricellular protein CCN5 (Cysteine-rich protein 61/Connective tissue growth factor/Nephroblastoma-overexpressed protein) in the development of BPD. Cultured non-proliferating alveolar type II cells expressed low levels of CCN5 protein, and displayed higher levels during proliferation. siRNA targeting of CCN5 reduced alveolar type II cell proliferation and migration in cell culture. In a mouse model of hyperoxia-induced BPD, CCN5 protein was increased only in proliferating alveolar type I cells. Alveolar epithelial cells co-expressing markers of type II cells and type I cells also appeared. The results suggest that hyperoxic injury in immature lungs induces proliferation of type I cells and trans-differentiation of type II cells into type I cells. We propose that the mechanism of the injury response in BPD includes CCN5 expression. Study of CCN5 in neonatal alveolar injury will further our understanding of BPD pathophysiology while providing a mechanistic foundation for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by an arrest of alveolar development, results from a complex set of circumstances. Our group has developed a Sprague-Dawley rat model of BPD, based on exposure for 13 days to cyclic hypoxia/hyperoxia (H/H). The Ahr (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), an activator of the antioxidant system, increases the expression of phase I enzymes (as P450-1A1) and phase II enzymes. Objective(s): To determine if prenatal activation of the Ahr pathway with Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) or 3.3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) protects rat pups from hypoxia/hyperoxia-induced lung injury, measuring body growth, relative expression of BPD and Ahr pathway-related genes, as well as radial alveolar counts in excised lungs. Method(s): Figure 1 shows the protocol approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#2015-RE-15, February 2016). After euthanasia, heart-lung blocks of excised pups were prepared for histopathological examination, RNA extraction and RT-PCR. Result(s): On the 13th postnatal day, H/H exposure caused decreased mean body weight from 20 +/- 2.6 g (control) to 9.8 +/- 1 g; I3C + H/H-treated pups had a mean body weight of 9.7 +/- 0.7 g, while that of DIM + H/H-treated pups was 15.3 +/- 1.1 g (p < 0.05). After H/H, a significant decrease in gene expression of hif1a, fgf7, ccl2, angp1, timp2, kdr1, fit1, vegf1 and tgfB (p < 0.05) was seen; these validate our BPD model. An increase of Ahr gene expression at birth, at 24 h and at 72 h was observed in I3C + H/H animals vs. controls, while it was only seen at birth for DIM + H/H-treated animals (p < 0.05). In I3C + H/H-treated animals, CYP1A1 gene expression was significantly increased at birth and at 24 h, while Nqo1 gene expression increased significantly at 24 and 72 h. Both treating compounds were accompanied by a significant increase in RAC means (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Conclusion(s): Gene expression results suggest a beneficial effect of I3C, which could become a welcome addition to the BPD preventive measures in human preterm neonates after carefully designed clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains an important consequence of preterm birth. As preterm babies in general are at high risk for side effects, local delivery of drugs to the lungs is gaining interest (e.g., budesonide). Preclinical evaluation of novel local therapeutic strategies for BPD is imperative and requires an appropriate animal model. Here we evaluated the feasibility and distribution of daily intratracheal injections in preterm rabbits. Method(s): Preterm rabbit pups (born at day 28 of gestation) were randomly assigned to either hyperoxia (> 95% FiO2) or normoxia, and in both conditions to either daily intratracheal surfactant or saline (under isoflurane anesthesia), or to no treatment. Transcutaneous injections were performed on spontaneously breathing animals. Lung function, lung morphometry and vascular morphometry were evaluated at day 7. To evaluate distribution, surfactant or saline was mixed with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose, and (Figure presented) radioactivity was traced after injections on day 0 and 7 by microPET-CT. Result(s): The intratracheal injections did not cause any mortality and as expected did not affect the functional, parenchymal and vascular phenotype of the pups raised in normoxia or hyperoxia conditions (Table 1). A median of 78% of the activity was found in the lungs. Ninety percent of the activity was present in 45% of the lung volume at both time points, suggesting an unequal distribution. No differences in distribution between surfactant and saline were observed (Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): We confirmed the feasibility of daily intratracheal injections in preterm rabbits and assured good delivery to and distribution within the lungs (compared to other delivery methods such as inhalation). The preterm rabbit BPD model is thus an appropriate model to study novel local therapeutics, as it utilizes relatively small animals and combines prematurity with the ability to translate clinical procedures like intratracheal delivery.

AB  - Introduction: Supplemental oxygen exposure is a risk factor for development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Reactive oxygen species may damage lung tissue, but hyperoxia has also a potential to alter the genome activity by means of altering DNA methylation. Understanding the epigenetic potential of hyperoxia can enable further improvement of therapeutic strategies in BPD. Objective(s): To identify hyperoxia-related alterations of DNA methylation, which could affect the activity of crucial genetic pathways involved in development of hyperoxia lung injury. Method(s): 24 newborn mice were randomized to hyperoxia (85% O2) or normoxia for 14 days continued with normoxia for the subsequent 14 days. The mice were killed on day 28 and lung tissue was analyzed with use of microarrays dedicated for assessment of genome methylation and expression profiles. Result(s): The mean DNA methylation level was higher in the hyperoxia in comparison with the normoxia group. The analysis of specific DNA fragments revealed hypermethylation of > 1,300 gene promoters in the hyperoxia group confirming the presence of the DNA hypermethylation effects of hyperoxia. Further analysis showed significant enrichment of TGF-beta signaling pathway (p = 0.0013). The hypermethylated genes included Tgfbr1, Crebbp and Creb1, which play central roles in TGF-beta signaling pathway and in cell cycle regulation. The genome expression analysis revealed complementary upregulation of genes that are crucial for cell cycle regulation in the normoxia group (Crebbp, Smad2, Smad3). Conclusion(s): These results suggest involvement of methylation of TGF-beta pathway genes in lung tissue reaction to hyperoxia. The data indicate hyperoxia may be a programming factor in newborn mice.

AB  - RATIONALE: Hyperpolarized 129Xe pulmonary magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) provides physiologically relevant biomarkers of obstructive lung disease.1-5 Multi-b diffusion-weighted MRI provides apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC) and other acinar duct morphometric measurements that estimate mean-linear-intercept (Lm) values. This is important for young adults with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). We hypothesized that accelerated (seven time faster) multi-b diffusion-weighted 129Xe MRI could provide regional alveolar size estimates in patients in an 10s inhalation breath-hold. METHOD(S): Four neversmokers (66+/-13yo; NCT02484885), four ex-smokers with COPD (74+/-5yo, NCT02723500) and one AATD (62yo, NCT02279329) patient provided written informed consent to an ethics-boardapproved protocol. All subjects underwent spirometry, plethysmography, DLCO and MRI including anatomical 1H and 129Xe diffusion-weighted and static-ventilation imaging. MRI was performed at 3.0T as previously described.2 Thoracic CT (GEHC Lightspeed VCT) was acquired for all COPD/AATD patients. MRI ADC2 were generated and 129Xe lung morphometry maps estimated using the stretched-exponential-method (SEM) applied to fully-sampled data and using SEM2,3 combimed with accelerated (acceleration factor=7) data sampling2. The SEM was extended to provide clinically-relevant biomarkers of emphysema.3 Ventilation-defect-percent (VDP) was measured as previously described,5 as was the CT relative-area-of-the-lung-withattenuation<=- 950HU (RA950) using Pulmonary Workstation-2.0 (VIDA Diagnostics, Coralville, IA). RESULT(S): Figure 1 shows centre coronal slice CT and MRI ventilation images as well as MRI ADC and Lm maps for a representative never-smoker, COPD and AATD patient using fullysampled and accelerated methods. CT images reflected emphysema with RA950=12% (COPD) and 19% (AATD). Mean ADC/ADCA, and Lm/Lm A estimates for the never-smokers (0.05cm2s- 1/0.05cm2s-1 and 290mum/290mum) were significantly smaller than the corresponding mean estimates for COPD/AATD patients (0.08cm2s-1/0.08cm2s-1 and 590mum/590mum; all p<.001) for fully-sampled and accelerated methods. For the COPD subgroup a mean difference of 2%/2% was observed between fully-sampled and accelerated data ADC and Lm values, respectively. For the AATD subject a mean difference of 2%/4% observed between fully-sampled and accelerated data ADC and Lm values, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): We demonstrated the feasibility of accelerated 129Xe MRI morphometry for the regional quantification and characterization of emphysema and airspace enlargement in COPD/AATD patients. The development of emphysema biomarkers based on MRI morphometry should help to better assess treatment outcomes and improve our understanding of disease progression (Figure Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Intercellular communication, such as between epithelial cells and adjacent epithelial cells or nearby endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or macrophages, occur via exosomes (30-100 nm size extracellular vesicles). As oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of many lung disorders, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, acute lung injury, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we determined the miRNA, mRNA, and proteomic profile of exosomes from human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) and their alterations with hyperoxia. Method(s): Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation from supernatants of HBE exposed to air or hyperoxia (85% O2) for 48h. Exosome numbers and sizes were characterized by NanoSight and Electron Microscopy. miRNA, mRNA, and protein contents were evaluated by RNA-seq, small RNA-seq and proteomic analysis by LC- MS/MS. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to analyze data. Result(s): (1) Hyperoxia increased exosome release from HBE by 2.5 fold, although exosome sizes were similar. (2) mRNA: 1006 transcripts (of 54824) were expressed in only one condition (250 only in hyperoxia, 756 only in air), while 222 additionally were at >2 fold change, q<0.05. For mRNA expressed in only one condition, top canonical pathways were leucine degradation I, and granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis. For >2 fold change, q<0.05, the top pathway was osteoarthritis pathway due to decreased EP300, and increased TGB1, PDGFC, RUNX2. (3) miRNA: At >2 fold change, p<0.05, far more miRNA were reduced by hyperoxia (1585 of 2685 measured, eg. miR-3691-3p, miR-3174) than increased (Only 3: miR-875-5p; miR- 95-5p; miR-8084). IPA indicated the cellular functions of "Cell Cycle", "Cellular Movement", "Cellular Development", and "Cell Death and Survival". The targets of some of these miRNA (e.g. of miR-3691-3p: TGFB3, FGF2, VCAM1) are relevant to lung injury and repair. (4) Proteomic analysis: 495 proteins were detected in exosomes, of which 28 were reduced by hyperoxia and 130 were increased (>2 fold change, p<0.05). Top 3 increased proteins included PSMB4, PSMD12, TARS, while decreased proteins included KRT5, ITGA3, and RPL6. IPA indicated top canonical pathways as EIF2 signaling, eIF4 and p70S6K signaling, protein ubiquitination, mTOR signaling, and caveolar-mediated endocytosis signaling, with cellular functions being "Cell Death and Survival", "Protein Synthesis", "RNA Post-transcriptional Modification", and "Cellular Development". Conclusion(s): Exposure to hyperoxia, the archetypal oxidative stress, increases exosomal release from epithelial cells with an overall reduction in miRNA and mRNA and increases in protein content. The exosomes may serve to modulate signaling and cellular responses locally in the lung and possibly at distant locations.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infants in the US, affecting up to 45% of infants born before 29 weeks of gestation. Our prior studies identified significant variation in COL6A5 gene sequence and expression associated with BPD. We also observed reduced expression of several Collagen 6 (COLVI) isoforms in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice. While mutations in COLVI genes are known to cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies accompanied by respiratory dysfunction, little is known regarding the role of COLVI in the lung. Method(s): We studied airspace morphometry (mean linear intercept; MLI), airway branch structure and airway mucosal layer thickness in histological sections from a previously described Col6a1-/- mouse (Bonaldo et. al., 1998, Hum Mol Genet) on a C57BL/6J background. We measured extracellular matrix and lung cell lineage gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Result(s): Western blot analysis of whole protein lysates from mouse lung tissue confirmed an absence of COLVI in Col6a1-/- mice, but no significant differences between heterozygous and wild-type mice. Histological assessment of mature (6+ week old) Col6a1-/- mice showed a number of gross developmental abnormalities. We observed spontaneous airspace enlargement in Col6a1-/- animals, similar to that observed in BPD lungs, characterized by a 24% increase in MLI relative to wild-type controls (p<0.001). Additionally, Col6a1-/- mice exhibited a gross branching defect, evident as a significant increase in the average number of airways within the left lung (8.4 vs. 12.0; p=1.3e-5). Finally, the thickness of the airway mucosal layer was increased by 34% in Col6a1-/- mice (p=1.4e-4), which was associated with variability in distance from epithelial cell nuclei from the basement membrane. These histological abnormalities were associated with a 2.0-fold increase in expression of the basement membrane protein Col4a1 (FC=1.98, p=0.01), a 2.6-fold increase expression of the Club cell marker Scgb1a1 (p = 0.02), and a 2.0-fold increase in expression of the goblet cell marker Muc5ac (FC=1.96, p=0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of alveolar epithelial cell markers (Aqp5, Spc) or additional airway cell markers (Muc5b, Foxj1). Summary: The absence of COLVI results in lung pathology, similar to that observed in BPD. The COLVI deficient mouse may represent a new model useful for studies of BPD pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. The pathogenesis of BPD has a number mechanisms: it is associated with smooth muscle proliferation; there is airway epithelial and vascular endothelial cell dysregulation; these changes occur under the influence of hyperoxia, barotrauma and inflammation; and, there is a strong genetic foundation. Among the candidate genes that may influence these smooth muscle cell changes is the ASB3 gene. ASB-related genes are expressed in smooth muscle cells and play a role in protein turnover, smooth muscle cell differentiation, and induction of hypertrophy. Genetic variants of ASB3 are associated with asthma and bronchodilator responsiveness to inhaled beta2-agonists. Objective(s): To investigate the hypothesis that ASB3 variants are associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. Study Design: After obtaining IRB approved parental consents, DNA from buccal swabs of ELBW infants was isolated and subjected to allelic discrimination by RT-PCR for 5 specific ASB3 SNPs (rs350729, rs1840321, rs1384918, rs1319797 and rs10205606). Additionally, an ASB3 protein specific ELISA assay was performed on tracheal aspirates of ELBW infants. BPD was defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks PMA. X2, t-test, z-test, and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Patients with BPD were born earlier (p=0.001) and weighed less (p<0.001) when compared to infants without BPD. There were also more patients with BPD who were also small for gestational age (SGA; p=0.02). One out of five SNPs (rs1319797; p<0.01) showed a statistically significant association with the progression to BPD. This association remains significant when corrected for gestational age and birth weight after multiple logistic regression analysis. Patients with BPD had higher ASB3 protein concentrations in their tracheal aspirates compared to patients without BPD, but this difference was not statistically significant (313.6 pg/ml +/- 22.3 vs 276.3 pg/ml +/- 25; p=0.3). Conclusion(s): Genetic variations of ASB3 are associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that these genetic variants influence smooth muscle cell differentiation, hypertrophy, and the responsiveness to bronchodilators; and, that they increase the susceptibility to BPD in ELBW infants.

AB  - Background: Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) after adjusting for other confounders. BPD is characterized by impaired alveolar secondary septation and vascular growth and these abnormalities may persist to adulthood leading to increased susceptibility to other chronic lung diseases. Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) in the neonatal period contributes to the development of BPD. Sex-specific differences in the long-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia exposure on lung and heart health and the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Method(s): Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-5: saccular stage of lung development) or room air and allowed to grow in room air till 6-8 weeks of postnatal age. Alveolarization (morphometric measurements including mean linear intercept and radial alveolar count), pulmonary vascularization (vWF positive vessel number by immunohistochemistry (IHC), inflammation (macrophage infiltration) were assessed at 6-8 weeks. Measurement of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF was done in lung and heart tissues from male and female mice at 6-8 weeks of age. Echocardiography was performed to assess pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary acceleration time (PAT) and ejection time (ET) were measured in the parasternal short-axis view by pulsed-wave Doppler of pulmonary artery flow. Result(s): Neonatal hyperoxia exposure had persistent adverse effects on lung growth even in adulthood in this model. Hyperoxia exposed mice displayed alveolar simplification and arrest in pulmonary vascular development compared to mice maintained in room air. Alveolarization and angiogenesis was better preserved in hyperoxia-exposed female mice compared to similarly exposed male mice. Hyperoxia-exposed male mice showed increased macrophage infiltration in the lungs compared to females. Increased pulmonary hypertension was observed in hyperoxiaexposed animals at 6-8 weeks compared to room air controls. HIF-1 alpha and VEGF mRNA and protein expression was decreased in hyperoxia exposed animals and this was more significant in males. Conclusion(s): Brief exposure to hyperoxia (PND 1-5) in the neonatal period can lead to long-term effects in lung growth persisting into adulthood and we present sex-specific differences in our model. Persistent changes in expression of crucial angiogenic genes such as HIF-1 alpha and VEGF may in part explain these differences. These results support the hypothesis that sex plays a crucial role in hyperoxia-mediated lung injury in this model.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen administration is frequently encountered in the treatment of infants and adults with pulmonary insufficiency. However, hyperoxia contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants and ALI/ARDS in children and adults. In this investigation, we tested the hypotheses that mice lacking the genes for NAP(P)H quinone reductase (NQO1) or NQO2 will be more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury in vivo, compared to wild type (WT) mice, and that pre-treatment of these mice with the cytochrome P4501A inducer beta-napthoflavone (BNF) will rescue this phenotype. Ten-twelve week-old wild type (WT) (C57BL/6J) mice, NQO1- null, or NQO2-null mice were treated i.p. with vehicle CO or BNF (40 mg/kg), once daily for 4 days, and the animals were either maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia for 24- 72 h. The lungs were fixed in buffered formalin, and were paraffin sectioned and stained with H&E. Lung injury and inflammation was assessed by measuring lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios, histology, and neutrophil recruitment by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression of CYP1A1, Nrf2 and NQO1/2 genes was determined in lung by real time RT-PCR. The NQO1-null and NQO2-null mice were more susceptible to oxygen-mediated lung damage and inflammation than WT mice, as evidenced by increased lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios, lung injury, neutrophil recruitment, and augmented expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, in these animals compared with those in WT mice. There was no significant difference in the extent of lung injury between NQO1- and NQO2-null mice. Pretreatment of WT, NQO1-null, as well as NQO2-null mice with BNF, followed by hyperoxia for 24-72 h, led to significant attenuation of lung injury. BNF treatment led to increased expression of CYP1A1 gene expression in lungs and liver, and of CYP1A2 gene in liver in each of the genotypes. The fact that NQO1- and NQO2-null mice are more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury suggests that these enzymes are protective against oxygen injury. That BNF-pretreated mice show attenuation of hyperoxic lung injury in WT, NQO1- null, and NQO2-null mice, and the fact that these mice display augmentation of pulmonary CYP1A1 and hepatic CYP1A1/1A2 support the hypothesis the BNF protected against lung injury by inducing the expression of CYP1A enzymes. . Future research could lead to the development of novel strategies for prevention and/or treatment of BPD and ALI/ARDS.

AB  - Introduction: Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are both inflammatory diseases that affect the respiratory airway. Even though the association of both conditions is well known in the adult population, few studies with objective measurements of both conditions are available in the pediatric field. The aim of this study is to investigate factors associated with higher obstructive respiratory event index (OREI) among asthmatic patients. Method(s): We studied patients >= 7 and < 18 years old, with persistent asthma attending a tertiary clinical care in Brazil. Exclusion criteria were: craniofacial or thoracic malformation, genetic syndromes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiolitis obliterans, neuromuscular diseases, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis. Questionnaires regarding asthma, rhinitis, and asthma control were applied. Children performed Pulmonary Function Test and Home Sleep Apnea Test. A generalized linear model was used to investigate factors associated with OREI. We considered habitual snore that present in >= 3 times/week. OSA was classified based on OREI: > 1 mild, > 5 moderate, and > 10 severe. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): 59 asthmatic patients (11 year, P25 = 8.5, P75 = 13, 52% female) were included. Mild or moderate asthma was seen in 17% while 83% had severe asthma. Considering the past 12 months, 68% was uncontrolled. Overweight or obesity was found in 35% and failure to thrive in 3%. Mild apnea was found in 3%, moderate in 12%, and severe in 84%. Asthma control was associated with OREI (generalized linear model, Poisson distribution, Prevalence Ratio = 2.3, p = 0.001; asthma uncontrolled in past 12 months associated with higher OREI). Habitual snore was not associated with OREI (generalized linear model, Poisson distribution, Prevalence Ratio = 0, p = 0.97) Conclusion(s): Home Sleep Apnea Test detected OSA in all patients (84% with severe OSA). Asthma control was associated with OSA (higher OREI associated with uncontrolled asthma). A sleep study must always be considered in asthmatic patients since the history of habitual snore was not a good predictor of OSA in this population.

AB  - Lung fibrosis is an ultimate consequence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which shows the excessive proliferation of lung fibroblasts (LFs). To find a better model for studying the role of LFs in hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis at the cellular level, we isolated LFs from the lung tissue of hyperoxia- and normoxia-exposed rat lungs on postnatal days 7, 14 and 21 for primary culture to study their proliferative behavior. In the present study, the LF predominance was > 95% in our culture method. The LFs isolated from rats exposed to hyperoxia in vivo showed significantly greater proliferation than that from normoxia-exposed rats. Flow cytometry revealed that percentage of LFs in S and G2/M stage increased, and proportion in the G0/G1 stage declined at the same time. A greater presence of myofibroblasts in LFs isolated from rats exposed to hyperoxia compared with those exposed to normoxia. In addition, elevated collagen level, transforming growth factor-beta and connective tissue growth factor protein expression in conditioned medium were also found in hyperoxia LFs. These data demonstrate that hyperoxia promotes LFs proliferation, myofibroblast transdifferentiation and collagen synthesis in a time-dependent manner. The primary culture of LFs from hyperoxia-exposed rats is a feasible method for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of lung fibrosis caused by BPD at the cellular level.

AB  - Rationale: The overall objective of our study "STOP BPD" (Signature of Top Omic Profiles in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia) was to prospectively define and validate clinical and "omic" signatures associated with resilience against, or risk for development of BPD, with the goal of informing the development of primary prevention strategies for BPD. Method(s): 230 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants were enrolled at birth. Blood/serum, tracheal aspirates and urine samples were collected within 72 hours of life. Patients were divided into four groups based on NIH BPD clinical prediction tool, and actual clinical outcomes: No BPD Concordant (Predicted to have no BPD and developed no BPD), No BPD Discordant (Predicted to have severe BPD but developed no BPD), Severe BPD Concordant (Predicted to have severe BPD, and developed severe BPD) and Severe BPD Discordant (Predicted to have no BPD, but who develop Severe BPD). In phase 1, we analyzed plasma samples collected within first 72 hours of birth for mRNA by AmpliSeq, miRNA by small RNASeq and Proteomics by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Result(s): A very distinct serum miRNA profile differentiated Severe BPD versus No BPD. Top miRNA in severe BPD vs no BPD was hsa-miR10a-5p (Fold change 0.6, p 0.026) which has predicted targets of HIF1A, LTGB1, CXCR4, STAT5a, DNMT1, MMP3, CDH1, EYA1, ERBB2, MIF etc. Top signaling pathways affected were PDGFR alpha, aSMA, IL-11, VEGFA, Insulin/IGF1R and AR. In No BPD Discordant versus Severe BPD Discordant infants, top differentially expressed miRNA included hsa-miR10a-5p, miR-548ar-5p, miR-448g-5p, miR-449c, miR-199a, miR-30a. Predicted targets were IkBKB, JunB, DDR1, EDN1, HIF1A, SOX9, SMAD4, CD44, ERBB2, CAV1, SIRT1, TGF Beta etc. Proteomic Analysis: Serine Protease Inhibitors were reduced in severe BPD. Distinct protein network differences (such as IGF, CRP, Prdx-1 and serine peptidase inhibitors) were seen in No BPD Discordant vs. Severe BPD Discordant infants. An 'integrated' omic analysis increased the AUC of the NICHD BPD clinical predictor by 10%. Conclusion(s): An integrated omic approach at birth in ELBW infants differentiates the 'predisposition to' or the 'resilience against' development of severe BPD. These findings may help in informing the development of early personalized prevention strategies for BPD in extremely preterm infants.

AB  - Background: Genome-wide association studies in adults for pulmonary function and COPD, have identified gene polymorphisms in chromosome 4 associated with Hedgehog Interacting Protein (HHIP) gene. HHIP is a key regulator of the Hedgehog(Hh) signaling pathway. Loss of HHIP function in animal models leads to lethality at birth due to impairment of branching morphogenesis, resulting in hypoplastic lungs. The defect ultimately results from hyperactive sonic hedgehog (Shh) inhibiting the expression of Fgf10, a fibroblast growth factor expressed in the mesenchyme, which is critical for epithelial morphogenesis. Therefore, low HHIP levels result in reduced Fgf10 levels, impaired growth, and lung hypoplasia. Since BPD is associated with altered growth in small airways, which worsens with stimuli including volutrauma, barotrauma, and reactive oxygen species, HHIP would be a candidate gene for BPD. In addition, Shh promotes smooth muscle differentiation by induction of myocardin and smooth muscle actin. So, there may be a role in PDA susceptibility. Eight different HHIP SNPs were tested based on their associations with COPD and asthma. Method(s): DNA from buccal swabs of infants who are less than 1000 grams at birth (ELBW), with informed parental consent, was isolated and subjected to allelic discrimination by RT-PCR, using specific probes for HHIP SNPs. PDA was diagnosed by echo between day3-5. BPD was defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks PMA. Student's t-test and chi-square were used, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the association between each SNP with BPD adjusting for gestational age (GA). Result(s): Demographic characteristics did not differ among the study groups except birth weight (BW) (835+/-132 vs 715+/-153 gm) and GA (26 vs 25wk), which were less in babies with BPD. Similar trend was seen in babies with PDA. Among the eight SNPs tested, rs13147758 was found to be associated with BPD and rs1512288 was associated with PDA (Table1). After logistic regression analyses, rs1512288 was associated with PDA (p=0.03) when adjusted for GA. Conclusion(s): HHIP SNP is associated with susceptibility of PDA and BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that the HHIP pathway via Shh signaling of smooth muscle differentiation interferes with closure of DA; and low Hhip causing low Fgf10 leads to impaired lung growth thereby making ELBW infants more susceptible to BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multi-factorial chronic lung disease of preterm infants that is characterized by interrupted alveolarization. Importantly, postnatal sepsis leads to BPD; yet, the underlying contributory mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous rodent studies have attempted to address this knowledge gap by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the alveolar phase of lung development. However, the lungs of infants who develop BPD are still in saccular phase of development. To address these knowledge gaps, we tested the hypothesis that LPS administered during the saccular phase of lung development disrupts alveolarization by mechanisms that promote lung inflammation and prevent optimal lung development and repair. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL6J wild-type mice were administered 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg of LPS or an equivalent volume of the vehicle, i.p. once daily on postnatal days (PND) 3, 4, and 5. To determine the molecular mechanisms and the extent of lung inflammation, the lung tissues were collected for proteomic analyses and flow cytometry on PND 6. Additionally, alveolarization was determined by performing lung morphometry on tissues harvested on PND7 and 14. Result(s): LPS increased mortality in a dose-dependent manner. LPS exposure differentially affected the expression of 98 proteins (p<0.05). Specifically, high-dose LPS decreased the expression of proteins regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (Ki67, integrin, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) and increased those mediating inflammation and cell death (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase). Additionally, the proteomic profile indicated LPS dysregulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the lungs. Flow cytometry analyses showed that LPS exposure decreased T-regulatory cells and increased macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Further, LPS-exposed mice had decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts, indicating that LPS disrupts alveolarization. Conclusion(s): Collectively, our results suggest that early LPS exposure disrupts alveolarization by mechanisms that promote lung inflammation and prevent optimal lung development and repair. Importantly, we have identified several potential therapeutic targets for sepsis-mediated BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Introduction: Inflammation and dysregulated innate immunity play a vital role in the pathophysiology of many lung diseases. Current clinical practices for treating many of these lung diseases have stagnated in recent years and new immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches are required. To address this our aim was to generate alveolar-like macrophages (ALMs) in vitro from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are resident cells of the pulmonary innate immune system that are responsible for maintaining healthy airways. Unlike bone marrow-derived macrophages, AMs arise from primitive hematopoiesis and are able to proliferate, making them an ideal candidate for cell-based therapies. Method(s): Using a stage-specific directed differentiation approach we generated human ALMs (hALMs) from H1 ESCs. Under defined media conditions ESCs passed through mesodermal progenitor, hemangioblast, and primitive hematopoiesis stages to produce hALMs. Cells were characterized by flow cytometry for typical myeloid and human AM markers. The functional properties of hALMs were determined by assessing their uptake ability of live P. aeruginosa and acetylated, fluorescently-labeled low-density lipoprotein (DiI-AcLDL). Cryopreservation and recovery capacity was also assessed. Result(s): After 1 month of culture hALMs expressed myeloid markers including CD11b, CD11c and CD45, and expressed AM markers CD68, CD163, CD169, CD206 and HLA-DR. These characteristics were maintained after 3 months in culture. hALMs exhibited phagocytic capabilities demonstrated by the uptake of live P. aeruginosa and DiI-AcLDL. In optimum media conditions hALMs exhibited a doubling time of ~48 hours. hALMs undergo cryopreservation and recovery and maintain their cell marker characteristics and proliferative ability. Conclusion(s): Together, these data suggest that we are able to successfully generate hALMS derived from ESCs that are capable of phagocytosis and proliferation in vitro, thus proving scalable for future therapeutic applications. Our hALMs are a prime candidate for cell-based therapies to treat lung diseases that result from inflammation and dysregulated innate immunity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infectious lung diseases.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic pulmonary complication of preterm birth and is characterized by impaired alveolar growth with fewer and larger alveoli and interstitial fibrosis. In premature infants undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal airway colonization with Gram-negative bacteria is associated with development of severe BPD. Tracheal aspirate chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) levels are higher in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome who go on to develop BPD. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a membrane component of Gram negative bacteria capable of inducing a strong proinflammatory immune response, including increased CCL2 expression and CCR2-dependent monocyte/macrophage accumulation. We hypothesized that chronic intranasal LPS exposure of neonatal mice increases lung inflammation and impairs lung alveolar growth in a CCR2-dependent manner. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL/6J and CCR2 knockout mice were inoculated with 3ug/10ul of LPS from E. coli O26:B6 or 10ul of PBS intranasally on day of life 3, 7, and 10. Lungs were harvested on day of life 14. Lung alveolar growth was assessed by lung morphometry. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. Lung myeloid cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Result(s): Chronic intranasal LPS administration to neonatal mice disrupted alveolar growth leading to larger alveolar spaces and significantly increased alveolar chord length. In addition, chronic intranasal inoculation with LPS induced mRNA gene expression of: CC-chemokines Ccl2, Ccl3, and Ccl4, proinflammatory cytokines Tnfa, Ifng, and Il1b, and matricellular proteins Periostin and SPARC. Chronic intranasal LPS exposure also increased the number of exudative macrophages (F4/80+CD11c+CD11b+) and both lung resident CD11c+F4/80- DC subsets (CD103+ and CD11b+ cells). Neonatal CCR2 knockout mice were protected from LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impaired alveolar growth, showing no significant increase in mRNA expression of the above proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines and matricellular proteins or in alveolar chord length. Compared to wild-type mice, neonatal CCR2 knockout mice showed an attenuated increase in exudative macrophages, but continued to show increases in both CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs in response to chronic LPS exposure. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that in neonatal mice, CCR2 signaling is required for chronic LPS-induced hypoalveolarization, a mechanism linking Gram-negative bacterial LPS-stimulated innate immune response and alveolar development. Future studies will examine the mechanisms by which CCR2+ signaling affects lung growth during chronic LPS exposure.

AB  - Introduction: Infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) have pulmonary inflammation from multiple sources including oxygen exposure. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines have been measured in blood and airway lavage samples from BPD patients, but specific roles for inflammatory cells are unclear. We previously demonstrated that M2-like CD11b+ monocytes/macrophage mitigate hyperoxia-induced lung injury as a model of BPD (Eldredge, AJRCMB 2016). In this pilot study, we sought to 1) define evolving monocyte/macrophage populations in lungs of premature infants during the first month of life and 2) identify potential inflammatory biomarkers expressed by these pulmonary monocyte/macrophages to predict BPD. Method(s): Serial tracheal aspirates were prospectively collected from intubated premature infants born at less than 29 weeks gestation and hospitalized at the University of Washington NICU. Samples were collected at day of life (DOL) 0-3, 7-10, 14-17, and 28-31. Monocytes/macrophages were isolated via fluorescent activated cell sorting. RNA was extracted for QPCR and/or RNASeq analyses. BPD was classically defined as oxygen dependence on DOL 28 and classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on level of respiratory support at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. IRB approval was obtained from UW/Seattle Children's Hospital. Result(s): We analyzed 30 samples from 17 patients (of 30 expected enrollment). 2 patients had mild BPD, 2 moderate BPD, 6 severe BPD, and 4 with severity not yet determined. CD3+T cells, CD19+ B cells, Siglec8+ eosinophils, CD15+CD66b+ neutrophils, CD203+ basophils, and CD56+ NK cells were identified and gated out. Two populations of monocyte/macrophages were identified: CD14+CD16- single positive (SP) and CD14+CD16+ double positive (DP). DP cell numbers were greatest at DOL 0-3 (5.08% of CD45+ cells) and at 28-31 (7.1% of CD45+). SP cell number was greatest at DOL 7-10 (22.8% of CD45+). SP and DP cells express M2-like markers IL-10, CD206, and Arg1, whereas M1-like markers Nos2 and IL-12a were undetectable. DP cells express 30-fold more Arg1 than SP. Infants who develop severe BPD may have increased DP cells before DOL 28 than those with milder BPD. SP and DP cells from three infants who subsequently developed severe BPD had unique transcriptional signatures (Table 1, RNASeq). SP cells expressed more IL7R, TGFBI, and IL-10 than DP, and DP expressed more Arg1. Conclusion(s): We identified two M2-like monocyte/macrophage populations in noninvasive tracheal aspirates from patients at risk for BPD. These populations evolve in number and have unique transcriptomes that may impact BPD pathogenesis through modulation of type 2 inflammation. (Table pressented).

AB  - Background: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to neonatal lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype variations and acquired somatic mutations that cause mitochondrial dysfunction modify risk for ROSassociated pulmonary pathology such as asthma. We have previously found that preterm infants with vascular endothelial cell mitochondrial dysfunction at birth have increased risk for BPD. The objective of our current study was to identify whether differences in mtDNA haplotypes independently affect hyperoxic lung injury susceptibility in newborn mice. Method(s): C57BL6 (C57n/C57mt) and C3H/HeN (C3Hn/C3Hmt) mice wild type (WT) mice that are relatively susceptible and resistant to neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, respectively, were used to create novel Mitochondrial-Nuclear eXchange (MNX) strains - C57MNX (C57n/C3Hmt) and C3HMNX (C3Hn/C57mt). C57BL6 WT, C3H/HeN WT, C57MNX, and C3HMNX were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) or room air from P1-P14 and then evaluated for lung mechanics and lung histology. Result(s): C57WT mice had increased resistance and decreased compliance with exposure to hyperoxia compared to normoxic controls, while hyperoxic and normoxic C3HWT mice had similar resistance and compliance values indicating resistance to hyperoxic lung injury. C57MNX mice (C57n/C3Hmt) exposed to hyperoxia did not have significantly different resistance and compliance compared to room air controls while C3HMNX (C3Hn/C57mt) mice strains showed reduced pulmonary function vs. their normoxic controls (Figure 1A). We also found disorganized lung structure in neonatal mice with C57 mtDNA (C57WT mice and C3HMNX) compared to more normal histologic appearance in mice with C3H mtDNA (C3HWT and C57MNX strains) that were exposed to hyperoxia when compared to their normoxic controls (Figure 1B). Conclusion(s): Mice with C57mtDNA are susceptible to neonatal hyperoxic lung injury compared to mice with C3HmtDNA. This indicates that mtDNA haplogroup variations are risk modifiers of murine BPD. Evaluation of underlying mechanisms including changes in mitochondrial function, gene methylation, and expression are ongoing. (Figure pressented).

AB  - RATIONALE: Mechanical ventilation is associated with ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the preterm infant. Total liquid ventilation (TLV), that uses a low surface tension fluid called perflubron to fill and ventilate the lungs, has interesting properties that could diminish VILI and help prevent BPD. Our objective is to test the hypothesis that TLV is less deleterious than conventional gas ventilation (GV) to the neonatal lung in an ovine model of induced surfactant deficiency. METHOD(S): Fourteen lambs (1-4 days of life, 3.2 +/- 0.9 kg) were intubated, anesthetized and paralyzed and 5 lambs were used as controls (i.e. no ventilation). Surfactant deficiency was induced by repeated lung lavages, until PaO2/FiO2 reached <100 mmHg for 20 minutes. Lambs were then randomized to GV (n=7) or TLV (n=7). After 5h of ventilation, lung tissue was collected from both the dependent and non-dependent lung regions for histological (Hillman score) and qRT-PCR RNA analysis. Mann-Whitney U test was used for histological score and t-test was used for RNA analysis. RNA data is presented as fold increase compared to control. RESULT(S): After 5 h of mechanical ventilation, lambs from the TLV group had better histological scores in dependent lung regions (2.1 +/- 1.6 vs 4.0 +/- 1.5, p=0.04). There was no significant difference in non-dependent regions. In dependent regions, there was a higher expression of HIF-1alpha (3.5 +/- 1.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.3, p<0.01) and less expression of elastase (0.7 +/- 0.4 vs 1.7+/- 0.7, p=0.004) in the TLV group. In the non-dependent region, there was a significant rise in the expression of aquaporin-1 (1.8 +/- 0.8 vs 1.0 +/- 0.4, p=0.04) and HIF- 1alpha (3.2 +/- 1.5 vs 1.6 +/- 0.4, p=0.03) as well as a trend towards more expression of RNA encoding for surfactant protein-A (1.4 +/- 0.4 vs 1.0 +/- 0.4, p=0.09) and surfactant protein-D (1.2 +/- 0.4 vs 0.81 +/- 0.3, p=0.07) in the TLV group. CONCLUSION(S): TLV was protective to the lung when compared to GV. RNA expression following TLV showed an interesting pattern. As we are aiming at BPD prevention, a higher expression of pro-developmental molecules such as HIF-1 alpha as well as a higher production of Aquaporin-1 and lower production of elastase, two molecules implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease, are promising.

AB  - Rationale: The pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial with multiple regulatory pathways contributing to the inflammation and disrupted alveolar development in BPD. Adenosine signaling is a key regulatory pathway in the lung, and sustained adenosine signaling activates pro-inflammatory pathways leading to ongoing inflammation and abnormal lung development. There is growing evidence from animal models that adenosine may play a role in BPD. In this study, we examined the regulation of adenosine pathway components in human BPD samples. Method(s): Lung lysates from 19 patients (10 BPD and 9 controls) were analyzed for transcriptional and protein alterations in key adenosine signaling mediators. We utilized quantitative real-time PCR for transcriptional analysis with normalization to 18s RNA, and results were normalized using the comparative Ct method (2deltadeltaCt). Immunoblots for CD73, Adora2a and Adora2b were used for protein analysis with normalization to GAPDH. Result(s): Quantitative PCR revealed significant elevations of adenosine receptors Adora1 and Adora2b. There was a trend for increased Adora3. Adora2a transcript levels were unchanged. There was also a trend for increased ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73), the enzyme that performs the final step in extracellular adenosine production. Metabolism of adenosine was also increased including a significant increase in the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2) and a trend for increased ENT1 and adenosine deaminase (ADA). Interestingly, protein analysis revealed a trend for decreased Adora2a and no change in CD73 or Adora2b proteins. However, subgroup analysis demonstrated decreased Adora2b in patients with Respiratory Distress Syndrome and BPD, and increased Adora2a in patients with BPD and cytomegalovirus infection. Conclusion(s): Patients with BPD have alterations of adenosine signaling mediators. The transcriptional pattern includes mediators that would increase adenosine signaling as well as increase adenosine metabolism. Protein analysis revealed mediator changes in subgroups of neonatal patients, suggesting adenosine signaling may play a role in other disease processes as well. (Figure presented) .

AB  - Rationale: Hyperoxic exposure in neonates causes lung injury including arrested vascularization and simplified alveolarization, which are the characteristics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Lung vascular development and endothelial cell (EC) signals are important for normal alveolarization. Metabolic shifts towards glycolysis support proliferation by providing ribose 5- phosphate and NADPH for biomass synthesis through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Although hyperoxic exposure reduces glycolytic capacity and reserve in lung epithelial cells, it is not known whether hyperoxic exposure alters glycolysis in lung ECs. We hypothesize that hyperoxic exposure alters glycolysis, resulting in abnormal proliferation in lung ECs. Method(s): Mouse fetal lung endothelial cell line (MFLM-91U) and primary lung microvascular ECs isolated from neonatal mice (3-5 days old) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) for 24 h and 6 h, respectively. Some cultures were placed in air for 1, 3 and 7 days post exposure (air recovery). Glycolysis was measured by the Seahorse XF Analyzer. Proliferation was measured using the Click-iTTM EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit. Result(s): Hyperoxic exposure significantly increased glycolytic flux (indicated by an extracellular acidification rate) in MFLM- 91U cells. This was associated with increased protein levels of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for the PPP. Increased glycolysis was maintained in lung ECs exposed o hyperoxia followed by air recovery for 24 h compared to normoxic exposure. Hyperoxic exposure reduced proliferation, which was restored when cells were recovered in air for 1, 3 and 7 days after hyperoxia. Interestingly, proliferation was reduced when we blocked glycolysis and the PPP using a non-metabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (6 mM, 12 h) and 6-aminonicotinamide (an inhibitor of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, 20 muM, 12 h), respectively. Conclusion(s): Initial hyperoxic exposure causes a compensatory increase in glucose utilization towards the pentose phosphate pathway, which is maintained in recovery phase for proliferation. These findings suggest metabolic shifts in ECs as a potential mechanism for abnormal proliferation in BPD and its complications (e.g., pulmonary hypertension).

AB  - The effect of CASZI on bronchopulmonary development in neonatal rats was investigated. Forty SD rats were randomly divided into the control group (n=20) and the experimental group (n=20) using a random number table. The experimental group was treated with hyperoxia to establish the bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model, while the control group received no treatment. At 14 days of experiment, rats in each group were treated, and lung tissues were taken for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Radial alveolar count (RAC) and morphological changes in lung tissues were observed under a microscope, and the thickness of respiratory membrane was detected via IPP6 image. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of CASZI, Rho kinase, RhoA and ET-A receptor in lung tissues. There were no obviously pathological changes in lung tissues of neonatal rats in the control group, while BPD could be seen in lung tissue structures of neonatal rats in the experimental group. RAC in experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05), and the thickness of respiratory membrane was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). CASZI mRNA expression level in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in control group (P<0.05), and Rho kinase, RhoA and ET-A receptor mRNA expression levels were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). CASZI protein expression level in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05), and the Rho kinase, RhoA and ET-A receptor protein expression levels were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). In conclusion, CASZI expression was downregulated during the development of BPD. CASZI downregulation may have an effect on the pulmonary microvascular regeneration through RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, thus participating in the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive respiratory disease whose underlying mechanism is not completely understood and which currently lacks effective treatment. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to prevent pulmonary fibrosis in preclinical models of IPF. We have demonstrated that MSCs exert their therapeutic effects through exosome vectors in murine models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Here we investigated the efficacy of bone marrow-derived MSC exosomes (MEx) and their immunomodulatory potential in a bleomycin IPF model. Method(s): Exosomes were isolated from media conditioned by MSCs using iodixanol density gradient and characterized by electron microscopy and western blot. Ten to fourteen-week old C57BL/6 mice received endotracheal bleomycin (60 mug) on day 0 followed by a bolus dose of IV MEx or fibroblast-derived exosomes (FEx, control) on days 0 or 7. Lungs were harvested on days 7 and 14 for histologic assessment, collagen deposition, cytometric and gene expression analysis. Result(s): The administration of MEx concurrent with or 7 days after bleomycin resulted in a significant reduction of lung fibrosis and collagen content compared to bleomycin controls. There was an increase in the expression of macrophage inflammatory markers Il-6, Ccl-2, and Arginase-1 in the bleomycin group, while their levels were normalized with MEx treatment. Protein expression of Cd206 and Arginase-1, macrophage markers of M2 activation, increased after bleomycin administration but remained similar to control levels after MEx treatment. Whole-lung flow cytometric analysis showed an increase in alveolar macrophage (AM) number on day 14 in the bleomycin group. This was associated with a shift from Ly6Chi to Ly6Clow circulating monocytes. MEx treatment led to the restoration of the AM population and monocyte phenotype to control levels. A significant rise in lung regulatory T cells (Tregs) was observed in response to MEx, but there was no significant difference in T cell subpopulations between bleomycin-treated versus control mice. Interestingly, MEx treatment led to the reduction in apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Using the bleomycin IPF model we show that treatment with a bolus dose of MEx delivered either at the induction of the inflammatory phase or during its course leads to significant amelioration of pulmonary fibrosis. This effect was exerted through modulation of alveolar macrophage phenotype and shift in recruited monocyte subpopulations, and was plausibly independent of adaptive immunity. This study suggests that the use of MSC exosomes represents a potential cell-free therapy for the treatment of fibrotic lung diseases.

AB  - RATIONALE Preterm neonates exposed to mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or increased O2 evolve bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a neonatal chronic lung disease, characterized by reduced alveolar formation. Prior studies showed that MV reduces Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor that regulates cell pluripotency and survival. Since type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII cells) are crucial in alveolarization and serve as progenitor cells for lung regeneration, we hypothesized: Klf4 is expressed in ATII cells during late lung development; dysregulation of Klf4 is mechanistically linked to reduced alveolarization after exposure to increased O2 or MV. METHODS 1) Neonatal C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 85% O2 or room air from postnatal day 1 (P1) until P28. Lungs were excised and either snap-frozen or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde, followed by paraffin embedding. 2) Murine ATII cells (MLE-12) were exposed to either hyperoxia (85% O2) vs normoxia (21% O2) or to cyclic stretch (20% elongation; 1Hz). Klf4 was overexpressed in MLE-12 using a doxycycline-inducible sleeping beauty transposon system. Survival was assessed by MTT or BrdU assay. RESULTS 1) Dual immunofluorescent staining for Klf4 and surfactant protein C (SfptC) showed localization of Klf4 in ATII cells during late lung development (P7 and P28). Exposure of newborn mice to hyperoxia decreased gene expression and protein abundance of Klf4 in lungs significantly. The loss of Klf4 was linked to reduced mRNA and protein of alveolar cell-specific markers (SftpC and Aquaporin 5), indicating arrested alveolar growth. Reduced radial alveolar count coupled with increased mean linear intercept confirmed less alveolar formation after hyperoxia. 2) Hyperoxia did not only decrease Klf4 protein and mRNA expression in cultured MLE-12, but also inhibited cell survival (MTT and BrdU). Moreover, prolonged exposure of MLE-12 cells to cyclic stretch for 24 hours reduced Klf4 mRNA. Intriguingly, overexpression of Klf4 did not protect MLE-12 cells from reduced survival after hyperoxia; in contrast, Klf4 overexpression aggravated the adverse effect of hyperoxia on proliferation of MLE-12 cells, indicating thereby that both loss and overexpression of Klf4 regulate ATII cell homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS We show for the first time, that Klf4 is expressed in ATII cells during late lung development. Loss of Klf4 in vitro an in vivo following hyperoxia was linked to reduced survival and lung growth, respectively. Here, we identify Klf4 as a novel key regulator of ATII cell homeostatasis and a potential novel target to prevent hyperoxia-induced lung injury.

AB  - Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and severe chronic lung disease of premature infants. Inflammation from oxygen exposure contributes to BPD pathogenesis. The naive newborn lung has a dominant type 2 immune response, including immunomodulatory macrophages. We previously found that depletion of CD11b-expressing monocyte/macrophages at birth led to severe acute hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) with capillary leak and significant mortality. Analyses of CD11b-DTR+ and CD11c-DTR+, and CCR2-DTR+ depleted mice demonstrated protective roles for Ly6CloCD11chi interstitial macrophages/monocytes (IM) and alveolar macrophages (AM). In this study, we sought to explore the functions of specific mononuclear phagocyte populations in HILI as a model for BPD, focusing on role of IL-33 and other IL-1 cytokine family members. Methods HILI was used to model BPD in neonatal mice as previously described with FiO2 0.8-0.9. In parallel, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.9 FiO2 or normoxia for 24h and we isolated four populations of mononuclear phagocytes - immature alveolar macrophages (AM), Ly6Chi IM, Ly6Clo IM, and dendritic cells (DC) - for RNASeq analysis. We then performed QPCR with nested primer sets targeting Type 2 inflammatory pathways in lungs from DT-treated CD11b-DTR+, CD11c-DTR+, and CCR2-DTR+ mice after 24h of hyperoxia. Results RNASeq analysis was performed on the four sorted mononuclear populations (AM, DC, Ly6Chi IM, and Ly6Clo IM) in normoxia and hyperoxia conditions at PN1. These populations were distinct based on principal component analysis (Figure 1). The IL-1 family member IL1f9 (IL-36g) was increased in hyperoxia-exposed mice by 9-fold in Ly6Clo IM, 7- fold in DC, and 4-fold in AM but not in Ly6Chi IM. Ly6Chi IM had upregulation of the M1 gene IL- 1a. Given our growing interest in the IL-1 family, we found that IL-33 expression in the newborn lung increases after 24h of hyperoxia. IL-33 expression is decreased in lungs of DT-treated CD11b-DTR+ mice compared with DTR-controls, but not in CD11c-DTR+ or CCR2-DTR+ mice. There was also a trend toward decreased levels of the downstream growth factor amphiregulin (Areg) in CD11b-DTR+ mice but not in CD11c-and CCR2-DTR+ mice. Another IL-1 family member IL-36g was increased in CD11b-DTR+ mice but unchanged in CD11c-and CCR2-DTR+ mice. Conclusions Mononuclear phagocyte sources of IL-1 family cytokines may play a protective role in HILI. This work furthers our understanding of how these innate cells modulate inflammatory lung injury in the neonatal lung. Future work will explore IL-33 and IL-36g in epithelial-innate cell interactions in HILI and BPD. $$graphic-3A22ACCC-77BF-44D3-ADE5- 28F08B16FD9C$$ (Figure presented) .

AB  - Purpose: While the administration of supplemental oxygen has been critical in improving the survival of premature infants with respiratory failure, it also significantly contributes to the development of pulmonary damage, which results in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We have recently shown that autophagy plays an important role in hyperoxia-induced apoptotic cell death in developing lungs, and that the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) complex regulates lung injury in the BPD mouse model (Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2016 Nov;55(5):722-735). Therefore, we screened for regulators of MTOR and focused on microRNAs (miRs), which are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The present study tests the hypothesis that miR-99 plays a role in the development of HALI and BPD, and targets specific signaling pathways that can modulate autophagy. Method(s): For in vitro experiments, mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12 cells) were divided into 2 groups: normoxia and hyperoxia. Hyperoxia was induced by placing MLE-12 cells for indicated time points (6 and 24 hours) in 95% O2/5% CO2 at 37degreeC. For in vivo experiments, newborn mice, along with their mothers, were exposed to either 100% O2 for the first 4 postnatal (PN) days, or kept in room air conditions throughout, and were sacrificed at PN4. MiR-99 expression at specific time points was assessed by RT-PCR and the expression of target proteins was analyzed by Western blot. Result(s): Histology of PN4 mouse lungs shows larger, simpler saccules with thinner walls in those exposed to hyperoxia conditions. MiR-99 expression was significantly increased (p<0.01) at PN4 upon hyperoxia. In MLE-12 cells, the level was significantly increased at 6 hours and 24 hours upon hyperoxia exposure (both p<0.05). We also noted an increase in the target proteins pMTOR, MTOR, p-P70S6, and SQSTM1/p62, as well as a decrease in the target protein RPTOR in hyperoxia-exposed MLE-12 cells. Conclusion(s): We conclude that miR-99 expression is increased in hyperoxia conditions in the in vitro and in vivo models, with concomitant effects on autophagy-related target proteins in vitro.

Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide that mediates its angiogenic effects via calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Calcrl) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) -2. We observed that global AM-deficient mice have an increased susceptibility to neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. However, the endothelial cell-specific contribution and mechanisms of AM-mediated effects on developing lungs are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that endothelial AM signaling-deficient neonatal mice will display increased susceptibility to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD compared with wild-type mice. Method(s): In vivo studies: To disrupt endothelial AM signaling, we decreased the expression of the AM receptor, Calcrl, in the mouse lung endothelial cells by breeding Calcrlflox/flox mice with Tie-Cre mice. One-day-old endothelial Calcrl-sufficient (eCalcrl +/+) or - deficient (eCalcrl +/-) mice were exposed to air (FiO2 21%) or hyperoxia (FiO2 70%) for up to 14 d, following which the mouse lungs were harvested to determine angiogenesis and alveolarization, and the expression of Calcrl. In vitro studies: For mechanistic studies, we used fetal human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) and human pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) and determined the effects of Calcrl antagonist, Calcrl knockdown, and AM on angiogenesis and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Result(s): Exposure of neonatal mice to 70% oxygen decreased the expression of endothelial Calcrl expression. Further, endothelial Calcrl deficiency augmented hyperoxia-induced alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification in neonatal mice. Mechanistically, inhibition or knockdown of Calcrl in human fetal lung endothelial cells decreased eNOS expression, ERK1/2 activation, and in vitro angiogenesis. Additionally, inhibition of ERK1/2 and eNOS signaling in these cells decreased AM-mediated angiogenesis. Conclusion(s): We conclude that endothelial AM signaling protects against hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD via ERK1/2 and eNOS pathways. Our results indicate that AM and Calcrl- RAMP2 interface are potential therapeutic targets for the management of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants, but mechanisms causing alveolar simplification are not well understood. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-17~92 expression is severely attenuated in human patients who died with BPD and in a murine model of BPD. This cluster is predicted to regulate many genes implicated in BPD pathogenesis, including TGF-beta. Murine global deletion of miR-17-92 results in fatal neonatal respiratory failure from reduced alveolar epithelial cells; however, the developmental phenotype of partial miR-17~92 deletion, or "haploinsufficiency" (HI), has not previously been characterized. Rationale: The following studies test the hypothesis that miR-17~92 HI causes alveolar simplification and pulmonary hypertension reminiscent of a BPD-like phenotype. Method(s): miR-17~92flx/flx and Sox2-Cre+/- mice were mated to produce HI (Sox2-cretg/-/miR-17-92+/delta) and control (C: Sox2-cre-/-/miR-17-92+/flx) offspring. At birth, pups were assigned to room air (RA) or 85% oxygen (O2) exposure for 14 days and then sacrificed. Using H&E stained slides, analyses for alveolar count and area were performed using ImageQuant Pro (n=3/group); medial wall thickness (MWT) was measured on small muscularized pulmonary arteries using ImageJ (n=3/group). Hearts were dissected, separating the right ventricle (RV) from the left ventricle and septum (LV+S) (n=5-10/group). TGF-beta activation was quantified by Phospho(P)-SMAD to SMAD2 ratio using Western blot on whole lung homogenates (n=3-4/group). Data analyzed by one-way ANOVA or paired t-test where appropriate. Significance noted at p<0.05. Result(s): Alveolar counts were significantly less in HIRA (83.7) vs C-RA (156.3) but greater in HI-RA than C-O2 (48.4) and HI-O2 (37.9) groups. Alveolar count was not different between O2-exposure groups. Alveolar area was enlarged in HIRA vs C-RA (2053 vs 1136 mum2). The Fulton's index, a ratio of RV to LV+S weights, was equivocal between HI-RA (0.274) and C-O2 (0.271), and significantly different than C-RA (0.241) and HI-O2 (0.317). No difference was present between groups for MWT. There was a trend toward increased P-SMAD/SMAD2 ratio in HI-RA (1.99) vs C-RA (1.45) (p=0.09). Conclusion(s): Our data reveals that miR-17~92 HI causes alveolar simplification as evidenced by increased alveolar area and decreased alveolar counts in HI-RA pups. The Fulton's index indicates that HI alters the right ventricle, similar to O2-exposed BPD models. Vascular remodeling was not present and additional studies are underway to determine the mechanism for the increased Fulton's index. This HI model provides an opportunity to elucidate the biologic impact of miR17~ 92 on alveolar and vascular simplification present in traditional BPD models.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of preterm birth and is characterized by hypoalveolarization, interstitial thickening and dysmorphic microvasculature. We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of immature mice (a model of BPD) increases the number of activated CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs). We also showed CD103+ DCs are required for hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 195: A7181, 2017). We hypothesize that hyperoxic exposure modulates the development of lung CD103+ DCs by stimulating DC growth factor expression. We also hypothesize that hyperoxic exposure induces lung CD103+ DC secretory phenotype that mediates hypoalveolarization. Method(s): 2 day-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to normoxia or 75% oxygen for up to 14 days or inoculated intranasally with recombinant Saa3 or CXCL9 on DOL 2, 5, 7 and 9. Lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR and ELISA. Lung myeloid cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. CD103+ DCs were flow-sorted. E16 fetal lungs were microdissected and cultured in transwell plates. Result(s): Normoxia-exposed immature mice showed a gradual increase in whole lung mRNA and protein levels of the DC growth factor FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) as well as in CD103+ DC numbers between day of life 3 and 16. Compared to normoxic mice, whole lung Flt3L levels were higher on day 1 and 7 of hyperoxic exposure, followed by a significant increase in lung CD103+ DC number after 14 days of hyperoxia. Flow-sorted lung CD103+ DCs from hyperoxic lungs showed higher mRNA expression of the acute phase protein associated with fibrosis Serum Amyloid A3 (Saa3) and angiostatic chemokine CXCL9. Similar increases in Saa3 and CXCL9 mRNA and protein were observed in whole lungs after hyperoxia. In E16 fetal lung explants, Saa3 decreased Pdgfra and Cd31 mRNA expression, CXCL9 decreased Wnt2 and Cd31 mRNA expression and combined Saa3 and CXCL9 treatment had an additive effect in decreasing Wnt2 and Cd31 expression. Immature mice inoculated with Saa3 or CXCL9 showed larger alveoli and a significant increase in alveolar chord length. Conclusion(s): In normoxiaexposed mice during early life, the number of lung CD103+ DCs gradually increases and correlates with an increase in lung Flt3L expression. This process is accelerated by hyperoxic exposure. CD103+ DCs and their secretory products represent new targets for BPD prevention and treatment.

AB  - RATIONALE Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are twice as likely to require rehospitalization in the first two years. Although all infants born preterm have higher rates of pulmonary problems than their term counterparts, infants with BPD continue to experience sequelae into adolescence and adulthood. METHODS A prospective cohort of infants in neonatal intensive care units within Cleveland Clinic Children's were identified. Serum samples were obtained at birth, and highly-sensitive immunoassays were used to measure BDNF and NGF protein concentrations. Participants consented to be followed for 18 years, completing annual telephone follow-up calls. Results at each follow-up time were analyzed separately. Subjects with and without BPD were compared on outcomes at 1, 2, and 3 year follow-up surveys using Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. The associations between outcomes and serum neurotrophins were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. RESULTS This is an interim analysis of 32, 35, and 19 patients who have completed the 12, 24, and the 36-month follow-up questionnaires respectively. In each cohort respectively, 8, 10, and 8 patients had a history of BPD. At one year, subjects with BPD had significantly fewer sick visits (p=0.042) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) (p=0.012) than subjects with BPD; this unexpected finding is likely due to the extended NICU length of stay in the BPD group. They also were significantly more likely to require home oxygen therapy (6/8=75% vs 5/24=21%, p=0.010). At two years, subjects with BPD were more likely to have a new diagnosis of asthma than subjects without BPD (3/10=30% vs 2/25=8%, p=0.043). At three years, subjects with BPD were more likely to have sick visits for wheezing/breathing problems than those without BPD (p=0.038). Higher serum BDNF at birth was significantly associated with greater numbers of URTI in the first year (correlation =0.37, p=0.042), whereas higher serum NGF at birth was significantly associated with fewer admissions and numbers of sick visits in the first year (correlations -0.40 and -0.42, p-values 0.028, 0.020 respectively). CONCLUSIONS Infants with BPD are at an increased risk of being diagnosed with asthma, or seeking medical attention for respiratory symptoms by 2 years. Serum levels of BDNF and NGF obtained at birth may provide valuable insight into the postnatal course of these children. These early biomarkers may help set expectations for a child's long-term pulmonary outlook. Further analysis and adjustment for other patient characteristics is needed as more data is collected.

AB  - Rationale: Pulmonary angiogenesis during early alveolarization is essential for distal lung growth. We previously showed that activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) during early alveolarization promotes pulmonary angiogenesis. Proteomic analyses to identify unique factors present in the early alveolar lung microenvironment identified transforming growth factor induced protein (TGFBI) as a putative activator of NFkappaB in the developing pulmonary endothelium. Method(s): To determine a role for TGFBI in promoting NFkappaB-mediated pulmonary angiogenesis during alveolarization, we isolated primary pulmonary endothelial cells (PEC) from early alveolar and adult mice. NFkappaB activation was assessed by EMSA and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) determined by western immunoblot. PEC migration was assessed using scratch and microfluidic chemotaxis assays in TGFBI-stimulated WT (C57BL/6) PEC, and in PEC obtained from mice with an EC-specific deletion of the NFkappaB activator, IKKbeta. In separate studies, TGFBI-stimulated migration was assessed in PEC treated with; (i) BAY 11-7082, a pharmacologic inhibitor of NFkappaB; (ii) antibodies to inhibit alphavbeta3 integrins; and (iii) siRNA against alphav and beta3 integrins. TGFBI regulated genes were characterized in early alveolar and adult PEC using RNA Seq. WT and TGFBI null mice were exposed to chronic hyperoxia (FiO2 85%) from P0 to P14, and radial alveolar counts determined to assess alveolarization. Result(s): TGFBI induced both early alveolar and adult PEC migration (p<0.01), serving as both a chemoattractant and chemokinetic. TGFBI activated the angiogenic MAPKs: ERK(p<0.01), p38(p<0.05) and Akt (p<0.05) at 5 minutes, and increased NFkappaB activation by 40% at 1 hr. Although TGFBI promoted PEC migration in WT PEC (p<0.01), TGFBI-mediated migration was abrogated in PEC treated with BAY 11-7082, and in PEC lacking IKKbeta. TGFBI-mediated migration was also blunted by antibodies blocking alphavbeta3 integrins (p<0.01), and by silencing av (p<0.01) or beta3 (p<0.05) integrins. RNA-Seq to characterize TGFBI-mediated genes identified Csf3, a modulator of nitric oxide, as a target increased by TGFBI in both early alveolar and adult PEC. Finally, hyperoxia-exposed TGFBI null mice had significantly lower radial alveolar counts as compared to hyperoxia exposed WT mice (p<0.001), suggesting a more marked impairment in alveolarization. Conclusion(s): These studies identify TGFBI as a developmentally regulated protein expressed in the early alveolar lung which functions via alphavbeta3 integrins to promote NFkappaB-mediated EC migration. We speculate that TGFBI plays a key role in regulating pulmonary angiogenesis during alveolarization, and could represent a new therapeutic target to treat lung diseases characterized by impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Rationale: It has become clear that survivors of premature birth suffer from an arrest in lung development that is characterized by abnormalities in lung structure and function that persist into adulthood, known as Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). There are currently no therapies for the arrest in lung development in BPD, nor an understanding of the mechanisms leading to a persistence of an arrest in lung development and compromised repair mechanisms that are seen in survivors of premature birth. We have previously shown that the treatment of neonatal rats with mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (EV) protect lung structure in neonatal mice during exposure to hyperoxia. We hypothesize that EV protection of lung structure is through induction of Akt/eNOS mediated angiogenesis. Method(s): We collected conditioned medium from rat bone marrow derived MSCs and isolated EV by standard protocol. To assess Akt activation HUVEC cells were treated with EV along with MK-2206, an Akt inhibitor (iAkt), and quantified phospho-Akt and phospho-eNOS levels. Functional effects of EVs were analyzed by in vitro tube formation and scratch assays (migration). There was an n=4 in each condition. Result(s): Treatment with MSC derived EV induced Akt phosphorylation and in bi-phasic manner. At 8 hrs time point phosphorylation of Akt increased by 89% +/- 68 (p = 0.087). Yet EV treatment significantly increased in e-NOS phosphorylation by 78% +/- 19 (p = 0.002). Treatment with Akt inhibitor blocked EV induced Akt phosphorylation and down stream e-NOS activation. EV treatment increased tube formation by 75% (p<0.01). Akt inhibition blocked EV-induced tube formation. EV treatment increased HUVEC migration by 81% (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Treatment with MSC derived-EV enhances HUVEC tube formation and migration. A mechanism for this may be through an increase in eNOS activation that is known to be a critical pathway for endothelial cell growth and function. This suggests that the effect of EV treatment may be through the enhancement or preservation of lung vascular growth that is known to be dysfunctional in hyperoxic injury of premature infants.

AB  - Infants born premature are at increased risk for development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and ultimately right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, which together carry a high risk of neonatal mortality. However, the role alveolar simplification and abnormal pulmonary microvascular development in BPD affects RV contractile properties is unknown. We used a rat model of BPD to examine the effect of hyperoxia-induced PH on RV contractile properties. We measured in vivo RV pressure as well as passive force, maximum Ca2+ activated force, calcium sensitivity of force (pCa50) and rate of force redevelopment (ktr) in RV skinned trabeculae isolated from hearts of 21-and 35-day old rats pre-exposed to 21% oxygen (normoxia) or 85% oxygen (hyperoxia) for 14 days after birth. Systolic and diastolic RV pressure were significantly higher at day 21 in hyperoxia exposed rats compared to normoxia control rats, but normalized by 35 days of age. Passive force, maximum Ca2+ activated force, and calcium sensitivity of force were elevated and cross-bridge cycling kinetics depressed in 21-day old hyperoxic trabeculae, whereas no differences between normoxic and hyperoxic trabeculae were seen at 35 days. Myofibrillar protein analysis revealed that 21-day old hyperoxic trabeculae had increased levels of beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), atrial myosin light chain 1 (aMLC1; often referred to as essential light chain), and slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) compared to age matched normoxic trabeculae. On the other hand, 35-day old normoxic and hyperoxic trabeculae expressed similar level of alpha- and beta-MHC, ventricular MLC1 and predominantly cTnI. These results suggest that neonatal exposure to hyperoxia increases RV afterload and affect both the steady state and dynamic contractile properties of the RV, likely as a result of hyperoxia-induced expression of beta-MHC, delayed transition of slow skeletal TnI to cardiac TnI, and expression of atrial MLC1. These hyperoxia-induced changes in contractile properties are reversible and accompany the resolution of PH with further developmental age, underscoring the importance of reducing RV afterload to allow for normalization of RV function in both animal models and humans with BPD.

AB  - Introduction Premature infants born with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are at risk to evolve bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and chronic obstructive lung diseases. Perturbed lung matrix remodeling coupled with reduced alveolarisation and angiogenesis are basic features of lungs with BPD. Prior studies by our group in a rat model of IUGR showed that dysregulated key developmental molecular pathways directing alveolar formation and matrix remodeling are intimately linked to reduced alveolarisation and impaired lung function. These previous findings let us to hypothesize that IUGR (a) dysregulates angiogenetic pathways and lung matrix assembly during late lung development; and (b) this in turn adversely affects micro-vascularisation. Methods IUGR was induced in Wistar rats using a low protein diet during gestation; control dams received normal protein diet. After birth litter size was reduced to six pups to evoke catch-up growth postnatally; all pups received standard chow. The rats were sacrificed at embryonic day 21 (E21), postnatal day 3 (P3) and P23. The lungs were excised for quantitative histological assessment or gene and protein assays. Results First, anti-angiogenic intrauterine phase: measurement of gene expression showed a reduction of markers of endothelial cell homeostasis (CD31, vWF, and VE-Cadherin), VEGF, and VEGFR2 and BMPR2 by 50 % in lungs after IUGR at E21. Reduced expression of pro-angiogenic markers was linked to decreased activation of signaling pathways Erk1/2 (VEGF signaling) and P38 (non-canonical BMPR signaling) as well as lower mRNA expression of BMPR2 targets id-1 and apelin. Second, pro-angiogenic postnatal phase: during catch-up growth following IUGR were no significant changes in gene expression of markers of endothelial cell homeostasis, VEGF, VEGFR2 or BMPR2; in contrast, Erk1/2 and Smad1/5/8 (BMPR-pathway) signaling were activated at P3. Assessment of lung matrix showed reduced elastic fibers and increased metalloproteinase activity (MMP2/9) at P3. This lack of elastic fibers persisted until P23 and was related to decreased collagen deposition in lungs after IUGR with catch-up growth. Microvessel count at P23 showed a significant reduction of capillaries (<20mum) in lungs after IUGR. Conclusion Here we show two independent mechanisms by which lung angiogenesis and microvascularisation could be adversely affected in lungs after IUGR with catch-up growth. First, an intrauterine phase with an inhibition of angiogenic signaling (VEGF/BMPR); and second, a postnatal catch-up phase with perturbed lung matrix assembly, resulting in reduced elastic fibers and collagen deposition. These mechanisms could contribute to the risk for pulmonary vascular diseases in infants with IUGR and catch-up growth.

AB  - Rationale: Premature infants exposed to increased oxygen (O2) are often afflicted with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a debilitating disorder marked by reduced formation of alveoli and microvessels as well as perturbed matrix remodeling. It is well recognized that inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of BPD; human studies show that Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is increased in lungs of infants evolving BPD. Since IL-6 is known to regulate inflammation and cell homeostasis, we hypothesized that hyperoxia-induced lung growth arrest in newborn mice is linked to activation of IL-6 signaling; in contrast, IL-6 deficiency is protective and enables lung growth in newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia. Method(s): The functional role of IL-6 signaling in aberrant lung development was studied in C57Bl/6N as well as IL-6-deficient mice (IL-6-/-) and its wildtype controls (WT). Newborn mice were exposed to either hyperoxia (85% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P28. Lung function tests were performed at P28; at the end of the experiments lungs were excised and snap-frozen or pressure-fixed in paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded for quantitative morphometric analyses. Result(s): 1) Exposure to 85% O2 induced a 10-fold increase of IL-6 expression and a marked activation of Stat3-SOCS3 signaling in lungs of newborn mice. Activation of pulmonary IL-6 signaling was related to previously shown impaired alveolarization and decreased dynamic compliance. 2) To investigate the functional role of IL-6 we exposed IL-6-/- and its controls to hyperoxia or normoxia. Quantitative histomorphometric analyses of the lungs revealed reduced radial alveolar count, increased mean linear intercept and alveolar surface area, as well as less microvascular formation (vWF staining) in lungs after hyperoxia, indicating impaired alveolarization. In contrast, IL-6-/- pups were significantly protected from blocked alveolarization and impaired angiogenesis. Moreover, assessment of elastic fibers showed that IL-6 deficiency partially attenuated the significant increase of elastic fibers; collagen Ialpha1 mRNA, however, was increased in lungs of IL-6-/- after hyperoxia when compared to WT. Further analysis revealed that hyperoxia reduced gene expression of surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-C, and SP-D) in the lungs of WT, but not of IL-6-/- mice. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that activation of pulmonary IL6-signaling is intimately linked to hyperoxia-induced lung growth arrest. Loss of IL-6, however, enabled lung growth in newborn mice exposed to prolonged hyperoxia, offering thereby a new potential target to treat preterm infants evolving BPD.

AB  - Background: BPD is characterized by impaired alveolarization and vascular growth. Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. Alternative splicing of coding genes is an underappreciated regulatory mechanism and has been shown to play a role in diverse processes such as embryonic development, tumorigenesis, and resistance to chemical pharmaceutical treatments. Our objective was to elucidate the sex-specific alternative splicing differences in coding genes in the lung in vivo in a model of murine neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-5: saccular stage of lung development) or room air and sacrificed on PND 7. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data were mapped onto the murine genome build UCSC mm10 using TopHat2, and quantified using cufflinks2 and the GENCODE mouse reference. Alternative splicing was performed for skipped exons splicing events using the MISO pipeline. We compared the alternative splicing by sex between room air and hyperoxia exposure. We evaluated enriched pathways using hypergeometric distribution (p<0.05) and the compendium of pathways Hallmark, Kegg, Reactome, and Gene Ontology, as compiled by MSigDB. Result(s): Alveolarization and angiogenesis was better preserved in female mice compared to similarly exposed male mice. Significant alternative splicing was observed in numerous genes between male and female mice at PND7 in room air and after hyperoxic treatment. 67 genes showed alternative splicing in room air, while 441 showed differences in the mice exposed to hyperoxia. Among 14 pathways enriched in alternatively spliced genes only in room air, we found differences in genes involved in collagen formation, such as Col24a1 and Col23a1, and PPARa signaling genes such as Med15 and Nrf1. Among 537 pathways enriched only in the hyperoxia group, genes involved in vascular endothelial signaling, including Fn1, Notch1, Mapk14, Itgb1bp1, Prkd1, Nrp2, and developmental genes, such as Rara, Ncoa2, Disc1, Chd7 were differentially regulated between male and female mice. Conclusion(s): Dysregulation via alternative splicing may contribute to the sex-specific differences in hyperoxia-induced inhibition of lung development and diseases, such as BPD. These differences could explain in part the mechanisms behind sex-specific differences in the incidence of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: We have found that in a hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) model in neonatal mice, miR-133a/b expression was significantly decreased in the lungs after exposure to hyperoxia for 2 weeks. We also found that miR-133a/b suppressed pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation and induced the expression of contractile proteins in PASMC, suggesting a protective role of miR-133a/b in the development of PH. In this study, we investigated whether miR-133a/b can ameliorate the development of PH in hyperoxia-induced BPD and PH in neonatal mice in-vivo. Method(s): We exposed neonatal mice (1-3 d old) to hyperoxia (75% O2) for 2 weeks and then maintained them in room air for 4 more weeks. MiR-133a/b mimics were given to these mice via retro-orbital injections, from the beginning of room air exposure post-hyperoxia, once a week for four weeks. Negative control miRNA mimics (Ambion) were injected as the control for the experiment. At the end of the 4-week room air period, we measured right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), RV hypertrophy [RV/(LV+S) ratio], and pulmonary arterial wall thickness in these mice. Result(s): We found that injection of miR-133a/b mimics suppressed the increase in RVSP in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that miR-133a/b may play a therapeutic role in the treatment of PH associated with hyperoxia-induced BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disorder affecting infants born prematurely. Impaired lung function results from inhibited alveolar septation causing alveolar simplification. Although the etiology is multifactorial, BPD is strongly associated with exposure of the immature lung to inflammation and hyperoxia. While the mechanisms governing alveolarization are poorly understood, alveolar interstitial fibroblasts that express Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (PDGFRalpha) play an important role in matrix production and tissue remodeling during septation. In the present study we used a transcriptomic approach to assess changes in lung gene expression using a murine model of neonatal hyperoxia to elucidate acute and persistent effects of hyperoxia on PDGFRalpha+ pulmonary cells. Method(s): Newly-delivered C57BL6 mouse pups were exposed continuously to either hyperoxia (>90% O2) or room air (RA) from birth through the first 7 postnatal days (P0-P7). On P7, hyperoxia-exposed mice were returned to RA and allowed to recover until P10. Using magnetic bead separation from single lung cell suspensions, cells expressing PDGFRalpha were obtained at P4 and P7 (acute hyperoxia exposure) and P10 (recovery from hyperoxia), processed for bulk RNA-Seq, and compared to RA controls. Transcriptomic data analysis identified differentially expressed genes between time-matched samples, during normal development (RA), as well as under hyperoxic conditions. Pathway analysis revealed enriched pathways relevant to septation. Changes in gene expression were used to predict upstream transcriptional regulators. Result(s): Neonatal hyperoxia caused significant, global changes in PDGFRalpha+ fibroblast gene expression: RNAs associated with oxidative stress (super oxygen dismutase, glutathione metabolism) were significantly increased, RNAs encoding key lung developmental growth factors (TGF-beta, PDGF, BMP, VEGF, FGF, IGF) were significantly decreased, and RNAs governing extracellular matrix production and remodeling (collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and proteinases) were significantly inhibited. Additionally, mis-expression of genes known to be important regulators of cell cycle (P21, CDKs, cyclins) indicated that hyperoxia inhibited cell cycle progression. Upstream analysis of perturbed genes predicted that Foxm1 serves as a master regulator of the cell cycle during alveolarization by inhibiting the G2/M checkpoint. Conclusion(s): Taken together, this study demonstrates that neonatal hyperoxia causes global, persistent changes in the gene expression in murine PDGFRalpha+ interstitial fibroblasts. We have identified key regulators of alveolar septation as potential therapeutic targets to optimize lung development following preterm birth.

AB  - Rationale Apoptosis has been shown to be crucial in normal organogenesis; however, little is known about how these cells are removed during development. We use an inducible alveolar epithelial cell-specific knock out mouse model to further the understanding of both apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells in lung development. This will provide a useful foundation for investigation of human lung disease; specifically, bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates, and type 2 alveolar cell hyperplasia in ARDS in adults. We hypothesize that deletion of Rac1 will impair effective engulfment and removal of apoptotic cells by alveolar epithelial cells during lung development, resulting in structural changes in lung architecture. Methods We utilized a doxycycline-inducible knockout mouse model under the control of the human SPC-promotor, which will effectively target type II alveolar epithelial cells. Using this model we delete the small GTPase rac-1. We previously showed that deletion of rac-1 will lead to an impaired ability to engulf apoptotic cells. Pups are euthanized on post-natal day 1, 3, and 7. Lung architecture, as analyzed by alveolar wall width, alveolar density, and alveolar surface area, is assessed on H&E slides, measuring at least 10 adjacent fields. Total cellularity and apoptotic cell numbers are assessed by immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining. Results We found a statistically significant difference in alveolar wall width in the lungs of knockout mice compared to wild-type (WT), at both post-natal day1 and day3. Mean alveolar width in the rac-1 deficient mice was 8.30 mum +/- 0.12, compared to 5.33 mum +/-SD 0.08, in WT littermate controls, with a mean difference of 2.97 mum (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 2.69-3.25) and 9.01 mum +/- 0.07 compared to 4.76 mum+/- 0.25in WT, with a mean difference of 4.24 mum (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 3.87-4.65) on day 3. Additionally, we have shown an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells in stains of KO mice at day 3, suggesting impaired removal of dead cells in these mice. ConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that lack of rac1 in alveolar epithelial cells during lung development results in increased alveolar wall thickness and higher cellularity and higher numbers of TUNEL-positive cells, which could be explained by impaired apoptotic cell removal by rac1 deficient epithelial cells. Further investigations will need to focus on how this may impact lung function such as gas exchange; and lead to potential increase in inflammation and development of fibrotic changes in the lung.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung condition in ELBW infants that results in alveolar simplification and has strong genetic foundations (~80%). TGF- beta is an excellent gene candidate for mediating susceptibility to BPD as TGF- beta signaling plays a dual role in alveolarization-through the regulation of branching and septation in developing lungs; as well as during its role as a prominent pro-inflammatory mediator. Genetic polymorphisms of TGF- beta are involved in inflammatory conditions such as allergic rhinitis and in the remodeling associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In our previous study one SNP of TGF- beta (rs1800470) was found to be associated with BPD in ELBW infants (p=0.046), while four other SNPs (rs1800469, rs1700471, rs1984072, rs12029576) were not. TGF- beta also plays a role in cardiovascular remodeling and has been shown to influence the susceptibility and treatment outcomes of Kawasaki disease. The closure of the ductus arteriosus has also been found to be regulated by TGF- beta through its effects on vascular smooth muscle. Objective(s): We sought to determine whether SNPs of TGF- beta are associated with increased susceptibility to PDA in ELBW infants. Design/Methods: This is an ongoing cohort study of ELBW infants (<1000g) without congenital or chromosomal abnormalities. BPD is defined as supplemental oxygen requirement at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. PDA is defined are requiring medical or surgical treatment for closure. IRB-approved parental consent was obtained prior to DNA (buccal swabs) collections (n=207). DNA was and subjected to allelic discrimination using Taqman probes for rs1800469, rs1800470, rs1700471, rs1984072, and rs12029576 during RT-PCR. Chi-squared, Mann- Whitney, t-test, and z-test performed with p<0.05 denoting statistical significance. Result(s): Patients with BPD and PDA were born earlier (p<0.001) and at a lower birth weight (p<0.001) than those without. For rs1800470 there is a statistically different genotype distribution between ELBW infants who progress to BPD and those who do not (p=0.046). For this polymorphism an association with PDA was not seen (p=0.074). Conclusion(s): A genetic variation of TGF- beta is associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that the promoter variant alters transcription of TGF- beta affecting alveolarization from direct changes in pulmonary remodeling, as well as from changes following a dysregulated inflammatory response.

AB  - Background: Neonatal care has drastically improved resulting in survival of extremely premature babies and increased incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) associated comorbidities. Among that, Pulmonary Hypertension (BPD-PH) has high mortality and morbidity. The diagnosis of BPD-PH is difficult since the symptoms overlap with severe BPD. Cardiac catheterization is a highly invasive gold standard procedure for diagnosing PH. Hypothesis: Unique inflammatory biomarkers in tracheal aspirates from preterm babies are associated with BPD-PH. These biomarkers may reflect underlying inflammatory pathways involved in development of BPD-PH. Method(s): We collected tracheal aspirates from a small cohort of infants at the Penn State Children's hospital NICU. Patients with confirmed clinical diagnosis based on NHLBI classification of severe BPD (n=6), BPD-PH (as diagnosed based on echocardiogram findings) (n=6) and term control babies (n=5) were enrolled for the study. Samples were digested; iTRAQ labeled and analyzed via mass spectrometry using ABSciex 5600 Triple TOF and protein identification was accomplished using ProteinPilotTM4.5Beta software. Significantly different proteins in the groups were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen). Result(s): Over 700 different proteins were identified using Proteinpilot software. Applying very stringent local false discovery rate estimation; approximately 200-330 proteins were confidently identified in each sample. 22 proteins and 16 proteins were significantly differentially (either under or over expressed) expressed when comparing control vs BPD group and control vs BPD-PH groups respectively. Between these two sets of data, 4 proteins were similar but were differentially expressed (Fig 1) namely lysozyme C precursor, lactotransferrin isoform 1 precursor, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor precursor and mucin-5B precursor (MUC-5B) and MUC-5B precursor had the most statistically significant differential log ratio expression (Fig 1). IPA analysis of these 4 proteins showed relevant pathways between NFKB (complex), RELA, CDKN1A, TNF, TP53, PRKCD (Fig 1). Conclusion(s): Our pilot project revealed four proteins whose expression was significantly different in severe BPD vs. BPD-PH, and IPA analysis predicted specific underlying inflammatory pathways. Further investigation into these proteins is warranted to explore potential for biomarkers for early diagnosis and target therapies. (Figure presented) .

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal chronic lung disease, which typically evolves in extremely preterm infants whose immature lungs are exposed to prolonged increased oxygen (O2). Failed alveolar and microvascular formation coupled with perturbed matrix remodeling are characteristics of BPD. Alveolar myofibroblasts are thought to be crucial in secondary septation during alveolarization and fibrotic processes. The transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) is important in cell homeostasis and has been shown to regulate fibroblast function. Impaired secondary septation and fibrotic changes in murine models of BPD let us hypothesize that reduced alveolar formation after hyperoxia is mechanistically linked to dysregulated Klf4 in lung fibroblasts. Method(s): (1) Newborn C57Bl/6N mice were exposed to 85% O2 (hyperoxia) or 21% O2 (normoxia) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P28. Lungs were excised and either snap-frozen or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded. (2) Primary neonatal murine lung fibroblasts (PnF) were isolated and exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia for up to 48 hours. Klf4-siRNA or vehicle was used to assess effects on proliferation (MTT assay), migration (Boyden chamber assay) and gene expression of PnF. Result(s): (1) Klf4 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in lungs during alveolarization. Exposure of newborn mice to hyperoxia markedly reduced Klf4 mRNA and protein at P7 and P28 in lungs when compared to control. Gene and protein expression of alphaSMA as an indicator of myofibroblasts was increased after hyperoxia. Dual immunofluorescent staining showed a co-localization of Klf4 in myofibroblasts (alphaSMA-positive cells). Moreover, septal thickness and expression of matrix components, such as CTGF, elastin, collagen Ialpha1, and collagen IIIalpha1 were significantly increased, whereas alveolar formation was reduced in lungs after hyperoxia. (2) Exposure of cultured PnF to hyperoxia decreased Klf4 protein. Knockdown of Klf4 in PnF using siRNA did not affect proliferation or gene expression of apoptosis-regulators, such as bax or bcl-2. The Boyden chamber assay, however, showed that loss of Klf4 significantly reduced migration of PnF. Moreover, we found that knockdown of Klf4 using siRNA increased gene expression of CTGF, collagen Ialpha1, collagen IIIalpha3, and PDGFRalpha, indicating a transdifferentiation of neonatal lung fibroblast to myofibroblasts. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that loss of Klf4 is intimately linked to myofibroblast activation, fibrotic processes and reduced alveolarization. Moreover, we identify Klf4 as a novel regulator of neonatal lung fibroblast migration and differentiation to myofibroblasts. Induction of Klf4 in lungs exposed to hyperoxia could partially protect from hyperoxia-induced lung injury.

AB  - Increased atmospheric oxygen tension, hyperoxia, contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although oxygen-dependent signaling pathways regulating pulmonary epithelial responses during oxidative injury are well described, there is limited knowledge on the regulation of redox-sensitive modifications and signaling. Reversible non-radical cysteine modifications serve as a redox-dependent interface to sense and initiate signaling pathways in response to oxidative perturbations. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is a major thiol oxidoreductase that catalyzes reduction of oxidized cysteine thiols of redox-dedicated enzymes as well as non-redox substrates. Although Trx1 is cytoprotective against hyperoxic injury and predominantly resides in the cytosol, nuclear Trx1 accumulation has been reported to occur during oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to investigate molecular and physiological functions of nuclear Trx1 during hyperoxic injury. We found that nuclear Trx1 increased in human adenocarcinoma H1299 and A549 cells cultured under hyperoxic conditions (95% O2 and 5% CO2) by performing subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry. Similarly, nuclear Trx1 was significantly increased in hyperoxic mouse lungs. Therefore, we manipulated subcellular expression of Trx1 to understand how nuclear Trx1 influences oxygen-dependent injury pathways. Expression of a nuclear-targeted Trx1 transgene exacerbated hyperoxic death of H1299 cells. This was effect was lost when the redox-active site of Trx1 was mutated or Trx1 localization was restricted to the cytosol. Adult mice with ubiquitous expression of a nuclear-targeted Trx1 had increased proteinaceous edema and pulmonary expression of TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 after hyperoxic treatment. To elucidate potential Trx1-dependent signaling pathways, we used a substrate-trap for proteomic identification of Trx1 protein interactions in the nuclear compartment during hyperoxic treatment of H1299 cells. This approach identified 15 oxygen-sensitive protein candidates regulated by Trx1 that function in gene regulatory or stress signaling pathways. Taken together, these data support that nuclear Trx1 can modulate lung epithelial physiologies in response to increased atmospheric oxygen tension (cell death and inflammatory signaling) and warrants further investigation of nuclear Trx1 as an enzymatic regulator of redox-dependent signaling pathways influencing BPD pathogenesis.

AB  - Aim: Effective treatment of premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is lacking. We hypothesize that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a ligand of the TGF-beta family that binds to the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)-BMP receptor type 2 (BMPR2) receptor complex, may be a novel therapeutic option for BPD. Therefore, we investigated the cardiopulmonary effects of BMP9 in neonatal Wistar rats with hyperoxia-induced BPD. Methods: Directly after birth Wistar rat pups were exposed to 100% oxygen for 10 days. From day 2 rat pups received BMP9 (2.5 mug/kg, twice a day) or 0.9% NaCl by subcutaneous injection. Beneficial effects of BMP9 on aberrant alveolar development, lung inflammation and fibrosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were investigated by morphometric analysis and cytokine production. In addition, differential mRNA expression of BMP9 and its receptor complex: ALK1, BMPR2, and Endoglin, and of the ALK1 downstream target transmembrane protein 100 (TMEM100) were studied during the development of experimental BPD. Expression of the BMP9 receptor complex and TMEM100 was studied in human endothelial and epithelial cell cultures and the effect of BMP9 on inflammatory cytokine production and TMEM100 expression was studied in endothelial cell cultures. Results: ALK1, ALK2, BMPRII, TMEM100, and Endoglin were differentially expressed in experimental BPD, suggesting a role for BMP9-dependent signaling in the development of (experimental) BPD. TMEM100 was expressed in the wall of blood vessels, showing an elastin-like expression pattern in arterioles. Expression of TMEM100 mRNA and protein was decreased after exposure to hyperoxia. BMP9 treatment of rat pups with hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD reduced alveolar enlargement, lung septal thickness and fibrosis, and prevented inflammation, but did not attenuate vascular remodeling and RVH. The anti-inflammatory effect of BMP9 was confirmed in vitro. Highest expression of ALK1, BMPR2, and TMEM100 was observed in human endothelial cell cultures. Stimulation of human endothelial cell cultures with BMP9 reduced their pro-inflammatory cytokine response and induced TMEM100 expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Conclusion:  BMP9 protects against neonatal hyperoxia-induced BPD by improving aberrant alveolar development, inflammation and fibrosis, demonstrating its therapeutic potential for premature infants with severe BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Normal lung alveolar septation is a complex process that involves the integration of a number of biological pathways. The spatial and temporal regulatory processes that play a role in this complex developmental process are poorly understood. We believe that is important to understand the integration of gene expression and DNA methylation to understand the normal processes during alveolar septation which can then guide us to a better knowledge of developmental diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and lung growth abnormalities, in addition to understanding risk for COPD and interstitial lung disease. Method(s): This study was carried out as a part of the LungMAP project which seeks to develop a comprehensive cellular and molecular map of normal lung alveolar development in humans and mice. We undertook whole genome evaluation of DNA methylation using the Illumina EPIC array. Human genomic DNA from lung tissues was isolated from LCM samples (n=24) at different time points during lung development: Early time point: 1day-1 month; Mid A: 2 months-1year; Mid C: 3 to 4 years; and Late time point: 8-9 years. Data obtained was normalized and differential methylation analyses were performed using Bioconductor. Result(s): Our preliminary analyses have identified sites noted to be differentially methylated between the different time points after adjusting for sex and batch, Preliminary computational models show that there are a number of distinct temporal methylation trajectories followed by genes and their regulatory elements. In table 1 we present the sites that were most significant in the early vs late time point comparison. Of note these sites map to SEC31B, C19orf55, NRXN3, CRISPLD2 and FOXA1 genes. Many of the most differentially methylated regions are long noncoding (lnc) RNAs and genes involved in protein trafficking. Pathway analysis shows an enrichment for metabolic pathways, Pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway among others. Conclusion(s): DNA methylation at a number of sites changes dynamically during human lung alveolar development, suggesting important roles for intracellular trafficking and lncRNAs. We are currently in the process of integrating murine and human data to further understand the regulation of alveolar septation. (Table Presented) .

AB  - RATIONALE. Although in general acute bronchiolitis is a self-limited condition that can be managed conservatively at home without significant medical care, a not insignificant proportion of children often require hospitalization for observation and supportive therapy. Among inpatient suffering from bronchiolitis, approximately one quarter may have prolonged length of stay (LOS) for the treatment of their respiratory condition. Hospitalized bronchiolitis imposes a significant clinical and economic burden particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and this burden is even greater when patients require a prolonged LOS. However, there have been few research studies evaluating variables that may be objectively measured at admission or early in hospitalization performed in LMIC, where the clinical and economic burden of the disease is the greatest. METHODS. We conducted an analytical single-center cross-sectional study that included a random sample of patients aged <2 years with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis hospitalized in the Fundacion Hospital De La Misericordia between March and June 2016. We collected demographic and clinical information, and the LOS for each patient. Prolonged LOS for bronchiolitis was defined as at least one hospital stay of 5 or more days. RESULTS. A total of 303 patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis were included, with 176 (58.1%) male and the median (IQR) of age 3.0 (1.0-7.0) months. After controlling for gender, history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, number of days with respiratory symptoms, the presence of apnea as an initial manifestation of bronchiolitis, and other underlying disease conditions, we found that independent predictors of prolonged LOS for bronchiolitis in our study population included age (OR 0.92; CI 95% 0.84-0.99; p= 0.049), history of prematurity (OR 6.34; CI 95% 1.10-36.46; p= 0.038), RSV isolation (OR 1.92; CI 95% 1.02-3.73; p= 0.048), and initial oxygen saturation (OR 0.94; CI 95% 0.88-0.98; p= 0.048). CONCLUSION. The factors identified can be taken into account when planning policies to reduce duration of hospital stay in infants with bronchiolitis.

AB  - Tuberculosis The World Health Organization estimates that 530,000 cases and 74,000 child deaths every year are attributable to tuberculosis (TB), but a recent modeling exercise estimated 239,000 deaths in children in 2015, most of them being under 5 years old and not receiving TB treatment (1). The immunodiagnosis of TB relies on the detection of a cell-mediated immune response. The tuberculin skin test (TST) is the standard test, but can have low specificity in BCG-vaccinated children. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) measure the concentration of interferon gamma in blood exposed to specific M. tuberculosis antigens, improving specificity. However, TST and IGRAs have significant limitations such as their inability to discriminate between latent TB infection and active TB and also, both are negatively affected by immune compromise and malnutrition. Furthermore, IGRAs have contradictory results in young children, are solely licensed for the diagnosis of latent TB infection (not active TB) and are not recommended in resource-limited, high-burden TB countries, where their sensitivity is lower than that of TST. The new Quantiferon TB Gold Plus test (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) adds CD4- stimulating and CD8-stimulating antigens but has not yet been fully tested in children. The C-Tb is a new intradermal skin test using ESAT-6 and CFP-10 to induce IFN-gamma releasing CD4+ T cells. A recent study showed that C-Tb administration was safe and detected similar numbers of people with TB infection with very high concordance to QFT. Furthermore, the test showed good specificity and was not affected by BCG vaccination. However, children younger than 5 years were not included in the study and the test was positive in fewer patients with active tuberculosis than was QFT. The confirmation of active TB through culture and drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis still remains the diagnostic gold standard. Samples in children include gastric aspirates, induced sputum and nasopharyngeal aspirates. However, mycobacterial growth requires 3 weeks and becomes positive in only 30% of children with probable TB. Moreover, smear microscopy that gives a presumptive rapid diagnosis of TB is rarely found in children. Bronchoalveolar lavage should be reserved for children with uncertain diagnosis or endobronchial TB as its bacteriological yield is lower than that of serial gastric aspirates. To overcome the difficulty of respiratory sampling in children, stool has been studied as an alternative sample but it has not shown better sensitivity. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and antigen detection are rapid tests that include real-time polymerase chain reaction and line probe assays. The limits of detection of PCR are approximately 100- 150 CFU/mL versus 10-100 CFU/mL and 50-150 CFU/mL for liquid and solid media respectively and 1000-10,000 CFU/mL for microscopy. The PCR has similar sensitivity than culture in smear-positive samples but less than culture in smear-negative samples. Recently developed NAATs can also simultaneously detect genes conferring drug resistance. The rapid Xpert MTB/RIF detects a series of mutations associated with rifampicin resistance (rpoB) of the Mycobacterium complex and the WHO recommends this test in children suspected of multidrug-resistant TB or HIV coinfection. The new Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) uses two amplification targets (IS6110 and IS1081) to reduce the limits of detection to 16 organisms per milliliters. One study showed that the Ultra detected most of the children with positive culture and also some with negative culture(2). Other tests such as the GenoType MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience, Holland) or the Genoscholar NTM + MDRTB (Nipro Europe, Germany) are especially useful for simultaneously detecting isoniazid- and rifampin-resistance mutations. Despite the use of all these techniques, 70% of the children with active TB will not have a positive microbiological confirmation and the diagnosis will be based on the history of exposure, the clinical features and the chest radiograph findings. Mediastinal lymphadenopathies are the hallmark of TB in children but poor interobserver agreement has been reported for radiologist and clinicians. A standardized approach to analyze chest X-ray could improve interobserver agreement in the interpretation(3). Also, CT, mediastinal ultrasound and MRI can be useful to detect lymphadenopathies and lung involvement in patients with difficult diagnosis or complications. However, there is no role for the use of these techniques in a tuberculin-positive child with no symptoms and a normal chest radiograph(4). Biomarkers, including cytokine responses to different specific antigen stimulation, can provide information about disease status and risk for progression(5). More studies are required to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers as well as their clinical implications. Nontuberculous mycobacteria There are more than 170 recognized species of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) but the majority of disease in humans is caused by fewer than 20 of them. NTM are ubiquitous in the environment, and can be found in soil, tap water, fresh water, brackish water, salt water, foodstuffs, and a variety of animals. The mode of transmission in pulmonary infections is by inhalation of aerosolized NTM. The estimated incidence of NTM disease in children is approximately 0.6 to 2.1 cases per 100,000 children per year. During the last decades, an increasing incidence of pulmonary NTM isolation has been reported. NTM have emerged due to the declining incidence of TB, aging population with chronic lung diseases, the improvement in diagnostic techniques and an increased awareness ofNTM diseases by physicians. The majority of children with NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) have underlying lung disease, such as cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or primary ciliary dyskinesia. The prevalence of NTM varies in different countries. M. gordonae is frequently recovered from a clinical sample but it is mostly considered not to be clinically relevant. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most frequently isolated NTM in pulmonary disease in European countries and also in CF patients in the United States. M. abscesssus complex (MABSC) includes three subspecies with different clinical significance (massiliense, abscessus and bolleti) and is more commonly seen in young adults and children with more severe lung disease. Many children with NTM-PD will have positive TST as PPD is a heterogeneous mixture of more than 200 mycobacterial peptides, some of which are expressed by NTM. Skin testing with mycobacterial sensitins derived from NTM (e.g. M. avium or M. kansasii) has been shown to be more sensitive than TST in NTM disease, but are currently available only for in vitro use and have limited ability to discriminate between different mycobacterial infections. IGRAS are supposed to be specific for M. tuberculosis but ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are also expressed by various NTM species, including M. kansasii, M. marinum, and M. szulgai. "False-positive" IGRA results have been reported in patients infected with these NTM species and also in patients with NTM species without this RD-1 region. Clinical symptoms may be indistinguishable from TB or other respiratory diseases. They typically present with fever, weight loss, fatigue, asthenia or anorexia, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis or dyspnea. Also, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis syndrome due to mycobacteria may occur in patients who are exposed toMACantigens. In a CF patient, NTM should be suspected when there are constitutional or respiratory symptoms, unexpected decline in lung function, or progressive radiographic disease, that do not respond to usual therapy. A chest radiograph may not be adequate for evaluating a patient with suspected NTM infection. High-resolution computed tomography is more sensitive to detect the parenchymal lung damage, including bronchiectasis, infiltrates, multiple nodules, multifocal bronchial disease, and cavities. Sputum, induced sputum, bronchial washings, bronchoalveolar lavage or transbronchial biopsy samples can be used to evaluate individuals suspected to have NTM-PD. Laboratory processing of samples should ideally be performed within 24 hours of collection or refrigerated if delays longer than 24 hours. Oropharyngeal swabs fail to detect NTM infection and are not recommended. Also, there is no role for the culture of gastric aspirates, fecal specimens or urine to detect NTM infection in HIV-negative patients. Most NTM grow under the same culture conditions as M. tuberculosis. Respiratory tract samples should be cultured (following decontamination) on solid and liquid media for 8 to 12 weeks. Some NTM species such as M. genavense or M. haemophilum only grow in culture after prolonged incubation times or after the addition of special growth factors. Microscopy, preferably carried out using auramine-phenol, allows the direct evaluation of bacterial burden but cannot distinguish NTM from M. tuberculosis. Direct molecular detection can detect NTM in respiratory specimens but are more expensive and less sensitive than conventional culture and their role in routine clinical practice remains to be determined. Available methods include the line probe assay GenoType CM (Hain Lifescience, pers. commun.), the CapitalBio Mycobacteria Real-Time PCR Detection Kit (CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China) and the REBA Myco ID (YD Diagnostics, Yongin, South Korea). A useful application of direct molecular detection is to rapidly differentiate M. tuberculosis complex from NTM in smear-positive samples. New commercially available spectral reference libraries have been issued for the differentiation of NTM using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (6).

AB  - Background: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death. Children exposed to second (SHSe) and third hand smoke (THSe) are at risk for smoke-related morbidity and have limited options for avoiding exposure. Tobacco smoke exposure increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, lower respiratory tract infections, middle ear disease, severe asthma, and slowed lung growth.1,2 Every possible effort should be made to decrease the burden of tobaccorelated diseases. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)3, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)4, and many international organizations have published guidelines to assist physicians in tobacco prevention, control, and treatment. The AAP recommends that pediatricians screen for tobacco smoke exposure at every visit and offer smoking parents counseling, treatment, and referral to quit lines5,6. Unfortunately, pediatricians' adherence to the guidelines remains low7,8,9. This may be attributed to lack of physician awareness and familiarity with published guidelines, as well as a lack of knowledge regarding available tools. It is essential that pediatric pulmonologists, who manage primarily diseases that are directly affected by SHSe, adhere to published guidelines. Purpose of Study: Data regarding whether pediatric pulmonologists adhere to guidelines is lacking. We conducted a survey to assess pediatric pulmonologists' practices with respect to SHSe screening, counseling, treatment, and referral to cessation services. Method(s): Survey questions included whether respondents used either the AAP Julius B. Richmond Center of Excellence Clinical Efforts Against Second Hand Smoke Exposure (CEASE) toolkit10 or the ACCP Smoking toolkit4. Participants were then queried whether they screened, counseled, treated, and referred caregivers to cessation services some of the time, always, or never. Confidence in smoking cessation promotion and willingness to attend a course if offered at a national meeting was asked. The questionnaire was posted on the pediatric pulmonology list server PedLung. PedLung reaches pediatric respiratory physicians around the globe. Survey Monkey was used to design and administer the questionnaire. Responses were anonymous. Results were compared with our previous data of general pediatricians 7. Result(s): Eighty responses were obtained. Only 1% stated they always use the AAP and ACCP clinical practice guidelines. Although respondents reported always screening (93%) and counseling (77%), only 27% referred caregivers. Zero percent responded to always prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Over 55% of respondents did not feel comfortable treating tobacco dependence in caregivers but only 41% responded that they would attend a cessation training course if offered at a national meeting. Conclusion and Discussion: Compared to our cohort of general pediatricians, the rate of screening and counseling of the respondents was higher but the rate of treatment and referral was similar7. Despite the morbidity of SHSe in common pulmonary diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia11, cystic fibrosis12, and asthma13, pediatric pulmonologists are not using available tools to assist smoking caregivers. It is imperative that physicians who treat children with respiratory disorders feel confident in treating caregivers' tobacco dependence. A revision of pediatric pulmonary training programs' curriculum is needed and should include tobacco cessation training to assure graduates are able to be actively involved and at the forefront of treating the tobacco epidemic.

AB  - Lung transplantation has become established as a therapeutic option in selected children with severe lung disease in whom other therapeutic options have failed, resulting in good quality of life and prolonged survival1,2. Although pediatric transplant results have improved considerably in the last two decades due to advances in the transplant technique, organ preservation, peri-operative management, immunosuppression, and the prophylaxis and treatment of infectious complications, chronic graft dysfunction limit long-term survival1-3. Pediatric transplantation has numerous unique features in relation to transplantation in adults: specific characteristics of children at different stages of development (from infants to adolescents), different indications for different age groups, the effects of immunosuppressant treatments, special susceptibility to infections related to an immature immune system, and particular problems in the availability of suitable donors1-2. According to the data of the International Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), which represents approximately 75% of worldwide transplant activity4,5, 57,934 Lung and heart-lung transplants were performed between 1986 and 2015, 2288 of which were pediatric (3.9%). The highest percentage of transplants took place in the adolescent group (11-17 years), representing 72.7% of pediatric transplants, followed by the 6-10 y group (15.5%), 1-5 y (7.2%) and < 1 y (4.6%)5. The number of pediatric lung transplants per year has increased only moderately in the last decade: year 2000: 73, year 2013: 137, year 2015: 96. This is in contrast to the growth observed in adult patients from 1635 procedures in year 2000 to 4122 in 2015. In Spain we have experienced a similar situation. The number of adult lung transplants is growing constantly (from 138 in 2000 to 361 in 2017 for a total of 4,318 from 1990) while the number of transplants in children remains quite low (median per year 6, for a total of 133 from 1996; 3.0% of total). [Spanish National Transplant Organization (ONT) data]6. Only a small number of hospitals worldwide carry out pediatric lung transplantation (around 45), and most (88.9%) perform only between 1 and 4 transplants per year, with just 5 centers performing between 5 and 9 transplants or more5. Two types of centers can be distinguished among these: centers specifically dedicated to pediatric transplantation, in which transplants are performed in children of all ages (or in some centers in children above preschool age), and adult lung transplant centers in which adolescents or children over 8-10 years of age are also treated2. Good results have been achieved in pediatric lung transplantation in individual adult centers7. On the other hand, published data indicated that not only transplant center volume, but also specific pediatric and cystic fibrosis expertise influences the outcome of pediatric lung transplantation8. The low frequency of transplants in children is related to 3 factors2: - The low prevalence of severe lung disease in children. - Advances in the medical care of patients with cystic fibrosis (the primary indication in pediatric patients) have considerably improved its course and delayed the age at which lung transplantation may be required. - The limited availability of young donors. Some young patients with severe lung disease are too sick to survive the waiting list. Improvement in ECMO support and paracorporeal lung assist devices may help to bridge these critically ill patients to lung transplantation, especially with the new techniques that allow the patients to be "awake" on ECMO. This prevents physical deconditioning as children have the possibility to get mobilized and perform physiotherapy1,3. Indications The general indication for lung transplantation is progressive respiratory failure with a short life expectancy, less than 1-2 years, and very poor quality of life1-2. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common indication in children. In the ISHLT registry, it represents 57.6% of the lung transplants (66.7% for children 11-17 y old and 50% for children 6-10 y old). The other major groups of indications are diffuse parenchymal lung diseases [including obliterative bronchiolitis (16.3%)], pulmonary vascular diseases [mainly pulmonary hypertension, (14.3%)] and retransplants (6.4%). Non-CF bronchiectasis (1.5%), and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (0.9%) are rarer indications5. Before including a child in the waiting list, the child and family require to be appropriately informed and educated. They both should consent to the planned transplant operation and to the close post-operative long-term follow-up needed1. When Should a Child Be Referred for Lung Transplantation? The decision to place a child on the waiting list for a lung transplant is not easy, as it is very difficult to predict survival. It is very important to make this decision properly, in order to provide a survival benefit. Patient with CF should be referred for evaluation for lung transplant if on maximal medical therapy, including a trial of the new CF therapies, when having a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) <30% predicted or a rapidly fallen FEV1, a 6-minute walk distance < 400 m, pulmonary hypertension, clinical decline characterized by increasing frequency of exacerbations associated with any of the following: acute respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV), increasing antibiotic resistance and poor clinical recovery from exacerbations, worsening nutritional status despite supplementation, pneumothorax, life-threatening hemoptysis despite bronchial embolization. Listing of patients with CF for lung transplant is generally recommended in case of chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia alone or hypercapnia, long-term NIV, rapid pulmonary function decline, pulmonary hypertension, frequent hospitalizations and/or WHO functional class IV9. In children with diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, the most important thing is to assess the presence of moderate or severe functional impairment, need for mechanical ventilation or very high oxygen supplementation, lack of response to treatment, and taking into account the natural course of the disease. With some diseases, such as surfactant protein B deficiency or neonatal presentation of ABCA3 deficiency, the child will rarely survive without a transplant, while others may have a variable response to treatment, such as surfactant protein C deficiency or ABCA3 deficiency presenting later in life. Patients with post infectious obliterative bronchiolitis with major hypoxemia or requiring invasive mechanical ventilation who do not improve with medical treatment should also be considered for transplantation, taking into account the possibility of improvement over the first years after the initial insult. The prognosis in pulmonary hypertension has improved considerably with the new treatments available, so the following criteria are now recommended: children in functional class IV: place on the transplant list and begin medical treatment; if they improve, remove them from the waiting list. Children in functional class III: administer medical treatment; if they do not improve or worsen, place them on the waiting list. Children with bilateral pulmonary vein stenosis or alveolar capillary dysplasia would have to be included on the transplant list at an early stage, as they do not respond to other treatments2. The nature of these indications means that lung transplantation in mechanically ventilated children is indicated more often than in adults. Infants on mechanical ventilation or children on long-term mechanical ventilation may be considered candidates for lung transplant. It has been shown that mechanically ventilated infants who have received transplants have the same survival post-transplant as non-ventilated older children, and better than ventilated older children. Invasive mechanical ventilation in children with cystic fibrosis is a risk factor for higher post-transplant morbidity and mortality, unlike non-invasive ventilation. Contraindications There are several situations in which lung transplantation may not be advised, some absolute and others relative, while some are specific to each center. In patients with cystic fibrosis, Burkholderia cepacia genomovar-3, Mycobacterium abscessus and multiresistant fungal infections (Scedosporium prolificans) constitute a contraindication in some centers1,2. Patients with cyanotic heart diseases in whom previous thoracotomies have been performed for palliative purposes have a very high risk of bleeding from chest wall collateral vessels, and should be assessed individually2. Prognosis and Survival Lung transplant recipients experience a major improvement in quality of life, and 88% of children do not have any limitations in their activity 3 years after the transplant. Overall survival in children after lung transplantation is similar to that reported in adults, with a median survival of 5.4 vs. 5.9 years, respectively. For those who survived the first year after transplant, the median survival is 8.8 years. The long term survival (. 15 y) is about 30%5. Adolescent lung transplant recipients have poorer overall survival when compared with younger children and adults, with those 15 to 19 years old having the highest risk of death. They have reduced 1-year survival (82%) compared with those 10 to 14 years old (88%), and reduced 3-year survival (59%) compared with those 10 to 14 (73%) and 20 to 24 years old10. This survival disparity among age groups likely reflects the difficult period of adolescence and its biological and social transitions, which may influence both immunological function and adherence10.

AB  - Acknowledgments and conflicts of interest: Some data presented in this short article have been supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Research Chair in Neonatal Respiratory Physiology. Introduction: Rodents are by far the most popular animal models of human diseases, including for pediatric respiratory medicine; one of the best examples is asthma. Rodents have several obvious advantages, including their small size and cost, short gestation and high number of littermates. Also, the number of diseases addressed by genetically-modified mice is unequaled in other species. There is an increasing awareness however that large animal models are physiologically closer to humans. For instance, the lung development of large animals such as the sheep and monkey corresponds to that of the human newborn at birth. This is different from the mouse or rat, whose lung is at the saccular stage of development. In addition, the size of large animals at birth allows to mimic the clinical conditions more closely and to perform more extensive physiological recording and tissue sampling than in rodents. Finally, the fetal lamb has been extensively used for chronic studies of fetal respiratory physiology in utero. This short abstract summarizes a few contributions of large animal models to pediatric respiratory medicine. Cystic fibrosis: In addition to murine models of cystic fibrosis (CF), a CFTR -/- piglet model has been designed a few years ago. The CF piglet airways lack normal CFTR protein and exhibit defective chloride and bicarbonate transport. Unlike mouse models, CF piglets develop lung disease like humans with CF (1). Experiments in CF piglets has allowed to challenge the dogma that the CF lung is normal at birth and that airway obstruction and air trapping is consequent to infection, mucus plugging or inflammation. Studies have indeed shown that on the day of birth, CF piglets already exhibit a decreased lumen size of proximal airways with airway obstruction and air trapping. The presence of such anomalies before any infection or inflammation suggests that CF is responsible for congenital airway anomalies (2). In addition, a sheep model of CF is being developed. Acute viral bronchiolitis of infancy: Acute viral bronchiolitis of infancy, especially due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), continues to pose a great challenge worldwide, due to its very high incidence and severe forms, especially in preterm infants. While passive immunization can be given in specific conditions such as preterm newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, no vaccine is yet available, and treatment is only supportive. Among the large animal models which have been used since many years, nonhuman primates and both the full-term and preterm lamb have yielded interesting results. However, all animals tested to date are only semipermissive for human RSV replication and experimental infection with even large doses of virus results in little or no clinical signs of disease, and generally only mild pulmonary pathology (3). While they have been used to design and test candidate vaccines, they have not yet been responsible for any breakthrough with regard to anti-RSV vaccination. Overall, we unfortunately still lack a good animal model of acute viral bronchiolitis. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: Rodent models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have been studied for a long time. Meanwhile, the preterm lamb model has also been used for many years as a model of respiratory distress syndrome, including for prenatal prevention with betamethasone, for postnatal surfactant treatment and for mechanical ventilatory support. More recently, the preterm baboon and lamb have been used as animal models of BPD. Compared to rodent BPD models, they present distinct advantages. As already alluded to, their lung development at birth (= beginning of the alveolar stage at term) is identical to that of the human newborn. In addition, the preterm baboon and lamb have a similar respiratory distress than humans and need ventilatory support for days or weeks with oxygen-rich gas. To our knowledge, only the preterm lamb model is still active. Studies on the preterm lamb model of BPD have yielded important results, including the beneficial effects on alveolarization of vitamin A supplementation or non-invasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation (4). Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a rare congenital malformation which occurs in about 1/3300 live births. It is still responsible for mortality in about 20% of the infants due to a significant lung hypoplasia and vasculature maldevelopment. The lamb model with a surgically-induced diaphragmatic hernia in utero has led the field since many years. One especially important contribution of this model is the FETO procedure (fetal endotracheal occlusion) which was designed and shown to promote pulmonary development in fetal lambs in utero. The FETO procedure is currently used in clinical trials involving several centers worldwide for the most severe forms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (e.g., clinical trials NCT03138863, NCT00881660 and NCT02986087; https://totaltrial.eu) (5,6). Non-invasive ventilation in newborns: Apart from two studies in newborn baboons and piglets, studies on the use of nRS have essentially been conducted in newborn lambs (see review in 7). Studies have shown that the early use of noninvasive respiratory support is generally associated with better respiratory outcomes in preterm lambs. Lambs with a more severe form of respiratory distress syndrome however showed a progressive deterioration while on bubble-CPAP. We have been studying nRS in full-term and preterm lambs for more than 10 years. The various nRS modes we have studied include nasal CPAP (nCPAP), high-flow nasal cannula (HF), nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation and nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation. The nasal mask that we use has been specifically designed and molded for newborn lambs and allows the introduction of nasoesophageal catheters. Polysomnographic studies in lambs on any of the above nRS can be performed for several hours, including during the different states of alertness. In addition, lambs can readily bottle feed while on nCPAP or HF (8). Our research program on nRS is mainly focused on two aims. First, we aim to better understand laryngeal behavior during nRS. We have shown that the larynx can actively close against ventilator insufflations during certain ventilatory modes (i.e., pressure support). On the contrary, the larynx does not close with nCPAP or HF, as well as during nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation or nasal NAVA (neurally adjusted ventilatory assistance). These results can help individualize the type of nRS in a given patient. Secondly, we are interested by the interplay between nRS and aerodigestive problems, especially in newborns and infants. For this purpose, we have established the only neonatal animal model for studying gastroesophageal reflux disease. We have shown that nasal positive pressure ventilation, including CPAP, intermittent positive pressure ventilation and high frequency oscillatory ventilation, can efficiently inhibit gastroesophageal reflux (9). In addition, we have shown that nasal CPAP (but not HF), increases the rate of milk intake during bottle-feeding in preterm lambs, without inducing any cardiorespiratory events (10). Again, we believe these results can contribute to the ongoing heated debate on the relevance of bottle-feeding convalescing BPD infants still on nRS. Conclusion(s): The contribution of large animal models to pediatric respiratory medicine has been and remains very important, especially in neonatology. Despite the cost and difficulty of maintaining such research, we hope that the above short summary brings convincing evidence that the responsible use of large animals in research can uniquely lead to a better understanding and treatment of pediatric respiratory diseases.

AB  - By virtue of the markedly different degree of attenuation of X-rays by air and soft tissue, chest radiography (CXR), fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) are effective methods for imaging the airways. Pathology may be directly visualized for large central airways or inferred for small peripheral airways on the basis of the imaging findings. Applications are broad and include suspected intraluminal obstruction (e.g. foreign body, bronchiolitis obliterans), intrinsic airway disease (e.g. tracheobronchomalacia, complete cartilaginous tracheal rings), or extrinsic compression (e.g. vascular rings and slings, crossing innominate artery, midline descending aorta). The preferred imaging technique varies with the suspected pathology and available equipment. Dynamic imaging techniques such as inspiratory/expiratoryCXR, fluoroscopy, and inspiratory/expiratoryor cine CT permit the lungs and airways to be imaged at different phases of the respiratory cycle. Inspiratory/expiratory CXR and inspiratory/expiratory chest CT have long been the preferred initial imagingmethods for detecting foreign body aspiration or bronchiolitis obliterans, respectively, on the basis of air trapping rather than direct visualization of the airway obstruction. Judicious use of airway CT in pediatric cases with an intermediate likelihood of foreign body aspirationmay reduce the negative bronchoscopy rate1. Fluoroscopy has historically been the preferred noninvasive method for diagnosing tracheobronchomalacia due to its ease of performance, even in uncooperative patients, and its high specificity, but it is limited by its subjective interpretation, low sensitivity, poor depiction of the paratracheal structures, and inability to simultaneously display the anteroposterior and lateralwalls of the airway and quantify luminal cross-sectional area2. In infants and children too young to comply with breath-hold instructions, inspiratory/expiratory phases can be simulated by imaging during right/left lateral decubitus or prone/supine positioning. Controlled-ventilation CT under sedation or anesthesia also permits inspiratory/expiratory imaging of the lungs and airways in uncooperative patients.6 Dynamic cine CT technique allows the airways to be imaged rapidly and sequentially during successive phases of the respiratory cycle, and the airway findings on dynamic cine CT correlate well with those noted on bronchoscopy3,4. Recent technologic advances including more rapid gantry rotation and wider detector arrays (up to 16 cm craniocaudal coverage) allow all or nearly all of the lungs and central airways to be imaged by CT throughout the respiratory cycle without the need for sedation or intubation. This technique is capable of generating multiplanar, 3D (volume-rendered and virtual bronchoscopy), and even 4D representations of the airways during normal tidal breathing or forced expiratory maneuvers, as well as depicting the relationship of the airways to the adjacent vasculature if intravenous contrast is administered5, information that can be vital for therapeutic planning. With dynamic cineCT, intrinsic and extrinsic causes of airway narrowing can be distinguished and fixed airway stenosis can be differentiated from expiratory central airway collapse due to tracheobronchomalacia (softening of tracheobronchial cartilage) or excessive dynamic airway collapse (inward bulging of the posterior membrane)6. Tracheobronchomalacia is primary (congenital) in approximately 1/2100 children and often resolves in isolated mild to moderate cases by 2 years of age as the cartilage geometry and composition matures and posterior membrane tone develops. Tracheobronchomalacia is often accompanied by gastroesophageal reflux disease and is associated with other foregut anomalies, especially esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. Tracheobronchomalacia can be secondary to extrinsic compression, chronic airway inflammation, intubation, or positive pressure ventilation and is identified in about one-fourth of children with chronic respiratory symptoms or signs such as wheezing, barking cough, recurrent respiratory tract infection, apnea, cyanotic spells, or difficulty weaning from respiratory support. Tracheobronchomalacia was originally defined as >50% reduction in airway cross-sectional diameter during coughing, but false positives are very commonwith this definition, especially for the bronchi in which physiologic expiratory airway narrowing is more pronounced than for the trachea. The shape and cross-sectional area of the airway lumen can be precisely determined by CT, but there is no current consensus on the optimal threshold degree of expiratory airway collapse for a diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia among children of varying ages with or without coexisting lung disease during either tidal breathing or forced expiration. Expiratory collapse of normal airways can occur in the setting of obstructive lung disease such as asthma or bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to increased pleural pressure and increased peripheral airways resistance that reduces airway transmural pressure7. Dynamic cineCTprovidesobjective information to classify expiratory central airway collapse according to the FEMOS(functional status, extent morphology, origin, severity) system8, but it should be noted that the degree of luminal narrowing is only one factor in airflow limitation. Evidence of airway compression or expiratory collapse on imaging does not necessarily indicate a condition requiring therapeutic intervention, and correlation with the clinical symptoms, signs, risk factors, and pulmonary function tests is necessary to determine the functional significance2,7. In addition to the noninvasive nature, the advantages of dynamic cineCTover bronchoscopy includethe ability to directly evaluate for vascular structures or soft tissue masses that impinge on the airway, depict airways too small to be passable by a bronchoscope, and assess the lungs for air trapping or other parenchymal disease5. A disadvantage of CT is the exposure to ionizing radiation. For perspective, CT virtual bronchoscopy can be performed with a radiation dose similar to a few months of natural background radiation9. MRI avoids exposure to ionizing radiation and is capable of producing high resolution images of the central airways and vasculature during free breathing10, but is limited by a longer scan time, more frequent need for sedation/anesthesia and less detailed depiction of the lung parenchyma compared to CT. Additional studies in children are needed to determine how the anatomic and functional information provided by dynamic CT and virtual bronchoscopy is best applied to the diagnosis, treatment planning, and post-therapeutic monitoring of pediatric airway disorders.

AB  - Introduction: The Lancet asthma commission brought together experts from all over the world to address the question as to why for the most part asthma outcomes have stalled over the last decade [1]. The discovery of the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) undoubtedly transformed the lives of millions of patients suffering from asthma, but there have been no real major breakthroughs since. Pharmacotherapy is still the blue one and the brown one, albeit with a darker brown and a longer acting blue. Why? The Commission poses sharp questions and has some challenging answers, and some of the pediatric implications of the Commission will be reviewed. Do I have asthma at all? There is no question that the approach to asthma diagnosis at all ages is lamentable. There is a reluctance tomake any objective measurements before diagnosis, and as a result, the diagnosis is frequentlywrong. Ina groupof academic general practices in the Netherlands [2], around 50%of children diagnosed with asthma, and prescribed sometimes high dose asthma medications, had no objective evidence supporting the diagnosis! In what other disease setting is a diagnosis made with no objective testing performed, even when simple tests are available? Given even this basic level of diagnostic competence is often not attained, small wonder that attempting phenotyping of airway disease is not considered (below). What sort of asthma do I have (no other co-existing condition)? The Commission is predicated on the assumption that 'asthma' is no more a 21st century diagnosis than 'arthritis' or 'anemia'. The term 'asthma' should be reserved for a clinical description - wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness, cough - with no assumptions about the underlying pathology. Next, in order to answer the question in the abstract title, the airway is deconstructed into its component parts - in children, whether there is fixed and/or variable airflow obstruction, airway inflammation, or infection, and treatment is planned depending on the answer. There is nothing new in this; the late, very great Harry Morrow-Brown showed that prednisolone was effective only in patients with airway disease characterized by sputum eosinophilia (thus rescuing steroids from the dustbin of history to which they were in danger of being consigned by a large Medical Research Council trial which recruited all-comers irrespective of airway phenotype) [3]. This finding triggered a wave of steroid-fervor, but the lesson that Dr. Morrow-Brown taught us, that steroids should be used selectively, and were not a general panacea, was lost in history. So if, and only if, there is evidence of airway eosinophilia, then ICS should be used. Similarly, variable airflow obstruction, if thought to be due to bronchospasm, is treated with short- or long-acting beta-2 agonists. If there is irreversibly fixed airflow obstruction, there is no point in increasing treatment to try to reverse this. Finally, the airway disease should be seen in the context of any co-morbidities, and social and environmental factors, in particular adherence [4]. The emphasis should always be on detecting that for which a treatment exists. This approach is of direct relevance to the vexed question of preschool wheeze. Instead of "diagnosing asthma" at some wholly arbitrary age, we should be probing the nature of any airway disease as a preliminary to deciding how to treat it. Spirometry and acute bronchodilator reversibility can reproducibly be measured even in young children [5]; and there is increasing evidence that peripheral blood eosinophil count reflects lower airway eosinophilia [6], and, in conjunction with aeroallergen sensitization [7], can predict the response to ICS in preschoolers. Are the LMIC asthmas the same as developed world asthmas? One of the most pernicious effects of the uncritical use of the umbrella term "asthma" is the creeping assumption that the disease is the same the world over. This may not be the case, especially in LMIC settings with a high burden of infection and environmental pollution. Indeed, in Brazil, atopic asthma, so common in the UK, is very uncommon, and the phenotype is associated with bronchiolitis and helminth infections [8]. This of course means that what works in the UK may not work everywhere else in the world, and should not be uncritically adopted. However, the approach of deconstructing the airway works extremely well internationally, and the question "what sort of asthma does this child have?" is globally relevant, and should be adopted rather than slavishly following the diktats from elsewhere. Is asthma a co-morbidity of a systemic or another respiratory condition? The frequently asked question is, do children with, e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or sickle cell (SCD) have "asthma"? Post the Commission, this question should be discarded as meaningless, and instead, be replaced by, "does this child with e.g. BPD/SCD have an airway disease, and if so, what is its nature and how should it be treated. Thus BPD survivors have fixed and variable airflow obstruction, with no evidence of airway eosinophilia, and should be treated with short-acting beta-2 agonists but not ICS [9]. SCD airway disease is of fixed airflow obstruction, with no airway reactivity or evidence of airway eosinophilia [10]. The same approach should be applied to the question of whether patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or primary ciliary dyskinesia also have "asthma". Beyond phenotyping: the importance of endotypes As ever-increasing numbers of monoclonal antibodies become available, it will be important to go from treating phenotypes (the set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment e.g. airway eosinophilia) to endotypes (a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or pathobiological mechanism). The importance of this is most clearly shown by cystic fibrosis; when the endotype (abnormal or absent CFTR function) was distinguished from the phenotype (chronic bronchopulmonary infection with airway neutrophilia) real progress was made, culminating in the use of designer molecules directly to correct CFTR dysfunction. Nowhere is this more important than in severe therapy resistant asthma; for example, although much eosinophilic airway disease is driven by classical Type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), alternative pathways characterized by upregulation of genes concerned with metabolic pathways, ubiquitination and mitochondrial function have been discovered [11]. Airway eosinophilia is not synonymous with Type 2 inflammation [12], and should not necessarily be treated with anti-Type 2 monoclonal antibodies. It could be argued that endotypes are irrelevant to mild asthma which is easily controlled with low dose ICS, but I would argue that this is not the case; if we are to prevent the development of asthma, we surely need to understand pathways. Furthermore, we should not be complacent about "mild" asthma; in the UK National Review of asthma Deaths [https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/why-asthma-stillkills], only ~40% of those who died had "severe" asthma. Hence endotyping will ultimately be important for the asthmas of all severities. Summary and conclusions The Lancet Commission is intended to trigger a new era of precision medicine for airway disease. Inpediatric pulmonology, we have been guilty for far too long of failing to make measurements, uncritically accepting that one size fits all, and wasting time on irrelevant questions like "is it asthma, Dr?". The challenge to us is to move into the age of true precision medicine, giving the right treatment to the right child, guided by objective measurements.

AB  - Aim: Microsomal RNAs' contribution was established in pulmonary hypertension (PH) process by smooth muscle proliferation in pulmonary artery, resistance to apoptosis, endothelial damage and vascular remodeling. In this study, it was aimed to determine role of miRNAs in pulmonary hypertensive infants with BPD and to investigate whether miRNAs are appropriate markers for risk stratification. Material method: The study included 21 BPD patients with PH (group 1), 17 without PH (group 2) and 21 healthy preterm (group 3). All participants were aged between 28 days and 3 months. Echocardiography was performed by using Vivid 7 Ultrasound system (GE, Hortens, Norway). Tricuspid velocity, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary acceleration time, RV end diastolic and end systolic diameter, RV Tei, RV FS, TAPSE, IVC index, LV eccentricity index parameters were measured by echocardiography. For miRNA assays, peripheral blood samples were drawn into EDTA tubes at time of diagnosis and expression of 25 miRNAs were analyzed. Result(s): Mean weight of patients: 1000 (850-1340)gr, 1100 (832- 1345)gr, 1360 (1100-1512)gr for Group 1,2,3 respectively. Mean PAP and PVR was found significantly high in group 1. Nineteen types of miRNA were associated to pulmonary hypertension. Expression of the 15 miRNAs of these 19; was found increased in group 1 (miR 23a-3p, miR 23b-3p, miR 21-5p, miR 17-5p, miR 199a-3p, miR 451a, miR 191-5p, mir 206, miR 145-5p, miR 20a-5p, miR 26b-5p, miR 29c-3p, miR 126-3p, miR 130a-3p, miR 208b-3p). It was also found that expression was significantly higher in 3 miRNAs in group 1 when compared to group 3 (miR 221-3p, miR 221-5p, miR 223-3p). miR 150-3p expression level was significantly lower in group 2 than group 3. Conclusion(s): Pulmonary hypertension is a disorder developing due to environmental and genetic reasons, in which underlying mechanism isn't fully understood. The genes controlled by miRNAs found to be related to PH in our study may have a mechanistic role in PH. In the future, it could be possible to establish novel approaches that may contribute early diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension by focusing target genes of miRNA found to be related in this study.

AB  - BPD as described 50yrs ago represented chronic lung changes evolving in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome exposed to prolonged high oxygen and artificial ventilation. Classic BPD was a necrotizing bronchiolitis, with bronchiolar/alveolar fibrosis and often pulmonary hypertension. Orderly radiographic stages occurred with progression from diffuse opacity to increasing cyst-like changes, hyperinflation and scarring. The etiology of BPD now includes a mutifactorial interaction between genetic and maternal/acquired factors and multiple postnatal insults to an immature developing lung. Despite advances in the care of premature infants, BPD incidence has not decreased, rather much smaller babies survive accounting for most cases. Lung injury affects organogenesis resulting in fewer, simplified alveoli, dysmorphic capillaries and fibroproliferation,"new" BPD. Instead of orderly stages, the lungs gradually develop persistent mild reticulation +- hyperexpansion. Cyst-like changes may be seen in more severe cases. On CT imaging there are overinflated lobular areas and reticular fibroproliferative changes. Abnormality, including mosaic attenuation, air trapping, pulmonary hypertension and abnormal pulmonary function tests may persist into childhood and adulthood. The purpose of this poster is to review and illustrate both classic and "new" BPD and the followup radiographic and CT features of these entities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nephrocalcinosis (NC) is defined as deposition of calcium in renal tubules and interstitium and is highly related with prematurity and monogenic diseases. Recent studies have reported that NC might be a specific finding of underlying hereditary renal diseases. This study evaluated the risk factors, underlying monogenic causes, and clinical outcomes of NC in Korean children according to gestational age (GA)., METHODS: A total of 464 patients younger than 18 years who were diagnosed with NC by ultrasonography from January 2013 to December 2022 in Samsung Medical Center were enrolled. Medical record data of sex, GA, birth weight, underlying disease, medication history, ultrasonography and genetic analysis were reviewed retrospectively., RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 1:0.98, and the mean age at first diagnosis of NC was 385 days. Approximately 62% of patients experienced confirmed resolution of NC after about one year. In comparison of the preterm (mean GA 28 weeks and 2 days) and full-term (mean GA 38 weeks and 2 days) groups, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and use of furosemide and vitamin D were more frequent in the preterm group. In the full-term group, a larger proportion of cases showed persistent NC without resolution and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Genetic analyses were performed in 56 patients, and the monogenic mutation rate was significantly higher in full-term children (OR 10.02, 95% CI [2.464-40.786], p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: While the overall outcomes of pediatric NC are favorable, underlying monogenic causes should be studied, especially in full-term patients without known clinical risk factors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a syndrome of respiratory distress caused by chronic lung injury, primarily in preterm infants. miR-206 and fibronectin 1 (FN1) are associated with the development of BPD. The present study used rat type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) to investigate the underlying mechanisms of BPD. AECII were isolated using a primary cell culture prior to alkaline phosphatase staining and immunofluorescence of surfactant protein C (SP-C). These were used to verify the presence of AECII. AECII were then divided into four groups, which were transfected with four different plasmids. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine the relative expression of miR-206 in the each group. The gene and protein expression level of FN1 was detected by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. The proliferation of AECII in each of the four groups was evaluated using an MTT assay 48 h following transfection. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The present study demonstrated that upregulation of miR-206 decreased the expression of FN1 (P<0.05) and low levels of miR-206 led to increased expression of FN1 (P<0.05) in AECII. Furthermore, the forced expression of miR-206 suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of AECII while downregulation of miR-206 had the opposite effect (P<0.05). The results of the current study provide valuable insights into the prevention of BPD and suggest that miR-206 may be used as a potential molecular target for BPD therapy in the future.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial chronic disease that occurs predominantly in preterm infants receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, and is characterized by lung growth arrest, diminished alveolar and blood vessel development and impaired pulmonary function. Using a murine model in hyperoxia-induced BPD, we recently showed that a bolus dose of MSC extracellular vesicles (MEx) improved lung architecture and lung function and that this therapeutic effect was associated with modulation of lung macrophage phenotypes. However, BPD is a disease with multi-organ effects. Thus, we extend our studies in this BPD model to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of MEx on the innate and adaptive immune responses at the multiorgan level. Method(s): Extracellular vesicles were collected from the conditioned media of human Wharton's Jelly-MSCs and purified through density flotation in Iodixanol. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia on postnatal day 1 (PN1) (75% O2), treated with MEx on PN4 and returned to room air on PN7. Treated animals and appropriate controls were harvested on PN7 and PN14 for histologic and cytometric assessment of lungs, spleen and thymus. Result(s): Hyperoxia-exposed mice presented significant lung damage and alveolar simplification as well as medullary involution of the thymus. Injection of MEx into hyperoxic-mice improved lung histology and restored thymic cortico-medullary ratios to levels akin to their normoxic counterparts. At PN7, MEx treatment modulated macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype and mobilized inflammatory LY6ChiCCR2+ monocytes in the lungs and spleens. At PN14, MEx treatment induced a multi-organ reduction of inflammatory monocytes with a shift to a regulatory phenotype. Specifically, MEx altered T-cell subpopulation levels, inducing a reduction in CD8+ lymphocytes and an increase in CD4+ lymphocytes, and promoting the generation of CD4 +CD25hiFoxP3+ regulatory T cells. Summary/conclusion: Using a hyperoxia-induced BPD model, we show that MSC extracellular vesicle treatment results in a profound multiorgan effect on the immune system and promotes a tolerogenic T-cell phenotype that plays a crucial role in the amelioration of BPD-associated pulmonary damage.

AB  - Background: Intravenous administration of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can reverse the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in rodent models. However, systemic administration of EVs could cause concern in a fragile patient population such as preterm neonates. Thus, we suggest that intratracheal (IT) administration of MSC-EVs, if proven effective in a reliable animal model, could represent a safer and more convenient tool for future clinical studies on patients with BPD. Method(s): The study was conducted on Sprague Dawley rat pups exposed to normobaric oxygen concentration set at FiO2 0.6 until postnatal day (P) 14. Experimental groups (n = 10) included healthy controls (room air), hyperoxia-exposed pups receiving IT vehicle only and hyperoxia exposed pups receiving IT either human Wharton Jelly-derived MSCs (2 x 10E6) or MSCEVs (1.3 x 10E10) on days P3, P7 and P10. Animals were euthanized on P14. Alveolarization was stereologically assessed as described previously. The thickness of the medial layer of small pulmonary arteries was also morphometrically evaluated. Cytokine expression was analysed in lung lysate. Result(s): Untreated hyperoxia-exposed animals showed lower total surface of air spaces, lower total alveoli number (Nalv) and higher mean alveolar volume (Valv) than normoxia-exposed animals. Treatment with both MSCs and MSC-EVs produced significant increase in Nalv and significant decrease in Valv compared to sham-treated animals. Themedial layers of small pulmonary arteries were unchanged, probably due to the relatively short follow-up time. Reduced IL-10 and TGFb1 concentrations were found in the lungs of hyperoxic animals. Both parameters were significantly increased following both treatments. Summary/Conclusion: Similarly to their cells of origin, MSC-EVs significantly improved both morphological and biochemical parameters in an animal model of BPD, suggesting that IT EVs administration could represent a convenient and effective approach to reverse the development of BPD treatment in preterm neonates.

AB  - Rationale Preterm birth affects about 11% of pregnancies worldwide. The Institute of Medicine estimated the cost associated with premature birth to be $36 billion in 2016. Lungs in preterm infants are in the critical saccular stage of lung development and susceptible to the oxygen-induced chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is characterized by functional abnormalities including decreased saccular/alveolar septation, decreased microvascular cross-sectional area with or without pulmonary hypertension, airway injury with or without increased airway reactivity, and abnormalities of control of breathing in various combinations. While the initial inflammation improves, chronic inflammation ensues for a long time. We tested how neonatal hyperoxia exposure affects lung function one year after birth. We postulated an increase in lung collagen levels reflected by reduced pulmonary function. Methods 6 newborn male and female rats in each group were exposed to Hyperoxia (Hx; 85% O2) or Normoxia (Nx; 21% O2) for 14 days, then aged to 1 year in Nx. At one year, lung function was measured using a FlexiVent (Scireq, Montreal, Canada). Using a single frequency forced oscillation manoeuvre and a low-frequency forced oscillation technique the lung was tested for compliance and resistance. Total lung collagen was determined by a colorimetric assay using Ehrlich's reagent. Results Analysis of one year old rats showed no difference in weight and body length between the Nx and the Hx group within each gender. The inspiratory capacity (IC) was significantly higher in the Hx exposed male rats compared to the Nx exposed male rats (12.6+/-0.6 ml vs 14.0+/-0.9 ml; p>=0.02). The difference in IC in female rats was significantly lower in the Hx group compared to the Nx group (11.3+/-0.4 vs 10.1+/-0.6 ml; p>=0.002). Dynamic compliance was significantly increased in the male Hx group compared to the male Nx group (1.43+/-0.05 vs 1.61+/-0.11 ml/cm H2O; p>=0.04). In contrast, the female Hx group showed significantly reduced compliance compared to the female Nx group (1.32+/-0.05 vs 1.15+/-0.17 ml/cm H2O). In addition, the PV loop area was higher in the male Hx group compared to the male Nx group and no difference was found between the two female groups. Total collagen in lung tissue was not different between the male Hx and Nx groups but was higher in the female Hx compared to the Nx group. Conclusion One year after neonatal Hx exposure, the male lung shows increased compliance and inspiratory capacity compared to the Nx exposed rats suggesting a trend to emphysema. In contrast, female rats show signs of lung fibrosis reflected by reduced compliance and increased total collagen content. This data suggests that neonatal oxygen exposure initiates alterations in inflammatory and repair pathways that are different between male and female rats.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen is often used to assist those with respiratory dysfunction, including adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Experimental evidence has shown that increases in oxygen levels can create a hyperoxic environment that is capable of exacerbating existing pulmonary injury as well as independently inducing injury due to increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Our group has examined the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in hyperoxic toxicity because of their possible role in the generation of ROS. We have previously found that CYP1A1/1A2 as well as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), protect against hyperoxic toxicity. We have also found that CYP1B1 may, in fact, contribute to hyperoxic toxicity in vitro and in Cyp1b1-null mice. Further, we found that Cyp1b1-null mice exposed to hyperoxia have decreased markers of oxidative stress and increased CYP1A gene expression compared to WT mice. In this study, we hypothesized that Cyp1b1-null mice would be less susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury compared to WT mice and that CYP1A mechanistically contributes to the attenuated phenotype of Cyp1b1-null mice. To test this hypothesis, we exposed male and female C57BL/6J (WT), Cyp1b1-null, Cyp1a1/1b1-null (DKO), and Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1-null (TKO) mice to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 24-68 hours. Lung weight measurements were used to assess pulmonary injury and edema and qPCR was used to measure RNA. We found that all mice lacking CYP1B1, including DKO and TKO mice, had reduced pulmonary injury as indicated by reduced lung weights in male (P<0.01) and female (P<0.05) mice after 68 hours of hyperoxia. CYP1B1 gene expression was induced (P<0.01) in WT mice during hyperoxia exposure, and CYP1A1 gene expression was increased in Cyp1b1-null mice (P=0.01). NQO1 gene expression was significantly induced by hyperoxia (P<0.05) in all groups with higher expression in TKO mice at room air (P<0.001) and early phase of hyperoxia (P<0.05). We found that pulmonary AHR repressor (AHRR) expression was increased in the DKO and TKO (P<0.05) mice after hyperoxia exposure. Our results suggest that increased AHR-dependent transcription, as evidenced by enhanced CYP1A1 and AHRR gene expression, may play a role in attenuating lung injury in mice lacking CYP1B1 and needs to be elucidated further. Future studies will thoroughly characterize the effect of CYP1B1 on oxidative stress in these animals and determine the viability of CYP1B1-directed therapeutics to treat or prevent ARDS/BPD.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a significant pulmonary complication for preterm infants, but the mechanisms associated with altered lung development remain poorly understood. Our mouse model of perinatal inflammation mimics the pathophysiology observed in infants with severe BPD. We have previously reported decreased pulmonary miR-29b expression, and that restoration of miR-29b expression improves lung development. The current studies tested the hypothesis that decreased expression of miR-29b was associated with decreases in expression of key protein methyltransferases (PRMTs), and that restoration of miR-29b would restore expression. Methods Pregnant C3H/HeN mice received an intraperitoneal LPS injection on E16 and newborn pups were exposed in 85% oxygen from birth to 14 days of life. On postnatal day 3, PBS containing a liposomal preparation of miR-29b or an empty liposome was administered intranasally. On postnatal 28, mouse lung tissues were analyzed for changes in PRMT-1, PRMT-5, and symmetrical and asymmetrical dimethylation of histone 4, arginine 3 by western blot. Results Perinatal inflammation resulted in decreased expression of PRMT-1 and PRMT-5 which led to a decrease in histone 4, arginine 3 symmetrical dimethylation. Liposomal delivery of miR-29b restored PRMT-1 and PRMT-5 expression and partially attenuated the decrease in histone 4 symmetrical methylation. Conclusion Our data suggest that restoration of miR-29b may prevent aberrant expression of matrix proteins by increasing histone 4, arginine 3 dimethylation and promoting gene silencing.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a pediatric chronic lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can develop in BPD, greatly increasing morbidity and mortality. PH is the result of decreased pulmonary vascular lumen diameter from vasoconstriction and/or vascular remodeling. Vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling result from activation of abnormal signal transduction cascades including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). MAPK deactivation is regulated by a family of phosphatases called the dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). In the present study, we hypothesized that (1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the DUSP gene family are differentially expressed in a cohort of BPD patients with and without PH and that (2) DUSP SNPs, when combined with clinical data, could be useful as a biomarker for PH development in BPD patients. Methods BPD patients (n=188) who were born at <35 weeks gestation and enrolled at Nationwide Children's Hospital were studied. PH was defined by established echocardiographic criteria. DNA from patient blood samples was assayed for 31 SNPs in DUSP genes by Agena Massarray. DUSP SNPs were selected from NCBI database for their putative functionality. Clinical characteristics and minor allele frequencies (MAF) were compared between BPD-PH (cases) and BPD alone (control) groups using t-test or chi-square as appropriate with p-value <0.05 as significant. Biomarker models were analyzed by calculating area under the curve (AUC) for clinical and SNP data separately and together. Results In a cohort of 188 patients with BPD, 61 (32%) showed echocardiographic evidence of PH. Patients with BPD-PH had a lower birthweight (806g +/- 343g vs. 972g +/- 414g, p=0.004), gestational age (262 +/- 24 vs. 270 +/- 25, p=0.041), and were more often small for gestational age (20% vs. 7%, p=0.010) than BPD alone patients. Patients with BPD-PH received less surfactant (48% vs. 63%, p=0.044), more post-natal pre-admit steroids (33% vs. 12%, p=0.001), and more mechanical ventilation (92% vs. 73%, p=0.003) than BPD alone patients. Of the 31 DUSP SNPs evaluated, DUSP-1 SNP rs322351 was less common in cases than controls (MAF; 0.32 vs. 0.44, p=0.021), and DUSP-5 SNPs rs1042606 (MAF; 0.44 vs. 0.34, p=0.042) and rs3793892 (MAF; 0.42 vs. 0.32, p=0.049) were more common in cases than in controls. The best fit biomarker model combines clinical (birthweight<700g + post-natal, preadmission steroids + mechanical ventilation + no surfactant) and SNP data (DUSP1 rs322351 + DUSP5 rs1042606) with AUC 0.76. Conclusions In the present study, we identified several potential clinical and genetic biomarkers for BPD-PH patients including birthweight, gestational age, small for gestational age, surfactant, post-natal pre-admit steroids, mechanical ventilation, DUSP-1 SNP rs322351, and DUSP-5 SNPs rs1042606 and rs3793892. Combining clinical and DUSP-1 SNP data yields the most robust biomarker for PH in BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous pulmonary vasodilator produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), and decreased eNOS-derived NO underlies many types of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of eNOS, is elevated in the plasma of patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) prior to the onset of PH. ADMA is hydrolyzed to citrulline by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), and our group has previously found that a DDAH1 SNP is differentially expressed in BPD-PH patients compared to BPD control patients. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that siRNA-mediated knockdown of DDAH-1 will attenuate NO-mediated apoptosis in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC). DESIGN/METHODS hPMVEC were transfected with siRNA against DDAH-1 or scramble control for 24h, washed and fresh media placed on them and incubated in 21% O2/5% CO2 for 24h. Protein was analyzed by western blot for DDAH-1, eNOS, arginase I, arginase II, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-9, and loading controls (beta-actin, total cleaved caspase-3, total cleaved caspase-8, and total cleaved caspase-9). Cell media was assayed for nitrite concentration using chemiluminescence. In a separate set of experiments after transfection, hPMVECs were washed, trypsinized, and viable cells were counted after trypan blue exclusion. In a third set of studies after transfection, hPMVECs were treated with 0.1muM of the NO donor DETA NONOate for 24h or 0.1muM DETA NONOate and 100muM of the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK for 24h, and viable cell numbers were counted after trypan blue exclusion. RESULTS There was no difference in protein levels of eNOS, arginase II, or cleaved caspase-9 between hPMVEC treated with DDAH-1 siRNA and scramble controls. However, hPMVEC treated with DDAH-1 siRNA had less DDAH-1, arginase I, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-8 protein levels than did scramble controls (p<0.05). hPMVEC treated with DDAH-1 siRNA had lower media nitrite concentration than did scramble controls (p<0.05). hPMVEC treated with DDAH-1 siRNA had greater viable cell numbers than did scramble controls (p<0.05). hPMVEC treated with DDAH-1 siRNA and DETA NONOate had viable cell numbers that were less than DDAH-1 siRNA alone (p<0.05) and similar to that seen in scramble control hPMVECs. When hPMVEC were treated with DDAH-1 siRNA, DETA NONOate, and Z-DEVD-FMK, viable cell numbers were increased three fold from scramble control (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS We found that knockdown of DDAH-1 with siRNA in hPMVEC resulted in less NO production, less caspase-3 activation and more viable cells. These data suggest that greater levels of ADMA are associated with lower levels of NO-mediated apoptosis in hPMVEC. We speculate that enhancement of DDAH-1 activity may be a viable therapeutic target to decrease pulmonary vascular wall proliferation and thereby ameliorate the vascular remodeling that occurs in PH.

AB  - Adiponectin (APN) is a pleotropic adipokine mainly produced by adipocyte. It modulates many biological functions including metabolism, immunity, vascular integrity, tissue remodeling and inflammation. In genetically modified mice, APN protects the lung from oxidative and inflammatory injury (Sliman SM et al., Cell Biochem Biophys 2013, Konter JM et al. J Immunol 2012). Premature infants and infants who are small for gestational age have minimal fat mass, very low levels of circulating APN and are at increased risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) from oxidative stress and inflammation. To begin to understand the potential role that APN may play in protecting the lung from injury during lung development, we characterized the developmental profile of circulating APN levels, and protein and gene expression for APN and its receptors in the lung during development in newborn rats. METHODS APN, adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) gene and protein expression were measured in lung homogenates from fetal day (FD)19 and postnatal day (PD) 1,4,7,10,14,21 and 28 (n= 8/each age). Relative mRNA expression was detected by quantitative PCR and serum APN was measured using ELISA. Protein levels of APN and AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in lung homogenates were measured by western blot. RESULTS Lung APN protein levels significantly changed with development (ANOVA, p<0.05). Total lung APN levels were lowest at FD19 and PD1, increased by 4 fold by PD 7 followed by a 2 fold drop from PD 7 to 10. AdipoR1 protein expression in the lung peaked at PD1; increased by 1.8 fold from FD19 to PD1 followed by a 3 fold drop by PD4 and remained low until PD 14 when levels again increased and were comparable to levels measured at PD1. Similar to AdipoR1, AdipoR2 protein expression in the lung was highest at PD1, but in contrast, AdipoR2 did not significantly change until PD7-10 at which time levels decreased by 2-fold and then subsequently increased at PD14, reaching levels similar to those measured at PD1. The pattern of mRNA relative expression for lung APN, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mirrored the protein expression. Serum APN levels ELISA did not differ between animals PD 4-28. CONCLUSIONS These data are the first to characterize the developmental profile of APN and its receptors in the lung of a newborn model. At birth, similar to lung of the premature infant, rat lungs are in the saccular stage of lung development. At PD4, alveolarization starts, peaks at P10 and ends at PD21. In APN knock out mice, alveolarization is abnormal. Here we show that APN and its receptors are undergoing significant changes in expression associated with alveolar development. AdipoR1 on alveolar epithelial cells decreases the cytotoxic effects of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), and induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) (Nigro et al, Int J Biochem Cell Biol 2013). We found that AdipoR1 receptor expression is lowest from D4-D10. We speculate the drop in the AdipoR1 receptors during the stage of lung alveolarization may be a critical period of increased vulnerability to inflammatory and oxidative stress that may contribute to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in human infants.

AB  - Background: Respiratory morbidity is common among preterm infants, particularly those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This longitudinal study aimed to characterise the burden of respiratory disease in a cohort of very preterm infants, <32 weeks gestation, with and without BPD. Method(s): Seventy infants (median gestational age, 27.9 weeks; 27 BPD and 43 non-BPD) were followed prospectively for the first year of life. Respiratory symptoms (cough and wheeze) with and without acute respiratory illnesses (ARI), healthcare utilisation and requirement of respiratory medications were assed using monthly questionnaire. Episodes of ARI were classified into upper vs. lower based on parentally reported symptoms. Proportions were tested using chi-square and Fischer's exact tests. Result(s): Parents reported 511 episodes of ARI during the follow-up, 155 upper and 356 lower, with no difference between BPD and non-BPD infants (median (IQR): 7 (7,11) vs. 7 (4,9)). Similarly, there was no difference in the proportion of symptoms with ARI between the two groups. The incidence of respiratory symptoms without ARI was similar among BPD and non-BPD with 20 (74%) vs. 32 (74%) reporting cough and 10 (37%) vs. 11 (26%) reporting wheeze, respectively. The incidence of presenting to emergency and general practice for respiratory conditions were similar between BPD and non-BPD infants with 56% vs. 44% and 93% vs. 88%, respectively. BPD infants were more likely to be re-hospitalised (58% vs. 42%, p=0.043) and prescribed both inhaled corticosteroid (22% vs. 2%; p=0.011) and bronchodilators (37% vs. 7%; p=0.003) compared to non- BPD infants. Conclusion(s): Respiratory morbidity is highly prevalent among preterm infants, particularly those with BPD.

AB  - Background: Mortality has decreased following preterm birth but incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is an important aetiological factor for BPD. Animal research demonstrated that high ventilator bias flows increase VILI. The FLORA RCT investigated the effect of bias gas flow on cytokines and number of ventilated days. Method(s): Preterm infants (<28 weeks gestation / <1,000 g) needing ventilation in the first week were randomised to bias gas flows of 4 or 10 L/min. Cytokine concentrations in tracheal aspirate (TA) and blood were measured at 24, 72 and 120h and clinical data were recorded until 36 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). Result(s): Demographic data and ventilator requirements at randomisation were well matched between babies ventilated with 4 (n=50) and10 (n=45) L/min. There were no differences in TA IL-8 concentrations at 24 h or number of ventilated days between groups. Plasma IL-8 concentrations increased over time (p<0.05). Respiratory support requirements at day 28 and 36 weeks CGA, and incidence of BPD, were not different between groups. Fewer babies ventilated at 4L/min developed NEC stage 2 or 3 (n=0 vs 4; p=0.01) and tended to have a lower mortality (n=1 vs 5; p=0.05). Conclusion(s): In this first RCT investigating the effect of bias gas flows, there was no effect of reduced flow on biomarkers or respiratory outcomes. However, the finding of decreased NEC and mortality in babies randomised to a bias gas flow of 4 L/min warrants further investigation.

AB  - Aim: Survivors of neonatal chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) suffer from compromised lung function and are at high risk for developing lung injury by multiple insults later in life. Because neonatal lysophosphatidic acid receptor-1 (LPAR1)-deficient rats are protected against hyperoxia-induced lung injury, we hypothesize that LPAR1-deficiency may protect adult survivors of BPD from a second hit response against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung injury. Methods: Directly after birth, Wistar control and LPAR1-deficient rat pups were exposed to hyperoxia (90%) for 8 days followed by recovery in room air. After 7 weeks, male rats received either LPS (2 mg kg-1) or 0.9% NaCl by intraperitoneal injection. Alveolar development and lung inflammation were investigated by morphometric analysis, IL-6 production, and mRNA expression of cytokines, chemokines, coagulation factors, and an indicator of oxidative stress. Results: LPAR1-deficient and control rats developed hyperoxia-induced neonatal emphysema, which persisted into adulthood, as demonstrated by alveolar enlargement and decreased vessel density. LPAR1-deficiency protected against LPS-induced lung injury. Adult controls with BPD exhibited an exacerbated response toward LPS with an increased expression of pro-inflammatory mRNAs, whereas LPAR1-deficient rats with BPD were less sensitive to this "second hit" with a decreased pulmonary influx of macrophages and neutrophils, interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, and mRNA expression of IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and tissue factor. Conclusion:  LPAR1-deficient rats have increased hyperoxia-induced BPD survival rates and, despite the presence of neonatal emphysema, are less sensitive to an aggravated "second hit" than Wistar controls with BPD. Intervening in LPA-LPAR1-dependent signaling may not only have therapeutic potential for neonatal chronic lung disease, but may also protect adult survivors of BPD from sequelae later in life.

AB  - Background: The airway epithelium protects the body from the external environment, eliciting rapid repair when injured to reinstate barrier integrity. We aimed to characterise the repair mechanisms of airway epithelial cells in very preterm infants, who are often exposed to lung injury during early life. Method(s): Upper airway nasal epithelial cells (NECs) obtained by cytological brushing from 10 children born very preterm (25-31 weeks gestation) at 1.07-1.22 years corrected age (8 males; 3 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and 6 full-term children (2.4-6.5 years 4 males) were used to establish primary cell cultures. Cell monolayers were cultured in restricted media and subsequently wounded. Monolayers were washed to remove cellular debris and media replenished at 48h. Time-lapse images were captured and analysed every 30 minutes and values expressed as a percentage of total wound recovery over the period to achieved full repair. Result(s): Healthy full-term NECs were found to fully repair wounds by 36 hrs. In contrast, the preterm NECs only completed 37.5% repair on average at the same time point. At 72 hours post injury, two preterm NECs exhibited significantly dysregulated repair (20-30% repair), five achieved 50-80% wound closure, 1 >90 repair with 2 achieving full repair. Conclusion(s): Preliminary data generated suggests that there is an inherently delayed ability of preterm infant upper airway epithelial cells to successfully repair, which may contribute to their increased susceptibility to environmental pathogens.

AB  - Aims Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common adverse outcome of very premature birth. Studies have given conflicting results as to whether BPD is associated with long-term lung function impairment, but few have included populations exposed to routine use of antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant. To determine, according to BPD status, the lung function of 16 to 18 year old, very prematurely born young people (<29 weeks of gestational age) of whom more than 90% were exposed to both antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant. Methods Lung function was assessed in 59 (34 of whom had BPD) young people. Airway function was assessed including by forced expiratory flow at 75% and 25% of the expired vital capacity (FEF75, FEF25-75), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Lung volumes were assessed including by total lung capacity (TLC), forced vital capacity (FVC), functional residual capacity by helium gas dilition(FRCHe). Gas transfer was assessed by the diffusing capacity for carbon dioxide (DLCO). The results were converted to z-scores, corrected for height, sex and ethnicity using GLI reference ranges. Results The BPD and no BPD group were of similar height and weight at assessment. The lung function results are expressed as mean z score (standard deviation). Airway function (FEF75-1.31 (1.35) versus-0.64 (0.89), p=0.035; FEF25-75-1.88 (1.42) versus-1.10 (0.84), p=0.020; FEV1-1.41 (1.44) versus-0.52 (1.23), p=0.017) and gas transfer DLCO (-1.50 (1.22) versus-0.72 (1.22), p=0.019) were significantly lower in those with BPD compared to those who had not developed BPD. Lung volumes (TLC 0.81 (1.24) ver-sus 1.01 (0.82), p=0.504; FVC-0.54 (1.36) versus 0.13 (1.53), p=0.086 and FRC He 0.30 (1.11) versus-0.16 (1.20), p=0.669) were similar in the BPD and no BPD groups Conclusions Airway function was significantly lower in the young people who had BPD, whereas lung volumes did not differ significantly between the two groups. Those results suggest that dysynaptic growth may be more pronounced in those who had BPD.

AB  - Neonatal hypertension (NH) is an uncommon but important clinical problem in neonates. The most important non-renal association with NH is Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). Exact mechanism of hypertension in BPD infants is not known. The purpose of this case series is to describe our experience with the use of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in neonates with hypertension and BPD. Methods Retrospective case review conducted at Level II NICU in Calgary from 2013 to 2017 revealed 10 preterm infants with BPD and NH who had plasma renin and aldos-terone levels done as part of their investigations for hypertension. NH was defined by blood pressure >95 th centile of the normative data. Maternal characteristics included age, smoking and drug use, history of pregnancy induced hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, antenatal steroids and mode of delivery. Neonatal characteristics included gestational age, birth weight, sex, intrauterine growth restriction, APGAR scores, insertion of umbilical arterial catheterization and the presence of BPD. All infants had serum creatinine, electrolytes, urinalysis, plasma renin and aldosterone levels, renal ultrasound and ECHO done. Data collected also included age at diagnosis of hypertension, age at initiation of treatment, medications used, response to treatment and follow up. Results NH in all infants was diagnosed after 36 weeks GA and treatment was started at presence of persistent hypertension >99 th centile. 3 infants were initially started on amlodipine and Furosemide with no response and were changed to aldactazide. 2 infants received only Furosemide with no response. 5 of the remaining infants were started on aldactazide as a first line treatment to target hyperaldosteron-ism. All infants responded within 48 hours of treatment with aldactazide. All 10 infants developed mild hyponatremia which required sodium chloride supplementation until aldactazide was discounted. Hypertension was transient lasting from 3 months till 16 months post term and medications were discontinued with normal blood pressures. Conclusion Transient hyperaldosteronism is one of the possible causes for hypertension in preterm infants. Our case series demonstrates association preterm of NH with elevated aldos-terone and low rennin without any other apparent cause for the hypertension. All infants responded to aldactazide, an aldosterone antagonist containing medication.

AB  - Purpose of study There is increasing evidence that the neonatal microbiome plays a major role in maintaining a balanced immune response and influencing disease development such as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Several factors can influence the preterm gut microbiome, including antibiotic treatment. In this study, we have focused on the influence of maternal antibiotic exposure and early antibiotic administration on the neonatal murine gut microbiome. We hypothesised that pre- and postnatal antibiotic treatment in neonatal mice would induce a sustained depletion and/or alteration of the intestinal microbiome, which may impact neonatal disease susceptibility. Methods used Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type mice were treated with ampicillin (AMP) 100 mg/kg oral gavage from E17-19 to simulate clinically-relevant prenatal antibiotic exposure and control pregnant dams received no antibiotic treatment. Mouse pups were then treated with either AMP (100 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (control) once daily via intraperitoneal injection for 3 consecutive days to simulate postnatal antibiotic exposure. Intestinal and lung tissue were collected on postnatal day (PND) 6 and 21. Intestinal and lung tissue were then subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Summary of results We identified a significant difference in bdiversity of the intestinal microbiomes between the AMP and PBS-treated groups at PND 21. The PBS control mice had higher levels of Lactobacillus compared to the AMP treated group at PND 6, while the AMP treated group had higher levels of Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus at PND 6. However, these effects were not observed at PND 21. There was not a significant difference in a-diversity between AMP and PBS treatment groups at either PND 6 or 21. In both treatment groups, microbial diversity increased between PND 6 and 21. Conclusions Our data suggests that a clinically-relevant antibiotic dosage has a sustained effect on the intestinal microbiome at PND 21 in a mouse model. Future studies will focus on potential cross talk between the gut and lung microbiomes and the effect of antibiotic treatment on common preterm outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and sepsis.

AB  - Purpose of study Hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in human preterm infants. We observed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling is necessary to protect primary fetal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) against hyperoxic injury. Whether AhR activation is sufficient to protect HPMEC against hyperoxic injury is unknown. To this end, we used leflunomide (LEF), which is an AhR agonist and an immunosuppressive medication used in humans to treat rheumatoid arthritis. We tested the hypothesis that LEF will decrease hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress in HPMEC via AhR activation. Methods used HPMEC were treated with varying concentrations of LEF and exposed to air or hyperoxia (95%) for up to 24 h, following which the cells were harvested to determine cell viability, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and expression of several antioxidant genes, including NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), hemoxygenase 1 (HO1), catalase, glutathione transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) -1,-2, and -3 at the mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, HPMEC were transfected with siRNA to knockdown AhR, following which the cells were treated with LEF and exposed to air or hyperoxia to determine the mechanisms by which LEF modulates oxidative stress. Summary of results LEF did not affect cell viability at 24 h of exposure. Interestingly, LEF increased the expression of NQO1, SOD2, and HO1 and decreased H2O2 production in air-exposed cells. In hyperoxic conditions, LEF augmented hyperoxia-induced HO1 and NQO1 expression and decreased H2O2 production. Our AhR knockdown studies suggested that LEF decreased H2O2 production via AhR-independent mechanisms both in air- and hyperoxia-exposed cells. Conclusions LEF protects fetal HPMEC against hyperoxiainduced oxidative stress via AhR-independent activation of the anti-oxidant enzymes, NQO1, SOD2, and HO1. Our results indicate that LEF is a potential therapeutic drug for the management of human BPD infants.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is common in preterm infants and acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with significant mortality in critically ill patients. Thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibition by auranofin (AFN) activates Nrf2-dependent responses in murine transformed club cells (mtCC), decreases lung damage, and improves survival in murine models of BPD and ALI. TrxR1 activity is selenium (Se) dependent and Se deficiency is common in preterm infants and critically ill patients. We tested the hypothesis that Se supplementation would enhance Nrf2 induction and transcriptional activation by AFN. Methods used MtCCs, supplemented with 0, 25, or 100 nM Se, were treated with 0.5 mM AFN or vehicle for 1 h. TrxR1 activity was assessed and nuclear Nrf2 protein amounts determined. Data (mean+/-SEM) were analyzed by ANOVA or t-test as indicated. Summary of results We detected a concentration-dependent effect of Se supplementation on TrxR1 activity in controltreated mtCCs (R2=0.97, p<0.0001). AFN inhibited TrxR1 activity in control and Se-treated groups (p<0.0001 vs vehicle). Nuclear Nrf2 protein was increased in all AFNtreated groups compared to respective vehicle-treated controls (0 nM: 2.7+/-0.1 vs 1.0+/-0.2; 25 nM: 5.6+/-0.6 vs 1.5+/-0.4; 100 nM: 4.6+/-0.4 vs 0.6+/-0.1; all p<0.05). The magnitude of AFN-induced increases in nuclear Nrf2 was greatest in Se-supplemented mtCCs (25 nM: 13.9+/-2.3 vs 5.8+/-0.2; and, 100 nM: 13.5+/-1.5 vs 5.8+/-0.2, p=0.02). To evaluate transcriptional activation, antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase activity was measured in Se-supplemented mtCCs. ARE-luciferase activity was not different between vehicle and AFN-treated 0 nM and 10 nM supplemented mtCCs. In contrast, AFN increased ARE-luciferase activity by 2.3 times in 25 nM and 5.4 times in 100 nM supplemented mtCCs. Conclusions Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that Se supplementation enhances Nrf2 activation by TrxR1 inhibition. We speculate that Se status may modulate the efficacy of TrxR1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents to prevent or treat BPD and/or ALI. Optimization of Se status could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TrxR inhibition.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a lung disease with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. A developing fetus exists in a hypoxic environment (~3%O ). Endogenous antioxidant systems, including the glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) systems, protect the lungs and mitigate O related injury. Previous work from our lab has shown that the Trx reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibitor, aurothioglucose (ATG), attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung developmental abnormalities in a murine BPD model. This appears to be mediated via activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is a regulator of endogenous antioxidant responses. We hypothesise that ATG treatment enhances pulmonary GSH-dependent responses in a murine BPD model. Methods used Within 12 hour of birth, C3H/HEN pups received saline or 25 mg/kg ATG and were exposed to either room air (RA, 21%O ) or hyperoxia (HO, 85%O ). Lungs were collected at 1, 3, and 7 d. GSH levels (total and oxidised) were determined in whole homogenates. Data (n=4-6) were analysed by 2-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc. Significance was accepted at p<0.05. Summary of results At 1 d, there were no significant effects of ATG or HO on total GSH or GSSG levels. At 3 d, total GSH levels were 1.3 fold higher in HO+saline (p=0.0206) and 1.7 fold higher in HO+ATG (p=0.0002) when compared to RA +saline. Individual differences between HO+saline and HO+ATG were not detected, but two-way ANOVA indicated an independent effect of ATG on GSH levels at 3 d (p=0.0020). At 7 d, total GSH was 1.5 fold greater in lungs from HO+ATG treated pups (p=0.0447) vs RA +saline. There were no significant effects of HO or ATG on GSSG levels at 3 d or 7 d. Conclusions Our results show that ATG enhances total GSH levels in the lungs of HO-exposed pups but has no effect on GSSG levels. Given the importance of GSH-mediated antioxidant responses in protection from hyperoxia, we speculate that ATG-mediated enhancement of GSH-dependent antioxidant responses contributes to the protective effects of TrxR1 inhibition in our murine BPD mode. This supports the rationale for TrxR1 inhibitors, which mitigate the effects of hyperoxia on the developing lung, to prevent the development of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia is a debilitating respiratory disease that affects over 15 000 neonates annually. Oxidative stress has been shown to play a key role in disease manifestation. Therapeutic agents capable of mitigating oxidative damage should be investigated. Emerging evidence suggests that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) may be a novel treatment option for BPD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of UC-MSCs in an in-vitro model of hydrogen peroxide-induced lung injury. Methods used UC-MSCs, derived from human Wharton's jelly tissue, were verified against criteria for MSCs per the International Society for Cellular Therapy. Rat lung epithelial cells (RLE-6TN) were used to model the lung epithelium in neonates. RLE-6TN cells were treated as follows: I) control (grown at standard cell culture conditions), ii) injured (100 muM H2O2 for 1 hour), and iii) treated (100 muM H2O2 for 1 hour +50% UC-MSC conditioned media). Cell proliferation, wound healing, production of reactive oxygen species, and RNA expression of caspase-6 and superoxide dismutase-2 were measured. Summary of results Compared to the control, RLE-6TN proliferation after injury decreased by 51% versus a decrease of 4% in the treated group (p<0.05). Four hours after creating a wound across RLE-6TN cell monolayers, the control group had healed by 14% while the injured group reached 33% closure and the treated group had 48% closure (p<0.05). Hydrogen peroxide increased oxidant injury 1.7-fold whereas the treated group decreased oxidant injury to 0.5- fold of control (p<0.05). Caspase-6, a measure of cell apoptosis, increased after injury but did not demonstrate a significant decrease after UC-MSC conditioned media exposure. Superoxide dismutase-2 was similar in all groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that UC-MSCs may potentially improve alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and wound healing as well as reduce production of reactive oxygen species after oxidative stress injury. Further studies will optimise the concentration of UC-MSC conditioned media, remeasure it's effects on apoptosis and anti-oxidants, and examine mitochondrial function.

AB  - Introduction Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) is a rare condition that presents with hypotonia and often respiratory distress. We present a severe case. Case report This 2,130 g female infant was born at 34 weeks by Caesarian for NRFHT and polyhydramnios to a 28 y/o mother with a history of a prior 35 week infant who died shortly after birth from respiratory failure. The case infant was hypotonic with no respiratory effort at birth and was intubated and placed on a ventilator. Apgar scores were 1, 1, and 2 at 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively and were primarily due to profound hypotonia. Admission exam showed Jeffries K severe hypotonia and chest X-ray showed thin ribs. The mother has a positive family history for CMD, exhibits myotonic facies,and has difficulty releasing her hand after a handshake. However, array CGH was normal and karyotype revealed a balanced translocation between chromosomes 17q and 19q13. The infant failed numerous attempts at extubation and had severe feeding intolerance for which she received a tracheostomy and feeding gastrostomy. She has developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia, persistent patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-right shunt and right ventricular hypertrophy. At 6 months of age,she is tolerating 30 min trials of continuous positive airway pressure every 4 hours in an attempt to wean from the ventilator. She is on continuous gastrojejunal tube feedings with OG tube clamping for one hour every four hours. Profound hypotonia persists. Discussion CMD is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of about 1 in 45 to 50 thousand live births. Inheritance is almost always from an affected mother although parental inheritance has been documented. The aetiology is an unstable CTG repeat in an untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. These repeats in the mRNA inhibit proper splicing and result in disease. The more CTG repeats there are, the more severe the disease. Infants with greater than 1000 repeats manifest disease in the newborn period while individuals with fewer repeats have onset later in life. Conclusion All infants presenting with hypotonia in the newborn period should have a family history taken and be evaluated for the possibility of this disease.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of human preterm infants. Several insults interrupt angiogenesis and contribute to BPD pathogenesis; however, how these insults dysregulate lung angiogenesis is poorly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we used a well established hyperoxia-induced lung injury model. Hyperoxia exposure affects the expression of several mitogens, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2. Whether it affects the lung endothelial ERK1/2 signaling in neonatal mice and whether ERK1/2 promotes lung angiogenesis in human infants is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ERK1/2 signaling is necessary to promote lung angiogenesis and to protect against hyperoxic lung injury. Methods used In vivo experiments: One-day-old WT mice were exposed to 21% O2 (normoxia) or 70% O2 (hyperoxia) for up to 14 d, after which lung tissues were harvested to determine vascularization and ERK1/2 activation. In vitro experiments: Fetal human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) were exposed to air and hyperoxia for up to 48 h, after which the cells were harvested to quantify ERK1/2 activation. Further, to determine if ERK1/2 signaling affects lung angiogenesis, HPAECs treated with varying concentrations of the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD 98059. Finally, we determined if ERK1/2 inhibition affects hyperoxia-induced cytotoxicity. Summary of results Hyperoxia exposure increased lung angiogenesis at 7 d, before decreasing it at 14 d, when compared to normoxia exposed animals. Interestingly, the effects of hyperoxia on ERK1/2 activation followed an identical pattern both in neonatal mice and HPAECs, wherein hyperoxia initially increased, but later decreased ERK1/2 activation. At basal conditions, ERK1/2 inhibition significantly decreased HPAEC proliferation, migration, and tubule formation, indicating that ERK1/2 signaling is necessary for lung angiogenesis. Additionally, ERK1/2 inhibition augmented hyperoxia-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusions We conclude that ERK1/2 signaling is necessary to promote lung angiogenesis and to protect against hyperoxic lung injury. Our results indicate that ERK1/2 signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic target for the management of human BPD infants with decreased lung vascularization.

AB  - Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic, constitutively expressed, pro-inflammatory cytokine and an important regulator of immune responses. d-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT), a newly described member of the MIF protein superfamily, shares sequence homology and biological activities with MIF. We recently reported that high expression levels of MIF sustain innate immune responses in newborns. Here, we elected to further characterize age-dependent MIF expression and to define whether DDT shares a similar expression profile with MIF. Therefore, we delineated the circulating concentrations of MIF and DDT throughout life using a large cohort of 307 subjects including fetuses, newborns, infants, children, and adults. Compared to levels measured in healthy adults (median: 5.7 ng/ml for MIF and 16.8 ng/ml for DDT), MIF and DDT plasma concentrations were higher in fetuses (median: 48.9 and 29.6 ng/ml), increased further at birth (median: 82.6 and 52.0 ng/ml), reached strikingly elevated levels on postnatal day 4 (median: 109.5 and 121.6 ng/ml), and decreased to adult levels during the first months of life. A strong correlation was observed between MIF and DDT concentrations in all age groups (R = 0.91, P < 0.0001). MIF and DDT levels correlated with concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor, a protein upregulated under low oxygen tension and implicated in vascular and lung development (R = 0.70, P < 0.0001 for MIF and R = 0.65, P < 0.0001 for DDT). In very preterm infants, lower levels of MIF and DDT on postnatal day 6 were associated with an increased risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia and late-onset neonatal sepsis. Thus, MIF and DDT plasma levels show a highly specific developmental profile in early life, supporting an important role for these cytokines during the neonatal period.

AB  - Purpose of study Interrupted pulmonary angiogenesis is a hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in human preterm infants. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide that mediates its angiogenic effects via calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Calcrl) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) -2. We observed that global AM-deficient mice have an increased susceptibility to hyperoxic injury. However, the endothelial cell-specific contribution and mechanisms of AM-mediated effects on developing lungs is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that endothelial AM signaling-deficient neonatal mice will display increased susceptibility to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD compared to wild type mice. Methods used In vivo studies: One-day-old endothelial Calcrl-sufficient (eCalcrl ) or -deficient (eCalcrl ) mice were exposed to room air or hyperoxia (FiO 70%) for up to 14 days, following which the mouse lungs were harvested to determine angiogenesis and alveolarization, and the expression of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Calcrl). In vitro studies: For mechanistic studies, we used human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) and determined the effects of Calcrl antagonist, Calcrl knockdown or AM on extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERK)1/2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and angiogenesis. Summary of results Exposure of neonatal mice to 70% oxygen decreased the expression of endothelial Calcrl expression. Further, hyperoxia-induced alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification was augmented in neonatal eCalcrl mice compared to eCalcrl mice. Mechanistically, Calcrl deficiency decreased eNOS expression and ERK1/2 activation in HPMEC. Further, inhibition of ERK1/2 and eNOS signalling in HPMEC decreased AM-mediated angiogenesis. Conclusions We conclude that endothelial AM signalling protects against hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD in neonatal mice via ERK1/2 and eNOS pathways. Our results indicate that AM and Calcrl-RAMP2 interface are potential therapeutic targets for the management of BPD in human preterm infants.

AB  - Purpose of study Sustained expression of pro-inflammatory mediators has been identified as a risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation following neonatal insult are unknown. Following the initial wave of the innate immune response to inflammatory stress, the kinase IKK  activates the TF IRF3 initiating a late-phase type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine response. It is unknown whether this late phase response contributes to chronic inflammation in the neonatal lung. Methods used Neonatal (P0) and adult ICR were exposed to LPS (5 mg/kg IP, 5-7/time point) for 6/12/24 hours. Pulmonary protein and mRNA was isolated and IKK/IRF3 activation was assessed by Western blot. IKK/IRF3 gene expression as well as the expression of their target genes was assessed by RTqPCR. Summary of results Endotoxemia significantly increased IKK expression in adult mice at 6/12/24 hours (p<0.05). Notably, endotoxemia resulted in significant (p<0.05) pulmonary IKK induction in neonatal mice, but levels were significantly attenuated compared to similarly exposed adults (p<0.05). Consistent with attenuated IKK expression, phosphorylated-IRF3 was significantly lower in neonatal mice when compared to adult mice. Despite attenuated IKK/p-IRF3 activity, IRF3 dependent gene expression was not uniformly attenuated in the neonatal lung. Only neonatal IFNbeta was significantly attenuated; whereas induction of IRG1 was similar in neonates and adults. In contrast, expression of RANTES, IP10, IFIT1 was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the neonate compared to adult. Conclusions Consistent with our hypothesis, we found LPSinduced IKK/IRF3 activation and target gene expression in the neonatal lung. Altogether, these findings may provide clues as to the role of critical aspects of the innate immune response may play a critical role in development of neonatal lung injury. Future work will investigate developmentally regulated mechanisms dictating developmentally-regulated expression of IKK/IRF3 target genes following exposure to systemic inflammatory stress.

AB  - Purpose of study Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) protein level is low in preterm infants. Low IGF-1 level is related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia and its comorbidities. Whether repletion of plasma IGF1 will acutely affect lung and brain outcomes is unknown. Methods used We measured plasma IGF1 protein level (ELISA; Mediagnost; Reutlinger, GER) for 3 groups. Group 1 was normal fetal lambs from 128 d (~28 w human) to term (~150 d), and term lambs to 150 d (~6 y human). Group 2 was preterm lambs managed by mechanical ventilation or non-invasive support. Group 3 was preterm MV lambs continuously infused with SHP607 (IGF1/BP3 complex; 1.5 mg/Kg/d) or vehicle (saline). Lung and brain tissue was collected at the end of 3 d. Summary of results Plasma IGF1 protein level was low (~100 ng/mL) in normal fetal lambs and doubled postnatally (~220 ng/mL). IGF1 level was less in ventilated preterm lambs regardless of ventilation mode (not shown; similar to blue points in the figure 1; next). SHP607-treated preterm lambs (n=6) attained elevated plasma IGF1 level at the target of ~125 ng/mL. These lambs had slightly lower FiO2 and PIP to maintain physiological oxygenation and ventilation targets, and slightly lower and more stable systemic hemodynamics, relative to vehicle (not significant, NS; n=6). SHP607 did not disrupt mRNA or protein abundance of apoptotic, proliferation, or vascular growth molecules in lung or brain. SHP607 also did not disrupt alveolar formation or capillary surface density in the lung, or grey/white matter ratio or capillary surface density in the brain, relative to vehicle (NS). Conclusions SHP607 did not harm preterm lambs or injure their lungs or brain. SHP607 appears to lead to better systemic hemodynamics relative to its vehicle. HL110002, Shire. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background and Aims: To investigate the effects of hyperoxia on the expressions of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) proteins, and to examine interactions between these proteins in premature neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Method(s): In this prospective study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from residual venous blood samples of 20 premature infants with BPD and 20 gender-matched premature infants without BPD (non-BPD group). Expressions of SUMO and SIRT1 proteins in PBMCs were assessed by Western blot analysis, and their interactions in PBMCs were detected by immunoprecipitation assay. Based on the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) administered, neonates were divided into normal- (Fi2=21%), low- (21% <Fi2 <30%), medium- (30% <=Fi2 <40%), and high-oxygen (Fi2 >=40%) groups. Result(s): Expression levels of SUMO1 and SUM2/3 proteins in the normal-oxygen group were significantly lower than those in the medium- or high-oxygen groups, but were comparable to those in the low-oxygen group. SIRT1 expression in both the medium- and high-oxygen groups was significantly lower than that in the normal-oxygen group. In the BPD group, the expression of SIRT1 protein was lower, and its interaction with SUMO1 and SUM2/3 was attenuated as compared to that in the non-BPD group. Conclusion(s): Oxygen therapy Supplemental oxygen with Fi2 >=30% was associated with upregulation of SUMO1 and SUM2/3 expressions and downregulation of SIRT1 expression.

AB  - Purpose of study Hospitalised neonates and adults with hypoxemia are often given high oxygen concentrations (hyperoxia). The exact effects of administering hyperoxia are unknown; however, prolonged hyperoxia is associated with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in neonates and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in adults. We created a novel strain of hyperoxia tolerant rats by repeatedly breeding a single naturally hyperoxia tolerant rat and its tolerant offspring. Adult tolerant rats survive indefinitely while all adult control rats die in hyperoxia. Adult tolerant rats have higher alveolar macrophage precursor (bone marrow mononuclear cell {BMM}) levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-an anti-inflammatory antioxidant-and develop less lung injury and inflammation (acute lung injury) than adult control rats after hyperoxia. Because of considerable interest in hyperoxia effects on neonates, we evaluated BMM HO-1 levels and acute lung injury in neonatal control and tolerant rats before and after hyperoxia. Methods used Bone marrow from femurs of male neonatal (21-day-old) control and tolerant rats was harvested from unexposed and hyperoxia exposed (~52 hour) rats. BMM were counted and analysed (ELISA) for HO-1 expression. Acute lung injury (lung lavage LDH and protein levels) and lung inflammation (lung lavage neutrophils) were measured. Summary of results After hyperoxia, neonatal tolerant rats have higher (p<0.005) BMM HO-1 levels and less LDH (p<0.005) and protein (p<0.05) but the same (p>0.05) neutrophils compared to neonatal control rats. Notably, pre-hyperoxia, neonatal control rats have higher (p<0.05) BMM HO-1 levels than neonatal tolerant rats; however, after hyperoxia, BMM HO-1 levels from neonatal control rats decrease (p<0.005) to below pre-hyperoxia baseline levels while BMM HO-1 levels of neonatal tolerant rats triple (p<0.05). Conclusions BMM HO-1 levels of neonatal control rats do not increase following hyperoxia and are associated with increased acute lung injury. By comparison, neonatal tolerant rats have increased BMM HO-1 levels and reduced acute lung injury. BMM HO-1 increases may decrease lung injury in BPD related to hyperoxia treatment.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, is characterised by arrested lung structure and function and high risk for pulmonary hypertension (PH). Animal models suggest that decreased angiogenesis impairs lung growth and causes PH. Hypoxiainducible factor (HIF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis but whether enhanced HIF signalling prevents BPD is uncertain. Therefore, we sought to determine if antenatal and postnatal HIF stabilisation preserves lung growth and function and prevents PH in a rodent model of BPD. Methods used Endotoxin (ETX, 10 ug/sac) was administered to pregnant rats by intra-amniotic (IA) injection at embryonic day 20 (E20; termu=E23) and pups were delivered by cesarean-section at E22. Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) was administered to enhance HIF signalling at either E20 (antenatal, 10 mgs/ sac) or after birth (postnatal, 5 mg/kg IP QOD). At day 14, animals were killed to collect lung tissue to assess alveolarization by radial alveolar counts (RACs); pulmonary vessel density (PVD) by endothelial staining; and cardiac weights to determine right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH; ratio of RV to LV+S weights) as an indicator for PH. Lung protein contents of HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by western blot. Lung function was determined by Flexivent measurement of compliance and resistance at day 14. Summary of results As compared to controls, IA ETX: decreased RAC by 42% (p<0.01), decreased PVD by 41% (p<0.01), increased RVH by 70% (p<0.01), increased lung resistance by 46% (p<0.01), and decreased lung compliance by 41% (p<0.01). Antenatal and postnatal DMOG therapy restored all values to control levels except lung compliance for postnatal therapy. DMOG increased lung HIF-1 and VEGF protein expression by 4- and 3- fold above values measured after ETX alone (p<0.01 for each protein). Conclusions We found that antenatal or postnatal DMOG therapy improves lung structure and function and prevents RVH caused by antenatal ETX exposure. We speculate that the beneficial effects of DMOG therapy are due to HIF stabilisation and up-regulation of VEGF expression in the developing lung.

AB  - Purpose of study Perinatal management of preterm delivery has improved considerably in recent years with increased use of antenatal steroids, stabilisation with non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and avoidance of prophylactic surfactant therapy. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a serious complication of invasive mechanical ventilation in preterm infants that may lead to air leaks and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We compared characteristics of premature infants developing PIE in two time frames, and compared them to infants of similar gestation to assess risks associated with developing PIE. Methods used This was a retrospective cohort study from 2001 to 2016 at a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit. Characteristics of infants with PIE in Period 1 (P1, 2001-2008) were compared to infants with PIE in Period 2 (P2, 2009- 2016). P2 infants were also compared to infants of similar gestational age without PIE to find risks associated with developing PIE. IBM SPSS version 24 software was used for stepwise logistic regression analysis. Summary of results A total of 77 patients developed PIE during the study periods. Incidence of PIE in very low birth weight infants was comparable in both periods with 44 (9.7%) in P1 compared to 33 (10.3%) in P2. Infants from P2 had significantly lower mean gestational age (24.5 wks vs 25.4 wks; p=0.020) as well as birth weight (629 g vs 762 g; p=0.003) compared to P1. All neonatal morbidities including survival were similar between the groups. All infants in P2 were less than 28 weeks gestation. Infants in P2 compared to infants without PIE using logistic regression controlling for gestational age revealed the most important differentiating factor was invasive ventilation at 24 hours of age (p=0.029). More infants with PIE compared to without PIE had increased duration of invasive ventilation (p<0.001) and BPD (p=0.034). Mortality and other neonatal morbidities were not significantly different. Conclusions Infants with lower gestational age and birth weight are still at risk for developing PIE. Invasive ventilation at 24 hours is a significant risk factor for developing PIE in preterm infants. Aggressive extubation to NIV as soon as possible may likely improve short- and long-term pulmonary outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early fetal lung development is dependent on the presence of a sufficient amount of amniotic fluid. We aimed to evaluate the role of serial AFV assessments in pregnancies complicated by early preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) in predicting neonatal respiratory outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of all women with a singleton pregnancy admitted to a single tertiary referral center with PPROM between 20 and 28 6/7 weeks of gestation during 2004-2014 and underwent expectant management. According to our institutional protocol, each patient underwent an AFV assessment at presentation followed by biweekly assessment of AFV until delivery. In the current analysis, we included only patients that underwent 4 serial AFV measurements. Pregnancies complicated by delivery at <23 weeks or major fetal anomalies were excluded. We compared pregnancy and neonatal outcome between four groups of women based on the proportion of sonographic exams documenting oligohydramnios (defined as maximal vertical pocket <2cm): 0-25% (group A), 26-50% (group B), 51-75% (group C) and 76-100% of studies (group D). Composite respiratory outcome was defined as any of the followings: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypoplasia, or respiratory distress syndrome. RESULT(S): A total of 268 women who underwent 1512 AFV studies met the study criteria. Mean gestational age at PPROM was 25.8 1.7 weeks and the mean latency to delivery was 19.6 11.4 days. The proportion of women classified as groups A, B, C or D were 74 (27.6%), 77(28.7%), 35 (13.1%), and 82 (30.6%) respectively. The overall rate of composite respiratory outcome was 133/268 (49.6%). The rate of composite respiratory outcome did not differ between the 4 groups (40.5%, 48.1%, 54.3%, 57.3% for groups A-D, respectively, all non-significant). In an adjusted analysis, various factors, but not the AFV group, were associated with the risk of composite neonatal respiratory outcome (Table). CONCLUSION(S): We did not find evidence that the information obtained from serial AFV measurements is useful for the prediction of neonatal respiratory outcome in pregnancies complicated by early PPROM. Therefore, the role of costly and time-consuming serial sonographic assessment in women with PPROM should be reevaluated.

STUDY DESIGN: Women with preterm cephalic first twins delivered after preterm labor (PL) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) from 240/7 to 346/7 weeks' gestation, with both fetuses alive at the beginning of labor, were identified from the national prospective population-based EPIPAGE 2 cohort study that was implemented to describe the short- and long-term outcomes of preterm infants. A propensity score analysis, involving inverse probability of treatment weighting and a generalized estimating equation model adjusted for gestational age, sex and birth weight zscore, was used to assess the association between the planned mode of delivery and survival to discharge, survival to discharge without severe morbidity (i.e. without intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and survival at two years corrected age without disability (defined as cerebral palsy, blindness or deafness). RESULT(S): The analysis included 390 women of whom 108 had a PCD and 157 had a cesarean section. In women with PCD vs PVD, rates of survival to discharge, survival to discharge without severe morbidity and survival at 2 years without disability were 96.2% vs 93.4% (p=.47), 79.4% vs 88.0% (p=.15) and 85.9% vs 89.3% (p=.40), respectively. After propensity score analysis, PCD was not associated with a lower rate of survival (i) to discharge or (ii) without severe morbidity or (iii) at two years corrected age without disability for either the first twin ((i) adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.12 [95% confidence interval 0.32-3.84]; (ii) aOR 1.01 [0.42-2.44]; (iii) aOR 1.56 [0.56-4.32]) or the second twin ((i) aOR 1.04 [0.34-3.14]; (ii) aOR 0.84 [0.41-1.72]; (iii) aOR 0.45 [0.15-1.34]), compared to PVD. CONCLUSION(S): PCD of preterm twins with the first twin in cephalic presentation does not decrease either survival, survival without severe morbidity at discharge or survival at two years corrected age without disability for both first and second twins when delivery is due to PL or PPROM. These results should encourage vaginal deliveries in preterm twin gestations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Funisitis, the inflammation in umbilical cord, is considered as representing fetal inflammatory response. Funisitis in singleton preterm neonates is known as a strong risk factor for adverse neonatal outcome. There have been anecdotal reports in placental inflammation in twin preterm birth, but the clinical meaning of funisitis in twin preterm birth has not been well determined. This study aimed to determine the frequency and clinical significance of funisitis in twin neonates with spontaneous preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: The study population consisted of preterm twin neonates (<35 weeks) who were delivered after spontaneous preterm labor and/or preterm premature rupture of membrane. The presence of funisitis was examined in umbilical cords of each twin. Adverse neonatal outcome was compared according to the presence or absence of funisitis. Cases with higher order pregnancy, fetal demise in utero, major fetal malformation, unique monochorionic complications including twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome were excluded from analysis. Adverse neonatal outcome was defined as neonatal mortality and/or significant morbidity (at least one of the followings: respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumoniae, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and proven sepsis). A generalized estimating equation was used in multivariate analysis to account for the familial correlation between the twin pairs from a single mother. RESULT(S): Among the 474 preterm neonates (237 twin pairs) included in the study population, the funisitis was identified in 31 cases (6.5%). Funisitis was associated with increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes (28.4% in cases without funisitis vs. 51.6% in cases with funisitis, p<0.05). This difference remained significant after adjustment for gestational age at delivery, chorionicity and use of antenatal corticosteroid. CONCLUSION(S): The presence of funisitis is associated with increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes in twin neonates with spontaneous preterm birth. (Table Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS) is one of the prime risk factors for chronic lung disease development. Smoking during pregnancy may lead to birth defects in the newborn that include pulmonary dysfunction, increased susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens, or initiation of childhood respiratory manifestations such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Moreover, exposure to SHS in early childhood can have negative impact on lung health, although the exact mechanisms are unclear. Autophagy is a crucial proteostatic mechanism modulated by cigarette smoke (CS) in adult lungs. Here, we sought to investigate whether SHS exposure impairs autophagy in pediatric lungs., METHODS: Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to room air or SHS for 14 days. The newborn pups were subsequently exposed to room air or SHS (5 h/day) for 1 or 14 days, and lungs were harvested. Soluble and insoluble protein fractions isolated from pediatric mice lungs were subjected to immunoblotting for ubiquitin (Ub), p62, VCP, HIF-1alpha, and beta-actin., RESULTS: Our data shows that short-term exposure to SHS (1 or 14 days) leads to proteostasis and autophagy-impairment as evident by significant increase in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Ub), p62 (impaired-autophagy marker) and valosin-containing protein (VCP) in the insoluble protein fractions of pediatric mice lungs. Moreover, increased HIF-1alpha levels in SHS-exposed mice lungs points towards a novel mechanism for SHS-induced lung disease initiation in the pediatric population. Validating the in vivo studies, we demonstrate that treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas2b cells) with the proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) induces HIF-1alpha expression that is controlled by co-treatment with autophagy-inducing drug, cysteamine., CONCLUSIONS: SHS-exposure induced proteostasis/autophagy impairment can mediate the initiation of chronic lung disease in pediatric subjects. Hence, our data warrants the evaluation of proteostasis/autophagy-inducing drugs, such as cysteamine, as a potential therapeutic intervention strategy for SHS-induced pediatric lung diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Amniotic fluid volume (AFV) plays an important role in early fetal lung development. We aimed to evaluate the role of AFV assessment at admission in pregnancies complicated by early preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) in predicting neonatal respiratory outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of all women with a singleton pregnancy admitted to a single tertiary referral center following PPROM between 20 and 28 6/7 weeks of gestation during 2004-2014 and underwent expectant management. Pregnancies complicated by delivery at <23 weeks or major fetal anomalies were excluded. AFV at admission was classified according to the maximal vertical pocket (MVP) as either normal (MVP>=2cm), oligohydramnios (MVP<2cm), severe oligohydramnios (MVP<1cm) or anhydramnios (no measurable AFV). Composite respiratory outcome was defined as >=1 of the followings: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypoplasia, or respiratory distress syndrome. RESULT(S): Of the 748 PPROM pregnancies assessed, 549 women were eligible for the study. Mean gestational age at PPROM was 25.2 +/- 1.9 weeks and the mean latency to delivery was 11.2 +/- 13.1 days. AFV as presentation was classified as either normal (58.8%), oligohydramnios (41.5%), severe oligohydramnios (16.2%), and anhydramnios (11.4%). The overall rate of composite respiratory outcome was 285/549 (51.9%). Composite respiratory morbidity was more common in the presence of low AFV using any of the 3 cutoffs: oligohydramnios (57.9% vs. 47.7%, p=0.018), severe oligohydramnios (70.8% vs. 48.3%, p<0.001), and anhydramnios (74.6% vs. 49%, p<0.001). In an adjusted analysis (table and image), the following factors were independently associated with composite respiratory outcome: gestational age at delivery, neonatal birth weight, cesarean delivery, chorioamnionitis, severe oligohydramnios, and anhydramnios, but not oligohydramnios. CONCLUSION(S): The presence of severe oligohydramnios (MVP<1cm) at the time of presentation with early PPROM is predictive of neonatal adverse respiratory outcome. (Table Presented).

AB  - Preterm birth is associated with alteration of the vascular tree that can result in disease states such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity during the neonatal period and emphysema and hypertension in adulthood. Studies have suggested a potential role for endothelial progenitor cells in the pathophysiology of prematurity-related complications involving blood vessels; however, this knowledge has never been synthesized.Weconducted a systematic review of the published data to examine the characteristics of endothelial progenitor cells in relation to preterm birth in humans. Preterm infants compared with term controls displayed similar or increased circulating/cord blood endothelial progenitor cell counts. However, the preterm endothelial progenitor cells were more vulnerable to exogenous factors such as oxidative stress. A reduced number, in particular of endothelial colony-forming cells, was associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. No studies have examined endothelial progenitor cells beyond the neonatal period. These findings could prove useful in the identification of biomarkers for prognostication or therapeutic strategies for vascular-related diseases in preterm-born individuals.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zinc finger protein A20 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary inflammation/anti-inflammatory mediators in an acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) rat model. Material/Methods: Forty-eight ALI/ARDS rats were selected and assigned into normal saline (NS) (injected with NS), LPS (injected with LPS), LPS-C1 (injected with pEGFP-C1, NS and LPS), and A20 groups (injected with pEGFP-C1-A20, NS, and LPS). The wet/dry (W/D) ratio of rat lung tissues and total protein concentration and the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were detected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and qRT-PCR were applied to detect the protein and mRNA expressions of A20, IL-10, and TNF-alpha, respectively. Western blotting was employed to detect the protein expressions of A20, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) p65 and NF-kB p-P65 in rat lung tissues. Result(s): Compared with the NS group, the W/D ratio of rat lung tissues and total protein concentration and the number of neutrophils in BALF in the other 3 groups increased significantly. The protein and mRNA expressions of A20, IL-10, and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in the LPS group than in the NS group. The protein and mRNA expressions of A20 and IL-10 were significantly up-regulated and the expression of TNF-alpha, NF-kB p65, and NF-kB p-P65 was significantly down-regulated in rats injected with A20 compared to those in the LPS group. Conclusion(s): The study provided evidence that zinc finger protein A20 can alleviate pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting TNF-alpha, NF-kB p65, and NF-kB p-P65 expressions and promoting IL-10 expression.Copyright © Med Sci Monit.

AB  - Aims: This study explored whether growth was poorer among very low birthweight (VLBW) infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and assessed adipokine levels as predictors of early growth. Method(s): We studied 53 VLBW infants born in Tampere University Hospital up to 12 months of corrected age (CA). The median gestational age of the 21 infants with BPD and 32 infants without BPD was 29 weeks, and the median birthweights were 930 (635-1470) and 1185 (650-1470) grams. Growth parameters, macronutrients intake and plasma levels of adipokines were measured. Result(s): Bronchopulmonary dysplasia infants were lighter than controls until 36 weeks of CA, with catch-up growth achieved by three months of CA. Adipsin levels were lower in BPD infants at 28 days of postnatal age. High leptin levels seemed protective for low weight for height at nine months of CA. The duration of ventilator therapy predicted low weight for height, length for age and body mass index and BPD predicted low length for age at 12 months of CA. Conclusion(s): Catch-up growth in VLBW infants with BPD was achieved by three months of CA, but adipokines played a limited role in predicting growth. Shortening ventilator therapy could help growth in VLBW infants.Copyright ©2017 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background & aims The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of the parenteral emulsion SMOFlipid, with 15% fish oil, with Clinoleic on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and other morbidities and growth, and to compare their impact on longitudinal serum levels of fatty acids. Retinopathy of prematurity, other morbidity and growth were correlated with each parenteral lipid supplement. Methods Ninety infants born at gestational age <28 weeks were randomized to treatment with SMOFlipid or Clinoleic. Two thirds (66%) of the infants received parenteral nutrition for up to 14 days birth (median 8, range 2-14 days), and additional 25% of the infants received for up to 28 days after birth (median 21, range 15-28 days). Cord blood samples and then venous blood samples were obtained at ages 1, 7, 14, and 28 days and at postmenstrual age (PMA) 32, 36, and 40 weeks. Breastmilk was collected at postnatal day 7, and at PMA 32 and 40 weeks. Serum phospholipid and breastmilk total fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Treatment groups were compared with regard to ROP, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus sepsis and growth between birth and 36 weeks. Results Infants on SMOFlipid had higher fractions of omega-3 LCPUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and slightly higher omega-3 LCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fraction and a decreased arachidonic acid (AA) to DHA ratio from one week after birth up to 32 postmenstrual weeks compared to infants on Clinoleic. Treatment groups did not differ in morbidities or growth. Conclusion Supplementation with SMOFlipid containing 15% fish oil during parenteral nutrition increased EPA substantially, DHA marginally, reduced AA and decreased AA to DHA ratio. It did not reduce morbidity or affect growth. Since extremely preterm infants accumulate a large deficit of DHA and AA, studies on more prolonged or different levels of DHA and AA supplementation are warranted.Copyright © 2017 The Authors

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between serum cytokine concentrations and chorioamnionitis (CAM) and CAM-related bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. METHOD(S): Serum was collected at 0 and 7 days after birth from 36 premature infants born at <32 weeks of gestation. We examined the relationships between 30 cytokine concentrations and CAM, BPD, and other perinatal factors. RESULT(S): On day 0, GM-CSF, IL-15, IL-17, IL-2, IL-2R, VEGF, and MIG concentrations were significantly higher in the CAM group (n = 17) than in the non-CAM group (n = 19). These concentrations had decreased by day 7 and were similar in both groups. The IL-12p70 concentration on day 0 was significantly lower in the BPD group (n = 16) than in the non-BPD group (n = 15). BPD incidence was similar between the CAM and non-CAM groups. CONCLUSION(S): These data support the hypothesis that intrauterine inflammation is not a primary risk factor for BPD. The immunological environment at birth or soon after, rather than intrauterine fetal inflammation (e.g., CAM), is a primary risk factor for BPD onset in preterm infants. Decreased inflammatory responses are particularly relevant, as indicated by the relationship between BPD and low serum IL-12p70 concentrations on day 0.Copyright © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Background: Most preterm infants born at 29-32 weeks gestation now avoid intubation in early life, and thus lack the usual conduit through which exogenous surfactant is given if needed. Objective(s): The aim of this work was to examine whether a technique of minimally invasive surfactant therapy used selectively at 29-32 weeks gestation would improve outcomes. Method(s): We studied the impact of selective administration of surfactant (poractant alfa 100-200 mg/kg) by thin catheter in infants with respiratory distress syndrome on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The threshold for consideration of treatment was CPAP >=7 cm H2O and FiO2 >=0.35 prior to 24 h of life. In-hospital outcomes were compared before and after introducing minimally invasive surfactant therapy (epochs 1 and 2, respectively). Result(s): During epoch 2, of 266 infants commencing CPAP, 51 (19%) reached the treatment threshold. Thirty-seven infants received surfactant via thin catheter, and CPAP failure was avoided in 34 of these (92%). For the overall cohort of infants at 29-32 weeks gestation, after the introduction of minimally invasive surfactant therapy, there were reductions in CPAP failure (epoch 1: 14%, epoch 2: 7.2%) and average days of intubation, with equivalent surfactant use and days of respiratory support (intubation + CPAP). Pneumothorax was substantially reduced (from 8.0 to 2.4%). These findings were mirrored within the subgroups reaching the severity threshold in each epoch. The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was low in both epochs. Conclusion(s): Selective use of minimally invasive surfactant therapy at 29-32 weeks gestation permits a primary CPAP strategy to be pursued with a high rate of success, and a low risk of pneumothorax.Copyright © 2017 S.

AB  - Chorioamnionitis can induce pulmonary inflammation and promote bronchopulmonary dysplasia development, distinguished by alveolar simplification and impaired vascular growth. Chorioamnionitis is more common during the extremely preterm canalicular lung stage (crucial for vascular development); and increases the risk for subsequent sepsis. We hypothesized that single/combined exposure to chronic and/or acute inflammation induces pulmonary inflammatory responses and vascular changes. Methods Ovine fetuses were intra-amniotically exposed to chronic Ureaplasma parvum (UP) at 24 days (d) before extreme preterm delivery at 94d (term 147d) and/or to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 7 or 2d before delivery. Pulmonary inflammation, vascular remodeling and angiogenic factors were assessed. Results LPS exposure increased CD3-positive and myeloperoxidase-positive cells. Combined UPLPS exposure increased pulmonary inflammation compared with 2d LPS or UP groups. The UP+2d LPS group had an increased adventitial fibrosis score when compared with UPtreated animals. A reduced wall-to-lumen ratio was found in the 7d LPS animals when compared to the 2d LPS-treated animals. Exposure to UP+2d LPS reduced VEGF and VEGFR- 2 levels compared with 2d LPS-treated animals. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2 (Tie-2) levels were decreased after UP+7d LPS as well as after 7d LPS, but not with UP alone. Conclusion Chronic UP and subsequent LPS exposure increased pulmonary inflammation and decreased expression of angiogenic growth factors and receptors when compared to single hit-exposed animals.Copyright © 2017 Willems et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate if endothelin 1 concentration at day 3 postnatal age could be used as a predictive marker for development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. METHOD(S): This prospective observational study was done on 69 preterm neonates with gestational ages between 28 and 34 weeks and diagnosed as having respiratory distress syndrome. Serum concentrations of endothelin 1 was measured for all patients at day 3 of life and they were divided into BPD and No-BPD groups according to whether they developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia or not. RESULT(S): A total of 17 infants were in the BPD group and 52 infants were in the No-BPD group. Serum endothelin 1 was significantly higher in the BPD group (435.39+/-172.88) compared with the No-BPD group (302.65+/-49.32) (<0.001). Serum endothelin 1 correlated significantly with days spent on mechanical ventilation (r=0.379, p=0.022) and days spent on CPAP (r=0.391, p=0.001). A serum endothelin 1 cut off value of 302.7ng/L could predict preterm that will develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia with a sensitivity of 88.24%, and specificity of 61.54%. CONCLUSION(S): Serum endothelin 1 is significantly increased at day 3 of life in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). It seems to be a promising predictive marker for BPD but further studies are needed to find the appropriate time for its measurement.Copyright © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to observe the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) on the expression of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) and cell apoptosis in lung tissue following hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rats. The 96 Sprague-Dawley newborn rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=24) as follows: Room air-exposed control group, room air-exposed rhEPO-treated group, hyperoxia-exposed group and the hyperoxia-exposed rhEPO-treated group. Pups (n=8) from each group were sacrificed on postnatal days 3, 7 and 14. The pulmonary morphometric and microvessel density changes were observed. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression levels of EGFL7, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax) in lung tissue samples were measured. The rats in the hyperoxia-exposed group exhibited alveolar and pulmonary vascular dysplasia, as well as low mRNA and protein expression levels of EGFL7 and Bcl-2, in addition to high level of Bax in the lung tissue samples when compared with the room air-exposed control group (P<0.05). However, in the hyperoxia-exposed rhEPO-treated group the lung histopathology was improved, and the protein and mRNA expression levels of EGFL7 and Bcl-2 were increased compared with the hyperoxia-exposed group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression level of Bax was lower than that of the hyperoxia-exposed group (P<0.05). The present study demonstrated that rhEPO promotes alveolar development and increases pulmonary vascular density by upregulating the expression level of EGFL7 in hyperoxia-induced lung injury of newborn rats.

AB  - Advances in the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ensure that clinicians must continue to revise current practice. We report the third update of the European Guidelines for the Management of RDS by a European panel of expert neonatologists including input from an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the beginning of 2016. Optimizing the outcome for babies with RDS includes consideration of when to use antenatal steroids, and good obstetric practice includes methods of predicting the risk of preterm delivery and also consideration of whether transfer to a perinatal centre is necessary and safe. Methods for optimal delivery room management have become more evidence based, and protocols for lung protection, including initiation of continuous positive airway pressure and titration of oxygen, should be implemented from soon after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of the management of RDS, and newer protocols for surfactant administration are aimed at avoiding exposure to mechanical ventilation, and there is more evidence of differences among various surfactants in clinical use. Newer methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been developed and offer potential for greater comfort and less chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease although minimizing the time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and if necessary postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimizing the general care of infants with RDS are also essential with good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion and judicious use of antibiotics all being important determinants of best outcome.Copyright © 2016 S.

AB  - Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), a feature of asthma, is observed in preterm-born children and has been linked to intrauterine growth restriction. BHR is mediated via airway smooth muscle tone and is modulated by the autonomic nervous system, nitric oxide, and airway inflammation. Interactions among these factors are insufficiently understood. Methacholine-induced BHR (Met-BHR), fractional exhaled NO, and systemic soluble markers of nitric oxide metabolism and inflammation were determined in a population-based sample of 57 eleven-year-old children born extremely preterm (gestational age [GA],28 wk) or with extremely low birth weight (,1,000 g), and in a matched normal-birth weight term-born control group (n = 54). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was defined as the need for oxygen treatment at a GA of 36 weeks. In preterm-born children, birth weight below the 10th percentile forGAwas associated with increased Met-BHR and higher plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), with an increased odds ratio for being in the upper tertile of Met-BHR (11.8; 95% confidence interval, 3.3-42.4) and of ADMA (5.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-20.3). Met-BHR was correlated to ADMA level (r = 0.27, P = 0.007). There were no significant differences in Met-BHR, fractional exhaled NO, or z-FEV1 according toBPDstatus. No associations with systemic soluble markers of inflammation were observed for Met-BHR, birth, or BPD status. Intrauterine growth restriction in preterm-born children was associated with substantially increased Met-BHR and higher ADMA levels, suggesting altered nitric oxide regulation. These findings contribute to the understanding of the consequences from an adverse fetal environment; they should also be tested in term-born children.Copyright © 2017 by the American Thoracic Society.

AB  - Background/aims Elastase inhibitors reverse elastin degradation and abnormal alveologenesis and attenuate the lung structural abnormalities induced by mechanical ventilation with O2-rich gas. The potential of these molecules to improve endothelial function and to ameliorate severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) during lung development is not yet understood. We sought to determine whether the intratracheal treatment of newborn mice with the elastase inhibitor elafin would prevent hyperoxia-induced lung elastin degradation and the cascade of events that cause abnormal alveologenesis. Methods Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Recombinant human elafin was administered by intratracheal instillation from the first day every two days for 20 days. We next used morphometric analyses, quantitative RT-PCR, immunostaining, Western blotting, and ELISA methods to assess the key variables involved in elastogenesis disruption and the potential signaling pathways noted below in recombinant human elafin-treated mouse pups that had been exposed to 85% O2. Results We found that impaired alveolar development and aberrant elastin production were associated with elevations in whole lung elastase levels in 85% O2-exposed lungs. Elafin attenuated the structural disintegration that developed in the hyperoxia-damaged lungs. Furthermore, elafin prevented the elastin degradation, neutrophil influx, activation of TGF-beta1 and apoptosis caused by 85% O2 exposure. Conclusions Pulmonary elastase plays an important role in disrupting elastogenesis during O2-induced damage, which is the result of a pulmonary inflammatory response. Elafin prevents these changes by inhibiting elastase and the TGF-beta1 signalling cascade and may be a new therapeutic target for preventing O2-induced lung injury in neonates.Copyright © 2017

AB  - Background. Despite current medical advances, to this day there is no single medical intervention to effectively prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in both preterm and term infants. Along with protective ventilation strategies, various drugs are being used or are being researched at this very moment, with the sole purpose of improving the general outcome for these patients. Inhaled dry salt micro particles therapy is now one of them. Materials and methods. This report presents five patients, diagnosed with severe BPD. All of them received, complementary to classical BPD management and respiratory support, continuous inhaled dry salt micro particles, via SaltMed cartridges, for a period of 12 to 30 days. After only 24 hours of administration, we were able to observe a significant improvement in respiratory function and dynamics. It was possible to use a lower fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), mean airway pressure (MAP) and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) in all mechanically ventilated patients. Higher tidal volumes were recorded and we observed improvement in oxygenation indexes. Conclusion. Continuously inhaled dry salt micro particles, administered complementary to classic BPD management, could improve respiratory and overall morbidity and mortality in infants with any form of BPD. Further study of these possible effects is needed, as there is no data published on this matter so far.Copyright © 2017, Pharmamed Mado Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prematurity affects approximately 10% of all children, resulting in drastically altered antigen exposure due to premature confrontation with microbes, nutritional antigens, and other environmental factors. During the last trimester of pregnancy, the fetal immune system adapts to tolerate maternal and self-antigens, while also preparing for postnatal immune defense by acquiring passive immunity from the mother. Since the perinatal period is regarded as the most important "window of opportunity" for imprinting metabolism and immunity, preterm birth may have long-term consequences for the development of immune-mediated diseases. Intriguingly, preterm neonates appear to develop bronchial asthma more frequently, but atopic dermatitis less frequently in comparison to term neonates. The longitudinal study of preterm neonates could offer important insights into the process of imprinting for immune-mediated diseases. On the one hand, preterm birth may interrupt influences of the intrauterine environment on the fetus that increase or decrease the risk of later immune disease (e.g., maternal antibodies and placenta-derived factors), whereas on the other hand, it may lead to the premature exposure to protective or harmful extrauterine factors such as microbiota and nutritional antigen. Solving this puzzle may help unravel new preventive and therapeutic approaches for immune diseases.Copyright © 2017 Goedicke-Fritz, Hartel, Krasteva-Christ, Kopp, Meyer and Zemlin.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to examine a possible correlation between high cytokine levels like interleukin (Il)-6, Il-8 and tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in non-invasively obtained amniotic fluid which indicates an intra-amniotic infection in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and adverse neonatal outcomes. Method(s): Women with PPROM during 23+0 to 33+6 gestational weeks and their neonates are included in this study. Amniotic fluid samples are daily obtained non-invasively with a commercial garlic press and are analyzed by a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and a lateral flow immunoassay as a point-of-care (POC) test. The cytokine levels in amniotic fluid during the last two days before delivery are compared to the Il-6 and C-reactive protein levels measured after birth in the fetal blood of the umbilical cord. Furthermore, the neonatal outcome is investigated. After delivery the newborns are separated into groups with or without adverse neonatal outcome. Primary outcomes are neonatal death, neonatal sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Result(s): Amniotic fluid Il-6, Il-8 and TNF-alpha were higher in women whose children were born with signs of neonatal sepsis and RDS and inversely proportional to gestational age. Newborns from women with Il-6 levels from 1100 pg/ml to 7000 pg/ml in amniotic fluid clinically showed signs of infection without increased Il-6 or CRP in umbilical cord blood. Newborns from women with Il-6 levels > 30000 pg/ml were diagnosed with sepsis and showed increased Il-6 levels (55.0 pg/ml- 793.5 pg/ml). Amniotic fluid Il-6 and Il-8 levels increased or decreased in correlation, TNF-alpha levels acted inversely to Il-6 and Il-8 in two of six cases. Both tests showed equal results in all cases. Conclusion(s): Il-6 values in amniotic fluid higher than 1100 pg/ml are correlated with signs of neonatal sepsis and RDS. The higher the differences in increased amniotic Il-6 levels during the days before delivery were, the more probable were increased Il-6 levels in umbilical cord blood. This correlated with neonatal sepsis and RDS. Il-6 levels increased earlier than CRP and indicated a faster positive correlation to maternal cytokine levels and clinical outcome of the newborn. Values measured from POC correlated to Il-6 levels measured by the immunoassay and may be a useful clinical test to forecast adverse neonatal outcome in PPROM early.

AB  - Background. The 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement on respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis (RSV IP) recommended against its use in infants 29-34 weeks gestational age (wGA) without chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (CLD/BPD) or congenital heart disease (CHD). This study examined the impact of these changes by evaluating RSV IP use and bronchio-litis hospitalization rates among full-term (FT) and preterm (PT) infants 29-34 wGA in the 2014-15 RSV season relative to previous seasons. Methods. Infants born 7/1/2009 to 6/30/2015 were identified in the MarketScan Multistate Medicaid (MED) and Commercial (COM) databases; DRG and ICD-9-CM codes were used to select FT and PT infants without CLD/BPD or CHD. Outpatient RSV IP use was identified by drug and administration codes. Bronchiolitis hospitali-zations were identified by diagnosis codes (466.11 and 466.19) during the RSV season (Nov-Mar) and summarized by chronologic age (CA). Hospitalization rates were calculated per 100 infant-seasons, and statistical signifcance was tested using generalized linear regression models with Poisson error, log link, and log ofset for exposure time. Results. 1.1 mil MED and 1.0 mil COM births were identified; 5.2% MED and 4.8% COM infants were born at 29-34 wGA. RSV IP use decreased among MED and COM infants 29-34 wGA (P <.01) in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14. Bronchiolitis hospitalization rates increased for MED and COM infants 29-34 wGA in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 (rate ratios <3 months CA: MED 1.45, P =.009 and COM 2.1, P =.004; 3-6 months CA: MED 1.35, P =.023 and COM 1.7, P =.053), whereas the rates for FT infants remained the same (rate ratios 0.94-1.08, P >.05). Absolute increases were greatest for infants 29-30 wGA and <3 months CA (MED +10.0 and COM +8.3 per100 infant-seasons). Similar trends were observed when 2014-15 was compared with the combined 2010-14 RSV seasons. Conclusion. In the 2014-15 RSV season, there was an increase in bronchiolitis hospitalization rates among PT infants born at 29-34 wGA when <3 months and 3-6 months CA, but no increase among FT infants. Trends were consistent in the MED and COM populations and are associated with the change to AAP policy.

AB  - For successful gas exchange, a thin alveolocapillary barrier with a large surface area is required. Formation of alveoli can be disturbed during development, for example in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), highlighting the need for refinements in the assessment of lung architecture during lung development. However, the dynamics of lung alveolarization throughout development, including alveoli formation or thinning of the alveolar septal wall has not been reported. Here we performed a longitudinal study of lung structure using a stereological approach. Lung structure was assessed over a nine-week period of post-natal life of C57BL/6 mice after harvest and fixation with glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde, after which, lungs were treated with arsenic, osmium, and uranium, and embedded in plastic, for systematic uniform random sampling, for quantification by microscopic analysis. Evidence of generation of alveoli was noted over the early post-natal period [post-natal days (P)5-10], when saccular or alveolar density gradually increased from 3.0 +/- 2.2 x106 sacculi or alveoli/cm3 at P5 to 9.7 +/- 1.2 x106 alveoli/cm3 at P7, with a further increase to 15.1 +/- 2.6 alveoli after P10. Concomitant with increasing saccular or alveolar surface area was a decrease in the mean septal wall thickness from 20.68 +/- 3.37 mum at P5 to 9.99 +/- 2.27 mum at P10. The mean septal wall thickness continued to decrease to 3.87 +/- 0.57 mum by P63. More alveoli were noted in male mice from P28, which was attributed to larger lung volumes. These data provide new and important reference values for the lung architecture since longitudinal studies on the structural development of the lung have never been performed using stereology.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by airspace enlargement, develops in premature infants. BPD leads to persistent lung consequences in adulthood, being considered as an early determinant of adult lung diseases. P16Ink4 is a key factor implicated in aging-related lung diseases and its levels are increased in cord blood cells of preterm infants. Whether p16 is involved in BPD and its persistent consequences at the adult age remains to be determined. Aim(s): To determine in a mouse model of BPD: 1) if p16 deletion protects against lung alterations in new born and adult mice, and 2) if these effects are mediated by cellular senescence. Method(s): Mouse pups were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) or room air from day 3 to 14 of life. Morphometry (mean linear intercept), elastin content (Weigert), collagen deposition (sirius red), cell senescence (betagalactosidase activity and p21) and cell proliferation (Ki67) were evaluated. Result(s): At day 14, hyperoxia induced airspace enlargement and cellular senescence, without modification of collagen deposition, nor cell proliferation. Hyperoxic p16-/-mice were not protected against alveolar disruption, but presented an increased alveolar wall thickness and cell proliferation. At day 60, hyperoxic mice showed persistence of airspace enlargement and senescence, without modification of collagen deposition, nor cellular proliferation. Hyperoxic p16-/-mice have reduced airspace enlargement, but increased collagen deposition, without modulation of senescence markers. Conclusion(s): P16 did not modulated hyperoxia-induced alveolar disruption at young age but could play a crucial role in BPD consequences in adults. This effect may be independent of cellular senescence.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of preterm birth, and is characterised by aberrant late lung alveolarization. Lack of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 has been linked to the risk of BPD. The role of IL-10 in the stunted lung development associated with exposure of newborn mouse pups to hyperoxia (85%O ), in a well-established animal model of BPD, has been addressed. Interleukin-10 gene expression was assessed in the lungs of hyperoxia-and normoxia-exposed (21%O2) mouse pups. Interleukin-10 gene expression slightly increased by P3 (by 12.7%), but dramatically decreased by P5 (by 400%) and remained downregulated at P14 (by 152.7%) by hyperoxia exposure. Interleukin-10 was administered (50 mug/kg; intraperitoneal) to newborn mouse pups daily for the first fourteen days of life. Stereological analysis of the lungs revealed no changes in mean septal wall thickness (10.6 +/- 1.3 mum, normoxia; 12.8 +/- 1.27 mum, hyperoxia; and 12.9 +/- 7.49 mum, IL-10-treated, hyperoxia-exposed pups), or in total alveoli number (3.3x106 +/- 0.29; normoxia; 1.8x106 +/- 1.13, hyperoxia; 1.85x106 +/- 0.27 in hyperoxia, IL-10-treated, hyperoxia-exposed pups). Efficient delivery of IL-10 to the lung was documented by IL-10-reporter gene expression, including Il8, Ifng, Tnfa, and Tnfr1b. These data demonstrate that hyperoxia exposure did impact lung IL-10 expression during aberrant post-natal lung maturation in the mouse, and that exogenous IL-10 application was unable to influence the stunted lung alveolarization, either indicating the need for an alternative dose, or that this therapeutic approach (systemic IL-10 administration) is not viable.

AB  - Caffeine is used for the treatment for apnoea of prematurity in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Oxygen supplementation is employed to manage BPD, but is deleterious to lung development, where patients exhibit lungs with fewer alveoli and increased alveolar septal wall thickness. It is not known whether caffeine impacts lung development per se. Therefore, the impact of caffeine (25 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal) administration on the structural development of the lung was assessed in a hyperoxiabased mouse model of BPD, together with the effects of caffeine on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling, a key modulator of lung development. Caffeine administration to newborn mouse pups prevented reductions in body mass provoked by hyperoxia exposure, and normalized Smad2 phosphorylation levels (assessed by immunoblot). However, caffeine administration had no demonstrable effect on lung structural development in experimental BPD, as assessed by stereology. Interesting, caffeine administration had parallel effects on TGF-beta receptor expression in primary lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, where expression of all three TGF-beta receptors, Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2, and Tgfbr3 was decreased, by 25%, 32%, and 58%, respectively, at the mRNA level (assessed by real-time RT-PCR); which was not observed in A549 cells, where Smad7 mRNA levels were reduced by 25%. These data highlight important differences between primary lung epithelial cells and the widely-used A549 immortalized lung epithelial cellline. In sum, these data indicate that while caffeine may be useful for the management of apnoea of prematurity, caffeine does not impact normal or aberrant lung development, despite effects on TGF-beta signalling.

AB  - Rationale: Forkhead box (Fox) proteins are transcription factors that play pivotal roles in the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. As such, key role for this group of transcription factors have been identified in embryonic development. To date, no study has addressed the role of Fox proteins in lung development. To this end, we have elected to examine a role for the forkhead box (Fox)O group of transcription factors in normal and aberrant lung alveolarization. Method(s): FoxO protein and gene expression was assessed by immunoblot and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. The phosphorylation of FoxO proteins was assessed by immunoblot. Result(s): Of the four FoxO proteins, only FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 expression was detected in the lung, where FoxO6 expression was not evident. Once the bulk alveolarization phase of lung development is mice was complete [at post-natal day (P)14)], a pronounced phosphorylation of FoxO1 was detected. This phosphorylation of FoxO1 was >50% reduced during blunted lung alveolarization after exposure of newborn mouse pups to normobaric hyperoxia (85% O2), in a widely-used mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that is characterized by arrested lung alveolarization. The total protein abundance of FoxO1 was also >30% decreased by hyperoxia exposure, while total protein levels of FoxO3 were unchanged. In contrast, the Ser253 phosphorylation of FoxO3, undertaken by Akt, was >20% increased after hyperoxia exposure. Conclusion(s): These data underscore potential roles for FoxO proteins as mediators of arrested alveolarization in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice.

AB  - Background: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by reduced alveoli and fibrosis. Prior studies of our group showed fibrosis in rat lungs after IUGR. Growth Hormone (GH) and Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) are important in development and dysregulated in cord blood of infants with IUGR. Aim(s): To investigate if (1) lung growth after IUGR is related to dysregulated lung GH/IGF1 signaling; and if (2) GH/IGF1 signaling is linked to neonatal lung fibroblast function. Method(s): (1) IUGR in Wistar rats was induced by isocaloric low protein diet during gestation. Lungs were obtained on embryonic day (E)21, postnatal day (P)3, and P23. (2) Cell culture: primary neonatal rat fibroblasts (PnF) were isolated from lungs of Control (Co-PnF) and IUGR (IUGR-PnF). Result(s): (1) E21: Lung GH mRNA was increased, GH-Receptor (GH-R) protein and Stat5 signaling were reduced; and lung IGF1 mRNA and IGF1-R signaling (Akt) were decreased in IUGR lungs. P23: increment of GH-R/IGF1-R protein was linked to active Akt and Stat5 in lungs after IUGR. Increased septal thickness after IUGR was related to higher PCNA/CyclinD1 protein (proliferation) and col1alpha1, elastin and alphaSMA mRNA. Serum IGF1, however, was reduced after IUGR. (2) GH/pStat5 signaling, PCNA and CyclinD1 protein were increased in IUGR-PnF. Both GH and IGF1 induced proliferation and migration of Control-PnF; only IGF1 had these effects on IUGR-PnF. Conclusion(s): Thus, we show a potential novel mechanism by which GH/IGF1 axis in lung fibroblasts could account for lung growth after IUGR. Those new insights offer potential new strategies to enable lung growth.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) may be a novel therapeutic option for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) by restoring alveolar development and preventing lung inflammation, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, but its role in BPD is unknown. Therefore, we determined the cardiopulmonary effects of BMP9 (2.5 mug/kg daily) in neonatal Wistar rats with BPD, exposed to 100% oxygen for 10 days. We investigated differential mRNA expression of the BMP9 receptor complex: activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), BMP receptor type 2 (BMPR2) and Endoglin and protein expression of the ALK1 downstream target transmembrane protein 100 (TMEM100). Parameters investigated included survival and lung and heart histopathology, vascular leakage, cytokine expression, and collagen and fibrin deposition. The effect of BMP9 (5 ng/ml) on inflammatory cytokine production was studied in endothelial cell cultures. ALK1, ALK2, BMPRII, TMEM100 and Endoglin were differentially expressed in experimental BPD. TMEM100 was expressed in the wall of blood vessels, showing an elastinlike expression pattern in arterioles. BMP9 treatment of experimental BPD improved alveolarization and reduced lung septal thickness, inflammation and collagen III deposition, but did not attenuate vascular remodelling and right ventricular hypertrophy. The anti-inflammatory effect of BMP9 was confirmed in vitro. Stimulation of human endothelial cell cultures with BMP9 reduced their oxidative stress-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine response. BMP9 attenuates alveolar enlargement, lung inflammation and fibrosis in neonatal rats with severe BPD, demonstrating its therapeutic potential for premature infants with BPD.

AB  - Lysyl oxidases are extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolizing enzymes with pathogenic roles in multiple diseases e.g. lung cancer fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Recently, ECM-independent roles for lysyl oxidases have been proposed, including chromatin remodelling and transcriptional regulation. We aimed to explore the gene regulatory roles for lysyl oxidases in primary mouse lung fibroblasts. The gene regulatory potential of three predominant lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2) was investigated using a microarray approach, small interfering (si)RNA knockdown and lentivirus-mediated over-expression. In order to determine whether the lysyl oxidase activity is required for transcriptional regulation, primary mouse lung fibroblasts were treated with lysyl oxidase inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and the transcriptome was analysed by microarray. Potential correlations with gene expression in vitro were made with gene expression in vivo, in mouse model of BPD. We report, for the first time a transcriptomewide analysis of gene regulation by lysyl oxidases. In the context of primary mouse lung fibroblasts, siRNA knockdown of Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 deregulated the expression of 134, 3,761 and 3,554 genes, respectively. Identified lysyl oxidases target-genes relevant to lung development and BPD included Mmp3, Mmp9, Eln, Rarres1, Gdf10, Ifnb1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl9. The expression of target-genes in vivo correlated with the lysyl oxidases expression in a mouse model of BPD. Moreover, using BAPN, we demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation by lysyl oxidases was independent of catalytic activity both in vitro and in vivo, which is of importance in targeting the lysyl oxidases in a therapeutic context.

AB  - Background and aims: BPD is the chronic lung disease of the newborn infant and is mainly caused by an inflammatory response of the immature lung to mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity. The members of the TNF-superfamily are known for their heterogeneous impact in different diseases. For BPD, FasL represents a major contributor to lung damage while in the absence of TNF-alpha the extent of inflammation and cell death induction is increased by an overweight of TGF-beta signaling. The role of TRAIL in the pathogenesis of BPD remains to be determined. Method(s): Wildtype (C57BL6) and TRAIL-/-(B6.129-tnfsf10tm1Mjs) mice were exposed to room air (21% O2) or 85% of oxygen from P1 to P8. Analyses include survival rates, lung histology, and determination of the extent of cell death induction and of inflammatory response. Result(s): Preliminary data show a trend of decreased survival rate for the TRAIL-/-mice. The lung histology showed fewer and larger alveoli and a higher density of inflammatory cells in the TRAIL-/-mice. The parameters of alveolar morphometry i.e. air space percentage and mean linear intercept showed a trend towards an increase in TRAIL-/-mice accompanied by reduced septal wall thickness and increased cellular density in the pulmonary interstitium in TRAIL-/-mice. Data on the extent in cell death induction and inflammation will be available at the time of poster presentation. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary results hint towards a role of the death inducing ligand TRAIL in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease of the newborn mouse exposed to hyperoxia. Our ongoing experiments are dedicated to separate the impact on the different compartments of the lung.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of premature infants, is characterised by thickened alveolar septa and decreased alveoli numbers. The mechanisms of BPD are not understood, however, an aberrant gene regulation is associated in part with deregulated microRNA function. Using a microRNA microarray, deregulated microRNA were identified in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD, and miR-135b was identified as a potential player in normal and aberrant lung development. Gene and protein expression was assessed using qPCR and immunoblot analysis. A miR-135b LacZ gene-trapped mouse strain was generated to localize miR-135b expression. In vivo, C57Bl/6 newborn mice, exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) for the first 14 days after birth, were injected (intraperitoneal) on post-natal day (P)1 and P3 with antagomiR (10 mg/kg) against miR-135b. Primary mouse lung cell screening demonstrated a pronounced expression of miR-135b in alveolar epithelial type II cells. Exposing miR-135b LacZ trapped mice to 85% O2 revealed high expression of miR-135b in the septa in situ, by LacZ staining. Smad5 was identified as a miR-135b target. Downregulation of Smad5 expression was observed after 85% O2 exposure, and after antagomiR administration, Smad5 expression was completely restored under 85% O2 conditions. By stereological analysis, antagomiR treatment against miR-135b under 85% O2 conditions demonstrated a moderate improving in alveoli number and alveolar density, implying miR-135b as a player in aberrant lung development. The restoration of Smad5 expression after antagomiR treatment implicates transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling in the miR-135b pathway during lung development.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature neonates characterized by arrested lung alveolarization. MicroRNAs (miR) are poorly understood in the context of BPD. Here, a miR microarray on mouse lungs exposed to normoxia (21% O ) or hyperoxia (85% O ) revealed an up-regulation of the miR-34a expression (at least 1.5-fold at all time-points) in mouse lungs maintained under hyperoxic conditions. Mice treated with an antagomiR-34a almost doubled the total number of alveoli (2.1 +/- 0.4 x 10 ) and normalized the mean septal wall thickness (10.1 +/- 2.3 mum) under hyperoxic conditions compared to the number of alveoli (1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10 ) and septal wall thickness (17.8 +/- 3.9 mum) assessed by stereology in mice injected with scrambled antagomiR (SCR). Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)alpha, a target of miR-34a, has been reported to be crucial for myofibroblast transdifferentiation and normal lung alveolarization. Isolated PDGFRalpha cells by flow cytometry from mouse lungs exposed to 85% O for the first five days of life revealed an up-regulation of the miR-34a expression (3-fold). Mice injected with two target-site blockers, to block the miR-34a/Pdgfra mRNA interaction, increased the total number of alveoli (1.7 +/- 0.2 x 10 ) and normalized the septal wall thickness (11.6 +/- 1.2 mum) under hyperoxic conditions compared to the number of alveoli (1.3 +/- 0.1 x 10 ) and septal wall thickness (13.9 +/- 1.4 mum) observed in SCR-treated mice. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-34a partially restored the total number of alveoli and normalised the septal wall thickness in mouse lungs maintained under hyperoxic conditions.

AB  - Transglutaminases (TGMs) are extracellular matrix remodelling enzymes with roles in multiple diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Gene and protein expressions of TGMs are deregulated in experimental and clinical BPD. To study their causal function in normal and aberrant lung development, the activity of TGMs was inhibited in developing mouse pups in hyperoxia-based experimental model of BPD and alveolar structure and lung function were assessed. Newborn mouse were exposed to normoxic (21% O ) or hyperoxic (85% O ) conditions and concomitantly treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of cysteamine, an inhibitor of TGM activity. Developing mice were evaluated for lung function on postnatal day (P)7, P10 and P14 using whole body plethysmography. Mice were sacrificed on P14 and lung structure was assessed using a state-of-art stereology method. Exposure of developing mouse lungs to hyperoxia decreased the number of alveoli in the lung (2.7+/-0.4x10 vs. 5.1+/-1.3x10 ) and increased the mean linear intercept (MLI) (64.7+/-3.7mum vs. 31.3+/-3.3 mum). Treatment with cysteamine significantly decreased the MLI in hyperoxia-exposed animals (53.1+/-2.7mum vs. 64.7+/-3.7mum) although no significant improvement in the number of alveoli was observed. Hyperoxia exposure had a profound impact on lung function in developing mice. No rescue of lung function was observed following cysteamine treatment. However, cysteamine-treated, normoxia-exposed mice exhibited a significant increase in tidal volume, expiratory volume and peak expiratory flow on P14 when compared to vehicle-treated normoxia-exposed mice. Our data indicate that TGMs may play a role in processes of both normal and aberrant lung development.

AB  - Rationale: Neonatal chronic lung disease, i.e. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) determines long-term pulmonary and neurologic development. Early markers are urgently needed for timely diagnosis and personalized treatment. Objective(s): The prospective study determined structural and functional changes in the preterm lung at the time of diagnosis and identified early disease markers by proteome screening in plasma in the first week of life. Method(s): 40 infants (27.7 +/- 2.09 wks, 984 +/- 332 g) were included for advanced MRI measurements (3-Tesla) and complemented by infant lung function testing (ILFT) in spontaneously breathing infants. Plasma samples were processed for proteomic screening by SOMAscanTM. Key findings were confirmed in an independent study cohort. Statistical analysis used penalized and Poisson regression analysis; for protein analysis confounder effects were subtracted by lasso regression. Result(s): Statistical analysis confirmed a high correlation of MRI and lung function variables and identified a pattern characterizing changes in the lungs of preterm infants by T2- and T1-weighed image analysis and lung volume measurements as well as ILFT. Functional enrichment analysis in proteome screening results showed overrepresentation of the GO categories 'immune function', 'extracellular matrix', 'cellular proliferation/ migration', 'organ development' and 'angiogenesis' in infants with BPD in the first week of life. A panel of three proteins was identified out of these with high sensitivity and specificity for BPD. Conclusion(s): We identified a structural pattern characterizing BPD by advanced MRI confirmed by ILFT. The identified development in the first week of life enabled personalized treatment strategies.

AB  - AIMS: This study set out to assess indications, feasibility, complications, and clinical outcome of percutaneous transcatheter device closure of atrial septal defects (ASDs) in infants with a bodyweight below 10 kg., METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective single center chart and echocardiography review study from 8/2005-12/2013. Twenty-eight children with ASD (13 female) with a median age of 1.15 years (0.2-2.8) and a median weight of 7.2 kg (4.5-9.9) were analyzed. Indications for early ASD closure were failure to thrive (n = 15, 54%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with supplemental oxygen dependency (n = 7, 25%), and genetic syndromes with suspected pulmonary hypertension (n = 12, 43%). Device implantation was successful in all patients without any periprocedural mortality or major complication. Clinical outcome after a median follow-up period of 2.1 years (0.25-7.3) revealed no residual shunt and a significant decrease of right ventricular volume load. Patients with pulmonary hypertension experienced a significant reduction of pulmonary artery/RV pressure. Patients also showed decreased supplemental oxygen dependency and less cardiac medications, but no significant "catch-up growth" in those with failure to thrive., CONCLUSION: Interventional ASD closure in children weighing less than 10 kg can be performed without any additional major risks and shows a favorable outcome, especially in selected patients with significant non cardiac co-morbidities.

AB  - Premature neonates with immature lungs often require supplemental oxygen for survival. Hyperoxic exposure in neonates results in impaired formation of alveoli and lung vasculature that is characteristic of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which can have long term consequences for the development of the respiratory and nervous systems. We have shown that hyperoxia reduces levels of Rev-erbalpha, a transcriptional repressor and circadian regulator of metabolism, in the mouse lung. We hypothesized that reduction of Rev-erbalpha expression would alter metabolism in a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model of hyperoxic exposure. In order to determine changes in metabolic function and utilization of key substrates resulting from loss of Rev-erbalpha, we exposed WT and Rev-erbalpha KO MEFs to either air or hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) for 24 hours. Control cells were exposed to air for 24 hours. Mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis, and substrate utilization were then determined using a Seahorse XF24 Bioanalyzer. Additionally, a 4 day growth curve was performed in air to determine differences in cell proliferation. Rev-erbalpha KO MEFs exposed to hyperoxia exhibited increased oxidative respiration and glycolysis compared to WT cells. Substrate utilization experiments showed that immediately following hyperoxic exposure, Rev-erbalpha KO MEFs were less dependent on glutamine and fatty acids, but had a higher capacity to metabolize glucose. Rev-erbalpha KO MEFs exhibit a higher basal rate of growth in air compared to WT. In conclusion, disruption of Rev-erbalpha in MEFs resulted in increased glycolysis and higher levels of proliferation. We speculate that these changes may render the cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress and less viable. We will test this using protein carbonyls as a measurement of oxidative stress levels and clonogenic assays as a measurement of cell survival.

AB  - Introduction: Therapeutic oxygen contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibitor aurothioglucose (ATG) is protective in our murine BPD model. Improved lung structure in ATG-treated newborn mice was associated with enhanced nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation. TrxR1 inhibitors also enhance glutathione (GSH) levels in models of acute lung injury. Hypothesis: The present studies tested the hypothesis that ATG enhances GSH-mediated antioxidant defenses in neonatal lungs. Method(s): Newborn C3H/HeN mice were dosed with 25mg/kg ATG or saline (SA) i.p. within 12 h of birth and exposed to room air (RA) or hyperoxia (HO, 85% O2). Lung glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (Gclc) and modifier (Gclm) subunit levels were assessed by qRT-PCR. Total and oxidized GSH (GSSG) levels were determined by Tietze recycling assay. Data (n=3-6) were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc. Result(s): At 24 h, Gclm levels were not different between groups. Gclc levels were 2-fold greater in HO:ATG vs RA:SA (p=0.0456). By 72 h, independent effects of ATG and hyperoxia were detected for Gclm and Gclc. Gclm levels were 1.6-fold higher in HO:ATG vs RA:SA (p=0.0016) and Gclc levels were 2.4 fold greater in HO:ATG vs RA:SA (p=0.0182). At 72 h, total GSH was 1.3 fold greater in HO:SA (p=0.0206) and 1.7 fold greater in HO:ATG (p=0.0002) vs RA:SA. Total GSH levels in HO:ATG lungs were 1.3 fold higher than RA:ATG (p<0.05). At 7d, total GSH was 1.5-fold higher in HO:ATG (p=0.0447) vs RA:SA. There was no effect of HO or ATG on GSSG at any time point. Conclusion(s): In HO-exposed newborn pups, ATG enhanced Gclm, Gclc and lung GSH levels. Given the importance of GSH-mediated antioxidant responses in protection against HO, we speculate that enhanced de novo GSH synthesis may be a mechanism by which ATG improves lung development in our model. TrxR1 inhibitors such as ATG, which increase NRF2-dependent responses and enhance GSH-mediated antioxidant responses, may represent a novel therapy to decrease BPD development.

AB  - Thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibition activates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) and attenuates lung injury in a murine bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is regulated by NRF2, although not exclusively. We have observed disproportionate increases in HO-1 levels in vivo and in vitro following TrxR1 inhibition; however, the role of NRF2 in HO-1 induction by TrxR1 inhibitors is unclear. To test the hypothesis that TrxR1 inhibition induces HO-1 via NRF2-dependent mechanisms, NRF2 knockout (KO) murine transformed club cells (mtCCs) were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and NRF2 deletion confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot. Cells were treated with 0.5 mu M of the TrxR1 inhibitor, auranofin (AFN), or control (DMSO) for 3h and lysates were collected. TrxR1 activity was determined by insulin disulfide reductase assay. HO-1 mRNA and protein expression were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Data (n=5-6) were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc (p<0.05). In KO mtCCs, baseline TrxR1 activity was 50% lower than that in wild type (WT) cells. AFN treatment decreased TrxR1 activity by 50% compared to respective control-treated WT and KO cells. In AFN-treated WT mtCCs, Hmox1 levels were 30-fold greater than in control cells. This corresponded with a 75-fold increase in HO-1 protein expression. In AFN-treated KO cells, we detected only a 2-fold increase in Hmox1; however, no increase in HO-1 protein was detected. To confirm that the KO mtCCs are able to generate Hmox1 and HO-1, WT and KO mtCCs were treated with hemin (5 mu M), a NRF2-independent HO-1 inducer, or DMSO control for 8h. In hemin-treated mtCCs, Hmox1 levels were increased 5-fold in both WT and KO mtCCs when compared to their respective controls. Compared to their respective controls, HO-1 protein levels were increased 15-fold in WT and 5-fold in KO cells. Our data suggest that NRF2 is the primary mechanism by which AFN increases HO-1 in mtCCs. HO-1 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target to prevent BPD. Future studies will investigate the role of NRF2 in HO-1 induction in the lung in vivo and the contribution of HO-1 to the protective effects of TrxR1 inhibitors in our BPD model.

AB  - Purpose: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) has been proposed as a biomarker to diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) in preterm infants (PI) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The relationship between NTproBNP, gestational age (GA) and the timing of increase in the course of BPD associated PH (BPD-PH) is not well documented. The purpose of this study was to compare NTproBNP values in PI with BPD-PH detected by ECHO and in infants with and without BPD at 28, 32 and 36 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). Method(s): After IRB approval and obtaining maternal consents, PI (birth weight<1500 gm &<30 week GA) were included. Infants with known chromosomal anomalies or congenital defects affecting cardiorespiratory system were excluded. PH was defined as ECHO [Table Presented] findings of pulmonary artery pressures>30 mm Hg estimated by tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, presence of right ventricular hyper-trophy and/or flattened interventricular septum. Infants were divided into 3 groups for analyses: BPD group (infants requiring oxygen and/or respiratory support at 36 weeks' CGA with no evidence of PH by ECHO), BPD-PH group (infants requiring oxygen and/or respiratory support at 36 weeks' CGA with ECHO evidence of PH), and no-BPD group (infants not requiring oxygen and/or respiratory support at 36 weeks' CGA with no evidence of PH by ECHO). NTproBNP levels were obtained and ECHO was performed on all subjects at 28, 32 & 36 weeks' CGA. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS procedures that included general linear models, repeated measures analysis of variance and logistic modeling for receiver operator curve (ROC) generation. Result(s): Fifty-four infants were enrolled in the study. The mean GA and birth weight was 27.036 1.06 days and 926 6263.7 kg respectively. Eight infants were in the BPD-PH group, 28 were in BPD group and 16 were in no-BPD group. The mean NTproBNP values in the BPD-PH vs BPD group at 28 weeks' CGA was 780565933 vs 1686 61968 pg/ml (P<0.05) and in the BPD vs no-BPD group was 168661968 vs 7036 509 pg/ml (P<0.05). These relationships persisted at 32 and 36 weeks' CGA (Table 1). In a repeated measures analyses of variance general linear model that included GA and NTproBNP values at 28, 32, and 36 weeks' CGA, BPD-PH vs BPD remained significantly associated with NTproBNP values, although the NTproBNP values for BPD-PH did not change significantly over time. ROC curves generated for NTproBNP values at 28 weeks provided a cut-point of 2,329 pg/ml for BPD-PH detection (sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 95%) and a cut-point of 578 pg/ml for BPD detection (sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 68%) (Figure 1). Conclusion(s): NTproBNP appears to be a good screening tool to determine the onset of BPD-PH as early as 28 weeks' CGA in PI.

AB  - Research objective: to evaluate the influence of the form, fetal age and weight on a birth date, comorbidity on the severity of the Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), calculated in points due to the results of the Computer Tomography (CT) of the chest organs. Mild disease scored 1-5 points, moderately-6-10 points and severely-11-15 points. Examined 65 patients with BPD from 2 month old to 3 years included, who had points from 2,0 to 15,0, which is in average 8,2+/-0,35 points. Children with classic form of BPD (n=25) have total points certain more than the same for the children with the new form of BPD (n=40): 9,0+/-0,6 vs 7,7+/-0,4 points, p<0,05. Course of BPD for the children with the gestational age at the date of birth less than 28 weeks (n=39) was more hard than in the group of children with the gestational age 28-32 weeks (n=15): 9,0+/-0,4 vs 7,4+/-0,6 points, p<0,05. Course of BPD for the children with the weight status at the date of birth less than 1000g (n=34) was more hard (8,8+/-0,5 points) than for children with the weight status from 1000 to 1500g (n=17) (7,2+/-0,6 points), p<0, 05. Course of BPD for the children with coexisting Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) (n=13) was more hard than in the group without the disease (n=39): 9,6+/-0,9 vs 7,3+/-0,35 points, p<0,02. In the group of patients with BPD complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH) (n=15) severe course of BPD was more frequent vs the group without PH (n=39) and was 9,8 +/-0,8 points, p<0005. Separated analysis of the morbidity of BPD for the children with the classic and new form of the disease confirmed the links clinically defined for BPD in general. The morbidity of BPD was higher during the CT in the age before 6 month old in comparison with the morbidity defined for the children scan by CT after 2 years old. Conclusion(s): Have been discovered to date that moderate form of BPD dominates each for classic and new forms of BPD. Course of the classic for of BPD staying to be more severe. Factors which are making the course of BPD more severe are the fetal age less than 28 weeks at the birth date, weight less than 1000 g at the birth date, coexisting PDA and PH. For the identification of the maximum BPD severity is reasonable to use the method of the numerical score of the CT results of the chest organs in the age before 6 month.

AB  - Generation and regeneration of the neonatal lung is critical in the treatment of pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with developmental lung disease. In order to generate diverse lung lineages, multipotent lung progenitor cells must simultaneously express genes for multiple specific lineages. For progenitor cell commitment to occur, cell-specific transcriptional networks must be activated, and simultaneously, alternative fate gene expression must also be switched off, processes that are currently poorly understood for alveolar epithelial cell fate. Formation of the alveolus, the functional unit of gas exchange in the lung, entails appropriate differentiation of the alveolar epithelium into a type 1 (AT1) or type 2 (AT2) alveolar epithelial cell and maturation of a juxtaposed capillary plexus. Of note, disruption of this process, results in developmental lung disease such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a disease frequently associated with PH. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms of alveolar epithelial cell fate may provide critical insight into reinitiating lung growth in developmental lung disease and PH. Recently, we prospectively identified a pool of AT2 cells that primarily contributes to lung growth and regeneration. Separately, we have also determined that commitment to the alveolar epithelial lineage occurs much earlier in development than previously recognized. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this cell fate is regulated by a transcriptional repressor, called Hopx, and the activating transcription factor, b-catenin. These preliminary results suggest a new paradigm for lung alveolar development, where alveolar epithelial cells are specified in the early stages of lung development. In addition, these findings suggest an additional layer of regulation in switching off alternative fate gene expression in cell commitment. Unraveling these mechanisms will provide critical insight into reinitiating lung growth in developmental lung disease. Similarly, understanding the regulation and coordination of alveolar epithelial plasticity will help drive new potential therapies in neonatal and adult lung regeneration.

AB  - The proper development of both human and murine lungs relies on a precise temporal-spatial expression of growth factors including WNT, FGF, and TGF-beta family of ligands. Among these, Tgf-beta family is well known for its functions in relation to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which play key roles not only during development but also during tumor growth. Sex is a risk factor in several human lung diseases. Male infants have higher risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as compared to females and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has higher incidence and worse outcome in male patients than in female patients. Sex hormones have been shown to modulated the severity of lung disease in animal models. For instance, the male hormone androgen exacerbates the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in female mice. Herein, we have induced the activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway specifically in embryonic lung epithelium by crossing Ca-Tgf-beta-r1-Stopfl/fl (Constitutively active Tgf-beta-receptor-1) female mice with Ttf1-Cre male mice which produced a complex and lethal phenotype only in male fetuses. The phenotype displayed by the mutant male resembles the bronchopulmonary dysplasia disease displayed by human preterm infants and was not compatible with life. In contrast, mutant females were viable and showed either a weak phenotype or no phenotype at all. The lung epithelium of the mutant males showed increased number of progenitor Sox9 positive cells and genetic deletion of one allele of the Sox9 gene significantly reduced the severity of the phenotype in mutant male mice. Transcriptome profiling delivered important insights on the mechanism responsible for the lung phenotype in mutant male animals. Among the genes deregulated in the mutant male lung we recognized genes already known to be critical for the lung physiopathology such as Spock2 and Amantsl2 which are implicated to the pathogenesis of BPD in human and bronchial dysplasia in mice, respectively , Adamts18 which is a critical regulator of murine lung development and Adamdec1 which is over-expressed in patients with sarcoidosis. Finally, we showed that injection of estrogen in pregnant female mice was able to reverse the phenotype in the male lungs which suggests a hormonal dependency of the phenotype in the lung of the transgenic male mice. In conclusion, we have established a novel male sex-specific model of the TGF-beta signaling pathway that will be useful in studying how male sex can adversely affects lung development as well as neonatal pulmonary diseases in humans and to identify the sex-specific signaling pathways that give to male patients bearing lung diseases a prognostic disadvantage compared to female patients.

AB  - Preterm infants are born with an underdeveloped lung that is unable to meet their tissues' oxygen demand. Standard care of these infants requires enrollment into neonatal intensive care units and the use of mechanical ventilation (MV) which is known to expose the developing lung to altered mechanical forces. Even with recent therapies, MV can result in alveolar injury and long-term pulmonary issues. The most common complication associated with MV is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). MV induced BPD is characterized by the presence of fewer, enlarged alveoli indicating a failure of the alveoli to undergo septation. A common co-morbidity occurring in one-third of BPD diagnoses is pulmonary hypertension (PH), which has a three-year mortality rate of 75%. Unfortunately, new therapies for BPD and PH are hindered, as current models are unable to study mechanical forces in an intact organ; therefore, the genetic pathways linking altered mechanical forces to cellular behaviors remain largely unknown in the developing lung. We have created a novel, microfluidic, ex vivo organ culture platform that enables longterm culture of neonatal mouse lung explants. In this device, the trachea of the explant is intubated and the organ vasculature cannulated with custom fabricated microneedles. Each compartment is connected to separate pump systems allowing for independent control of cyclic airway ventilation and vascular perfusion during culture. The culture model was validated by quantification of explant ventilation and serial perfusion of dye throughout the vasculature. Histological analysis of lungs cultured in our device over 48 hours show increased alveolar septation compared to bath cultured samples. Additionally, the septation of lungs culture in our ex vivo device more closely resemble that of age-matched, in vivo, sibling controls. Similarly, EdU staining demonstrates uniform cellular proliferation throughout a lung lobe in device cultured explants compared to an absence of proliferation in the central one-half lobe volume in explants cultured using traditional methods. This microfluidic culture platform enables future studies to directly quantify the dynamics of alveolar morphogenesis. Additionally, combining this model with pharmacological interventions and established genetic methods can elucidate the role of mechanotransduction pathways in BPD and PH and allow for the development of adjuvant therapies for infants undergoing mechanical ventilation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common serious complication of preterm birth. Mechanical ventilation is a significant contributing factor to the aetiology of BPD. Various treatments have been investigated using animal models however, none of these are as effective as anticipated when tested clinically1. Spontaneous repair of lung injury following O2 exposure has been observed in ratmodels thus limiting their clinical relevance2. Our aimwas to investigate spontaneous repair of lung tissue following ventilation induced lung injury (VILI). Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated for 4 hours at post-natal day (PND) 9 with a tidal volume of 9 ml/kg and a positive end expiratory pressure of 2 cmH20. Four treatment groups (n=2/group) were used. Lungs were pressure fixed and collected immediately following ventilation or following a 12-day recovery period in room air at PND 21. Lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and measurements of mean linear intercept (MLI) and air fraction were performed using a novel algorithm to assess alveolarization. No observable difference was seen in air fraction for the ventilated group at PND 9 compared to the control group however, at PND 21 the air fraction was higher suggesting an increase in air space of the ventilated lung. MLI of the PND 9 and PND 21 ventilated groups were higher than the control groups suggesting larger alveolar size post-ventilation. Preliminary data generated in this pilot study suggests that there is no spontaneous repair of lung tissue following VILI.

AB  - Introduction: Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 24 weeks gestation presents women with a dilemma when considering expectant management versus elective termination. The prognosis of neonatal survival varies worldwide due to differences in medical practice. To counsel patients appropriately, we aim to provide centre-based outcome data on obstetric and neonatal complications following expectantly managed previable PPROM. Method(s): We collected data on 164 consecutive pregnancies complicated by PPROM before 24 weeks gestation over a 7 year period in a single tertiary institution. These were women who delivered >24 h after membrane rupture, and had no signs of chorioamnionitis or advanced labour at admission. The descriptive statistics of obstetrics and neonatal outcomes were reported. Result(s): The overall neonatal survival to discharge rate was 33.8%. Stratification of patients into early (12 to 19 + 6 weeks gestation) and late previable PPROM (20 to 23 + 6 weeks gestation) revealed a 3.6 fold increase in survival rate in the latter group (12.2% vs 43.8%, p < 0.001). Previable PPROM following amniocentesis predicted a 100% survival outcome; however, anhydramnios impacted negatively. The most common neonatal morbidities were respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The most common maternal morbidities were chorioamnionitis, retained products of conception and preterm labour. Discussion(s): Later gestational ages at PPROM were associated with better survival rates, although neonatal morbidity remained high. Women experiencing previable PPROM following amniocentesis can be reassured, while those with anhydramnios at any time during the latency period should be adequately counselled regarding poorer outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a main chronic lung disease commonly occurs in preterm infants. BPD is characterized by impaired alveolarization and vascularization of the developing lung. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway is known to play an important role during lung vascular development. In the present study, we examined whether the regulation of TGF-beta-ALK-Smad signaling pathway influence on the disruption of pulmonary vascular development in newborn rats as hyperoxia-induced BPD model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newborn rats were continuously exposed to 21% or 85% O2 for 7 days, and subsequently kept in normoxic condition for another 14 days. Lung tissues harvested at each time point were evaluated for the expression of TGF-beta1, ALK1, ALK5, phosphorylated Smad1/5, phosphorylated Smad2/3, VEGF, and endoglin, as accessed by both biochemical and immunohistological analyses., RESULTS: Double-fluorescence immunohistochemical staining indicated these molecules were mainly expressed in pulmonary endothelial cells. The expression of TGF-beta1 and ALK5 mRNA and protein were significantly increased in D5 hyperoxia group, while that of ALK1 mRNA and protein were significantly decreased. The level of phosphorylated Smad1/5 was significantly decreased in D7 hyperoxia group, whereas that of phosphorylated Smad2/3 was oppositely increased. In addition, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA was increased at D1 with subsequent decrease in D7 hyperoxia group. There was no significantly difference in endoglin expression in entire experimental period., CONCLUSION: These results indicate that exposure to hyperoxia altered the balance between TGF-beta-ALK1-Smad1/5 and TGF-beta-ALK5-Smad2/3 pathways in pulmonary endothelial cells, which may ultimately lead to the development of BPD.

AB  - Background. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a serious pulmonary disease in premature infants, is the consequence of the complex interaction of various perinatal and postnatal factors. Early identification of risk factors allows the implementation of possible preventive strategies. Objective. Determining perinatal risk factors for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants < 32 weeks of gestational age. Materials and metods. This study enrolled 153 newborns < 32 weeks of gestational age. BPD was defined as a need for additional oxygen at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. Details including gestational age, sex, birth weight, prenatal steroids, chorioamnionitis, Apgar score, hypotension, pH, excess base (BE) after birth, surfactant treatment, ventilatory support, days of postnatal oxygen requirement, early and late onset sepsis, air leaks, patency of ductus arteriosus, IL-6 in first six hours after birth were colected. The enzyme immunoassay technique Quantikine R & D System was used for the determination of the IL-6 levels. Conclusions. In our cohort of infants GA < 32 weeks exposure to perinatal inflammation increases the risk for early neonatal death but not for BPD. However, low gestational age, need for resuscitation, hypotension, mechanical ventilation, and late onset sepsis were major risk factors for BPD development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a pulmonary complication of pre-mature birth. BPD occurs in premature infants experiencing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated with mechanical ventilation (MV), resulting in an inflammatory condition characterized by diverse radiographic findings and histologically by fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy in the pulmonary tissues. In this case, we describe unique radiographic sequelae of BPD manifesting in adulthood. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old Caucasian female with history of premature birth, supported with MV, presented to her primary care physician for a retirement physical. She endorsed mild dyspnea on exertion, but denied chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath at rest. On physical exam, lungs were clear bilaterally with good air movement in all fields. Chest radiograph was normal except a 6mm nodular density noted in the right lower lobe. A non-contrast computed tomography scan of the chest was performed revealing a 2mm calcified granuloma. In addition, there were global, mild, and uniform paraseptal emphysematous changes throughout the pleural surfaces of the lungs and the fissures. Pulmonary work up including spirometry, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was normal. DISCUSSION: The long term sequelae of BPD is heterogeneous and depends on the initial degree of insult. MV of the premature infant in the setting of RDS is the predominant risk factor. Mild-moderate BPD may have no long-term effects with normal to only mildly obstructed spirometry; these patients typically go on to have normal chest radiographs by adolescence. More severe cases may demonstrate bronchial wall thickening, air trapping, lung cysts, linear interstitial opacities and emphysema. Case series suggest infants with BPD have more frequent airway hyperreactivity in adulthood and may have increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Our patient presented with minimal symptoms, a history of MV during premature infancy and a novel, bilateral paraseptal emphysematous pattern without other underlying etiology suggesting BPD as the cause. Prevention in premature infants is key to management of this disease and centers on minimizing airway pressures during MV, antenatal glucocorticoids and exogenous surfactant therapy. CONCLUSION(S): The sequela of BPD infrequently persists into adulthood. We postulate that the diffuse and symmetric paraseptal emphysema in this adult patient with no other pulmonary risk factors is a previously undescribed manifestation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia as a premature infant.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe chronic lung disease of preterm infants with grave short-and long-term consequences. To date there is no effective and safe therapy in clinical use. We recently showed that prophylactic treatment with interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) prevents development of murine BPD. We assess whether delayed onset and higher dose of (IL-1Ra) treatment, and a second antiinflammatory agent, protein C (PC), prevent BPD. Method(s): Murine BPD was induced by perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia. Pups received daily injections of vehicle, 1200 IU/kg PC, 10 mg/kg IL?1Ra (early or late onset) or 100 mg/kg IL-1Ra. Result(s): 10 mg/kg IL-1Ra prevented BPD more effectively than treatment with 100 mg/kg IL-1Ra, but only when treatment commenced at day 1 of life (compared to controls 28% reduction in alveolar size, 34% increase in alveolar number and 21% increase in surface area-to-volume ratio). There was a nonsignificant trend to reduced BPD severity with PC (up to 18% increase in alveolar number and lung surface area, 18% decrease in alveolar size). IL?1?, IL-1Ra, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1, IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 emerged as main targets in the PC-regulated pulmonary immune response (downregulation by up to 89?fold). Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that prophylactic treatment with low-dose IL-1Ra is necessary to prevent BPD. Moreover, as IL-1Ra and PC employ different mechanisms of action, combined IL-1Ra and PC treatment might deliver enhanced benefits over IL-1Ra alone.

AB  - Introduction: BPD is a chronic respiratory disease in premature infants, resulting from perinatal inflammation and postnatal oxygen treatment. Infants with BPD have impaired lung development and greater risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which reduces survival in infants by up to 75%. Validated mouse models mimicking key features of BPD-associated PAH are required to identify potential new therapies. Aim(s): To characterise changes in markers of vascular remodelling and reactivity in intrapulmonary arteries in a "double-hit" mouse model known to induce alveolar dysruption (Nold et al., PNAS, 2013), and airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness (Royce et al., AJRCMB, 2016), consistent with BPD. Method(s): Following in utero exposure to lipopolysaccharide, neonatal C57BL6 pups were randomized to 21% oxygen (air) or 65% oxygen (hyperoxia) exposure for 4 weeks, for comparison with age-matched naive mice. Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane, then killed by cervical dislocation. Lung sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), endothelin receptor-A (ETA) and caveolin-1 as markers of increased contraction. Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared to assess vasoconstriction to endothelin-1 and the thromboxane mimetic, U46619. Result(s): Hyperoxia did not alter vascular expression of alpha-SMA (pixel count x 108/area: air 3.5 +/- 0.5 n = 15; hyperoxia 3.7 +/- 0.4 n = 20, NS), ETA (n = 13, 19, NS) or caveolin-1 (n = 15, 21, NS). In PCLS, endothelin-1 and U46619 elicited artery contraction in PCLS in all groups (max % reduction in area to U46619: naive 34 +/- 4% n = 5; air 33 +/- 14% n = 4; hyperoxia 42 +/- 12% n = 3). Conclusion(s): At the 4-week time point, this model of BPD does not induce vascular remodeling or evidence of increased contraction of intrapulmonary arteries to vasoconstrictors ex vivo. Alternative models or later time points may be required to validate conditions that establish BPDassociated PAH to enable assessment of new treatments to reduce morbidity and mortality in premature infants.

AB  - In recent years, directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has rapidly become a major focus of regenerative medicine to help address the shortcomings of pulmonary therapeutics or transplantation. Specific efforts have focused on endoderm-derived lung epithelium tissue regeneration, while mesoderm-derived tissues in the lungs -such as non-circulating hematopoietic lineages- have received minimal attention. This oversight in pulmonary stem cell regenerative medicine has led to a failure to appropriately address the importance of the innate immune system of the lungs; particularly it's most abundant population of airway cells, the alveolar macrophage (AM). We have established a protocol for generating AMs from murine PSCs under serum-free, feeder free, factor defined conditions (AMs are highly adapted phagocytic cells of the pulmonary innate immune system that represent the primary hematopoietic cells of the airways and are distinct of myeloid cells). The identity of PSC-AMs was phenotypically confirmed via co-expression F4/80: CD11c: Siglec F and functionally characterized by their ability to phagocytose and to remain functionally active in healthy, injured and injury-resolving mice lungs, without an obvious compromise in immune response. Furthermore, the PSC-AM remained viable in culture for several months using expansion and maintenance media. The PSC-AMs display bactericidal effects to various common pathogenic bacteria - including E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. Moreover, in a rodent model of E. coli-derived pulmonary sepsis, intratracheal-delivered PSC-AMs internalize live E. coli and reduce the number of airway neutrophils. Noting the therapeutic value of these functional macrophages, we also genetically modified the cells to constitutively express the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and/or the protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin. These advances in therapeutically scalable and functionally active stem PSC-AMs for pulmonary disease represent a novel non-pharmacological approach addressing the unmet needs of a variety of chronic airway diseases where innate immunity is insufficient or compromised including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic disease of extreme prematurity that has serious long-term consequences including asthma. We earlier reported that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) as a potent inhibitor of murine BPD. We determined whether airway remodelling and hyperresponsiveness are evident in this model, and whether IL-1Ra is protective. Method(s): Pregnant C57BL/6 J dams received 150?g/kg LPS at 14 d gestation. Within 24 h of birth, pups were randomized to normoxia (N, 21% O2) or hyperoxia (H, 65% O2), and treated daily with IL-1Ra or saline for 28 days. Lung sections were analysed for alveolar changes, epithelial thickening, subepithelial collagen and expression of?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA). Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared to visualise changes in intrapulmonary airway area to methacholine (MCh) by phase-contrast microscopy. Result(s): Hyperoxic mice developed a severe BPD-like lung disease (60% fewer alveoli, 4-fold increase in alveolar size). Epithelial thickness, subepithelial collagen and?-SMA expression increased following hyperoxia. MCh elicited contraction with similar potency in both groups, but increased maximum reduction following hyperoxia (N 44%; H 89%). IL-1Ra prevented BPD and reduced epithelial/subepithelial changes and?-SMA expression but did not prevent increased contraction to MCh. Conclusion(s): Our study is the first to demonstrate ex vivo airway hyperreactivity in murine BPD and reveals further preclinical mechanistic insights of IL-1Ra as a treatment for BPD.

AB  - Background: Intra-tracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle has been shown to significantly improve pulmonary status in animals and in a pilot study in preterm infants with RDS. The effect of this therapy on preventing the development of BPD has not been well studied. Methods and Materials: Before the study was conducted in neonate, an in-vitro study to assess and to assure the biophysical and chemical stability of surfactant/ budesonide mixture was carried out using surfactometer and HPLC. A randomized controlled trial comprised 265 VLBW infants with severe radiographic RDS who required mechanical ventilation (FIO2 >= 0.5) shortly after birth. Of these infants, 131 received survanta (S) (100 mg/kg) and budesonide (B) (0.25 mg/kg) (S+B gr.) and 134 received S only (100 mg/kg) (S gr.). The sample size was determined based on the hypothesis that 60% of infants in the control group and 40% of infants in the treated group would die or develop BPD defined at 34 weeks postmenstrual age. Result(s): The S+B and S groups were comparable in B.W. (Mean +/- SD; 882 +/- 249 vs 935 +/- 283 g), G.A. (26.5 +/- 2.2 vs 26.8 +/- 2.2 weeks), and in baseline cardiopulmonary status at the age of entry into the study (2.0 +/- 1.5 vs 1.8 +/- 1.6 hours). The S+B group had a sign. lower incidence of BPD (29% vs 50%, p = 0.008) and of BPD or death (42% vs 66%, p = 0.001) than the S group. Compared with the S group, the S+B had sign. lower levels of tracheal aspirate interleukins (IL) (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8), a lower OI, lower MAP for ventilation in the early course of therapy, a higher chance to wean to room air (p = 0.03), and a lower probability of requiring assisted O2 therapy(Nasal Flow, CPCP, IMV. HFOV) (p = 0.02). No significant immediate and long term (2-3 years) adverse effects were observed in treated infants. *NICHD criteria Conclusion(s): In VLBW infants with severe RDS, administration of surfactant/budesonide significantly decreases the incidence of BPD and or death with no apparent adverse side effects (Table Presented).

AB  - Background: Hyperoxic exposure in neonates causes lung injury including arrested vascularization and simplified alveolarization, which are the characteristics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Lung vascular development and endothelial cell signals are important for normal alveolarization. Endothelial cells mainly rely on glycolysis for bioenergetics, but display metabolic flexibility to maintain cell function under stress or nutrient deprivation. However, it is not known whether hyperoxic exposure alters metabolism thereby leading to lung endothelial cell dysfunction. Objective(s): To determine whether hyperoxia causes metabolic dysregulation leading to lung endothelial cell dysfunction. Method(s): Mouse fetal lung endothelial cell line (MFLM- 91U, Seven Hills Bioreagents) and primary lung endothelial cells isolated from neonatal mice (8 days old) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) prior to the measurement of glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and mitochondrial fuel utilization by the Seahorse XF Analyzer. Fatty acid metabolism gene was analyzed using the RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Arrays. Cell proliferation was measured using the Click-iTTM EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit. Scratch assay was performed to determine endothelial cell migration induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 50 ng/ml). Result(s): Hyperoxic exposure for 24 hours significantly reduced glycolytic flux (indicated by an extracellular acidification rate) and mitochondrial respiration (indicated by an oxygen consumption rate) in MFLM-91U cells, which was associated with reduced proliferation and migration. Mitochondrial fatty acid utilization was significantly increased in both MFLM-91U and primary mouse lung endothelial cells exposed to hyperoxia, which was associated with augmented gene expression of fatty acidmetabolism. However, hyperoxic exposure had no effects on mitochondrial utilization of glutamine or glucose in mouse lung endothelial cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of long-chain fatty acid entry intomitochondria for boxidation, which generates acetyl-CoA to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Treatment with a specific CPT1 inhibitor (etomoxir, 100 muM, 24 hours) significantly reduced proliferation inMFLM-91U cells. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxic exposure reduces glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration but augments fatty acid oxidation, while inhibition of fatty acid oxidation reduces proliferation in lung endothelial cells. These findings suggest dysregulated metabolism in endothelial cells as a potential mechanism for arrested lung vascularization during hyperoxic lung injury.

AB  - Background: Intermittent hypoxia and apnea occur in all preterm babies <32 weeks gestation and may affect drug action, metabolism, disposition and drug dosing such as caffeine. This drug, used in preterm es has a significant impact on major acute neonatal morbidities. Its use is associated with reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity, and improvement of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Caffeine is a diuretic and has potent renal effects. However, its effects on vasoactive mediators in the neonatal kidneys under different oxygen environments and intermittent hypoxia remains unclear. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that intermittent hypoxia amplifies dose-dependent adverse effects of caffeine on neonatal renal vasoactive mediators and prostanoid biosynthesis. Materials/Methods: Newborn rats were randomized to room air (RA), hyperoxia (50% O2), or IH (50% O2 with brief episodes of hypoxia, 10% O2) from P0 to P14 during which they received: (1) standard caffeine doses (SCD) of 20 mg/kg IP (loading) on P0; and 5 mg/kg/day IP (maintenance) on P1-P14; (2) high caffeine doses (HiCD) of 80 mg/kg IP on P0 and 20 mg/kg IP on P1-P14; or (3) equivalent volume saline (Sal). At P14, somatic growth, and renal prostanoid production; histopathology; and expression of cyclooxygenases (COX-1&2), prostanoid receptors and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) were examined. Result(s): Intermittent Hypoxia (IH) and hyperoxia had significant adverse effects on somatic growth. SCD produced no adverse effects on renal morphology, however IH amplified the detrimental effects of HiCD which produced the most severe renal injury, including marked necrosis and degeneration of the glomeruli and tubular structures. These were associated with increased COX-2 and TP; and decreased FP, IP, DP, and AQP-4 expression. Conclusion(s): Intermittent hypoxia potentiates the adverse effects of high doses of caffeine on renal prostanoidswhich are important regulators of renal development and function, suggesting toxicity in the developing kidneys. Its use should be avoided in the setting of IH or neonatal apnea. However, caffeine at standard doses is safe in the preterm neonate who experience frequent arterial oxygen desaturations or IH.

AB  - Preclinical studies have demonstrated promising results using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, recent evidences suggest that their therapeutic activity is mediated by paracrine mediators, most notably exosomes, rather than cell engraftment. Hypoxic preconditioning is thought to enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs. In this work, we aimed to analyse whether MSCs-derived exosomes are able to prevent the pulmonary vascular dysfunction induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to enhance their effectiveness by the use of hypoxia-preconditioning. Exosomes released by umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived MSCs cultured under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (3% O2) conditions were obtained by differential ultracentrifugation. Rat pulmonary artery (PA) smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were treated with 1 lg/ml of LPS for 48 hours in the absence or presence of MSC-derived exosomes (0.5- 5 lg/ml). IL-6 levels were determined by ELISA. Contractile responses were analysed in rat PA mounted in a wire myograph. Exposure to LPS significantly increased IL-6 release by rat PASMCs (Ctrl = 2.56 +/- 0.24; LPS = 75.46 +/- 4.16 ng/ml), inhibited hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), induced endothelial dysfunction and potentiated the contractile effects induced by serotonin in isolated PA. Treatment with normoxic MSC-derived exosomes had no effect in these responses. In contrast, hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs-derived exosomes significantly prevented the impairment of HPV, the hyperresponsiveness to serotonin and attenuated the reduction of the relaxant responses to acetylcholine. Neither exosome preparation was able to decrease the IL-6 release induced by LPS. Our data show that hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs-derived exosomes prevent the development of pulmonary vascular dysfunction induced by LPS in isolated PA. These findings suggest that hypoxic preconditioning increases the therapeutic potential of MSCs-derived exosomes and may represent a new therapeutic approach in pulmonary vascular diseases associated with inflammation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The physiologic vitamin D (VD), 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D) is a local paracrine/autocrine effecter of fetal lung maturation. By stimulating alveolar type II cell and lipofibroblast proliferation and differentiation, parenterally administered 1,25D has been shown to enhance neonatal lung maturation; but due to the potential systemic side effects of the parenteral route, the translational value of these findings might be limited. To minimize the possibility of systemic toxicity, we examined the effects of VD on neonatal lung maturation, when delivered directly to lungs via nebulization., METHODS: One-day-old rat pups were administered three different doses of 1,25D and its physiologic precursor 25(OH)D (25D), or the diluent, via nebulization daily for 14 days. Pups were sacrificed for lung, kidneys, and blood collection to determine markers of lung maturation, and serum 25D and calcium levels., RESULTS: Compared to controls, nebulized 25D and 1,25D enhanced lung maturation as evidenced by the increased expression of markers of alveolar epithelial (SP-B, leptin receptor), mesenchymal (PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha), and endothelial (VEGF, FLK-1) differentiation, surfactant phospholipid synthesis, and lung morphology without any significant increases in serum 25D and calcium levels., CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled VD is a potentially safe and effective novel strategy to enhance neonatal lung maturation.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a major morbidity of prematurity is characterized by early neutrophil influx, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and degradation, inflammation and vascular remodeling. The tripeptide Ac-PGP derived from the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) mediated breakdown of ECM, plays a critical role in various chronic lung diseases by enhancing neutrophilic inflammation and endothelial permeability. We hypothesized that Ac-PGP mediates the neutrophilic inflammation in BPD and loss of Ac-PGP function rescues BPD phenotype. Method(s): 1. In vitro: Human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) grown on collagen plates were exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2). Supernatants collected at 24 hours were tested for Ac-PGP, other matrikines and cytokines. 2. In vivo: a. Hyperoxia model: C57BL6 mice were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia from postnatal days (PN) 3-14. b. In vivo gain of function: Mice pups were administered either Ac-PGP (IP, 20 ug/g) or saline control every 72 hours from PN3-14 in both normoxia and hyperoxia. c. In vivo loss of function: Mice pups were administered RTR- an inhibitor of Ac-PGP (IP, 2 ug/g) or saline control every 72 hours from PN3-14 in normoxia and hyperoxia. Each group n=7-8. Animals harvested at PN14 for: morphometry by radial alveolar counts; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum for matrikines and cytokines; protein; RNA; hearts for RVH by Fultons Index (RV/LV+Septum weight ratio) as marker for pulmonary hypertension. Ac-PGP measured by ESI-LC/MS. Luminex multiplex assays performed for cytokines (IL-1beta, TNFalpha, VEGFA, MCP-1, eotaxin, IFN- gamma, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b). 3. Human: Ac-PGP and other matrikines analyzed in Tracheal aspirates (TA) from preterm infants with severe BPD at 36-38 weeks post menstrual age (PMA). Gestation matched term infants with no lung disease served as controls. Result(s): All differences between groups - p<0.05. 1. Cell supernatents from hyperoxic NHBE cells showed elevated expression of MMP-9, Ac-PGP and inflammatory cytokines compared to normoxic cells. 2. BAL and serum of hyperoxia animals showed increased MMP-9 and Ac-PGP compared to controls at PN14. Ac-PGP administration to pups, even in normoxia, caused decreased alveolarization, increased inflammatory cytokines in BAL and serum, and increased RVH as compared to saline controls. RTR administration rescued these changes in hyperoxia compared to saline controls. 3. TA from human infants with severe BPD showed elevated expression of MMP-9, Ac-PGP and inflammatory cytokines compared to controls. Conclusion(s): The neutrophil chemotactic matrikine Ac-PGP is critical in the pathogenesis of BPD, and serves as a target for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Rationale: Hyperoxia exposure during the saccular phase of lung development can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants, a disease characterized pathologically by arrested alveolar development. Human and animal studies suggest that hyperoxia induces excessive TGFbeta activation that disrupts lung development observed in BPD. Additionally, it has been reported that hyperoxia-induced type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury enhances TGFbeta-mediated epithelial trans-differentiation and apoptosis signaling. Our laboratory identified type II TGFbeta receptor interacting protein-1 (TRIP-1), a phosphorylation target of type II TGFbeta receptor kinase, as a repressor of TGFbeta1-mediated epithelial trans-differentiation and apoptosis. However, the role that TRIP-1 expression plays in BPD is not known. Our objective in this study is to investigate the role of specific TRIP-1 over-expression on epithelial injury in neonatal hyperoxia lung injury and arrested alveolar development. Method(s): Wild type (WT) C57BL/6 neonatal mouse pups were exposed to >95% O2 within 24 hrs of birth, then sacrificed on day of life (DOL) 7, with lungs collected for TRIP-1 immunohistochemistry. Heterozygous SPC-driven TRIP-1 overexpression (TRIP-1+/-) mouse pups and WT mouse pups were exposed to room air or hyperoxia (85% O2 DOL 4-7). Primary type II AEC were isolated from room air WT and TRIP-1+/- mouse pups at DOL 3, 7, and 14 and collected for protein analysis and immunocytochemistry. Result(s): Hyperoxia decreased TRIP-1 staining in WT mice at DOL 7 (data not shown). Isolated primary type II AEC from TRIP-1+/- mouse pups have higher TRIP-1 expression at DOL 3 and 7, but not at DOL 14, and have lower cleaved caspase-3 activity following hyperoxia (Figure 1). Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia decreases TRIP-1 expression in WT mouse lung. Primary type II AEC from TRIP-1+/- mouse pups maintain higher TRIP-1 expression during early postnatal lung development and resist hyperoxia-induced apoptosis signaling.

AB  - Background: The chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) afflicts more than 10,000 premature infants per year in the United States, yet it remains understudied and lacks targeted therapies. Cumulative oxygen exposure predicts BPD. Hyperoxia exposure damages respiratory epithelium and endothelium and activates innate immune cells. In the newborn lung, a dominant type 2 immune response maintains homeostasis, but how this immunotolerant milieu affects the response to lung injury is unknown. The cytokine IL-33 is expressed by pulmonary epithelium and endothelium, but alveolar macrophages (AM) also express IL-33 in response to injury. Innate cell-derived IL-33 has been shown to be important for epithelial repair. Premature infants with BPD have dysregulated serum levels of the soluble form of the IL-33 receptor ST2 (sST2). We hypothesized that IL-33 may be protective in hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) where barrier function is also impaired. Design/Methods: We used hyperoxia as a well-established model of BPD. Newborn (PN0) mice were placed in 0.8-0.9 FiO2 within 12 h of birth. Whole lungs from mice in normoxic versus hyperoxic conditions were harvested for histology, flow cytometry, and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and/or ELISA. Epithelial cells (EpC), endothelial cells (EndC), interstitial macrophages/monocytes (IM), and AM were isolated by FACS and analyzed by qPCR. Result(s): We examined developmental regulation of IL-33 in whole lungs from naive C57BL/6 mice. IL-33 and a downstream growth factor amphiregulin are highly expressed at birth, and expression decreases between postnatal day 0 (PN0) and PN5. We located IL-33 expression in sorted EpC, EndC, AM, and IM at PN0, PN1, PN3, and PN5. IL-33 expression was higher in Ly6Clo IM than in Ly6Chi IM at birth, and increased by more than 20 fold between PN0 and PN1. Hyperoxia exposure decreased IL-33 expression in Ly6Clo IM and EndC by more than 50%. We exposed IL-33-deficient mice to hyperoxia for 1-3 days. IL-33 deficient mice, especially male mice, were susceptible to HILI with increased mortality, morbidity, and cellular injury by day 3. By flow cytometry, lungs from IL-33-deficient mice treated with hyperoxia for 3 days had fewer total cells and decreased eosinophils (%CD45+ cells) in comparison to wild type littermates. Conclusion(s): The pulmonary cytokine milieu including IL-33 changes rapidly in the first few days of life. Epithelium, endothelium, and innate immune cells may be important sources of IL-33 in the newborn lung. IL-33-deficient mice are susceptible to hyperoxia-induced lung damage, suggesting that IL-33 may be protective in BPD.

AB  - Background: Chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a significant pulmonary complication for preterm infants. In addition to decreased alveolarization, these infants develop obstructive and/or restrictive lung function due to increases in or dysregulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Our mouse model mimics the pathophysiology observed in infants with severe BPD and we have previously reported decreased pulmonary miR-29b expression in this model. The current studies tested the hypothesis that restoration of miR-29b in the developing lung will improve lung alveolarization and minimize the pulmonary fibrosis. Method(s): MiR-29 levels were measured in the plasma of preterm infants by PCR. Pregnant C3H/HeN mice received an intraperitoneal LPS injection on E16 and newborn pups were exposed in 85% oxygen from birth to 14 days of life. On postnatal day 3, PBS containing a liposomal preparation of mir-29b or an empty liposome was administered intranasally. On postnatal day 14 or 28, mouse lung tissues were analyzed for changes in miR-29 expression, alveolarization, and matrix protein expression. Result(s): Analyses of plasma obtained from preterm infants during the first week of life indicate that circulating miR-29b levels are suppressed in infants later diagnosed with BPD and the levels are inversely correlated to severity in infants that subsequently develop BPD. In our mouse model, modest improvements in alveolarization were detected in the miR29b-treated mice. Mir-29b treatment completely attenuated the LPS/O2-associated increases in aSMA, MMP-9, and SMAD 2/3 and restored PDGFa levels in lung tissues. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that miR-29b restoration may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent severe BPD in prematurely born infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist used in premature neonates for treatment of apnea of prematurity. The Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) trial showed that infants treated with caffeine had a reduced rate of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). The mechanisms of caffeine's beneficial effects on BPD may be due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. HYPOTHESIS: High dose caffeine is more protective against the inflammatory effects of hyperoxia and intermittent hypoxia OBJECTIVES: 1) To compare the effects of low versus high dose caffeine treatment during hyperoxia and intermittent hypoxia (IH) on lung morphology; 2) To investigate whether caffeine reduces inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNFalpha) in lungs of rats exposed to hyperoxia and IH; and 3) To determine whether caffeine protects against oxidative damage (OHdG) by inducing antioxidants (SOD, Catalase) in lungs of rats exposed to hyperoxia and IH. METHOD(S): Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to either 1) room air; 2) 50% O2; 3) 50%/12% O2 exposed from P0 to P14. Groups were also treated with either Saline, low dose caffeine (20 mg/kg IP loading dose on PO; 5 mg/kg IP on P1-P14) and high dose caffeine (80 mg/kg IP loading dose on P0; 20 mg/kg IP on P1-P14). Lungs were then harvested for standard H and E staining, immunoflourescence staining of inflammatory mediators and antioxidants. ELISA and colorimetric assays were done for cytokines (IL-6 and TNFalpha) and antioxidants (SOD, Catalase). RESULT(S): On H and E staining, hemorrhage was noted in the RA group treated with low dose caffeine. Hyperoxia group treated with caffeine exhibited lung immaturity, alveolar simplification, lack of secondary crests and thickness of septae. ELISA assay for 8-OHdG, which is a biomarker for DNA damage showed increased levels in hyperoxia indicative of oxidative stress. However, TNFalpha, which is an inflammatory mediator, was noted to be increased in IH control group, and was noted to be decreased in caffeine treated groups. CONCLUSION(S): The oxygen environment influences the effects of caffeine. High caffeine in conjunction with hyperoxia resulted in lung immaturity, alveolar simplification, lack of secondary crests and thick septae. This effect was associated with increased DNA damage, IL-6 and TNFalpha. Treatment with caffeine in IH reduced DNA damage, cytokines and catalase (possibly due to reduction in H2O2), suggesting more beneficial effects when administered in IH versus hyperoxia.

AB  - RATIONALE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a form of chronic lung disease and one of the most common outcomes of preterm birth. Infants born extremely preterm are most at risk. METHODS A prospective cohort of infants in neonatal intensive care units within the Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth Systems were identified. Three groups were identified: 1) full-term neonates, 2) preterm neonates who did not develop BPD, and 3) preterm neonates who developed BPD. Serum samples were obtained at birth, and a highly-sensitive immunoassay was used to measure Serum Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) protein concentration. Both maternal and neonatal clinical data were collected, and subjects were followed until discharge. RESULTS In total, 637 patients were screened, and 158 patients were enrolled, including 47 term infants, 92 preterm infants who did not develop BPD, and 19 preterm infants who developed BPD. The three study groups differed significantly on gestational age, birth weight, and length of stay (p<0.001 for all). Compared with the preterm without BPD group, the preterm with BPD group had significantly lower median gestational age (34 vs. 26 weeks) and birth weight (1930 vs. 817 g) and significantly longer median LOS (20 vs. 88 days). The term group (median gestational age: 40 weeks) had higher birth weight (3590 g) and shorter median LOS (5 days). Notably, the three groups differed significantly on serum BDNF levels (p<0.001). The preterm with BPD group had significantly lower serum BDNF (median 3557.5 pg/mL) than the preterm without BPD group (median 6908.3 pg/mL) and the term group (median 9620.0 pg/mL). There was a moderately strong positive correlation between serum BDNF levels and gestational age (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.49). In a logistic regression model for BPD in preterm infants (n=111) predicted by gestational age and serum BDNF, we found that lower levels of serum BDNF were significantly associated with higher risk of BPD (p=0.037), even after adjusting for gestational age. Low levels of BDNF were associated with greater predicted days of and invasive ventilation and supplemental oxygen. CONCLUSIONS Serum levels of BDNF may provide valuable information for the neonatal course. This early biomarker could directly impact therapeutic interventions for preterm infants within neonatal intensive care units. This research sets the basis for future investigations concerning predictors for BPD and the postnatal period.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) may be a novel therapeutic option for premature infants at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) by restoring aberrant alveolar development, and preventing lung inflammation, vascular remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). METHOD(S): To determine the therapeutic potential of BMP9 in BPD, we induced BPD in neonatal Wistar rats by exposure to 90% oxygen for 15 days and treated the pups with 0.5-12.5 mug/kg of BMP9 once daily and 100% oxygen for 10 days and treated the pups with the optimal concentration of 2.5 mug/kg of BMP9 twice daily from day 2 onwards. We studied mRNA expression of the BMP9 receptor complex: activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ALK2), BMP receptor type 2 (BMPR2), endoglin and its downstream target transmembrane protein 100 (TMEM100) in the lung. In addition we investigated the beneficial effects of BMP9 treatment on body weight, survival, lung and heart histopathology, vascular leakage, inflammatory cytokine production, and collagen and fibrin deposition. Furthermore, the expression pattern of the BMP9 receptor complex and signaling of BMP9 were studied in primary cells and in endothelial and epithelial cell lines. In addition, the effect of BMP9 on inflammatory cytokine production was studied in endothelial cell lines. RESULT(S): Relatively high levels of mRNA expression of BMPRII, ALK1, endoglin and TMEM100 were observed in adult lung. The mRNAs of the BMP9 receptor complex and TMEM100 were differentially expressed in experimental BPD compared to controls. BMP9 treatment of neonatal rats with BPD improved alveolarization and reduced lung septal thickness, influx of macrophages and neutrophils, Interleukin-6 (IL6) expression and fibrosis. Beneficial effects of BMP9 treatment were observed on vascular remodeling (medial wall thickness and arteriolar muscularization) and RVH in rat pups with BPD. mRNA expression of BMPRII and ALK1 were higher in endothelial cells than in epithelial cells. ALK2 expression was high in both endothelial and epithelial cells. The anti-inflammatory effect of BMP9 was confirmed in cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells, showing a reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression of IL6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) after BMP9 stimulation. CONCLUSION(S): The differential expression of ALK1, ALK2, BMPRII, TMEM100 and Endoglin suggests a role for BMP9-dependent signaling in the development of (experimental) BPD. The beneficial effects of BMP9 on aberrant alveolarization, inflammation and fibrosis in neonatal rats with BPD, demonstrates the therapeutic potential of stimulation of the ALK1/BMPRII pathway with BMP9 as a treatment option for severe BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the major pulmonary morbidity experienced by premature neonates, and results from inflammation and oxidative stress. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that protect against and repair hyperoxia-induced lung injury via secretion of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory factors. We previously reported on the impact of MSC-conditioned media (MSC-CM) on anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant gene expression was modulated by the presence or absence of LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress (2016 ATS abstract A6572). This study sought to determine if MSCs applied in co-culture would have similar effects. METHOD(S): Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type C57BL/6J mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline control, bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) or media control, and 95% or 21% oxygen for 24 hours. Taqman PCR was used to assay gene expression. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were obtained from healthy adult volunteers. Data represents percent expression compared to baseline (100%), analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc t tests for significance. RESULT(S): In room air (RA), treatment with LPS reduced expression of anti-inflammatory PPARgamma and increased expression of pro-inflammatory TNFalpha and anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant Hmox1. Addition of MSCs did not result in any significant effect. Similar findings were observed in hyperoxia (HOx). In contrast, we previously reported MSC-CM further decreased PPARgamma and Hmox1 expression. In the absence of pro-inflammatory LPS, hyperoxia did not alter expression of PPARgamma, TNFalpha, or Hmox1. Addition of MSCs reduced expression of TNFalpha and Hmox1. We previously reported MSC-CM had no significant impact on gene expression. In the presence of LPS, hyperoxia did not alter expression of PPARgamma, TNFalpha, or Hmox1. Addition of MSCs reduced expression of Hmox1, similar to what we previously reported with MSC-CM. (Figure presented). CONCLUSION(S): Treatment with MSCs and MSC-CM have differential effects, with MSC-CM having greater effects in the context of LPS treatment, and MSCs having greater effects in the context of hyperoxia treatment. The optimal MSC-based therapy for BPD may therefore need to be individualized based on whether anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant benefits are more desirable.

AB  - Introduction Neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD) in preterm infants, also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the major complications arising in the premature infant. Pre- and postnatal stressors, such as mechanical ventilation (MV-O2) and hyperoxia (O 2) are known to contribute to disease development. In our study we observed that moderate prenatal cigarette smoke (pCS), enhances the vulnerability of the developing lung to postnatal injury resulting in impaired alveolar septation and vessel growth along with disturbed platelet drive growth factor (PDGF) signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Methods C57BL/6 mice were exposed to moderate pCS (500mg/m 3,50 min/2Xday) or filter air (FA) from day 7-18 of gestation. Postnatal 5-7 old neonatal mice from both groups received mechanical ventilation with oxygen euch gas (MV-O2), hyperoxia (40%O2) or room air ( RA, 21% O2) for 8 hours. Histologic analysis including alveolar and micro-vessel (20-100 mum) number, assessment of apoptosis (TUNEL and cleaved-caspase-3 staining) and immunoblot analysis for growth factors and vessel markers were performed. PDGFreceptor alpha (Ralpha) haploinsufficient neonatal mice (Charles River) were subjected to identical model of postnatal injury to unravel the role of PDGF-Ralpha. Results Without postnatal injury, neonatal mice that were exposed to pCS had decreased lung micro-vessel number alongside with increased apoptosis in endothelial cells and decreased CD31 and VE-cadherin protein expression when compared to neonatal mice from the FA group. Alveolar number and size were not different. When exposed to 8h of hyperoxia or MV-O2 micro-vessel number decreased further in pups from the pCS group together with increased apoptosis and significantly decreased expression of CD31 and VE-cadherin. Alveoli were found to be larger and fewer in the pCS group following MV-O2 when compared to FA together with increased number of monocytes and neutrophils. The alveolar phenotype in the pups from the pCS group upon postnatal injury was PDGF-Ralpha dependent as shown by additional studies in transgenic mice. Here, alveolar size and number as well as septal density was further reduced when compared to WT littermates following pCS. Conclusion Moderate pCS increases the vulnerability in neonatal mice to postnatal pulmonary injury as indicated by impaired alveolarization, micro-vessel formation and elastic fibers re-localization in these lungs. Furthermore, our data confirm the role of PDGF-Ralpha in postnatal lung pathology.

AB  - Rationale: Hyperoxia induces inflammatory lung injury in premature infants and in mouse models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Severe lung injury in CD11b-DTR mice occurs after 40h of hyperoxia, suggesting a protective role for a CD11b+ population in the newborn lung. Complementary transgenic mononuclear cell depleter mice (CD11b-DTR, CD11c-DTR, and CCR2-DTR) were used to more rigorously define the roles of specific populations. Method(s): Newborn (PN0) DT-treated CD11b-DTR, CD11c-DTR, and CCR2-DTR mice (all on C57Bl/6 background) were placed in 0.9 FiO2. Whole lungs were harvested for histology or flow cytometry analyses, using validated cell surface markers for mononuclear populations. In parallel, newborn C57/BL6 mice were exposed to 0.9 FiO2 for 5 days. Whole lungs were harvested for qPCR analyses of Th1 and Th2 cytokine expression. In addition, epithelial cells, dendritic cells (DC), interstitial macrophages/monocytes (IM), and alveolar macrophages (AM) were isolated by FACS and analyzed by qPCR. Result(s): DT-treated CD11b-DTR mice exposed to hyperoxia for 24h had severe lung injury with alveolar hemorrhage and capillary leak. CD11c-DTR mice had similar acute lung injury after 24h of hyperoxia while CCR2-DTR mice in hyperoxia for 24-36h displayed less lung injury. Approximately 30% of Ly6ChiIM, 60% of CD11b+DC, and 40% of immature AM (CD11chiSiglecFint) were depleted in CD11b-DTR+ mice by 24h. Approximately 50% of Ly6CloIM, 70% of DC (both CD11b+ and CD103+DC populations), and 80% of immature AM were depleted in CD11c-DTR+ mice. Furthermore, in CCR2 mice, over 90% of Ly6Chi IM were depleted by 36h. In wild type hyperoxia-exposed lungs, there was a 10-fold increase in thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a 6-fold increase in IL-6, a 3-fold increase in IL-1beta, and a trend toward increased IL-33 expression. In sorted cells from hyperoxic lungs, IL-10 was increased 2-fold in IM, IL-6 was increased 2.5 fold in DC, and there was a trend toward increased IL-6 in IM, in comparison to cells from normoxia conditions. TSLP and IL-33 were highly expressed in CD326-positive epithelial cells but expression was unchanged by oxygen exposure. AM expression of these cytokines was unchanged by hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): DT-treated CD11b-DTR+ and CD11c-DTR+ mice both display significant acute inflammatory lung injury after 24h of hyperoxia exposure. IM, DC, and AM populations may be protective. The Ly6Chi IM population is not critical as CCR2-DTR mice sustained less lung injury. Our qPCR data suggest that the cytokine milieu is largely driven by interstitial macrophages. IL-10 may be important for mitigation of hyperoxia-induced lung injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The administration of supplemental oxygen to treat ventilatory insufficiency may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent tissue damage. Cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) can modulate hyperoxic lung injury by a currently unknown mechanism. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of administration of omeprazole on the induction of CYP1A1 and its influence on hyperoxic lung injury in an established preterm rabbit model., METHODS: Omeprazole was administered either (1) directly to the fetus, (2) to the mother or (3) after birth to the pups in different doses (2-10 or 20 mg/kg). Controls were injected with the same amount of saline. Pups were housed in normoxia (21 %) or hyperoxia (>95 %) for 5 days. Outcome parameters were induction of CYP1A1 measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) immediately after delivery, at day 3 and day 5 as well as lung function, morphometry and immunohistochemistry assessed at day 5 of life. Transcriptome analysis was used to define the targeted pathways., RESULTS: Daily neonatal injections demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in CYP1A1. Lung function tests showed a significant improvement in tissue damping, tissue elasticity, total lung capacity, static compliance and elastance. Morphometry revealed a more developed lung architecture with thinned septae in animals treated with the highest dose (20 mg/kg) of omeprazole. Surfactant protein B, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor were significantly increased on immunohistochemical stainings after omeprazole treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal administration of omeprazole induces CYP1A1 in a dose-dependent matter and combined pre- and postnatal administration attenuates hyperoxic lung injury in preterm rabbits, even with the lowest dose of omeprazole without clear CYP1A1 induction.

AB  - Rationale: Prematurely born infants often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and persistent respiratory disease (PRD) over the first year of life. However, robust biomarkers capable of stratifying risk for individual subjects are lacking. Recent studies have identified lymphocyte dysfunction in preterm infants, particularly in those with respiratory morbidity. We hypothesized that analysis of sorted lymphocyte sub-populations could identify predictive markers and pathways associated with respiratory outcomes. Method(s): Transcriptomic profiles were generated from sorted CD8+ T lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood collected at the time of first hospital discharge, from preterm and full-term infants enrolled in the NHLBI Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) at the University of Rochester and the University at Buffalo (n=145). Standard statistical approaches were used to identify gene expression patterns associated with BPD, PRD and other demographic variables. Dimension reduction strategies (supervised PCA, LASSO, pathway stratification), with cross-validation, were applied to identify gene expression predictors for outcome. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used for gene set interpretation. Result(s): Among the subjects at greatest risk for BPD, those born at less than 29 weeks of gestation, (n=72), 501 genes were associated with quantitative oxygen utilization, 571 genes were differentially expressed in subjects receiving a diagnosis of BPD and 105 genes were differentially expressed in subjects who failed a room air challenge. When adjusted for gestational age at birth, 75 genes were associated with the diagnosis of BPD. A set of 92 genes classified the samples according to their BPD diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy (naive AUC=0.86, CV-AUC=0.71).Dysregulation of NRF2, HIPPO and CD40 pathways were consistently associated with BPD. Using gene expression data from all subjects with known PRD status at one year of age (n=116), a set of 34 genes, derived from 5 canonical biological pathways, predicted the PRD status with high level of accuracy (naive AUC=0.84; CV-AUC=0.73). Interestingly, gene predictors of PRD were associated with pathways involving complement activation, organic ion transport and regulation of intracellular actin organization. Summary: Gene expression from peripheral blood lymphocytes can predict respiratory outcomes in preterm infants and provides novel information on disease processes associated with disease states.

AB  - RATIONALE: Sepsis-induced endothelial cell (EC) inflammation contributes to defective vascular development in premature infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). The mechanisms by which inflammation programs deviant EC cell-fate decisions underlying aberrant microvascular arborization in the neonatal lung remain unknown. We postulated that EC innate immune activation directs abnormal angiogenesis by transcriptional induction of DLL4, the master regulator of sprouting angiogenesis. We tested this hypothesis in the saccular mouse lung and in isolated human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). DESIGN/METHODS: HPMEC (ScienCell) were treated with LPS (100ng/mL) to induce innate immune signaling. The ERK inhibitor U0126 (ERK-I), FOXC2-siRNA, and ERK1 and ERK2 wild-type and dominant negative (DN) plasmids were used to dissect signaling events in vitro. Immunoblotting, FOXC2-IP, and Chromatin immunoprecipiation (ChIP) were used to investigate the effect of LPS on ERK phosphorylation, FOXC2 activation, DLL4 expression, and ERK-dependent FOXC2 binding to DLL4 promoter. Sepsis was induced in 4d-old C57BL6 mice using intraperitoneal (i.p) LPS (2mg/kg) in the presence or absence of ERK-I (20mg/kg). Lung homogenates were used to examine FOXC2 and DLL4 expression, ERK/FOXC2 phosphorylation, and FOXC2 binding to DLL4 promoter. RESULT(S): In HPMEC, LPS mediated ERK phosphorylation in association with increased expression of the Notch ligand, DLL4. LPS induced phosphorylation of the Forkhead Box family transcription factor, FOXC2 resulted in nuclear translocation and binding of FOXC2 to the DLL4 promoter. ERK-inhibition or ERK-2 DN, but not ERK-1 DN, disrupted LPS-mediated FOXC2 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of DLL4. FOXC2-siRNA attenuated LPS-induced DLL4 expression in HPMEC. In vivo, i.p LPS induced ERK-phosphorylation, FOXC2 phosphorylation, FOXC2-binding to DLL4 promoter, and DLL4 expression in the saccular lung. ERK-inhibition (i.p) attenuated LPS-induced FOXC2 phosphorylation, FOXC2-DLL4 nuclear binding, and induction of FOXC2 and DLL4 protein Immunofluorescence studies showed that DLL4 was strongly induced in lung EC after LPS injection. CONCLUSION(S): We propose that ERK2 regulates LPS mediated FOXC2-dependent DLL4 expression in pulmonary endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. These data reveal a novel mechanism by which endothelial innate immune signaling programs deviant EC specification, which may contribute to defective vascular development in BPD. (Figure presented).

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) leads to significant morbidity in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. Genetic contribution to the development of BPD has been widely studied in the past. The smooth muscle isoform encoded by MYLK gene mediates cell movement and signaling in smooth muscle cells. MYLK gene also encodes the non-muscle isoform which plays a role in endothelial barrier integrity. Various studies have found associations of MYLK gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with asthma and susceptibility to acute lung injury. We hypothesized that MYLK gene variants are associated with development of BPD in ELBW infants. Method(s): We collected DNA from 146 ELBW neonates via buccal swabs after obtaining parental consent. The DNA was isolated and analyzed via real time PCR using TaqMan probes for rs820336, rs936170, rs9844173, rs9840993, rs4678047 and rs3796164. BPD was defined as the need for Oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. chi2, t-test and z-test were performed for statistical analysis; P<0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Table 1: Comparison of Demographic Characteristics and Genotype Distribution in the Study Groups with and without BPD(Table presented). Out of the six SNPs, rs820336 (p=0.03) was found to be significantly associated with the development of BPD while no significant association was found with rs936170 (p 0.06), rs9844173 (p 0.29), rs9840993 (p 0.96), rs4678047 (p 0.17) and rs3796164 (p 0.21). Conclusion(s): One MYLK genetic variant was found to be associated with the progression to BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that this genetic variation modulates smooth muscle dysregulation and vascular permeability during the progression to BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Oxygen toxicity and antioxidant deficiencies contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The FDA-approved drug aurothioglucose (ATG) inhibits thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) and activates nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key regulator of endogenous antioxidant responses. We have previously demonstrated that ATG attenuates hyperoxia-induced deficits in neonatal lung development, likely via Nrf2-dependent mechanisms. The present studies tested the hypothesis that the protective effects of ATG against neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits are Nrf2-dependent. Method(s): Four day-old newborn Nrf2-/- or isogenic wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice were treated with a single dose of ATG (25 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline and subsequently exposed to room air (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) through 14 d of life. TrxR1 activity I lung homogenates was determined by enzymatic assay at 24 h post-ATG administration. Lung development was qualitatively assessed using hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides prepared from inflation-fixed paraffin-embedded 14 d lungs. Result(s): Baseline TrxR1 activity was 40% lower in Nrf2-/- lungs when compared to WT. Following ATG treatment, TrxR1 activity was reduced by 80% in WT and Nrf2-/- lungs from RA or hyperoxia-exposed pups. There was no independent effect of hyperoxia on TrxR1 activity in WT or Nrf2-/- lungs. Lung development was not different between WT and Nrf2-/- mice raised in RA. Consistent with previous reports, hyperoxic exposure caused similar degrees of impaired alveolar development in both WT and Nrf2-/- mice. In WT mice, ATG attenuated the effects of hyperoxic exposure on lung development. ATG also improved lung development in hyperoxia-exposed Nrf2-/- mice when compared to saline-treated controls. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that Nrf2 is not required for the protective effects of the TrxR1 inhibitor ATG in a murine BPD model, which is contrary to our primary hypothesis. Though the mechanisms of protection in Nrf2-/- mice are unclear at present, focused studies are currently underway to identify pathways activated by ATG in the lungs of these animals. In addition to providing further support for TrxR1 as a novel therapeutic target, our current and future studies are likely to identify additional pathways that may be targeted to improve lung development and prevent BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic fibrotic pulmonary disease, remains a common complication of premature birth. BPD is characterized by hypoalveolarization and interstitial thickening with collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin-, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-positive myofibroblasts. Infants who develop BPD often have elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in their airway both at birth and during the later stages of disease progression. However, the links between inflammation and hypoalveolarization in BPD are undetermined. Supplemental oxygen, used to treat many premature infants, is a risk factor for BPD. Hyperoxic exposure is associated with lung epithelial cell apoptosis and necrosis. CD103+ DCs phagocytose apoptotic cells and this can induce immunogenic responses. Clec9a, a C-type lectin selectively expressed on CD103+ DCs, is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptor for dead cell cytoskeletal actin filaments that signals via the tyrosine kinase Syk and diverts internalized dead cell debris to endosomes, favoring cross-presentation on MHC class I to CD8+ T cells. We have recently shown that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice increases the number of IL-12-producing Clec9a+CD103+ DCs, however their effect on lung alveolar growth is not known. We hypothesized that CD103+ DCs and Clec9a signaling are required for hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization in neonatal mice. Method(s): We exposed 2 day-old C57BL/6J, Clec9agfp -/- mice to normoxia or 75% oxygen. In selected experiments, C57BL/6J mice were treated with anti-CD103 or IgG control intraperitoneally on day 0 and 7 of hyperoxic exposure, a method of in vivo depletion CD103+ DCs in non-lymphoid organs. After 14 days of exposure the lungs were harvested for histology. Lung CD103+ DC depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry. Result(s): As expected, the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed C57BL/6J mice showed marked hypoalveolarization with fewer and larger alveolar spaces and significantly increased alveolar chord length. In contrast, the lungs of CD103+ DC-depleted mice showed significant attenuation of the hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization and no significant increase in alveolar chord length compared to normoxia-exposed mice. Clec9a null mice also showed significant attenuation of hyperoxia-induced increase in alveolar chord lenth with no significant differences between alveolar chord length of normoxia or O2 exposed mice, affirming protection from hypoalveolarization. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that in neonatal mice, CD103+ DCs and Clec9a signaling are required for hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization, a novel mechanism linking innate immune responses and alveolarization. Future studies will examine the mechanisms by which CD103+ DCs and Clec9a signaling affect lung growth during hyperoxic exposure.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common respiratory morbidity in human preterm infants and interrupted angiogenesis contributes to the development of this morbidity. Exposure to hyperoxia interrupts angiogenesis both in humans and experimental animals. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional angiogenic peptide that exerts its biological effects via calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (RAMP2). We observed that AM-deficient human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells have an increased susceptibility to hyperoxic injury. Yet, whether endogenous AM signaling is necessary to protect neonatal mice against experimental BPD is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that AM-deficient neonatal mice will display increased susceptibility to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD compared to those who are AM-sufficient. Method(s): One-day old AM-sufficient (AM +/+) or -deficient (AM +/-) mice were exposed to room air or hyperoxia (FiO2 70%) for up to 14 days, following which the mouse lungs were harvested to determine angiogenesis, alveolarization, and the expression of AM and its signaling receptors, CRLR and RAMP2. Additionally, we determined the expression of established angiogenesis-regulating molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and its receptor (VEGFR2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), angiopoietin (ANG)-1 and -2, and TIE-2 in these animals. Result(s): Initially, we determined the effects of hyperoxia on the AM-signaling axis. Exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia decreased the expression of AM, CRLR and RAMP2, which indicates that hyperoxia disrupts AM signaling in neonatal mice. Further, hyperoxia-induced alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification was augmented in neonatal AM +/- mice compared to AM +/+ mice. Mechanistically, these findings were associated with decreased eNOS expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation. Although exposure to hyperoxia altered the expression of VEGF-A, VEGFR2, ANG-1 and -2, and TIE-2, AM did not independently affect the expression of these angiogenesis-modulating molecules in our experimental conditions. Conclusion(s): We conclude that endogenous AM signaling is necessary to mitigate hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD in neonate mice. Our results indicate that AM and CRLR-RAMP2 interface are potential therapeutic targets for the management of BPD in human preterm infants.

AB  - Background: Reactive oxygen species contribute to the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic pulmonary disorders, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a respiratory condition affecting preterm infants. BPD treatment often involves respiratory support with high O2, and oxidative stress is an adverse effect associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Genetic polymorphisms in a few candidate nuclear genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood, and the role of the mitochondrial genome has not been investigated. Understanding the role of genetic background in disease susceptibility is critical to improving treatment strategies and reducing oxidant injury in developing lungs. Method(s): To mimic features of BPD we developed a mouse model where one day after birth neonatal mice from 29 inbred strains were exposed for 72 hr to normoxia (room air, 20% O2) or hyperoxia (>95% O2). Hyperoxia induced phenotypes that were similar to BPD when compared to normal postnatal lung development in ambient air. We isolated lung DNA from mice exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia, amplified the mitochondrial genome with long range PCR, and then used ultra-deep sequencing to identify variants in the mitochondrial genome. Result(s): We found 385 sequence variations in wild-derived PWD/PhJ inbred mice compared to reference C57BL/6J mice. Higher variation frequency (1/32 bases) was found in the D-loop region compared to the rest of the mitochondrial genome (1/42 bases). There was also more heteroplasmy in PWD/PhJ mice compared to C57BL/6J. Among all 27 strains sequenced we found five haplotype groups: with classical inbred strains in haplotype 1, NZB and NZO mice in haplotype 2, PWD/PhJ and PWK/PhJ mice in haplotype 3, CAST/EiJ in haplotype 4, and MOLF/EiJ in haplotype 5. Overall, wild derived strains had more sequence variation than classical inbred strains compared to the reference C57BL/6J strain. Exposure to hyperoxia had minimal effects on the major mitochondrial DNA sequence but did lead to strain-specific changes in heteroplasmy. Conclusion(s): Ultra-deep sequencing identified mtDNA sequence variation and differences in heteroplasmy and indels across inbred mouse strains that associate with disease phenotypes. Through combined approaches, we have identified novel candidate nuclear and mitochondrial susceptibility genes that may improve our understanding of neonatal lung injury and development.

AB  - Rationale. BPD is a chronic respiratory disease in premature infants, leading to impaired lung development and greater risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Validated models mimicking key features of BPD-associated PAH are required to identify potential new therapies. We have previously established a mouse model whereby exposure to perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia induced alveolar dysruption (Nold et al., PNAS, 2013) and airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness (Royce et al., AJRCMB, 2016), but vascular changes in this setting have yet to be assessed. Aims. To use a "double-hit" mouse model of BPD to assess vascular remodelling and changes in intrapulmonary artery reactivity. Methods. Following in utero exposure to lipopolysaccharide, neonatal C57BL6 pups were randomized to 21% oxygen (air) or 65% oxygen (hyperoxia) exposure for 4 weeks, for comparison with age-matched naive mice. Using echocardiography, the time-velocity ratio TPV/RVET was measured as a marker of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and PAH. Lung sections were analysed for alveolar size and number, for perivascular collagen by Masson Trichrome (as a marker of fibrosis), and for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and endothelin receptor-A (ETA) expression by immunohistochemistry (as markers of increased contraction). In precision cut lung slices (PCLS) contraction to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the thromboxane mimetic U46619 was measured as changes in the area of intrapulmonary arteries (~200 um diameter) using phase-contrast microscopy. Results. Hyperoxic mice developed a severe BPD-like lung disease with 60% fewer and 4-fold larger alveoli accompanied by a loss of small pulmonary blood vessels, leading to PAH in 25% of the animals. Hyperoxia did not alter subendothelial collagen, or the expression of alpha-SMA (pixel count x 108/area: air 3.5+/-0.5 n=15; hyperoxia 3.7+/-0.4 n=20, NS) or ET (n=13,19, NS) in the perivascular smooth muscle A bundle. Artery contraction to endothelin-1 in PCLS was modest in both groups, and the thromboxane mimetic U46619 elicited contraction with similar potency (pEC50: air 7.5+/-0.4, n=6; hyperoxia 8.3+/-0.2, n=4) and maximum (% reduction in lumen area: air 48+/-9; hyperoxia 39+/-4). Conclusion. This mouse model of BPD does not induce vascular remodeling or increased contraction of intrapulmonary arteries consistent with established PAH. However, since perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia induced vascular rarefaction, this model provides a setting for assessment of novel approaches to restore vasculogenesis. Alternative models or later time points may be required to demonstrate other changes leading to BPD-associated PAH to enable assessment of new treatments to reduce morbidity and mortality in premature infants.

AB  - Rationale: Induction of cytoprotective genes by the transcription factor Nrf2 is essential in airway defense. Health benefits of dietary antioxidants, including a phytochemical Nrf2 agonist sulforaphane (SFN), have been demonstrated. However, effects of maternal antioxidant diet on postnatal airway disorders are not understood. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disorder of preterm infants. Lack of Nrf2 augmented the BPD-like phenotypes in murine models. Method(s): To determine the influence of prenatally supplemented SFN on the pathogenesis of a model BPD, time-pregnant wild-type (Nrf2+/+) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) mice were orally given with SFN or vehicle (PBS) on embryonic (E) days 11, 13, 15, and 17. At postnatal day 1 when lungs were in saccular stage of development, pups were exposed to 100% O2 (hyperoxia) or air with foster dams for 3 days until injury was analyzed by bronchoalveolar lavage and histopathology at the end of exposure. Result(s): Hyperoxia-caused lung edema and inflammation and arrested saccular-to-alveolar transition were marginal in Nrf2+/+ neonates compared to the susceptible Nrf2-/- neonates. Prenatal SFN significantly improved hyperoxia-caused lung injury parameters and alveolar maturation in Nrf2-/- pups while it did not alter these phenotypes in the resistant Nrf2+/+ pups. cDNA microarray analysis determined that gestational SFN altered baseline postnatal lung genes in an Nrf2-dependent way. Prenatal SFN caused upregulation of cell growth and tissue development genes (Egr2, Myof, Ibsp) in air-exposed Nrf2 +/+pups, while it altered cell cycle, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis genes (Tp53, Fgfr, Vegf, Ilk) in air-exposed Nrf2-/- pups. Transcriptome changes by gestational SFN also differed between two genotypes after hyperoxia. In Nrf2+/+pups, hyperoxia-increased immune genes (Lcn2, H2-D1, Cdh22) were downregulated by SFN, and vice versa for cell proliferation genes (Cdca2, Palmd). Prenatal SFN also upregulated Nrf2 effector antioxidants (Ephx1, Ggt7) against hyperoxia in these mice. In Nrf2-/- pups, many hyperoxia-induced inflammatory and cell-to-cell signaling genes (Clec7a, Selplg, Csf2rb) were suppressed by prenatal SFN. Althought gestational SFN supplementation affected lung transcriptomics differentially in Nrf2+/+and Nrf2-/- pups, inhibition of signaling molecules including MAPK, NF-kappaB and/or AP-1 was proposed to be involved in common. Conclusion(s): Gestational SFN protected developing lungs from BPD-like pathogenesis in the susceptible Nrf2-/- pups, supporting an Nrf2-independent defensive role of SFN. Transcriptome analyses suggested underlying molecular mechanisms of prenatal SFN. Together with transcriptome changes of embryonic lung and placenta at E18.5, results provide new insights into the influence of maternal antioxidant diet on fetal programming for postnatal respiratory health.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading cause of pediatric chronic lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in BPD significantly increases neonatal morbidity and mortality. The incidence of PH in BPD is between 20 and 35%, and therefore, there is a real need to identify predictive biomarkers for PH in patients with BPD. We have previously shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the arginase-1 gene (ARG1) is protective against PH in BPD patients. Similarly, we recently published that a SNP in the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 gene (DDAH1) is protective against PH in BPD patients. In the present study, we hypothesized that combining the ARG1 and DDAH1 SNP data would more precisely detect which patients are protected from PH in BPD, than each SNP independently. METHOD(S): BPD patients (n=79) who were born at <35 weeks gestation and enrolled in Nationwide Children's Hospital Perinatal Research Repository were studied. PH was defined by echocardiographic criteria, and of these 79 patients, 20 (25%) had PH. SNP verses wildtype status of both ARG1 rs2781666 (G>T) and DDAH1 rs480414 (G>A) was determined by Sequenom Massarray. Since these SNPs have previously been found to be protective, a test was considered positive if a patient had the wildtype allele at the given gene locus. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for each locus separately and combined. RESULT(S): The frequency of the ARG1 SNP in our BPD cohort was 40/79 (51%). Of the BPD-PH patients, 7/20 (35%) were heterozygous (GT) or homozygous (TT) for the SNP. Of the BPD alone patients, 33/59 (56%) were heterozygous (GT) or homozygous (TT) for the SNP. The sensitivity and specificity of ARG1 wildtype for detecting PH disease was 65% and 56%, respectively. The frequency of the DDAH1 SNP in our BPD cohort was 38/79 (48%), with a similar distribution across genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity of DDAH1 wildtype for detecting PH disease was 75% and 56%, respectively. We found that when the ARG1 and DDAH1 wildtype tests were combined, the sensitivity for detecting PH disease increased to 95% and the negative predictive value also increased to 95%. CONCLUSION(S): In this small cohort of BPD patients, the presence of ARG1 and DDAH1 wildtype, when combined, is a 95% sensitive biomarker for BPD-PH disease. Conversely, the presence of the ARG1 and DDAH1 SNPs, when combined, has a predictive probability of 95% that the BPD patient will not develop PH.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although historically challenging to perform in the lung, technological advancements have made Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) increasingly applicable for pediatric pulmonary imaging. Furthermore, a wide array of functional imaging techniques has become available that may be leveraged alongside structural imaging for increasingly sensitive biomarkers, or as outcome measures in the evaluation of novel therapies., AREAS COVERED: In this review, recent technical advancements and modern methodologies for structural and functional lung MRI are described. These include ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI, free-breathing contrast agent-free, functional lung MRI, and hyperpolarized gas MRI, amongst other techniques. Specific examples of the application of these methods in children are provided, principally drawn from recent research in asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and cystic fibrosis., EXPERT OPINION: Pediatric lung MRI is rapidly growing, and is well poised for clinical utilization, as well as continued research into early disease detection, disease processes, and novel treatments. Structure/function complementarity makes MRI especially attractive as a tool for increased adoption in the evaluation of pediatric lung disease. Looking toward the future, novel technologies, such as low-field MRI and artificial intelligence, mitigate some of the traditional drawbacks of lung MRI and will aid in improving access to MRI in general, potentially spurring increased adoption and demand for pulmonary MRI in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prematurity and fetal growth restriction are risk factors for pulmonary hypertension (PH) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neonatal rats develop PH and vascular remodeling when exposed to hyperoxia. We hypothesize that postnatal growth restriction (PNGR) due to under-nutrition increases the severity of PH induced by hyperoxia in neonatal rats., METHODS: Pups were randomized at birth to litters maintained in room air or 75% oxygen (hyperoxia), together with litters of normal milk intake (10 pups) or PNGR (17 pups). After 14 d, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was assessed by Fulton's index (right ventricular weight/left ventricular plus septal weight) and PH by echocardiography. Lungs were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, morphometrics, western blotting, and metabolomics., RESULTS: Hyperoxia and PNGR each significantly increased pulmonary arterial pressure, RVH and pulmonary arterial medial wall thickness, and significantly decreased pulmonary vessel number. These changes were significantly augmented in pups exposed to both insults. Hyperoxia and PNGR both significantly decreased expression of proteins involved in lung development and vasodilation., CONCLUSION: PNGR induces right ventricular and pulmonary vascular remodeling and augments the effects of oxygen in neonatal rats. This may be a powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms that induce PH in low-birth-weight preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is characterized by vascular damage and impaired lung development in premature infants on mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress. Sequence variants in specific nuclear-coded genes affect mitochondrial (mt) function and contribute to low birth weight and BPD. Excess oxygen also damages highly susceptible mtDNA, reducing the integrity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain through electron leakage. We identified significant differences (heteroplasmy and mtDNA sequence) in a neonatal mouse model of hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury that associated with lung phentoypes. In this pilot study we used ultra-deep sequencing to identify mtDNA variations in preterm infants with and without BPD. Method(s): Saliva samples were collected from very low birthweight (<1250 g) Argentinian infants prior to ventilation, and from their parents (12 non-BPD trios, 12 BPD trios). Infant DNA was manually isolated using the Oragene PrepIT-L2P protocol, while parental DNA was isolated on a BioMek robot using the Agencourt DNAdvance protocol (Beckman Coulter). mtDNA was amplified by long range PCR, column purified (Zymo Research) and characterized on a Bioanalyzer for purity and concentration. Mitochondrial PCR fragments (1 ng) were tagged with Nextera libraries, and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) using 2 x 150 bp paired end reads. Result(s): Phylogenetic mapping of BPD infants showed a higher incidence of BPD in the European HV haplogroup. Two-fold heteroplasmy increase and 3-fold higher incidence of SNP locus heterozygosity were found in BPD infants compared to non-BPD infants. The greatest variation in BPD infants was found in the D loop, MT-ND2 and MT-COI. MT-ND4 and MT-ND6 variants predicted to be damaging (PolyPhen) were 2 fold higher in BPD infants versus controls. Interestingly, two D loop variants previously associated with oxidative stress in adults were differentially distributed in BPD infants compared to controls. Conclusion(s): Mutations to complexes I (ND2, ND4 and ND6) and IV (COI) of the electron transport chain were overrepresented in BPD infants. Complex I contains the NADH dehydrogenase subunit and is a common target of mtROS generated from oxidative stress. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) catalyzes the final reduction of oxygen, and genetic mutations in this subunit have been implicated in early childhood disorders of tissues with high energy demand. Mitochondrial polymorphisms may contribute to differential susceptibility to BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - RATIONALE: Caffeine is widely used to manage apnea of prematurity, and reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is also complicated by arrested lung alveolarization, however, to date, it is not clear whether caffeine administration to BPD patients may also influence the course of post-natal lung development, namely, alveolarization of the immature, developing lung. To this end, we addressed whether caffeine impacted the structural development of the lung in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD. In parallel, we also explored whether caffeine modulated signaling by the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family of peptide growth factors, which are known to be mediators of both normal lung development, and the arrested lung development associated with BPD. METHOD(S): The impact of caffeine on TGF-beta signaling in primary mouse lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II cells was assessed in vitro, by real-time RT-PCR for gene expression of the TGF-beta signaling machinery, or to detect expression of reporter genes as distal readouts for TGF-beta signaling; or by immunoblot for Smad phosphorylation, as a proximal readout of TGF-beta signaling. The effects of caffeine administration (25 mg/kg/day for the first 14 days of post-natal life) on aberrant lung development and TGFbeta signaling in vivo was assessed in a hyperoxia (85% O2)-based model of BPD in C57BL/6 mice, using state-of-the-art design-based stereology. RESULT(S): Caffeine downregulated expression of type I and type III TGF-beta receptors, and Smad2; and potentiated TGF-beta signaling in vitro. In vivo, caffeine was detected in the lung within one hour of intraperitoneal administration. Caffeine administration normalized mouse body mass under hyperoxic conditions, and normalized Smad2 phosphorylation detected in lung homogenates. Using a stereological assessment of the total alveoli number in the lung, the mean alveolar septal wall thickness, and the total gas exchange surface area, caffeine administration neither improved nor worsened lung structure in hyperoxia-exposed mice, in which post-natal lung maturation was blunted. CONCLUSION(S): Caffeine modulated TGF-beta signaling in vitro and in vivo. Caffeine administration was well-tolerated by newborn mice, but did not influence the course of blunted post-natal lung maturation in a hyperoxia-based experimental mouse model of BPD with the dosing protocol employed in this study.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of preterm birth, and is characterized by a pronounced stunting of late lung development, namely, lung alveolarization. Several lines of evidence have associated the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 with the risk for, or development of BPD. In general, lower IL-10 levels have been associated with worse BPD. To explore this idea further, we addressed roles for IL-10 in the arrested lung development associated with exposure of newborn mouse pups to hyperoxia, in a well-established animal model of BPD. METHOD(S): IL-10, IL-10 receptor, and IL-10 reporter-gene expression was assessed in the lungs of mouse pups by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblot, and real-time RT-PCR. An interventional study was undertaken, by administering IL-10 via the intraperitoneal route (50 mug/kg, daily) to newborn mouse pups, from the day of birth for the first fourteen days of life. Mouse pups were randomized to hyperoxia or normoxia groups, and within each group, a control group received vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) alone, or IL-10. At the conclusion of the time-course, lungs were harvested, and fixed by intra-tracheal glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde at 20 cmH2O, embedded in agar and sectioned (3-mm sections), after which total lung volume was determined by the Cavalieri principle. Lungs were treated with arsenic, osmium, and uranium, embedded in plastic, and subjected to systemic uniform random sampling for stereological analysis of lung architecture. RESULT(S): Exposure of newborn mouse pups to normobaric hyperoxia had a pronounced impact on the abundance of IL-10 in the lung, where IL-10 levels were dramatically depressed. The intraperitoneal administration of IL-10 resulted in concordant regulation of IL-10-regulated genes, including interferon-g, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-8 (downregulated) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1B, at three, five, and 14 days post-IL-10 administration. However, intraperitoneal administration of IL-10 was without impact on any parameter of lung structure that was assessed, including alveoli density, mean gas exchange surface area, total number of alveoli in the lung, and mean alveolar septal wall thickness. CONCLUSION(S): These data demonstrate that hyperoxia exposure does impact IL-10 expression during post-natal lung maturation in the mouse, and that IL-10 can be successfully delivered to the developing mouse lung via the intraperitoneal route. These data also illustrate that IL-10 applied via the intraperitoneal route, at 50 mug/kg/day in the BPD mouse model, was unable to influence the stunted lung alveolarization, either indicating the need for a higher dose, or that this therapeutic approach is not viable.

AB  - Rationale: Hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). NADPH Quinone oxidoreductase 1(NQO1) induction is known to protect the tissues from hyperoxic injury. Sulforaphane is an important inducer of NQO1 and has been shown to improve the cell survival in hyperoxic conditions. We tested the hypothesis that human pulmonary cells carrying specific SNPs on the human NQO1 genes will display decreased inducibility by sulforaphane and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress than those carrying the wild type genes. Method(s): H441 cells grown in room air were transfected with plasmids containing the wild type or mutated NQO1 promoters [-1221(A>C)] and treated with various concentrations of sulforaphane. In another experiment, these cells were incubated in room air or hyperoxic conditions (95%O2 5%CO2) for various time periods. Transcriptional activation of NQO1 was studied using the dual luciferase assay after both experiments. Result(s): Compared to wild type NQO1 promoter, the -1221(A>C) showed significantly reduced promoter activity at basal condition and all different concentrations (p <= 0.05) of sulforaphane (Fig 1). When measured at 12 hours, compared to wild type NQO1, the -1221(A>C) showed significantly reduced promoter activity at room air and hyperoxic conditions (p <= 0.05) as measured by the luciferase reporter assay (Fig 2). (Figure presented). Conclusion(s): Our experiments support the hypothesis that human pulmonary cells carrying specific SNPs on the human NQO1 genes will display decreased inducibility by sulforaphane and hyperoxia than those carrying the wild type genes. Further studies may help to develop innovative strategies that can lead to the prevention and/or treatment of BPD by modulating the expression of NQO1.

AB  - Rationale. Lung immaturity is associated with numerous complications, including neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which are a key factor affecting mortality and morbidity in preterm babies worldwide. The cellular and molecular pathways that regulate lung development process are still poorly understood and critical to aid lung repair and regeneration in premature infants. The systematic investigations of the regulatory processes during the formation of the tracheobronchial tree and the alveoli will help to better understand the specification mechanisms that drive normal lung development and maturation. Methods. In this study, we applied unbiased mass spectrometry-based multi-omics approaches (i.e. proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) to characterize the molecular constituents of the mouse lung during normal development. We used whole lung tissue homogenates from mice at gestational day 16.5 & 18.5 (E16.5 & E18.5), postnatal day 7 (P7) and postnatal day 28 (P28) with n = 4 per timepoint. The aqueous polar metabolites, proteins, and lipids were extracted from the same sample using a modified Folch extraction method (metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction, MPLEx), then introduced into GC-MS (metabolomics) and LC-MS/MS (proteomics and lipidomics) analyses. Results. Our integrative multi-omics approaches have enabled comprehensive profiling of the processes underlying lung development in mouse. We have identified 8178 proteins, 159 metabolites, and 442 lipids which are involved in multiple stage specific changes in structure and function of Lung development over the time. The analysis showed several different expression patterns across developmental stages for each omics data. For example protein profiling indicated increased cell cycle activity and metabolism of proteins (i.e. increased proliferation) early in development while immune system components were increased as well as lipid metabolism and energy metabolism later. The proteomics observations were supported by global metabolite profiling which detected higher pools of free amino acids at early timepoints of lung development and increased abundance of glycolysis intermediates at later timepoints supporting the notion of increased proliferation/protein metabolism at early timepoints and increased energy metabolism at later timepoints. Conclusion. Understanding the molecular details of lung development will greatly help to ameliorate morbidity and mortality in premature infants. This work forms part of the LungMAP initiative to establish a molecular atlas of the mouse and the human lung.

AB  - Background: Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) is alveolar epithelium cell (AEC) mitogen which forms an integral part of the signaling required for distal lung branching morphogenesis in fetus. It regulates the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) that, in turn activates the Na-K-ATPase in AEC - protein responsible for fetal lung fluid resorption and beta2 receptor mediated actions. Also, FGF10 plays a significant role in cardiac outflow tract formation, and aberration in its expression is associated with cardiac outflow tract obstructive lesions. We hypothesized that MYLK gene variants are associated with development of BPD in ELBW infants. Method(s): DNA from buccal swabs of 91 ELBW infants who are less than 1000grams at birth, with informed parental consent, was isolated and subjected to allelic discrimination by RT-PCR, using specific probes for FGF10 SNP (rs2973644, rs900379, rs1011814). BPD was defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks PMA. PDA was diagnosed by echo between day3-5. Chi square test, t-test, and z-test were performed, with P<0.05 denoting statistical significance. Result(s): Babies in BPD group were smaller (690 +/-157 vs 761+/-143 gm) and more premature (25 +/-1.4 vs 26 +/-1.4 wk) than no BPD group. No statistical difference was noted in birth weight (762 +/-157 vs 722 +/-175 gm) and gestational age (25 +/-1.4 wk vs 26 +/-1.6 wk) between babies with and without PDA. rs2973644, rs900379, rs1011814 distribution was similar in both the groups and there was no significant association with BPD or PDA (Table presented). Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we did not find the association of FGF10 SNPs BPD or PDA, and it may have resulted from small sample size of the study.

AB  - Rationale: Hyperoxic exposure in neonates causes lung injury including arrested vascularization and simplified alveolarization, which are the characteristics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Lung vascular development and endothelial cell signals are important for normal alveolarization. Endothelial cells mainly rely on glycolysis for bioenergetics, but display metabolic flexibility to maintain cell function under stress or nutrient deprivation. However, it is not known whether hyperoxic exposure alters metabolism thereby leading to lung endothelial cell dysfunction. We hypothesize that hyperoxia causes metabolic dysregulation resulting in lung endothelial cell dysfunction. Method(s): Mouse fetal lung endothelial cells (MFLM-91U, Seven Hills Bioreagents) and primary lung endothelial cells isolated from neonatal mice (8 days old) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) prior to the measurement of glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and mitochondrial fuel utilization by the Seahorse XF Analyzer. Cell proliferation was measured using the Click-iTTM EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit. A scratch assay was performed to determine endothelial cell migration induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 50 ng/ml). Result(s): Hyperoxic exposure for 24 h significantly reduced glycolytic flux (indicated by extracellular acidification rate) and mitochondrial respiration (indicated by oxygen consumption rate) in MFLM-91U cells, which was associated with reduced proliferation and migration. Mitochondrial utilization of fatty acid was significantly increased in both MFLM-91U and primary mouse lung endothelial cells exposed to hyperoxia. However, hyperoxic exposure had no effects on mitochondrial utilization of glutamine or glucose in mouse lung endothelial cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of long-chain fatty acid entry into mitochondria for beta-oxidation, which generates acetyl-CoA to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Treatment with a specific CPT1 inhibitor (etomoxir, 100 muM, 24 h) significantly reduced VEGF-induced proliferation in lung endothelial cells. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxic exposure reduces glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration but augments fatty acid oxidation, while inhibition of fatty acid oxidation reduces proliferation in lung endothelial cells. These findings suggest dysregulated metabolism in endothelial cells as a potential mechanism for arrested lung vascularization during hyperoxic lung injury.

AB  - RATIONALE: Forkhead box (Fox) proteins are transcription factors that play pivotal roles in the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. As such, key role for this group of transcription factors have been identified in embryonic development. To date, no study has addressed the role of Fox proteins in lung development. To this end, we have elected to examine a role for the forkhead box (Fox)O group of transcription factors in normal and aberrant lung alveolarization. METHOD(S): FoxO protein and gene expression was assessed by immunoblot and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. The phosphorylation of FoxO proteins (which promotes nuclear exclusion, and hence, is a negative regulator of FoxO-mediated transcriptional regulation) was assessed by immunoblot. RESULT(S): Of the four FoxO proteins, only FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 expression was detected in the lung, where FoxO6 expression was not evident. Once the bulk alveolarization phase of lung development is mice was complete [at post-natal day (P)14)], a pronounced phosphorylation of FoxO1 was detected. This phosphorylation of FoxO1 was reduced during blunted lung alveolarization after exposure of newborn mouse pups to normobaric hyperoxia (85% O2), in a widely-used mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that is characterized by arrested lung alveolarization. The total protein abundance of FoxO1 was also decreased by hyperoxia exposure, while total protein levels of FoxO3 were unchanged. In contrast, the Ser253 phosphorylation of FoxO3, undertaken by Akt, was increased after hyperoxia exposure; while the Ser318/Ser321 phosphorylation of FoxO3, undertaken by ERK1/2, was unchanged. Furthermore, total FoxO4 expression in the lung was reduced by hyperoxia exposure during lung alveolarization. The trends in FoxO protein expression were largely parallel at the gene expression level. Consistent with a downregulation of FoxO1 protein levels after hyperoxia exposure, the expression levels of the FoxO1 target genes p27, CycE1, and Txr1 were also reduced in lungs from hyperoxia-exposed mice. Using isolated primary mouse lung alveolar type II cells, as well as primary mouse lung fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells, FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 were appreciably expressed, while FoxO6 exhibited very low expression levels. We additionally observed that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A could upregulated FoxO1 expression in vitro, which is consistent with the observation that PDGF-A signaling is impaired under hyperoxic conditions. CONCLUSION(S): These novel data underscore potentially exciting roles for FoxO proteins - FoxO1 in particular - as mediators of arrested alveolarization associated with the exposure of newborn mice to hyperoxia.

AB  - RATIONALE: Post-natal lung maturation generates a large number of small alveoli, with concomitant thinning of alveolar septal walls, thereby creating a large surface area over which gas exchange takes place, and minimizing the thickness of the alveolo-capillary barrier. This process is disturbed in disorders of lung development, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Diseases such as BPD are often modeled in the laboratory mouse, to better understand disease pathogenesis, or develop new interventional approaches. To date, there are no reports of stereology-based longitudinal studies on post-natal mouse lung development that report dynamic changes in alveoli number or alveolar septal wall thickness during lung maturation. METHOD(S): We quantified changes in lung structure over the first nine weeks of post-natal life of C57BL/6 mice. Lung tissue was harvested and processed for analysis of lung structure by state-of-the-art design-based stereology. Lungs were fixed by intra-tracheal installation of glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde at 20 cmH2O, embedded in agar, and sectioned (3-mm) for determination of lung volume by the Cavalieri principle, after which, lung sections were treated with arsenic, osmium, and uranium, and embedded in plastic, for systemic uniform random sampling, and subsequent microscopic analysis. RESULT(S): Alveologenesis was evident over the early post-natal phase [post-natal days (P)5-P10], when a step-wise increase in saccular or alveolar density was noted from 3.0 +/- 2.2 x106 sacculi or alveoli/cm3 at P5, to 9.7 +/- 1.2 x106 alveoli/cm3 at P7 (a two-day period), with a further increase to 15.1 +/- 2.6 x106 alveoli/cm3 at P10, after which the rate of increase in alveoli density slowed. The rate of increase of alveoli generation after P10 was commensurate with an increase in lung volume. Concomitant with increasing saccular or alveolar surface area was a decrease in the mean septal wall thickness, which was most dramatic over the first 10 days of post-natal life, where a reduction in mean septal wall thickness from 20.68 +/- 3.37 mum at P5 to 9.99 +/- 2.27 mum at P10. The mean septal wall thickness continued to decrease to 3.87 +/- 0.57 mum by P63. We also make the observation that the increased number of noted alveoli in male versus female mice is attributable entirely to the larger lung volume in male mice. CONCLUSION(S): These entirely novel data provide reference values for parameters of lung structure over the course of post-natal lung development in the mouse.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication or pre-term birth that develops in part from oxygen toxicity, and baro- and volu-trauma during medical management of preterm infants. BPD is often modeled in experimental animals, where the hyperoxia-induced arrest of lung alveolarization in mice recapitulates the alveolar simplification and alveolar septal wall thickening noted in affected patients. A variety of mouse strains are employed by different investigators, sometime yielding conflicting data. To date, to systematic side-by-side comparison has been conducted, evaluating the impact of mouse strain, on the degree of arrest of lung alveolarization after hyperoxia exposure. METHOD(S): Five widely-used mouse strains: C57Bl/6, BALB/c, FVB/n, C3H, and 129Sv, were exposed to normobaric hyperoxia (85% O2) or to room-air (21% O2) for the first 14 days of post-natal life. Lung tissue was harvested and processed for analysis of lung structure by state-of-the-art design-based stereology. Lungs were fixed by intra-tracheal installation of glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde at 20 cmH2 O, embedded in agar, and sectioned (3-mm) for determination of lung volume by the Cavalieri principle, after which, lung sections were treated with arsenic, osmium, and uranium, and embedded in plastic, for systemic uniform random sampling, and subsequent microscopic analysis. In parallel, lung tissue was harvested for immunoblot and gene expression analysis, to monitor trends in the expression of pro- and anti-oxidant systems in the lung. RESULT(S): The number of alveoli and the septal wall thickness was broadly similar across all five strains, in the lungs of mouse pups exposed to room air. There was a pronounced impact of mouse strain on the ability of hyperoxia to arrest lung growth and alveolarization. Total lung volume was decreased in C57Bl/6 mice, and increased in BALB/c mice by hyperoxia, while no effect on lung volume was noted for FVB/n, C3H, and 129Sv after hyperoxia exposure. The C57Bl/6 strain was the most susceptible mouse strain to hyperoxia exposure as neonates, with an 80% decrease in the number of alveoli by post-natal day 14, in contrast to BALB/c, which were largely protected, with a 20% decrease in total alveoli number; with FVB/n, C3H and 129Sv demonstrating intermediate sensitivity. The sensitivity of mouse strains to hyperoxia inversely correlated with changes in the expression of extracellular superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin 1, and correlated directly with baseline expression levels of glutathione synthetase. CONCLUSION(S): These data identify the C57Bl/6 mouse strain as the most sensitive mouse strain to hyperoxia-induced arrest of alveolarization.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic disease of extreme prematurity that has serious long-term consequences including increased asthma risk. We earlier identified IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) as a potent inhibitor of murine BPD induced by combining perinatal inflammation (intraperitoneal LPS to pregnant dams) and exposure of pups to hyperoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.65). In this study, we determined whether airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness similar to asthma are evident in this model, and whether IL-1Ra is protective. During 28-day exposure to air or hyperoxia, pups received vehicle or 10 mg/kg IL-1Ra by daily subcutaneous injection. Lungs were then prepared for histology and morphometry of alveoli and airways, or for real-time PCR, or inflated with agarose to prepare precision-cut lung slices to visualize ex vivo intrapulmonary airway contraction and relaxation by phase-contrast microscopy. In pups reared under normoxic conditions, IL-1Ra treatment did not affect alveolar or airway structure or airway responses. Pups reared in hyperoxia developed a severe BPD-like lung disease, with fewer, larger alveoli, increased subepithelial collagen, and increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and cyclin D1. After hyperoxia, methacholine elicited contraction with similar potency but with an increased maximum reduction in lumen area (air, 44%; hyperoxia, 89%), whereas dilator responses to salbutamol were maintained. IL-1Ra treatment prevented hyperoxia-induced alveolar disruption and airway fibrosis but, surprisingly, not the increase in methacholine-induced airway contraction. The current study is the first to demonstrate ex vivo airway hyperreactivity caused by systemic maternal inflammation and postnatal hyperoxia, and it reveals further preclinical mechanistic insights into IL-1Ra as a treatment targeting key pathophysiological features of BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Post-natal lung development, notably, lung alveolarization, is often studied in the laboratory mouse, both for normal alveolarization, as well as blunted alveolarization associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To this end, a broad spectrum of interventions are often applied by intraperitoneal injections, including the injection of drugs, tamoxifen (for inducible genetic rearrangements), and "scrambled" antagomiRs (to control studies that target microRNA with antagomiRs). To date, the impact of the intervention protocols on lung alveolarization has not been assessed. To this end, we explored whether daily injection of saline, or the administration of tamoxifen or "scrambled" antagomiRs in well-established protocols, had any impact on the postnatal alveolarization of mouse lungs. METHOD(S): Saline was applied by intraperitoneal injection (20 mul) daily. Tamoxifen was applied at post-natal day (P)1 and P2, by intraperitoneal injection (0.4 mg; 20 mul) dissolved in Miglyol. "Scrambled" antagomiRs were applied P2 and P3, by intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg; 20 mul) dissolved in water. In all cases, at P14 mice were sacrificed, lungs were harvested and fixed by intra-tracheal instillation of glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde at 20 cmH2O hydrostatic pressure, embedded in agar, sectioned (3-mm), and total lung volume was assessed by the Cavalieri principle. Lung sections were then treated with arsenic, osmium, and uranium, and embedded in plastic, prior to systematic uniform random sampling for the stereological analysis of lung structure. In parallel, lung tissue was harvested for the unbiased assessment of gene expression by RNA-Seq. RESULT(S): The daily injection of saline (versus no intervention) marginally (but significantly) decreased total lung volume, and was without effect in gene expression, or any other parameters of lung structure, including alveoli number and mean alveolar septal wall thickness. The daily injection of Miglyol increased, while tamoxifen in Miglyol decreased mouse body mass (versus untreated mice), while tamoxifen in Miglyol decreased lung volume, total alveoli number, and septal wall thickness, and had a pronounced effect on gene expression in the lung. One of two "scrambled" antagomiRs slightly (but significantly) decreased total lung volume, decreased alveoli density, and decreased mean alveolar septal wall thickness, while a second "scrambled" antagomiR was without effect. Both antagomiRs had a pronounced impact on gene expression in the lung. CONCLUSION(S): These novel data make the important observation that control interventions are not silent in terms of gene expression, and impact on lung structure, when applied to mice during the first 14 days of post-natal life, in studies on lung development.

AB  - RATIONALE: Lysyl oxidases are copper-dependent amine oxidases historically regarded as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling enzymes, with documented roles in lung development, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, and lung fibrosis. Recent evidence suggests that lysyl oxidases also have physiological functions that are not related to the ECM, and have been identified as components of transcription factor complexes. Thus, we explored a role for lysyl oxidases as transcriptional regulators in primary mouse lung fibroblasts, the key fibrogenic cell-type of the lung. METHOD(S): The expression of the three predominant lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2) was modulated in primary mouse lung fibroblasts using small interfering (si)RNA technology to abrogate gene expression, and lentivirus-mediated delivery to over-express lysyl oxidase family members. After down-regulation or over-expression, the transcriptome of mouse lung fibroblasts was analyzed by microarray. In order to assess whether lysyl oxidase activity was required for transcriptional regulation by lysyl oxidases, the primary mouse lung fibroblasts were treated with the lysyl oxidase inhibitor b-aminopropionitrile, after which, the transcriptome of mouse lung fibroblasts was analyzed by microarray. Lysyl oxidase-regulated genes identified by microarray were validated by real-time RT-PCR, and correlations with gene expression in vitro were made with gene expression in vivo, after treatment of newborn C57Bl/6 mouse pups with beta-aminopropionitrile, or exposure of pups to hyperoxia, which upregulated lysyl oxidase expression. RESULT(S): Three of the five family members, Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 were most highly expressed in primary mouse lung fibroblasts, compared to other constituent cell-types of the lung. Using a microarray approach, siRNA knockdown of Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 deregulated the expression of 134, 3,761 and 3,554 genes, respectively, in primary mouse lung fibroblasts. Lysyl oxidase target-genes identified in this study include Mmp3, Mmp9, Eln, Rarres1, Gdf10, Ifnb1, Cxcl2, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, all of which are relevant to lung development and BPD. In vivo, the expression of these target-genes correlated with Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 expression in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD. Furthermore, using beta-aminopropionitrile, we revealed that the transcriptional regulation activity of lysyl oxidases was independent of catalytic activity both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION(S): This study is the first to report a transcriptome-wide analysis of gene regulation by lysyl oxidases. Furthermore, gene regulation was dependent upon protein expression, but not catalytic activity of lysyl oxidases. This observation is most relevant when considering targeting the enzymatic activity of lysyl oxidases in a therapeutic context.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by decreased lung vascularization and alveolar simplification, and severe BPD is associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH). MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short, non-encoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Currently, the role of miRNA in the development of BPD and PH in BPD is not fully understood. In this study, we wished to identify miRNA that contribute to hyperoxia-induced decreased lung vascularization and PH. Method(s): Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% O2) for 2 weeks (T1) and then allowed to recover in room air for an additional 4 weeks until 6 weeks of age (T2). Lung alveolar and vascular development, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and vessel remodeling were measured at both T1 and T2 time points. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was measured at T2 only. miRNA expression profiling was performed with T1 and T2 lungs using a microarray platform and validated with qPCR. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (HPAEC and HPASMC) were transfected with candidate miRNA mimics and inhibitors and exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (95% O2). Cell proliferation, tube formation, and angiogenic factor expression were measured in HPAEC, while proliferation and smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker protein expression were measured in HPASMC. Result(s): Mice exposed to 2 weeks of hyperoxia exhibited decreased alveolarization and vascularization at T1, which persisted at T2, consistent with a BPD phenotype. At T2, these mice had developed PH, displaying RVH, increased arterial wall thickness, and elevated RVSP compared to control mice. From the miRNA microarray data, we found that miR-133a and miR-133b expression was significantly decreased in both T1 and T2 lungs after hyperoxia. HPAEC exposed to hyperoxia showed decreased proliferation and fewer loops and branches in a tube formation assay. HPAEC that were transfected with miR-133a/b inhibitors in normoxia also had fewer loops and branches in a tube formation assay. Transfection with miR-133a/b mimics restored cell proliferation and loop and branch formation in hyperoxic HPAEC. In normoxia, miR-133a/b mimics induced angiogenic factor expression in HPAEC. In normoxic HPASMC, miR-133a/b mimics decreased proliferation and induced SMC marker expression. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that decreased expression of miR-133 induced by hyperoxia plays a role in the decreased vascularization of the BPD phenotype by suppressing PAEC proliferation and angiogenesis. Decreased expression of miR-133 may also contribute to the subsequent PH phenotype in our model by inducing proliferation and dedifferentiation in PASMC.

AB  - Introduction: Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have a high risk of asthma later in life. Supplemental oxygen, used to treat many premature infants, is a risk factor for BPD and long-term respiratory symptoms. We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice (a model of BPD) increases the number of IL-12 producing Clec9a+CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) and hyperoxia-exposed, but not air-exposed mice, develop enhanced airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in response to rhinovirus (RV). Hyperoxic exposure is associated with lung epithelial cell apoptosis and necrosis. CD103+ DCs phagocytose apoptotic cells which induces immunogenic responses. CD103+ DCs are required for CD8+ T cell IFN-gamma production in mice treated with apoptotic cells and poly(I:C). Clec9a, a C-type lectin selectively expressed on CD103+ DCs, is a receptor for dead cell cytoskeletal actin filaments that signals via the tyrosine kinase Syk and diverts internalized dead cell debris to endosomes, thus favoring cross-presentation on MHC I to CD8+ T cells. Co-administration of Clec9a-targeted antigen and poly(I:C) induces DC maturation and Th1 cell differentiation. We hypothesized that CD103+ DCs and Clec9a signaling are required for hyperoxia-induced enhanced lung inflammation and AHR in response to RV. Method(s): We exposed 2 day-old C57BL/6J, Batf3-/-, Clec9agfp-/- mice to normoxia or hyperoxia for 14 days. In selected experiments, C57BL/6J mice were treated with anti-mouse CD103 antibody or control IgG intraperitoneally on day 0, 7 and 14 of exposure for in vivo depletion of CD103+ DCs. Subsequently, the mice were inoculated with RV intranasally. Five days after RV infection, lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR and ELISA. Lung immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Result(s): To confirm lung CD103+ DC depletion, we examined the lungs after 14 days hyperoxic exposure using flow cytometry. Anti-CD103 treatment significantly reduced the number of lung CD103+ DCs in both normoxia- and hyperoxia-exposed lungs, without significant differences between the two. After RV infection, hyperoxia-exposed IgG-treated mice showed greater increase in IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA compared to air-exposed mice. In contrast, anti-CD103-treated mice were protected from the hyperoxia-induced exaggerated increase in IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA in response to RV. Batf3-/- and Clec9agfp-/- mice were also protected from hyperoxia-induced exaggerated increase in IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA, and IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 protein expression in response to RV. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that hyperoxia-activated lung Clec9a+CD103+ DCs serve as a priming mechanism for exaggerated pro-inflammatory immune responses.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading cause of morbidity in premature infants. Prior work has demonstrated an association with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and BPD. When the Wnt pathway is active, phosphorylation of beta-catenin by tyrosine kinases (TK) at specific sites allows beta-catenin to enter the cell nucleus and initiate a transcription program. Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the environmentally-triggered transcriptomic features of BPD are human-specific and amenable to 3D in vitro modeling. As Wnt/beta-catenin signaling peaks in the developing human lung in the second trimester of gestation, we hypothesize that post-transcriptional phosphorylation of beta-catenin may be involved in BPD pathophysiology. Design/Methods: Human fetal lung fibroblasts (FLF) were cultured on functionalized alginate beads to form 3D mesenchymal organoid structures. The organoids were exposed to a hypoxia-hyperoxia (H-H) model of BPD. Comparisons in gene expression patterns and histology were made using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunofluorescence. Tissue from BPD patient lungs, normal fetal lungs, and normal term lungs was used to validate the model and its pathophysiology. The role of canonical Wnt signaling was assessed with specific TK inhibitors and CHIR, a small molecule that promotes Wnt signaling through GSK3beta inhibition. Result(s): Examination of the Wnt pathway showed nuclear localization of phosphorylated beta-catenin at site Y489 in the H-H treated organoids that was not present in normoxia control organoids. This expression pattern was found in canalicular stage fetal lungs (17 weeks) and in the lungs of infants who died with BPD, but was absent in normal lung controls from stillborn term infants. Exposure to H-H also showed increased expression of beta-catenin and CyclinD1 by qPCR. Activation of beta-catenin signaling with CHIR resulted in development of the BPD phenotype in the setting of normoxia in our 3D model. Inhibiting the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Y489 with dasatinib, a TK inhibitor, inhibited alpha-SMA expression and prevented the BPD phenotype from developing in H-H treated organoids. Conclusion(s): We have developed a 3D model of BPD that recapitulates the fibrotic component of BPD by histopathology and gene expression. Post-translational phosphorylation of b-catenin is a transient feature of normal lung development. Moreover, the persistence of p-b-cateninY489 is a durable marker of fibroblast activaton in BPD, and may play an important role in BPD disease pathobiology. As beta-catenin Y489 is phosphorylated by TK, this finding represents the potential discovery of a druggable target for BPD.

AB  - Purpose: Laryngomalacia is the most common bronchoscopy finding in neonates with obstructive sleep apnea. Severe laryngomalacia can be surgically treated by supraglottoplasty. Supraglottoplasty has been reported to improve sleep apnea in children however the efficacy in neonatal sleep apnea has not been reported. The aim of our study was to compare the outcomes of supraglottoplasty vs. no surgical intervention in neonates with laryngomalacia and neonatal obstructive sleep apnea. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was conducted on all neonates with obstructive sleep apnea (Apnea Hypopnea Index [AHI]>1/hour) and laryngomalacia, diagnosed by flexible bronchoscopy and at least two or more polysomnograms within the first year of life. The cohort was divided into two groups-with and without supraglottoplasty. For the infants who underwent supraglottoplasty, we analyzed the polysomnograms before and after intervention. Infants who had a concomitant surgery for craniofacial anomaly correction or tracheostomy were excluded. Clinical characteristics, bronchoscopic findings, PSG findings were collected on each patient. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the difference in AHI between the baseline values and follow-up PSG values between the two groups. Regression analyses, using generalized estimating equations to incorporate non-linear data, were performed to analyze the relationship between age, intervention, and AHI. Result(s): Of the 31 eligible patients, 7 patients (male=5) underwent supraglottoplasty (Group 1) while 24 (male=13) did not (Group 2). Median birth gestational age of Group 1 was 38 weeks (min,max:27,40) and Group 2 was 31 weeks (min,max:22,40) . Comorbidities included feeding dysfunction (43% vs. 83%, Group 1 vs. Group 2), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (14% vs. 43%, Group 1 vs. Group2), prematurity (57% vs. 75%, Group 1 vs. Group 2) and craniofacial anomalies (14% vs. 4%, Group 1 vs. Group 2). Median AHI and median postmenstrual age at the time of PSG are shown in Table 1. No significant difference existed in reduction of AHI between the groups- Group 1 had a 44.7% reduction in median AHI after supraglottoplasty; compared to a 22.5% (2nd follow up PSG) and 51% (3rd follow up PSG) reduction in median AHI without any supraglottoplasty in Group 2. Both the groups showed comparable decrease in AHI with increasing age (regression coefficient=-0.97, p<0.0001), even after adjustment for birth gestational age. Conclusion(s): A comparable clinical improvement was seen in neonatal obstructive sleep apnea with and without supraglottoplasty. Regardless of birth gestational age, neonatal obstructive sleep apnea improved with time.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen therapy is frequently encountered in the treatment of pulmonary insufficiency, as seen in in premature infants as well as ALI/ARDS patients. However, hyperoxia contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants and ALI/ARDS in children and adults. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that mice lacking the genes for Cyp1a1 and 1a2 (Cyp1a1/1a2 double null) or those lacking Cyp1a1, 1a2, and 1b1 genes (Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1 triple null) will be differentially susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury in vivo, compared to wild type (WT) mice, and that NADPH qunione (NQO1/2) contribute to this phenomenon. Twelve week-old male wild type (WT) (C57BL/6J), Cyp1a1/1a2-double null, or Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1 triple null mice were exposed to hyperoxia (> 95% O2) or room air for 24-72 h. Lung injury and inflammation was assessed by measuring lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios, histology, and neutrophil recruitment by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression of Nrf2 and NQO1 /2 genes was determined in lung by real time RT-PCR. The major findings were that the Cyp1a1/1a2-double null mice were more susceptible to oxygen-mediated lung damage and inflammation than WT, as evidenced by increased lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios, lung injury, neutrophil recruitment, and augmented expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, compared with those in WT mice. The Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1 triple null mice, in contrast, showed protection against hyperoxic lung injury, as indicated by decrease in each of the lung injury parameters. In room air, pulmonary Nrf2, NQO1 and NQO2 mRNA levels in the triple null mice were much higher than those of WT or double null mice. NQO1 was induced by hyperoxia in each of the genotypes, with the triple null mice showing the maximal induction at the 72 h time point. That Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1 triple null mice show attenuation of hyperoxic lung injury suggests that lack of CYP1B1 or induction of NQO1 contributed to the protective effects. Future research could lead to the development of novel strategies for prevention and/or treatment of BPD and ALI/ARDS.

AB  - Rationale: We recently discovered the role of microRNAs (miR) in BPD. In addition, airways of infants with severe BPD harbor a dysbiotic microbiome, with increased Proteobacterial abundance. Method(s): 1. Exosomes were extracted and characterized (quantity, size) using NanoSight. From: A) Tracheal Aspirates (TA) obtained from infants with severe BPD infants. Gestation matched full term infants with no lung disease were used as controls. b) Human bronchial epithelial cell (NHBE) supernatants - normoxia (21% O2) vs hyperoxia (85% O2); Proteobacterial lipopolyssachride (LPS) vs saline. 24 hour exposures. 2. A Prospective cohort study was conducted with separate discovery (Birmingham, AL) and validation (Philadelphea, PA) cohort of preterm infants. Total 805 different exosomal microRNAs were analyzed in each of the 30 early TA samples, using Nanostring platform. Statistical modeling and pathway analysis were conducted between BPD Susceptible vs BPD Resistant infants. 3. The top predictive miR was identified and further studied by in vitro and in vivo hyperoxia models, utilizing NHBE and C57BL6 mice respectively. Mimic miR (gain of function) and Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) miR (loss of function) were used for functional analysis of miR. 4. For effects of microbiota on miR, in vitro and in vivo hyperoxia experiments were conducted with Proteobacterial lipopolyssachride (LPS) inoculation in NHBE cells and postnatal intratracheal LPS administration in mice, respectively. Result(s): (All differences p<0.05) 1. TA from infants with BPD, and hyperoxia or LPS exposed NHBE cell supernatants, had larger but fewer exosomes. 2. After validation, out of all mu 800 miRs, five miRs were differentially expressed between BPD Susceptible and BPD Resistant infants. Out of these five, miR-876-3p was most significantly decreased at birth in infants who developed BPD. 3. Exosomal miR-876-3p in BPD: a) In vitro: miR 876-3p was decreased in hyperoxic NHBE cells compared to normoxic cells. Top targets of miR876-3p - RBBP61 and MCL1 were correspondingly increased in hyperoxia. On functional analysis- mimic miR 876-3p increased miR 876-3p and reduced target genes expression. LNA miR 876-3p reduced miR 876-3p and increased target genes expression. b) In vivo: Hyperoxia pups showed decreased miR 876-3p (P14). 4. Microbiota regulates miR-876-3p: a) In vitro: LPS significantly reduced the expression of miR 876-3p in normoxic and hyperoxic cells, compared to hyperoxia or normoxia alone. b) In vivo: Postnatal LPS reduced miR 876-3p in normoxia and hyperoxia pups compared to controls (P14). Conclusion(s): Decreased airway exosomal miR 876-3p predicts severe BPD, and is regulated by microbiota.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infants in the US, affecting up to 45% of infants born before 29 weeks of gestation. The lung epithelium shows impaired maturation and survival in BPD. Basement membrane (BM) plays a crucial role in mechanical support and signaling to epithelial cells during lung development. Abnormal composition and remodeling of the BM has been associated with developmental abnormalities observed in BPD. Type VI collagen (Col6) is a well-studied component of muscle BM, but its effect on pulmonary epithelium is largely undetermined. Method(s): Col6 isoform expression was measured in lung tissue samples from infants with and without BPD, and in animal models of BPD. We studied multiple models of human pulmonary epithelial cells (NHBE, 16HBE), including a novel primary epithelial cell model grown from normal pediatric lung tissue digests (PHLE). Cells were cultured on Matrigel, Col6, Col1 or a combination of matrices. Cell adherence, spreading, proliferation, tight junction formation and injury response was tested. The role of specific signaling intermediates was assessed by Western blot, and using blocking antibodies and inhibitors. Result(s): Compared to normal infant lung tissue, mRNA expression of Collagen 6a5 (fold change/FC = 0.47, p=0.03) and protein levels of collagen 6a1 in human BPD lung tissue (FC=0.22, p=3.7e-2) were reduced. We also observed a 2-fold reduction in mRNA expression of Col6 isoforms in hyperoxia-exposed mouse lung. There were no differences in cell adhesion or proliferation on any matrix tested. However, all cell models tested showed an increased rate of spreading when plated on Col6 (2-3-fold; p<0.05). Col6 promoted greater monolayer resistance (Col6 vs. Matrigel, FC=2.29 P=6.02e-5). Human lung epithelial cells also displayed greater injury response when plated on Col6, as evidenced by more rapid closure of experimental scratch wounds (Col6 vs. Matrigel, P=8.96e-4). FAK and PI3K phosphorylation were elevated in cells plated on Col6 compared to other matrices. Integrin beta1 blocking reduced the rate of spreading on Col6 (FC=0.61, p=9.99e-3), with no detectable effect on Col1 or Matrigel. While inhibition of ERK (FR180204) reduced spreading on all matrices, inhibition of PI3K (LY294002) resulted in significant and specific reduction in the rate of spreading on Col6 (FC=0.49, p=4.19e-6). Summary: Col6 has significant and specific effects upon human lung epithelial cell-autonomous functions, and may regulate injury-repair responses contributing to BPD pathogenesis. These responses appear to be mediated, in part, by integrin beta1 signaling through FAK and PI3K.

AB  - Introduction: The pulmonary component of the human respiratory microbiome is transplanted into the lung transplant (LTX) recipient and includes resident and transient bacteria and viruses (the human respiratory virome). We explored factors which influence the dynamics of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) microbiome including the role of donor colonisation, community acquired respiratory viruses (CARV) and targeted antimicrobial therapies. Method(s): Single center, prospective, longitudinal study of organisms detected in pre-operative sputa and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), explanted lungs, donor lungs prior to implantation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) post-operative days (POD) 1, 7, 21, 42, 63, 84. Samples were processed to isolate nucleic acids, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR for CARV [human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A (Flu A) and B (Flu B), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3, and human metapneumovirus]. Result(s): 19 consecutive LTX recipients (bilateral: heart lung = 18:1) (age 48 +/- 14 years, mean +/-SD) (M= 9) were recruited during winter. Indications were cystic fibrosis (n=1), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n=1), infective endocarditis (n=1), chronic lung allograft dysfunction (n=4), interstitial lung disease (n=5) and emphysema (n=7). Follow up was 67+/-37 days, range 15-128 days. Bacteria +/- fungi were detected in 4/19 pre-LTX sputa, 17/19 donor swabs and 6/19 POD 1 BAL (5/6 donor organisms) and thereafter in 8/19 patients (2/8 on multiple BAL). Most frequent donor organisms were gram negative bacilli (GNB) (n=11), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n=9), Candida albicans (n=2) and Aspergillus fumigatus (n=1). GNB (n=4) and Candida (n=1) were co-detected with MSSA. Only 1 donor derived organism was cultured after POD 1 (Aspergillus) and 1 pre-LTX organism (P. aeruginosa). 2 donors had Flu (A =1, B =1), recipients received oseltamivir. Despite vaccination and negative recipient NPS, 4 explanted lungs demonstrated Flu A. Flu A was detected in POD1 BAL in 9/19 and persisted for 3-6 weeks. 16/19 patients had CARV post LTX (11/16 on multiple BAL), including Flu A (n=14), HRV (n=5), Flu B (n=2), and PIV (n=2). HRV (n=3) and PIV (n=1) were co-detected with Flu A. Conclusion(s): CARV (particularly Flu A in winter) are more common and persistent after LTX than previously described, likely reflecting induction immunosuppression. Targeted antimicrobial therapy appeared effective in modulating early infection as assessed by prospective surveillance. Our longitudinal study, which includes next generation sequencing (not reported here) holds promise of elucidating long-term outcomes associated with the dynamics of the pulmonary microbiome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality during infancy. Evidence suggests that the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway plays an integral role in lung inflammation and injury. This study aimed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR pathway genes [TLR5 and Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)] among preterm neonates and to determine their association with the development and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of pre-term birth characterized by a pronounced arrest of lung alveolarization. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the blunted alveolarization in BPD have not been clarified, however, aberrant gene regulation, attributable in part to deregulated microRNA expression has been proposed as one pathomechanism at play in BPD patients. To this end, using a microRNA microarray, we have previously identified the deregulated expression of multiple microRNA species in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD. Amongst the microRNA species identified as being de-regulated, miR-135b emerged as a leading candidate. Thus, we resolved to address a potential role for miR-135b in normal and aberrant lung alveolarization. METHOD(S): Gene expression analysis in primary mouse alveolar type II cells was undertaken by 38K Agilent microarray. Gene and protein expression were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, respectively. MicroRNA expression was localized using a miR-135b::LacZ gene trapped mouse strain. In vitro, microRNA levels were modulated by administration of a microRNA mimic (for microRNA over-expression), while mRNA levels were modulated by small interfering (si)RNA application (for gene knockdown). In vivo, microRNA function was antagonized using an antagomiR directed against miR-135b, which was applied on post-natal day (P)1 and P3 to newborn mice. BPD was modelled by exposure of newborn mice to normobaric hyperoxia (85% O2). Lung structure was assessed by state-of-the-art design-based stereology. RESULT(S): Using a gene expression screen of primary mouse lung alveolar type II cells, as well as primary mouse lung fibroblasts, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and macrophages, together with in situ LacZ-staining, revealed pronounced expression of miR-135b in the lung alveolar epithelium. In vivo, exposure of newborn mouse pups to hyperoxia led to a pronounced increase in the expression of miR-135b in the lung. In silico, Smad5 was identified as a miR-135b target, and the hyperoxia-driven downregulation of Smad5 expression was restored after miR-135b neutralization using an antagomiR directed against miR-135b. Antagonism of miR-135b function in vivo, in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD moderately improved alveoli number and alveoli density, implying causal role for miR-135b in hyperoxia-driven perturbations to lung structure. CONCLUSION(S): These data underscore a hitherto unrecognized role for miR-135b in the arrested alveolarization associated with exposure of newborn mice to hyperoxia. These affects appear to be related to restoration of Smad5 expression levels, which implicates transforming growth factor (TGF)beta signaling in the miR-135b pathway during lung alveolarization.

AB  - Rationale: Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD. BPD is characterized by impaired alveolar secondary septation and vascular growth. Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) contributes to its development. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. In this study, we employed a non-biased approach to measure global changes in gene expression and DNA methylation following hyperoxia exposure in male and female mice. Method(s): Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-5: saccular stage) and sacrificed on PND 7 and 21. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data was mapped to the mouse genome using TopHat2, and quantified using Cufflinks2. Gene expression data was quantile normalized and analyzed using the R statistical software (Version 3.2.1). A combination of selection criteria comprising nominal p-values <0.05 and linear fold change greater or lesser than 1.25 was used to generate differential expressed genes (DEGs) profiles. Enriched pathways and processes were inferred using the hypergeometric distribution, and various gene set collections as compiled in the Molecular Signature Database compendium. To detect and quantify DNA methylation, we performed 5-methylcytosine ELISA on lung DNA samples (PND 21). Result(s): A total of 119 (up-regulated (UR): 40, down-regulated (DR): 70) and 198 (UR: 117, DR: 81) genes were differentially expressed following hyperoxia in neonatal female mice at PND7 and PND21 respectively. Pathway analysis revealed differential sex-specific modulation of key pathways on PND7 and PND21. In the early repair phase (PND7), myogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Notch signaling and angiogenesis were down regulated in males compared to females. In the late repair phase (PND21), females showed down regulation in the cellular defense response, allograft rejection and PD1 signaling compared to males. Hyperoxia decreased DNA methylation in both male and female mice but the decrease was more significant in male mice compared to similarly exposed females. Conclusion(s): Target genes in myogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Notch signaling and angiogenesis in the early phase after hyperoxia exposure and cellular defense response, allograft rejection and PD1 signaling pathways may explain the differences in susceptibility of male and female neonatal mice to HLI. Differences in the epigenome partly though DNA methylation may explain the changes in gene expression responsible for the differential pathway modulation described above. These findings provide novel insights in the differential sex-specific modulation of the pulmonary transcriptome in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury.

AB  - Rationale: Normal lung alveolar septation is a complex process that involves the spatial and temporal integration of several signals from multiple cross-talking pathways. Its disruption causes several diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which affects infants born prematurely. Despite significant progress in our understanding of the normal lung alveolar septation process, the molecular mechanisms that govern it are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide changes in DNA methylation during the alveolar phase of lung development. Method(s): Mouse genomic DNA from lung tissues was isolated from Laser-capture microdissected (LCM) samples at different time points during lung development: saccular stage (P0.5, and P2.5) and alveolar stage (P7, P10, P19 and P28). Three biological samples per time point were analyzed by Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation-Next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) to determine genome-wide CpG methylation. MEDIP-seq libraries were constructed using 125 ng of DNA. Libraries were uploaded onto an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform for ultra deep sequencing with single reads of 50 bases. Forty million reads per sample were sequenced. Result(s): Overall, MEDIP-seq data show that CpG methylation changes over time. GO enrichment analyses indicate that metabolic processes, binding, and catalytic activities are high in all time points. Transmembrane transport goes up at P0.5, then down, then up again at P7, P19 and P28. Phosphorous metabolism prominent at P0.5, P7, P10 and P28. Single-organism localization up at P7, P10 and P19. Furthermore, by performing genome-wide differential coverage analysis, we were able to identify a set of genes implicated in cell growth, development, or differentiation that were differentially methylated at several time points during lung development. Conclusion(s): Early changes in DNA methylation seems to initiate and shape lung alveolar development.

AB  - Introduction: Premature birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are associated with long-term respiratory sequelae. Supplemental oxygen, used to treat many premature infants, is a risk factor for BPD and long-term respiratory symptoms. We have recently used a murine model of BPD to show that hyperoxia alters lung innate immunity both at baseline and upon viral exposure. The mechanism of this hyperoxia-induced immune modulation is undetermined. Microbiota of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract play essential roles in maintaining immune homeostasis. A recent report demonstrated that infants with BPD have profoundly altered respiratory microbiota. The effects of hyperoxia on respiratory microbiota, and the resultant host immune responses, are unknown. We hypothesized that hyperoxia alters lung and gut microbiota in newborn mice. Method(s): We exposed 2 day-old mice to normoxia or 75% oxygen. After 14 days of exposure, we sampled microbiota from the lung, tongue, and lower gastrointestinal tract using a culture-independent approach (community sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, Illumina MiSeq). Result(s): Neonatal hyperoxic exposure significantly altered bacterial communities in the lungs (P = 0.008, PERMANOVA) and gut (cecum and colonic mucosa) (P < 0.001 for both) of neonatal mice. As shown in the attached figure, principal component analysis confirmed the distinct microbiota detected in lungs of hyperoxia- and normoxia-exposed mice. Oral communities were unchanged (P > 0.05), indicating that the ecological effects of hyperoxia were lung-specific within the respiratory tract. Lung communities were altered in the ecologically predicted fashion: the most abundant taxonomic group in normoxia-exposed lungs - a strict anaerobe, Erysipelotrichaceae sp. - was undetectable in hyperoxia-exposed lungs (P < 0.001), while a prominent aerobic Streptococcus group was enriched in hyperoxia-exposed lungs (P < 0.05). Community richness (the number of detectable species) was decreased in hyperoxia-exposed lungs, ceca and colonic mucosa (P < 0.05 for all comparisons), suggesting the extinction of oxygen-intolerant species. Conclusion(s): In neonatal mice, hyperoxia profoundly alters lung and gut microbiota, decreasing diversity and enriching the lungs with oxygen-tolerant bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus spp.). Our results identify a novel mechanism - lung and gut dysbiosis - by which hyperoxia may promote local and systemic inflammation in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Neonatal care has drastically improved resulting in survival of extremely premature babies and increased incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) associated comorbidities. Among that, Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) has high mortality and morbidity. The diagnosis of PH is difficult since the symptoms overlap with severe BPD. Cardiac catheterization is a highly invasive gold standard procedure for diagnosing PH. As part of a pilot study we evaluated tracheal aspirate samples for proteomic and miRNA profiles to find potential biomarkers that can be used to identify the onset of BPD and PH collectively. We aimed to analyze the association of these proteins and miRNAs in different cellular pathways. Method(s): We collected tracheal aspirates from infants at the Penn State Children's hospital NICU. Patients(n=56) had confirmed clinical diagnosis of mild/moderate BPD(n=7), severe BPD(n=21), PH(n=3), severe BPD+PH (n=8), or no history of lung disease (controls, n=17). The miRNA fraction was purified with the miRNA Purification Kit (Norgen), and the expression of 1,066 human miRNAs was quantified with miScript miRNA PCR Array Human miRNome array (Qiagen). The proteomic profile of these samples was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and results of both were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen). Result(s): Analysis of miRNA and proteomic profiles identified specific signatures for each group. Of these were 5 miRNAs with at least 4-fold difference in infants with mild BPD, 6 miRNAs in severe BPD, and 16 miRNAs in BPD+PH vs. control. The most significantly differentially expressed miRNAs among groups were miR-490-3p, miR-450b-3p and miR-507. Mass spec analysis identified 14 differentially expressed proteins in the BPD+PH group vs. BPD alone and controls. Of these, catalase, IGLL, S100A8, BPIFB1, and clusterin showed the greatest differences. IPA results predicted associations of these proteins with pro-inflammatory pathways. The primary pathways led to expression of iNOS (inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase), IFNgamma, JAK, and STAT proteins, which are known regulators of iNOS. The IPA miRNA analysis showed interactions with TP-53 and CDKN1A, which are cell cycle regulators in BPD+PH, as well as involvement of NF-kB in pro-inflammatory pathways. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to identify neonatal PH and BPD associated miRNA and proteomic profiles in tracheal aspirates from mechanically-ventilated infants. IPA analysis suggested the involvement of multiple pathways that control inflammatory and morphometric characteristics of BPD and PH. The differentially expressed molecules identified may reveal specific candidate genes involved in the disease pathogenesis and represent potential novel non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis.

AB  - Rationale: Hyperoxia increases oxidative stress and contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Thioredoxin (Trx) reductase 1 (TrxR1) reduces oxidized Trx to the active reduced form. A new function of TrxR1 has been recently reported wherein TrxR1, in response to excessive oxidation, forms a visible dimer on western blot, which possibly alters its ability to reduce oxidized Trx1. Our group has reported the protective effects of aurothioglucose (ATG) in a mouse model of BPD that is associated with persistent Trx1 oxidation. The present studies tested the hypothesis that hyperoxia induces TrxR1 dimer formation that can be prevented by ATG treatment. Method(s): Newborn C3H/HeN mice were treated with a single dose of 25mg/kg ATG or saline within 12h of birth and were exposed to either room air (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2). Lungs from D3 mice were collected. In vitro, murine-transformed club cells (mtCCs) were treated with 5 muM ATG or vehicle and exposed to RA or hyperoxia for 24h. TrxR1 dimer expression (100-150 kDa) was determined by western blot using tissue homogenates and cell lysates. Result(s): In vivo, TrxR1 dimer levels were low in lungs from control and ATG-treated mice raised in RA. In hyperoxia-exposed mice, TrxR1 dimer formation was significantly enhanced in saline-treated pup lungs. Conversely, TrxR1 dimer levels were less abundant in lungs from ATG-treated animals. In vitro, TrxR1 dimer levels were low in control and ATG-treated mtCCs exposed to RA. Exposure of mtCCs to hyperoxia resulted in increased dimer formation. In contrast to studies in vivo, ATG treatment failed to prevent dimer formation in vitro. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia causes TrxR1 dimer formation in newborn murine lungs in vivo and in lung epithelial cells in vitro. We speculate that TrxR1 dimer formation may impair the ability of TrxR1 to reduce oxidized Trx1 and contribute to persistent Trx1 oxidation previously reported by our group in this newborn BPD model. The lack of an effect of ATG in vitro may be related to the time point selected for study or the complex biochemical events that occur in tissues that are not easily replicated in cells. Prevention of TrxR1 dimer formation by ATG in vivo is likely to preserve Trx1 in its reduced state, preserving Trx1-reguated signaling pathways that guide proper alveolar development. Studies are underway to define the biologic effects of TrxR1 dimer formation in the newborn lung, its prevention by ATG, and effects on cell signaling and lung development.

AB  - Rationale: Viral respiratory infections are often grouped as a single respiratory syndrome named "viral bronchiolitis", independently of the viral etiology or individual risk factors. Clinical trials and guidelines have used a more stringent definition of viral bronchiolitis, including only the first episode of wheezing in children less than 12 months of age without concomitant respiratory comorbidities. There is increasing evidence suggesting that this definition is not being followed by pediatric care providers but it is unclear to what extend viral respiratory infections are currently misclassified as viral bronchiolitis using standard definitions. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of the Viral Immuno-genetic Responses of the Airways and the Lungs (VIRAL) cohort at Children's National Medical System was performed. For the purpose of this study we included hospitalized children with a positive viral PCR. Demographic variables were obtained by review of EMR at Children's National Medical Center and included age, gender and ethnicity. Bronchiolitis was defined as the first wheezing episode less than 12 months of age; prior history of wheezing or ICS use and comorbidities were characterized as a binary outcome. Comorbidities included history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, complex congenital heart disease, neuromuscular and metabolic disorders. Result(s): The study comprised a total of 513 hospitalizations (n=453). Viral bronchiolitis was diagnosed in 122 admissions (23.8%). The mean age was 0.9 months (IQR 0.38-1.33). Sixty one percent of children (n=74) had a co-morbid condition, 41.8% (n=51) had prior inhaled corticosteroid use suggestive of known reactive airway disease, 63% (n=77) had history of prior wheezing. Children misclassified with bronchiolitis had a statistically higher mean age 1.15 years (+/- SD 0.63). Conclusion(s): Misclassification of bronchiolitis is a common problem which may lead to inappropriate management of viral respiratory infections in young children. It is critically important for clinicians to understand the applicability and limitations of the evidence generated in viral bronchiolitis research. A comprehensive approach which takes into consideration viral etiology and individual risk factors may lead to a more accurate clinical assessment of this condition and would potentially prevent bronchiolitis misclassification.

AB  - RATIONALE Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are twice as likely to require re-hospitalization in the first two years than preterm children without BPD. Although all infants born preterm have higher rates of pulmonary problems than infants born at term, many infants with BPD experience sequelae even into adolescence and adulthood. METHODS A prospective cohort of infants in neonatal intensive care units within Cleveland Clinic Children's were identified. Serum samples were obtained at birth, and a highly-sensitive immunoassay was used to measure Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) protein concentration. Participants consented to be followed for 18 years, completing annual telephone follow-up calls. RESULTS This is an interim analysis of 10 patients who have completed the 12-month follow-up questionnaire and 12 patients who have completed the 24-month questionnaire. In each cohort, 4 patients had a history of BPD. Surprisingly, in each cohort, infants with a history of BPD did not differ from infants without a history of BPD regarding number of wheezing episodes, common colds, sick visits, hospital readmissions, and diagnoses of reactive airway disease. Serum BDNF levels were compared to clinical outcomes at one and two years. Within the first year, serum BDNF may be associated with the number of common colds (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.95; p<0.001). However, this finding needs to be confirmed in a larger sample. CONCLUSIONS Serum levels of BDNF may provide valuable information for the postnatal course. This early biomarker may help to set expectations for a child's long-term respiratory outcomes. Further analysis and adjustment for other patient characteristics is needed as more data is collected.

AB  - Rationale: Mast cells are derived from circulating progenitors (MCP) and differentiate following recruitment to target organs, under instructions of the local tissue microenvironment. Two major mast cell sub-populations are recognized; the mucosal subtype (MCT) that express tryptase (TPSAB1, TPSB2), and the connective tissue subtype (MCCT) that express carboxypeptidase (CPA3), chymase (CMA1) and tryptase. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) regulates MCP differentiation, and is suspected to play a role in regulating mast cell subtype. However, the detailed mechanisms controlling mast cell phenotypes remain unclear. Method(s): Umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCMC) were cultured for up to 4 weeks under conditions promoting mast cell differentiation. Human mast cell line (LUVA) was grown under standard conditions. 16HBE human lung epithelial cells were differentiated at air-liquid interface. Trolox, a vitamin E analog, was used to modulate oxidative stress levels in cultured LUVA cells. Mast cell phenotype was assessed by Wright-Giemsa stain and quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Result(s): UCMC cultures generated mast cells with 10% at week 1 and maximum 80% at week 4. However, the mast cells remained heterogeneous in size. UCMCs underwent spontaneous differentiation towards MCCT as evidenced by expression of all mast cell proteases peaking at week 4 (FCCPA3= 9.52, FCCMA1= 12.75, FCTPSAB1=9.45). Interestingly, induction of CPA3 occurred at 1 week, earlier than TPSAB1 and CMA1. MITF expression also peaked at week 4 of UCMC culture (FCMITF=2.87). Untreated LUVA cells also appeared to have an MCCT phenotype. Supplementation of LUVA cultures with Trolox led to a rapid and temporary phenotypic shift towards a mucosal subtype, characterized by a 78.6% reduction in CPA3 (p<0.01) and 53.9% reduction in CMA1 (p<0.01), while maintaining robust TPSAB1 expression (FC=6.05, p<0.01). Trolox also resulted in an 83.9% reduction (p<0.01) of MITF expression. Culturing LUVA cells with 16HBE grown at ALI, or with 16HBE cells conditioned medium, resulted in a phenotypic shift towards a mucosal subtype, as evidenced by a 66.4% reduction of CPA3 (p<0.01) and 98.7% reduction in CMA1 (p<0.05), while increasing TPSAB1 6-fold (p<0.01) and MITF 2-fold (p<0.01). Interestingly, the effects of mast cell phenotypic programming by16HBE persisted after separation of cell types. Summary: Our data, together with our prior work, suggests that cell-cell interactions, and changes in lung oxidative stress levels, may contribute to the pathological accumulation of MCCT in the lungs of preterm infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.

AB  - Introduction Hypercarbia is a common abnormality seen in premature babies, usually caused by lung disease. We report a rare cause of persistent hypercarbia observed in twins that were born premature. Case report Male monochorionic, diamniotic twins were born at 31 weeks gestation by cesarean section due to premature rupture of membranes. Both babies required intubation after birth due to respiratory failure. Twin B had mild respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis, pneumonia and upper airway obstruction were initially ruled out in both. Following initial intubation and stabilization, both twins failed multiple attempts to wean off ventilator support due to persistent respiratory acidosis. Episodes of apnea did not respond to caffeine. Chest X-rays in both showed changes of mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Cardiac, hematologic and neurologic evaluations were negative. Both babies required placement of tracheostomy at 2 months of age for inability to wean from respiratory support. Persistent hypercarbia out of proportion to lung disease raised suspicion of central dysregulation of respiration. Genetic studies were sent for both with positive results for paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX 2B) 25/20 gene mutation confirming the diagnosis of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Both babies were discharged from hospital on home mechanical ventilator support. Discussion Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by disordered respiratory control and resultant alveolar hypoventilation due to diffuse autonomic nervous system dysregulation. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene located on chromosome 4. Depending on genetic variation due to number of polyalanine repeats, there can be considerable difference in phenotypic expression. As a result of hypoventilation, these individuals become hypoxemic and hypercarbic but typically lack the ability to respond to these endogenous stimuli of ventilation regulation. Hirschsprung disease, tumors of neural crest origin, cardiac asystole and symptoms reflecting autonomic nervous system dysregulation have been associated with CCHS. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome in twin babies, especially those born premature, has rarely been reported. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a significant cause of respiratory illness in premature babies. In this instance, both twins did not respond to traditional management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Persistent hypercarbia out of proportion to lung disease should raise suspicion for abnormalities affecting control of ventilation such as CCHS. Patients with PHOX 2B, 25/20 mutation are reported to be ventilator dependent only during sleep, but both of these babies currently require 24 hour ventilator support, possibly due to coexisting bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - In premature infants, sepsis is associated with alveolar simplification manifesting as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The redox-dependent mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced inflammation and alveolar remodeling in the immature lung remain unclear. We developed a neonatal mouse model of sepsis-induced lung injury to investigate whether nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammation and alveolar remodeling. Six-day-old NOX2+/+ and NOX2-/- mice were injected with intraperitoneal LPS to induce sepsis. Lung inflammation and canonical TLR signaling were assessed 24 hours after LPS. Alveolar development was examined in 15-day-old mice after LPS on Day 6. The in vivo efficacy of a NOX2 inhibitor (NOX2-I) on NOX2 complex assembly and sepsis-induced lung inflammation were examined. Lung cytokine expression and neutrophil influx induced with sepsis in NOX2+/+ mice was decreased by >50% in NOX2-/- mice. LPS-induced TLR4 signaling evident by inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase-beta and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and nuclear factor-kappaB/AP-1 translocation were attenuated in NOX2-/- mice. LPS increased matrix metalloproteinase 9 while decreasing elastin and keratinocyte growth factor levels in NOX2+/+ mice. An LPS-induced increase in matrix metalloproteinase 9 and decrease in fibroblast growth factor 7 and elastin were not evident in NOX2-/- mice. An LPS-induced reduction in radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts were attenuated in NOX2-/- mice. LPS-induced NOX2 assembly evident by p67phox/gp91phox coimmunoprecipitation was disrupted with NOX2-I. NOX2-I also mitigated LPS-induced cytokine expression, TLR pathway signaling, and alveolar simplification. In a mouse model of neonatal sepsis, NOX2 regulates proinflammatory TLR signaling and alveolar remodeling induced by a single dose of LPS. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of sepsis-induced alveolar remodeling in the developing lung.

AB  - Rationale: Despite advances in neonatology, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a serious medical problem with long-term consequences. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are long-living cells which populate lung soon after birth and maintain their population via proliferation, without contribution from circulating monocytes. Normally AM play an essential role in maintaining lung homeostasis and limiting inflammatory response to the pathogens. We hypothesize that neonatal exposure to hyperoxia may shape these long-living AM into pro-inflammatory cells, which contribute to the development of BPD. We sought to investigate the kinetic and phenotype of AM in a mouse model of BPD and to test whether depletion of hyperoxia-primed AM and recruitment of the monocyte-derived AM under the normoxic conditions may improve outcomes in mouse model of BPD. Method(s): Newborn mice were exposed to room air (normoxia) or 85% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 days (P0-P14). AM were depleted via intranasal instillation of clodronate-loaded liposomes at P14, control group received PBS. Lungs were analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry at P14 and P28. In addition, we performed gene expression profiling of the FACSorted AM, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and endothelial cells at P14 and 28 via RNA-seq. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure affected lung development (increased mean alveolar area, decreased alveolar count, decreased number of small vessels at P14 and P28). At P14 number of AM was decreased in hyperoxia-exposed mice and AM had inflammatory phenotype. By P28 number of AM was expanded in hyperoxia-exposed mice. Intranasal administration of clodronate-loaded liposomes at P14 depleted ~50% of AM and induced recruitment of the circulating monocytes to repopulate the niche. This partial depletion of hyperoxia-primed inflammatory AM resulted in partial reversal of BPD phenotype (decrease in mean alveolar area, increase in mean alveolar count and number of small vessels). To unravel contribution of AM to the development and amelioration of BPD phenotype we performed transcriptional profiling via RNA-seq of the whole lung tissue, and FACSorted AM, AT2 cells and lung endothelial cells during the course of BPD with and without treatment with clodronate-loaded liposomes. Conclusion(s): Neonatal hyperoxia exposure can induce long-lasting pro-inflammatory AM phenotype which can contribute to the development of BPD. Depletion of hyperoxia-primed AM and recruitment of the new AM under normoxia conditions resulted in partial reversal of PBD phenotype in mouse. Long-living hyperoxia-primed AM can modulate gene expression in AT2 cells and affect the long-term outcomes of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: With no effective treatment to prevent or reverse bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a multifactorial chronic lung disease of preterm infants, the need for new therapies is urgent. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have shown promise in numerous preclinical models of lung pathologies relevant to neonatology. We have shown that the therapeutic capacity of MSCs is comprised in their secretome, and our recent studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic vector is represented by the exosomes (extracellular vesicles; EVs) they release. Here, we aimed to purify and comprehensively characterize MSC-EVs from both human bone marrow (BMSC) and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (WJ) and investigate the efficacy of MSC-EV treatments in BPD. Method(s): EVs in conditioned media were isolated by density on iodixanol gradient and characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot. Proteomic profiling was obtained by LC-MS. Immunomodulatory capacity of MSC-EVs was assessed by an in vitro macrophage polarization assay. Newborn FVB mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% O2) for 7 days (postnatal day (PN) 1-7). At PN 4 mice were treated with a bolus intravenous dose of purified MSC-EVs or human dermal fibroblast-EVs (HDF-EVs). After hyperoxic exposure the mice were placed in room air for one to five weeks. Histological analysis of lungs harvested at PN 14 and PN 42 was performed to assess alveolar injury, blood vessel number and vascular remodeling. At PN 42, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed and pulmonary function tests were conducted. Result(s): EVs immunoblots were positive for CD9, TSG101 and Alix. Proteomic profiling of WJMSC-EVs and HDF-EVs detected species unique or differentially enriched in MSC-EVs. In vitro, addition of MSC-EVs to alveolar macrophages (MH-S cell line) significantly reduced the induction of M1 markers such as TNFalpha and CCL5. Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited a significantly higher mean linear intercept compared to normoxic controls or to hyperoxia-exposed mice treated with either BMSC-EVs or WJMSC-EVs, whereas HDF-EV treatment had no beneficial effect on lung architecture. Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited elevated RVSP compared to normoxic control mice, which was effectively reduced by treatment with BMSC-EVs or WJMSC-EVs. Conclusion(s): We show that a bolus dose of purified human MSC-EVs, from two different MSC sources effectively alleviates core features of hyperoxia-induced BPD, drastically improving lung development and associated pulmonary hypertension, providing a novel platform for a new therapeutic intervention in newborn cardio-respiratory diseases.

AB  - Introduction: Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are known for their ability to contract and orchestrate airway peristalsis, support epithelial airway structure, and control epithelial differentiation in the developing rodent lung. Lung branching has been extensively studied in animal models, however little is known about the mechanisms underlying branching morphogenesis in the human lung. We hypothesize that smooth muscle cells invest the branch tips and guide branching in the human lung. Method(s): Fresh human fetal lung tissue between gestational ages 10-14 weeks were collected and either stained or used for culture. Distal lung segments (1-3 mm3) with intact edges were cultured in air-liquid interface for up to 72 hours. Explants were treated with different factors known to alter smooth muscle cell differentiation (FGF7, Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766). Result(s): We showed that in human fetal lung, smooth muscle cells extend to the very distal part of the lung where they invest the clefts in between branch sites. Analyses of ACTA2 expression in early human lung showed that smooth muscle cells arrange prior to epithelial branching. Moreover, we showed that in response to FGF7, a strong decrease in smooth muscle cell differentiation is observed accompanied with impaired branching and cysting of the distal buds. Whereas, when we treat human lung explants with Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766, we demonstrated an increase in smooth muscle differentiation, yet branching was also impaired. We then video-imaged the explants during culture for 48 hours and observed that in presence of NSC23766, peristalsis is severely impaired, suggesting that smooth muscle cell contractility plays an important role in proper branching morphogenesis in the human lung. Conclusion(s): We have determined that the pattern of smooth muscle cells is different in human fetal lung than in mouse lung. Moreover, we showed that contractility of smooth muscle cells is required for proper lung branching. Manipulating smooth muscle cell function to correct branching failure could lead to developing new targets for preventive or therapeutic avenues for lung diseases where branching is severely impaired such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypoplasia.

AB  - Rationale: Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling controls embryonic mesenchyme and is dysregulated in adult lung diseases with altered mesenchymal function, such as IPF and COPD. However, it has not been determined whether and how Shh regulates the mesenchyme during the critical phases of postnatal lung development. We recently revealed the presence of Hh signaling in the alveolar compartment of postnatal lung and observed that Gli1+ (Hh-responding) cells are high in number during the alveolarization phase when new secondary septa form, and less numerous during the maturation phase. Shh inhibition during alveolarization resulted in enlarged airspaces, suggesting that there is an alteration in the mechanical properties of the newly-formed secondary septa and/or that fewer secondary septa are formed. In this study we carried out carefully timed Shh inhibition experiments to delineate the effect on overall lung structure as well as the cellular and extra-cellular components of the septa during the alveolarization phase. Method(s): For morphometric assessment we combined measurement of MLI (mean linear intercept) and septum/alveolar space ratio. Mesenchymal cell markers, proliferative index (Ki-67+ cell fraction) and extracellular matrix molecules were evaluated by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence-based co-localization staining and histochemistry. Gli1 cell lineage was traced in the Gli1creERT2-Rosa26tdTom reporter mouse by timed Tamoxifen-mediated Cre activation. Result(s): Our results reveal three key functions of Hh signaling during alveolarization with consequences on lung structure and the mesenchymal compartment: (1) Hh signaling affects both secondary septum initiation as well as septum composition, dependent on the time point. At early time-points (P1) Hh blockade reduces secondary septum formation and causes a marked airspace enlargement at P6 and P8, while at later time-points (P3) Hh inhibition increases airspace size, but does not alter alveolar septal tip count at P6 and P8 when compared to the controls. (2) Hh signaling is required for myofibroblast differentiation during growth of the secondary alveolar septa; and (3) Hh signaling promotes mesenchymal proliferation, especially in the Gli1 lineage. Conclusion(s): Our study establishes Shh as a new alveolarization-promoting factor that is important in normal postnatal lung development and might be affected in perinatal lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common neonatal lung disease that has been linked to pulmonary inflammation. Previous studies have suggested involvement of various cell types and soluble factors but have thus far failed to reveal a dominant pathway that underpins disease progression. It remains unknown that which T helper (Th) cell polarization, if any, contributes to the pathogenesis of BPD. Methods Citrated whole cord and peripheral blood were collected from infants born between 24+0-28+6 gestational weeks at five different time points, namely at birth, on days 1, 7 and 14 and at 36 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). Cells were stimulated with either PMA, ionomycin and brefeldin A or vehicle and brefeldin A overnight. Cells were then stained for multi-color flow cytometry to enumerate Th cell subsets including Th1, Th2 and Th17 and regulatory T cells. Results were analyzed against BPD disease status at 36 weeks CGA and corrected for confounders. Results 50 infants were enrolled and 228 unique samples were collected. 36 enrolled infants (72%) had BPD (mild to severe) at 36 weeks CGA. When compared to infants that did not have the disease, the frequency of interleukin(IL)-4 in CD4+ Th cells in peripheral blood was increased in infants with BPD on days 1 (p=0.0449), 7 (p=0.0423), 14 (p=0.0489) and 36 weeks CGA but not within cord blood. There was no difference in the frequency of cells positive for interferongamma (IFNgamma), IL-17A or FOXP3 among CD4+ cells in blood from BPD and non-BPD infants across all time points. Conclusions T helper cells are polarized towards a Th2 phenotype in infants with BPD based on elevated levels of IL-4 in CD4+ cells. We hypothesize that BPD infants may benefit from therapies that target the Th2 pathway.

AB  - Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene regulators involved in a wide range of biological processes including angiogenesis. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also known as "arrested lung development", is characterized by decreased lung vascularization and simplified alveolarization. However, our knowledge about the role of miRNAs in BPD is very limited. The purpose of this study is to identify miRNAs that contribute to the decreased vascularization in BPD and to investigate the mechanisms involved. Method(s): Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% O2) for 2 weeks to induce BPD. To identify miRNAs that contribute to the decreased vascularization in BPD, we performed miRNA qRT-PCR array (LC Sciences) using harvested lung tissue from hyperoxic and normoxic (control) mouse lungs. The data was validated by qRT-PCR. To determine which miRNAs were involved in lung capillary formation, we transfected human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) with mimics for selected miRNA candidates. 24 hours after transfection, cells were re-plated on Matrigel and exposed to 95 % hyperoxia and normoxia to assay for tube formation. Tube formation was measured manually for loops and branching, 24 hours after re-plating the cells. We also measured the expression of known lung angiogenic factors (VEGF, EPO, PDGF-BB, EDN) by qRT-PCR. Result(s): The miRNA qPCR array data showed that miR-133a and miR-133b were decreased in hyperoxic lungs to 0.59 and 0.54 of the values in normoxic lungs. The results were validated by qRT-PCR. We found that inducing the expression of miR-133a and miR-133b with miRNA mimics restored hyperoxia-suppressed loop formation and branching in HPAEC. Induced miR-133 expression with miRNA mimics also induced the expression of angiogenic factors VEGF, EPO, PDGF-BB, EDN. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that decreased miR-133a and miR-133b levels in hyperoxic lungs contribute to the decreased vascularization in BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is managed with oral glucocorticoid (GC) and mineralocorticoid replacement to suppress excessive androgen production. Plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) is a marker by which GC is adjusted. There are no previous reports of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) contributing to androgen suppression in CAH patients. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe the first reported case of androgen suppression with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate HFA (BD HFA) in an infant female with CAH and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-month-old former 25-week gestational age Caucasian girl with severe BPD, tracheostomy, and salt-losing CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency due to the homoozygous mutation in the CYP21A2 gene presented for follow up in our Endocrine clinic. She had a history of adequate adrenal androgen suppression on oral hydrocortisone (HCT) replacement (9-12.8 mg/m2/day) as demonstrated by androstenedione (<15 ng/dL; normal <15-37 ng/dL) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) (range 37-419 ng/dL). She received fluticasone propionate HFA (FP HFA) 440 mcg inhalation daily via tracheostomy from age 8 months to age 22 months for BPD. At age 19 months, 17OHP was 101 ng/dL while on maintenance HCT 10.6 mg/m2/day. At age 22 months, ICS was transitioned to BD HFA 320 mcg inhalation daily via tracheostomy due to insurance preference. At 23 months, 17OHP was suppressed to 59 ng/dL despite low maintenance HCT of 8.5 mg/m2/day. At 25 months, 17OHP remained suppressed to 42 ng/dL and maintenance HCT was decreased to 7.4 mg/m2/day. At 26 months, 17OHP continued to be overly suppressed at 45 ng/dL and thus maintenance HCT was decreased to 6.3 mg/m2/day. At 28 months, patient underwent decannulation and remained on BP HFA though via oral inhalation. One month later, 17OHP increased to 857 ng/dL. At her most recent visit at 30 months of age she was off all ICS. Plasma 17OHP was 621 ng/dL and HCT was increased to 12 mg/m2/day. CONCLUSION(S): There was a clear suppression of 17OHP seen in an infant with CAH and BPD when patient was switched from inhaled FP HFA to inhaled BD HFA. This suppression underscores the systemic absorption and systemic effects of ICS. Inhalation through tracheostomy may have enhanced systemic effect as demonstrated by 17OHP rising with alternative route of administration even before ICS was discontinued. The case illustrates the difficulty in striking a therapeutic balance in CAH patients requiring ICS. Due to variable GC availability of ICS, clinicians should continue daily maintenance therapy and stress dosing to ensure adequate and even GC coverage.

AB  - Introduction Chronic lung diseases, such as asthma or COPD, affectmillions of people and are a major cause of premature death in children and adults worldwide. It is now generally accepted that many chronic lung diseases result from complex genetics and environmental interactions. Therefore, increasing attention has been given to many environmental and lifestyle factors, such as air pollution, smoking, physical activity and diet. Research shows that early nutrition plays a critical role in healthy lung development, and can underpin the increasing propensity for many respiratory and other non-communicable diseases. Diet may be an important modifiable risk factor for the development, progression and management of chronic lung diseases in children and adults (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF) and COPD). Under-nutrition and over-nutrition may have significant effects on pulmonary function, poor growth and risk for chronic lung disease. In early life, malnutrition has been related to impaired immunity, which results in more frequent and severe respiratory infections. Additionally, nutritional depletion is a common problem in patients with severe chronic lung diseases such as BPD, CF, and others. Hypermetabolism, malabsorption and depletion of fat free mass are associated with increased morbidity and significant impairment of health status. Obesity has also been related to poor lung function, an increase in the prevalence of asthma and asthma severity. In addition, several of these nutritional deficiencies rarely occur in isolation. Dietary intervention has a potential role in reducing acute respiratory illness related morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. In most chronic lung diseases, nutritional interventions have proven to be effective in preventing or improving outcomes, but evidence is scarce in others. Micro- and Macronutrients Related to Chronic Respiratory Diseases Pregnant women (hence, their babies) and children under 5 years of age are particularly vulnerable to micronutrient deficiency, increasing their susceptibility to acute and chronic lung diseases in childhood. In addition, multiple micronutrient deficiencies coexist in the same individuals. Vitamin A deficiency is related to impaired immune function and cell differentiation. Zinc deficiency has been associated with a higher incidence of acute respiratory infections, a major cause of death in children under 5 years in developing countries [1]. Instead, nutritional interventions or diets rich in fruits and vegetables seem to be protective. A recent meta-analysis on the effect of childhood nutrient intake and the risk of developing wheezing or asthma showed that there was some evidence of protective effects from Vitamin A, D and E, zinc, fruit and vegetables, and of a Mediterranean diet against the development of asthma [2]. Also, Saadeh et al. showed that fruit and green vegetable intake was associated with a low prevalence of wheezing and asthma in school children aged 8-12 years old [3]. Adequate dietary vitamin C intake has also been related to reduced wheezing in some observational studies in children. Vitamin D has been extensively investigated in the last 20 years. It has a well-established immunomodulatory effect within the lung. Epidemiological studies show significant associations between vitamin D and several acute and chronic lung diseases such as asthma. There is some evidence on the role of vitamin D deficiency in disease onset, progression and exacerbation in respiratory infections, asthma and COPD [4]. Several observational studies have shown associations between asthma and high intake of omega-6 Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), whereas omega-3 LCPUFA have been shown to be anti-inflammatory, as they decrease inflammatory cell production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2, Leukotriene B4 and activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Maternal dietary intake of oily fish was found to be protective of asthma in children 5 years of age if born to mothers with asthma. A systematic review of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation studies in women during pregnancy found that the risk of asthma development in children was reduced (OR 0.349, 95% CI 0.15, 0.78) [5]. Asthma Various dietary patterns have been linked to the risk of respiratory diseases. In asthma, dietary exposures (nutrients and diet), and the periods of introduction (antenatal or childhood) are relevant to disease pathogenesis. Several cohort studies have suggested a link between reduced maternal consumption of some micronutrients and childhood asthma. In a systematic review, it was noted that higher maternal intake of vitamin D, vitamin E, and zinc was associated with lower odds of wheeze during childhood [6]. In relation to dietary patterns, the Mediterranean diet (high intake of minimally processed plant foods and low intake of dairy food, fish, poultry and minimal intake of red meat) has been found to have a protective effect for allergic respiratory disease in several epidemiological studies [7]. On the contrary, the "Western" dietary pattern (characterized by high consumption of refined grains, cured and red meats, desserts and sweets, french fries, and high-fat dairy products) has been associated to obesity and increased risk of asthma in children. Observational studies on vitamin D in children with asthma have shown a strong relationship between low levels of vitamin D and lower lung function, increased corticosteroid use, and asthma exacerbations [8]. Over-nutrition and resulting obesity are clearly linked with respiratory disease, particularly asthma [9]. Obese children with asthma have a decreased lung function, reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids, lower quality of life and higher morbidity. Recently, Forno et al. reported that obesity is associated with airway dysanapsis, which is associated with severe disease exacerbations in obese children with asthma [10]. In the obese state, several causal mechanistic pathways have been reported: anatomical changes of airway, circulating free fatty acids which activate immune responses leading to increased inflammation, production of adipokines, higher concentrations of circulating leptin, epigenetics and also microbiome. Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity (CLDP) or Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Inadequate growth, weight gain and malnutrition are well-recognized complications of BPD. Given the fact that nutrition plays an important role in lung development and maturation, specific nutritional deficiency in combination with other risk factors may aggravate pulmonary injury involved in BPD. Some of these factors for BPD development include oxygen toxicity, immaturity, mechanical ventilation, infection and inadequate nutritional support. Infants with BPD have low energy intake and increased energy utilization when compared to term infants [11]. This results in a negative energy balance which leads to malnutrition. Following discharge, some infants with BPD are at high risk for persistent growth failure. Possible explanations include increased energy expenditure, poor oral feeding skills and tolerance, concomitant dysfunction of other organs, and recurrent infections and hospitalizations. Therefore, an adequate nutritional intervention is essential to match the increased energy requirements in infants at risk of and with BPD. Although there is no consensus regarding the optimal nutritional management for BPD, many have suggested specific nutrient supplementation (e.g. glutamine, Selenium, LCPUFAs, cysteine, larginine, l-citrulline, inositol, vitamins A, E and C, and others) to prevent or treat BPD. Theoretically, some of these nutrients may curb hyperoxia-induced injury or improve alveolar development. However, evidence for supplementation is still controversial for most of these and their effects on BPD need to be further studied [12]. Current evidence shows that supplementation of vitamin A and omega-3 LCPUFA are effective in preventing BPD. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) There is an intimate close relationship between nutritional status and CF prognosis. Early nutritional interventions and monitoring for respiratory disease in infants and preschoolers with CF is priority to improve long-term outcomes. Poor nutrition leads to poor lung function and increased number of infections. But poor lung function also causes increased energy utilization and growth failure, which ends with unsatisfactory outcomes. Most CF patients are pancreatic insufficient and approximately one third of patients are below the 5th percentile of weight for age. Several studies have shown that malnutrition in early life is related to imparted lung function during childhood [13]. Micronutrient deficiencies also occur in CF patients because of their pancreatic insufficiency and secondary malabsorption. Vitamin A and E deficiency, as well as zinc and magnesium, may be present when either intake or nutrient absorption is inadequate. These deficiencies may also increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and malnutrition. Normal growth in patients with CF is associated with improved pulmonary function and survival. Yen, et al. [14] showed that better nutritional status at age 4 years in children with cystic fibrosis was associated with better lung function, fewer complications and greater survival. Oral supplements have been used with conflicting evidence, therefore, they should be considered with other nutritional and behavioral approaches. Gastrostomy tube feeding has been shown to improve weight and (in some studies) pulmonary function. Also, poor adherence to pancreatic enzymes has been related to difficulties in correcting malabsorption, hence, worst nutrition and outcomes.

AB  - Introduction High flow nasal cannula therapy is a new and noninvasive method in treatment of infants with a severe formof bronchiolitis. In oxygenation, the air is humidified and heated, the use of respiratory muscles and instances of atelectasis are decreased, functional residual capacity is thus improved. The goal of thismethod is for shorter and more effective treatment of acute severe bronchiolitis in infants treated in pediatric intensive care unit and avoidance of invasive ventilation. Subjects and Methods A total of 15 patients (aged 2-24 months), previously healthy infants and toddlers, without accompanying diseases such as chronic respiratory diseases, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart diseases, with clinical features of proven viral infection (RSV, adenovirus, or hMPV in nasal aspirate proven by PCR method), severe bronchial obstruction and laboratory results of respiratory acidosis (pH level below 7.3, pCO 2 level above 7 kPa, pO2 below 7 kPa) were treated with high flow oxygen using nasal cannula in the period of 24-48 h in addition to other supportive pharmacotherapy (inhalation with hypertonic NaCl, bronchodilator and corticosteroid). Results The patients treated with high flow oxygen using nasal cannula during 24-48 h recovered significantly faster, with reduction in hypoxemia and CO2 accumulation, reduction of breathing efforts, reduction in respiratory and heart rate. In all patients, after 48 h of treatment in acid-base status, there were no signs of respiratory acidosis (normal pH range (from 7.35 to7.45 kPa, pO2 from 7.3 to 10.6 and pCO2 from 4.3 to 5.7 kPa), with mildly elevated bicarbonate level and slightly reduced SaO2 values. Conclusion High flow oxygen therapy in infants with severe forms of acute viral bronchiolitis allowed for shorter and more effective non-invasive ventilation treatment with faster improvement of general and respiratory status. Our limited experience with the first application of a new non-invasive ventilation in children with severe acute bronchiolitis treated in intensive care unit is highly positive and encouraging and we can recommend this treatment as the therapy of choice in place of invasive methods. An increasing number of patients are necessary in further research for purposes of optimization and evaluation of the new intervention.

AB  - A major change has occurred lately in our understanding of the natural history and risk factors for COPD. For decades, COPD was considered a disease that started almost exclusively in the sixth and seventh decade of life, and which was confined to individuals who were particularly susceptible to cigarette smoking or exposed to biomass smoke in poor countries. These noxious factors are known to accelerate the normal rate of decline with age ((approximately 25 ml/year) of parameters of lung function such as FEV1 and, as a consequence, the affected patients eventually reach a degree of airflow limitation that is associated with dyspnea and hypoxemia. The corollary of this conceptual framework was that all patients with COPD would show progressive deterioration in lung function with aging. Recent longitudinal studies of individuals with COPD strongly challenge this framework. It was first observed that only approximately half of all patients with COPD showed excessive lung function decline when followed prospectively (1). Furthermore, among subjects with COPD, two distinct groups were identified(2): one group showed the "classical" pattern of excessive lung function decline associated with cigarette smoking and these subjects had reached an FEV1 plateau in early adult life that was similar to that of subjects without lung disease. A second group showed no excessive FEV1 decline with aging, but was shown to have reached an FEV1 plateau that was significantly reduced with respect to subjects without lung disease and to those with "classical" COPD. These results suggested the existence of a new pathway for the development of COPD, one that was characterized by insufficient growth of airway function during childhood as a major predisposing factor. Prevention of risk factors that may hamper the development of airway function, starting in utero, thus becomes a major new avenue for the prevention of COPD, the third cause of death among adults in developed countries. Thorough descriptions of these risk factors have been recently published (3, 4). In summary, six major determinants of lung function growth have been identified. A large number of genetic variants that influence lung function in older children and adults have been identified by use of genome wide association studies (5). Unfortunately, all these variants have small effects on the outcome and therefore, it is unclear if they will be useful in a future preventive strategy. Prematurity, and especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), induce significant deficits in lung function that persist into adult life (6). Prevention of BPD will not only decrease morbidity and mortality during childhood but also extend its beneficial effects to the long term well-being of adults. Exposure to tobacco smoke in utero is also associated with subsequent deficits in airway function that persist into adult life (7).Deficits in maternal micronutrient such as vitamin A during pregnancy and early life have also been associated with deficits in lung function growth (8). Lower respiratory illnesses in early life, and especially pneumonia before age 3, are associated with persistent deficits of lung function (9), and these deficits are in part related to preexisting lung function abnormalities (10) and to the direct damaging effects on the airways triggered by the infectious agent causing the acute illness(11) . Asthma, especially when starting during the first years of life, is often associated with airway remodeling and chronic airflow limitation, and many patients with COPD have a history of asthma starting during childhood (12). Finally air pollution has been unequivocally shown to induce deficits in lung function growth: a recent study of the effects of improvements in air quality in California demonstrated significant increases in lung function in children living in the areas in which efforts to improve air quality were the most successful (13). In conclusion, prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, early life pneumonia, asthma, and maternal smoking during pregnancy; appropriate supplementation with micronutrients during pregnancy; and improvements in air quality are all attainable goals that may markedly decrease the prevalence of and morbidity and mortality associated with COPD in adult life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on motor performance and its early markers are rare in China, especially in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants., OBJECTIVE: Apart from the assessment of the inter-scorer agreement, we aimed to analyze to what extent the motor repertoire at 10 to 18weeks postterm was related to neonatal complications, and gross and fine motor performance at 12months after term., STUDY DESIGN: Exploratory prospective study., SUBJECTS: Seventy-four VLBW infants (58 males; mean gestational age=29weeks; mean birth weight=1252g)., METHOD: Five-minute video recordings were performed at 10 to 18weeks after term; fidgety movements and the concurrent motor patterns (resulting in a motor optimality score) were assessed according to the Prechtl general movements assessment (GMA). The gross and fine motor performance was assessed by means of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, second edition, at 12months., RESULTS: Reliability was excellent. Pneumonia was associated with absent fidgety movements; the motor optimality score was lower in infants with pneumonia and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Both absent fidgety movements and a lower motor optimality score were associated with a poor or very poor gross and fine motor performance at the 12-month-assessment., CONCLUSION: Both the assessment of fidgety movements and the evaluation of the concurrent motor repertoire contribute significantly to an identification of VLBW children with a poor gross and fine motor outcome at 12months. The results of this study document the need for an early identification of infants at high risk for a poor motor performance. Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..

AB  - Fifty years ago, Northway first described bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD affects approximately 10,000-15,000 preterm infants annually in the US. It is the major cause of chronic lung disease and morbidity for preterm infants. Preterm infants are diagnosed with BPD based on their requirement for supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. The most commonly used criteria are based on a physiological challenge test at 36 weeks post-menstrual age to assess the infant's requirement for supplemental oxygen. The epidemiology and pathology ofBPDhave changed dramatically over the past 25 years. "Old" BPDoccurred in preterminfants with surfactant deficiency (<34 weeks) following respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The introduction of two therapies, antenatal steroids and intratracheal or aerosol surfactant, markedly improved outcomes and survival, shifting the demographics of BPD to earlier preterm infants (< 29 weeks gestational age). The "new" BPD, often called chronic lung disease of the newborn or CLD, is characterized by arrested alveolar-capillary development with larger, simplified alveoli, increased interstitial fibrosis, and abnormal pulmonary vasculature with decreased branching and precapillary arteriovenous anastomoses.Other comorbidities associated with BPD include patent ductus arteriosus with increased pulmonary edema, abnormal central respiratory drive with apnea and hypopnea, pulmonary inflammation and injury, and pulmonary hypertension related to hypoxemia and an abnormal pulmonary vasculature. Preterm birth, BPD and respiratory infections result in airflow obstruction that persists into adulthood and predisposes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore there is a pressing need to determine interventions to prevent BPD and chronic lung disease. Several large multicenter trials have tested therapeutic strategies in the acute postnatal period to reduce the incidence of CLD sequelae. The two major interventions that are safe and effective are caffeine and intramuscular Vitamin A. Although dexamethasone treatment decreases the incidence of BPD, early administration of high dose dexamethasone increases the risk for gastrointestinal perforation, and poor neurocognitive outcomes. These complications have limited its use. In one trial, the DART Study, low dose dexamethasone was used after the second week of life in selected infants who failed extubation and treatment resulted in successful extubation and decreased supplemental oxygen requirement. Combined intratracheal therapy with budesonide and surfactant was superior to surfactant alone in reducing the risk for BPDin preterminfants onmechanical ventilation. In contrast, a trial of late surfactant administered to intubated,mechanically ventilated infants at age7to14days (TOLSURF)didnot decrease the risk of BPDat 36 or 40weeks. There is no evidence that other postnatal drug therapies including inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), superoxide dismutase, glutathione precursors or cimetidine prevent BPD. Non-pharmacological postnatal strategies to prevent or reduce the severity of CLD include alternative modes of non-invasive ventilation to decrease barotrauma and stretch injury associated with mechanical ventilation, and determination of the optimal range for oxygen administration. Several large multicenter trials compared the efficacy of alternative modes of non-invasive ventilator support. One therapy, synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (sNIPPV) compared to mechanical ventilation, resulted in decreased BPD in extremely low gestational age infants. Other modes of non-invasive support were considered equivalent to the comparison mode of therapy. For example, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) was equivalent to intubation, administration of surfactant and mechanical ventilation in risk for subsequent BPD. Further, a study comparing nCPAP and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation revealed no difference in BPD outcomes. A study from Australia in infants <32 weeks gestation, demonstrated that after extubation, high-flow nasal cannulae (flow rate 5-6 LPM) was noninferior to nCPAP (7 cm water) for infants to maintain ventilation and avoid reintubation. Altogether, the neonatal intensive care for extremely low gestational age infants is to shift to noninvasive ventilatory support such as high flow nasal cannulae and nCPAP as early as possible. If infants require intubation and ventilation, the consensus recommendation is for administration of surfactant. Three large trials, Surfactant, Positive Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial (SUPPORT), Benefits of Oxygen Saturation Targeting (BOOST)-II, and the Canadian Oxygen Trial (COT) evaluated the impact of titrating supplemental oxygen to achieve a lower vs. higher saturation range and the impact of these levels of support on death, BPD, and other comorbidities including neurocognitive outcomes. The SUPPORT and BOOST trials with a combined recruitment of 3424 infants revealed that infants titrated to the lower saturation range of 85 to 89% had a greater mortality rate than infants assigned to the range of 91 to 95%. In contrast, the COT study revealed no difference in mortality between the low or high saturation range arms of their study. Given the concerns for increased mortality raised by the SUPPORT and BOOST trials, the current consensus is to titrate therapy for oxyhemoglobin saturations in the low 90's % range to prevent a potential increased risk of infant death. The sequelae of BPD in the first years of life are variable as some infants diagnosed with BPD have no long term respiratory disease, while other infants not diagnosed with BPD may have persistent respiratory signs and symptoms. A review of pulmonary function studies for former preterm infants performed as infants, school-age children and adults reveal similar trends over time. Airflow obstruction is a common finding across all ages with small airways most affected as evidenced by decreased FEF25-75% predicted and increased ratio of residual volume:total lung capacity. Adults had decreased airflow on spirometry, and there are reports of emphysema by CT scan and exercise intolerance. We now know that new alveolarization appears to continue beyond the preschool age period to childhood and adolescence, raising the potential for continued lung growth to potentially overcome neonatal injury. One study supports the concept that post-natal interventions may improve pulmonary outcomes. Using the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal infant pulmonary function test, Filbrun et al. reported that airway flows significantly increased over 6 to 18 months of age in those preterm infants with optimal weight gain vs. those with less robust growth. A recent large multicenter observational study, the Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program, recruited preterm infants, <29 weeks gestation from 13 hospitals in the United States, to evaluate the contribution of antenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors on respiratory symptoms and pulmonary mechanics over the first year of life. There still remain many clinical uncertainties concerning the diagnosis of BPD and the risk for chronic lung disease. First, the diagnosis of BPD is based on the level of supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support at 36 weeks gestational age. There is currently a debate concerning whether these diagnostic criteria are determined at the optimal gestational age to predict future respiratory disease. Second, although there are much stronger data concerning perinatal factors that increase the risk for BPD, there is still uncertainty concerning which infants will develop chronic lung disease. There is a mandate to continue to follow the infants recruited for the large cohort studies internationally, so that insights can be gained to discover postnatal factors that either confer greater risk or may mitigate severity of future lung disease. Third, BPD is a relatively rare disease with variable phenotypes, therefore large numbers of subjects in multicenter clinical trials are required for definitively testing new therapies to determine whether there is a decrease in BPD or chronic lung disease. This raises the important issue that there is a need to establish BPD endotypes, to better inform therapeutic trials that target specific pathways. Investigations are underway to identify hosts factors - genetic and epigenetic associations, transcriptome, metabolome, and microbiome profiles that are associated with risk for BPD and chronic lung disease.

AB  - Introduction Long-term noninvasive ventilation (NIV) involves the delivery of ventilatory assistance through a noninvasive interface, as opposed to invasive ventilation via a tracheostomy. The number of children treated at home with this type of respiratory support is expanding exponentially around the world (1, (2, (3). Increasing pediatric conditions may benefit from long term NIV. However the indications and benefits have not been validated and rely mainly on recommendations and clinical experience. Diseases that May Benefit From Noninvasive Ventilator Support NIV comprises: 1) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which utilizes the delivery of a constant positive pressure in the airways aiming to maintain airway patency throughout the entire breathing cycle and, 2) biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP) which aims is to assist the breathing of the patient by delivering a supplemental higher positive pressure during each inspiration. NIV is indicated for disorders that cause disequilibrium in the respiratory balance, which comprises the load imposed on the respiratory system, the capacity of the respiratory muscles, and the central drive. In healthy subjects, the respiratory load, i.e. the effort the subject has to perform to generate a breath, is low, the capacity of the respiratory muscles is normal, and the central drive appropriately commands the respiratory muscles. In disorders characterized by an increase in respiratory load, or by a weakness of the respiratory muscles, the central drive increases its demands of the respiratory muscles. However, when this imbalance exceeds a certain threshold, hypoventilation, defined by hypercapnia and hypoxemia, occurs. Severe upper airway obstruction, airway malacia, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or bronchiolitis obliterans, may be responsible for an excessive respiratory load (4, (5, (6, (7, (8, (9, (10). Neuromuscular diseases that involve the motor neuron, the peripheral nerve, the neuromuscular junction, or the muscle may cause excessive respiratory muscle weakness. Disorders of the central drive are rare and may be congenital, such as the Ondine's curse (or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome) or acquired due to compression of or injury to the brainstem. Other disorders involving an impairment of two or more of these components, such as achondroplasia and mucopolysaccharidoses, may cause upper airway obstruction and brain stem compression. The choice of the type of NIV depends of the pathophysiology of the respiratory failure. CPAP is the simplest type of noninvasive respiratory support, which is indicated in case of "isolated" obstruction of the upper or lower airways. BiPAP is indicated when the two other components of the respiratory balance are impaired, i.e. the central drive and/or the respiratory muscles. In lung diseases associated with an increase in respiratory load, the aim of NIV is to "unload" the respiratory muscles (5, (6, (11, (12). As these patients have a normal central nervous system and a preserved respiratory muscle capacity, a ventilatory assistance that preserves the patient's own breathing pattern by allowing the patient to "trigger" assisted breaths, will be the most appropriate and comfortable (5, (6). Conversely, in patients with weak respiratory muscles, the role of BiPAP will be to "replace" the respiratory muscles by delivering a positive pressure during inspiration. A "controlled" mode with a back-up rate (i.e. a minimal number of breaths delivered per minute by the ventilator) close to the normal respiratory rate during sleep for age, is thus recommended. CPAP is thus clearly NOT the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with neuromuscular disease. Finally, in the case of an abnormal central drive, the ventilator should be able to "take over" the command of the respiratory muscles by means of a controlled mode. Indications and Benefits of NIV There are no validated criteria to start long term NIV in children. In clinical practice, NIV may be initiated in an acute setting, after NIV weaning failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), on abnormal nocturnal gas exchange alone or associated with a high apneahypopnea index (AHI) on a polysomnography (13). The main challenges or difficulties for NIV initiation in children are 1) the timing and type of investigation, such as a polysomnography, a polygraphy, or an overnight gas exchange recording, that should be performed for NIV initiation and, 2) the values or thresholds of the parameters that are retained for NIV initiation, such as the oxygen and/or carbon dioxide level, and/or AHI, with the assumption that their correction will be associated with a benefit of NIV (13). These difficulties are due to the lack of markers of end-organ morbidity associated with sleepdisordered breathing and chronic respiratory failure in children. Neurocognitive dysfunction and behavioral disturbances are the most common and severe consequences of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children but these deleterious effects are highly variable from one child to another (14). A sleep study is part of the routine evaluation of a child with OSAS. Polysomnography represents the gold standard but polygraphy or continuous monitoring of nocturnal gas exchange may be used as an alternative if full polysomnography is not available (15). Usual indications for CPAP are residual OSAS after adenotonsillectomy (defined by an AHI>5 events/h) and OSAS related to obesity or craniofacial abnormalities (15). In practice, CPAP is prescribed in children with complex OSAS due to anatomical or structural abnormalities of the upper airways such as craniofacial malformations, Down syndrome, Prader Willi syndrome or morbid obesity (16, (17, (18). BiPAP is indicated if nocturnal hypoventilation persists despite optimal CPAP (15). CPAP is associated with an improvement in sleep parameters such as the AHI and gas exchange, attention deficits, behavior, sleepiness and quality of life (16). There is less consensus regarding the type of investigation and criteria for BiPAP initiation in children with neuromuscular diseases. First, BiPAP may be justified without a sleep study when the child presents episodes of acute respiratory failure triggered by a respiratory infection or an anesthetic procedure, as these events are markers of an insufficient respiratory reserve (19). Concerning the timing of a sleep study, there is a lack of validated recommendations. This may be partially explained by the heterogeneity of neuromuscular disorders in children (20, (21). Symptoms suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing cannot be used as predictors or markers of nocturnal hypoventilation as they did not differ between neuromuscular children with or without documented nocturnal hypoventilation (22). Concerning the predictive value of lung function and other respiratory parameters, a large prospective study in children with neuromuscular disorders did not identify a sensitive and specific daytime lung function or respiratory muscle test that was associated with, or predictive of, nocturnal hypoxemia or hypercapnia (23). The type of neuromuscular disorder should thus be taken into account as nocturnal hypoventilation occurs preferentially in disorders characterized by a prominent diaphragmatic weakness. Children with a COL6 myopathy should thus be screened systematically for sleep disordered breathing (24). Prioritized screening is also recommended for infants or young children with congenital myopathies or rapidly progressive neuromuscular diseases (25). In children with neuromuscular disease, the documentation of nocturnal hypoventilation by means of a polysomnography is recommended but not essential prior to starting BiPAP because "isolated" abnormal nocturnal gas exchange may be sufficient (26). Indeed, 9 out of 10 patients with neuromuscular disease or thoracic deformity and isolated nocturnal hypercapnia without daytime hypercapnia progressed to overt daytime respiratory failure within a period of 2 years (26). Moreover, in the presence of an abnormal overnight gas exchange recording or full polysomnography, the criteria that are used to define "nocturnal hypoventilation" are highly variable which has practical consequences, as long term NIV indication relies upon hypoventilation detection (27). The scoring of polysomnography in patients with neuromuscular disease requires a specific expertise. Indeed, instead of apneic and hypopneic events, these patients may present a progressive simultaneous decrease in airflow and thoracic and abdominal movements accompanied or not by a change in gas exchange, suggestive of global inspiratory muscle weakness (28). Paradoxical breathing with opposition phase on the thoracic and abdominal belts may be the consequence of diaphragmatic dysfunction or weakness of the intercostal muscles and should not be falsely interpreted as "obstructive events" (28, (29, (30). In clinical practice, periods of "reduced ventilation" or paradoxical breathing, more than obstructive and/or central apnea-hypopneas, especially during rapid-eye movement sleep, associated with a pulse oximetry (SpO2) < 90% and/or a transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO2) value > 50 mmHg, are indicative of an insufficient respiratory muscle performance and justify long term BiPAP in children with neuromuscular disease. In clinical practice, however, many children with a progressive neuromuscular disease such as spinal muscular atrophy or Duchenne muscular dystrophy are started on NIV empirically.

AB  - Background Pulmonary angiogenesis is essential for alveolarization, and impaired angiogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We previously demonstrated that nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) is constitutively active in early alveolar, but quiescent in adult endothelium. Further, blocking NFkappaB disrupts angiogenesis of early alveolar primary pulmonary endothelial cells (PEC) in vitro, and impairs alveolarization in vivo. However, the upstream signals that activate NFkappaB in the developing pulmonary endothelium are not known. Objective We hypothesized that factors uniquely secreted from the early alveolar lung stimulate NFkappaB-mediated pulmonary endothelial angiogenesis to promote alveolarization. Methods Proteomic analysis of the lung secretome at distinct stages of development was performed by 2D gel electrophoresis and tandem massspectroscopy. Protein expression of secreted factors was validated by immunoblot analysis and immunostaining of lung tissue. NFkappaB activation was assessed by immunostaining and EMSA, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that regulate angiogenic function determined by immunoblot analysis. Migration of early alveolar PEC was assessed using scratch and microfluidic chemotaxis assays in transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBI)- treated WT PEC, and in PEC obtained from mice with an EC-specific deletion of the NFkappaB activator, IKKbeta. In separate studies, TGFBI-stimulated migration was assessed in PEC treated with; (i) BAY 11-7082, a pharmacologic inhibitor of NFkappaB; (ii) antibodies to inhibit the alphavbeta3 integrin; or (iii) siRNA against the alpha5, alphav, and beta3 integrins. Results Proteomic analysis identified TGFBI as a protein highly expressed in the early alveolar lung secretome. TGFBI immunoreactivity was intense throughout the early alveolar lung but completely absent in the adult, and TGFBI protein was high in the early alveolar lung but decreased to negligible levels in the adult lung (p<0.001). Recombinant TGFBI activated the MAPKs: ERK(p<0.01), p38(p<0.05) and Akt (p<0.05) within 5 minutes, and increased NFkappaB activation by 40% at 1hr. Although TGFBI promoted PEC migration in WT PEC (p<0.01), TGFBI-mediated migration (p<0.05) was abrogated in WT PEC treated with BAY 11-7082, and in PEC lacking IKKbeta. TGFBI-mediated migration was also blunted by antibodies to block alphavbeta3 integrin signaling (p<0.01), and by silencing alphav (p<0.01) and beta3 (p<0.05) integrins, but not affected by silencing alpha5 integrin. Conclusions These studies identify TGFBI as a developmentally regulated protein, highly expressed in the early alveolar lung, which functions to promote NFkappaBmediated pulmonary endothelial cell migration, perhaps via a mechanism involving either MAPK activation or alphavbeta3 integrin binding. We speculate that TGFBI may play a key role in regulating pulmonary angiogenesis during alveolarization, and could represent a new therapeutic target to treat lung disease characterized by impaired angiogenesis, such as BPD.

AB  - Background Inflammation-induced FGF10 protein deficiency is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurely born infants characterized by arrested alveolar development. So far, experimental evidence for a direct role of FGF10 in BPD is lacking. Methods and Results Using the hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury as a mouse model of BPD, the impact of Fgf10 deficiency in Fgf10(+/-) vs. Fgf10(+/+) pups was investigated. In normoxia, no lethality of Fgf10(+/+) and Fgf10(+/-) pups is observed. By contrast, 100% of Fgf10(+/-) pups died within 8 days of hyperoxic injury, with lethality starting at day 5, while Fgf10(+/+) pups were all alive. Lungs of pups from the two genotypes were collected on postnatal day 3 following normoxia or hyperoxia exposure for further analysis. In hyperoxia, Fgf10(+/-) lungs exhibited increased hypoalveolarization. Analysis by FACS of the Fgf10(+/-) vs. control lungs in normoxia, revealed decreased alveolar epithelial type II (AECII) cells over total EpCAM-positive cells ratio. In addition, gene array analysis indicated reduced AECII and increased AECI transcriptomic signatures in isolated AECII cells from Fgf10(+/-) lungs. Such imbalance in differentiation is also seen in hyperoxia and associated with reduced mature surfactant protein B and C expression. Attenuation of FGFR2b ligands activity postnatally in the context of hyperoxia also leads to increased lethality with decreased surfactant expression. Conclusions Fgf10 deficiency affects quantitatively and qualitatively the formation of AECII cells. In addition, FGFR2b ligands (including FGF10) are also important for repair after hyperoxia exposure in neonates. Deficient AECII cells could be an additional complication for patients with BPD.

AB  - Background Preterm infants receiving respiratory support often experience extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR). EUGR in preterm infants occurs secondary to feeding intolerance and clinically indicated feeding volume restrictions. EUGR increases the severity and incidence of the chronic lung disease of infancy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is characterized by impaired lung development, with decreased lung compliance, and increased lung resistance. Animal models demonstrate the importance of EUGR to lung development in the context of respiratory support. However, the isolated contribution of EUGR to lung development and function is unknown. We hypothesize that, in the juvenile rats, EUGR will impair alveolar development, decrease lung compliance, and increase lung resistance. Methods We induced EUGR in a rat model by cross fostering newborn rat pups to rat dams with litter sizes of 16 (EUGR) or 8 (control). Rat pup weight was measured every other day from birth to day of life 21 (d21). At postnatal d24, we measured alveolar wall thickness, second crest septal volume, and radial alveolar count (RAC) using ImageQuant software. At postnatal d24 we also measured lung compliance and resistance of the parenchyma (RPar) and airway (RAir) using a Flexivent System. Results Results are EUGR values as a percentage of control+/-SD (*=p<0.05). Rat pups in the EUGR group weighed significantly less (75+/-3%*) than control by postnatal d5 and continued to weigh less through d21 (70+/-5%*). Structural analysis of rat lungs revealed that EUGR rats had thicker alveolar walls than control in male (136+/-20%*) and female (134+/-32%*) rats, but no change in sepal density or RAC. EUGR decreased compliance in male (67+/-26%*) and female (66+/-25%*) rats. EUGR significantly increased RPar in both male (153+/-70%*) and female (157+/-56%*) rats and significantly increased RAir in male (111+/-25%*) and female (166+/-148%*) rats. Conclusion EUGR alters lung structure and function in juvenile rats. Given the role of elastin and elastic fiber formation in lung structure and function, we speculate that EUGR may disrupt elastin expression and fiber deposition. Ongoing studies are evaluating expression of elastin isoforms in the EUGR lung.

AB  - Rationale Macrophages are activated in response to insult. M1 macrophage polarization is associated with inflammation and tissue deterioration, whereas the M2 macrophage corresponds to wound repair and angiogenesis and has an antiinflammatory phenotype. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon gamma (IFNgamma) promote M1 differentiation and up-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin- (IL-) 1beta, IL-6, and IL-12 whereas M2 differentiation is regulated by IL- 4. Since hyperoxia exposure induces inflammation leading to the pathology seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) through induction of M1 macrophages, we tested the macrophage population in lung tissue of 1 year-old rats. We postulated an increased activation of M2 macrophages in lungs of hyperoxia-exposed rats, suggesting a continued wound healing response. Collagen levels were also assessed. We expected to see an increase in collagen levels of hyperoxic rats, suggesting that there is persistent phenotype after one year. Methods Newborn rats were exposed to 85% hyperoxia (Hx) or normoxia (Nx) (21%) for 14 days and then kept at Nx conditions. At one year, the lung was lavaged with PBS, the left lung was inflated and fixed (4% formaldehyde). Cells were isolated using a 100 mum cell strainer, red blood cells were lysed (ammonium chloride), and the cells frozen in freezing medium. For flow cytometry, the cells were stained for CD45, CD24, CD163, CD80, CD86, CD204, and CD206. Analysis was done with an LSR-2. Collagen levels were assessed using Masson's trichomestained lung sections. A blinded third party divded each image into grids and ranked each square on a scale of 0-3 (0=none, 3=severe) for fibrosis. Results Analysis of CD80 and CD86 showed an increased proportion of the M1 macrophages in the Hx lung compared to the Nx lung (11.7% higher in Hx). The Hx M1 showed more of activation marker CD163 compared to the Nx M1 in the CD24- cell population (12% higher in Hx). Similarly, the proportion of CD204+ M2 was increased within the CD45+ cell population of Hx (6.3% higher in Hx). Comparing M1 to M2 macrophages, Hx exposure shifted the ratio of macrophages toward an M2 response. These findings were supported by the histologic assessment of collagen showing increased lung collagen in Hx compared to Nx rats (p=0.008). Conclusion One year after neonatal Hx exposure, adult rat lungs demonstrate a macrophage population shift towards M2, suggesting a continued antiinflammatory response. Further, the increased level of collagen in Hx rats suggests that there is persistent damage after one year. The data indicates that humans born preterm with BPD may have long term alterations in inflammatory and repair pathways.

AB  - Background Infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are at increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH), but this remains poorly understood. NADPH-oxidase (Nox) have been implicated as a source of oxidative stress in both BPD and PH by others. More recently, oxidative stress has been proposed to be increased in IUGR pregnancies. Objective To determine if Nox signaling is disrupted in IUGR mice relative to appropriately grown mice. Methods Pregnant C57Bl6 mice had a micro-osmotic pump containing U-46619 (2000 ng/h) or vehicle (controls) implanted at E12.5 through term. U-46619 dams had gestational hypertension. U-46619 pups weighing <=1.266 g at birth (<10th percentile) were considered growth restricted (GR). GR and control mice were placed in 21% O2 (room air, RA) or 75% O2 (chronic hyperoxia, CH) within 24h of birth and sacrificed at 14d. Lungs were inflation fixed and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin or harvested for tissue. At 14d, lung morphometry was assessed. Lung Nox 1, Nox2, and Nox4 expression was measured by Western blot, normalized to beta-actin. Results CH-GR mice had significantly increased alveolar area and decreased alveolar counts relative to CH-control mice (1426+/-219 vs. 1023+/-71 mum2; 26+/-3.4 vs. 34+/-2 alveoli per hpf), and RA-GR had a trend towards increased alveolar area and significantly decreased alveolar counts relative to RA-control mice (738+/-30 vs. 611+/-32 mum2; 48+/-1.5 vs. 55+/-2 alveoli per hpf). The RA-GR mice had significantly less lung Nox1 and Nox4 protein expression relative to RA-control mice, but there was no difference in lung Nox2 expression between GR and control mice in RA. Hyperoxia increased lung Nox2 and Nox4 expression in control mice, but not GR mice. Conclusions GR mice have disrupted lung Nox protein expression relative to control mice. GR mice have less Nox1 and Nox4 in RA and less Nox2 and Nox4 in CH. Unexpectedly, these findings suggest less oxidative stress in the GR mice even though they have more alveolar simplification both in RA and CH. The mechanism of Nox dysregulation remains to be elucidated in these mice. Others have implicated epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for the Noxs. Given aberrant promotor DNA methylation, histone modifications along the body of the gene, and nucleosome positioning have been demonstrated to prevent upregulation of other genes in our IUGR model, we speculate that these epigenetic mechanisms may also be involved in the inability to upregulate the Noxs after IUGR.

AB  - Rationale Despite advances in neonatology, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a serious medical problem with long-term consequences. Alveolar macrophages are long-living cells which populate lung soon after birth and maintain their population via proliferation, without contribution from circulating monocytes. Normally alveolar macrophages play an essential role in maintaining lung homeostasis and limiting inflammatory response to the pathogens. We hypothesize that neonatal exposure to hyperoxia, via epigenetic mechanisms, may shape these long-living alveolar macrophages into pro-inflammatory cells, which contribute to the development of BPD. We sought to investigate the kinetic and phenotype of alveolar macrophages in a mouse model of BPD and to test whether depletion of hyperoxia-primed alveolar macrophages and recruitment of the monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages under the normoxic conditions may improve outcomes in mouse model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury/BPD. Methods Newborn mice were exposed to room air (normoxia) or 85% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 days (P0-P14). Alveolar macrophages were depleted via intranasal instillation of clodronate-loaded liposomes at P14, control group received PBS. Lungs were analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry at P14 and P28. In addition, we performed gene expression profiling of the FACSorted alveolar macrophages, alveolar type 2 epithelial cells and endothelial cells at P14 and 28 via RNA-seq. Results Hyperoxia exposure affected lung development (increased mean alveolar area, decreased alveolar count, decreased number of small vessels at P14 and P28). At P14, the number of alveolar macrophages was decreased in hyperoxiaexposed mice, and alveolar macrophages had an inflammatory phenotype. By P28, the number of alveolar macrophages was expanded in hyperoxia-exposed mice. Intranasal administration of clodronate-loaded liposomes at P14 depleted the preexisting pool of alveolar macrophags and induced recruitment of the circulating monocytes to repopulate the niche. This depletion of hyperoxia-primed inflammatory alveolar macrophages resulted in partial reversal of hyperoxiainduced lung injury/BPD phenotype (decrease in mean alveolar area, increase in mean alveolar count and number of small vessels). To unravel the contribution of alveolar macrophages to the development and amelioration of hyperoxia lung injury phenotype, we performed transcriptional profiling via RNA-seq of the whole lung tissue, and FACSorted alveolar macrophages, alveolar type 2 cells and lung endothelial cells during the course of hyperoxia-induced lung injury with and without treatment with clodronate-loaded liposomes. We found that at P28 alveolar macrophages from mice exposed to hyperoxia from P0 to P14 had dramatically different gene expression profiles, with a prevalent pro-inflammatory signature, which was attenuated after treatment with clodronate-loaded liposomes. Conclusion Neonatal hyperoxia exposure can induce a long-lasting proinflammatory inflammatory alveolar macrophage phenotype, most likely via epigenetic mechanisms, which can contribute to the development of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Depletion of hyperoxia-primed alveolar macrophages and recruitment of the new alveolar macrophages under normoxia conditions resulted in a partial reversal of the lung injury/BPD phenotype in mouse.

AB  - Administration of supplemental oxygen remains a critical clinical intervention for survival of preterm infants with respiratory failure. However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia can augment pulmonary damage, resulting in developmental lung diseases embodied as hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We sought to investigate the role of autophagy in hyperoxia-induced apoptotic cell death in developing lungs. We identified increased autophagy signaling in hyperoxia-exposed mouse lung epithelial-12 cells, freshly isolated fetal type II alveolar epithelial cells, lungs of newborn wild-type mice, and human newborns with respiratory distress syndrome and evolving and established BPD. We found that hyperoxia exposure induces autophagy in a Trp53-dependent manner in mouse lung epithelial-12 cells and in neonatal mouse lungs. Using pharmacological inhibitors and gene silencing techniques, we found that the activation of autophagy, upon hyperoxia exposure, demonstrated a protective role with an antiapoptotic response. Specifically, inhibiting regulatory-associated protein of mechanistic target of rapamycin (RPTOR) in hyperoxia settings, as evidenced by wild-type mice treated with torin2 or mice administered (Rptor) silencing RNA via intranasal delivery or Rptor+/-, limited lung injury by increased autophagy, decreased apoptosis, improved lung architecture, and increased survival. Furthermore, we identified increased protein expression of phospho-beclin1, light chain-3-II and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, suggesting altered autophagic flux in the lungs of human neonates with established BPD. Collectively, our study unveils a novel demonstration of enhancing autophagy and antiapoptotic effects, specifically through the inhibition of RPTOR as a potentially useful therapeutic target for the treatment of hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and BPD in developing lungs.

AB  - Background Chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a significant pulmonary complication for preterm infants. In addition to decreased alveolarization, these infants can develop obstructive and/or restrictive lung function due to increases in or dysregulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Our mouse model mimics the pathophysiology observed in infants with severe BPD and we have previously reported decreased pulmonary miR-29b expression in this model. The current studies tested the hypothesis that liposomal mediated restoration of miR-29b in the developing lung will improve lung alveolarization and minimize the pulmonary fibrosis. Methods MiR-29 levels were measured in the plasma of preterm infants by PCR. Pregnant C3H/HeN mice received an intraperitoneal LPS injection on E16 and newborn pups were exposed in 85% oxygen from birth to 14 days of life. On postnatal day 3, PBS containing a liposomal preparation of miR-29b or an empty liposome was administered intranasally. On postnatal day 14 or 28, mouse lung tissues were analyzed for changes in miR-29 expression, alveolarization, and matrix protein expression. Results Analyses of plasma obtained from preterm infants during the first week of life indicate that circulating miR-29b levels are suppressed and the levels are inversely correlated to severity in infants later diagnosed with BPD. In our mouse model, modest improvements in alveolarization were detected in the miR-29btreated mice. MiR-29b treatment completely attenuated the LPS/O2-associated increases in aSMA, MMP-9, and SMAD 2/3 and restored PDGFa levels in lung tissues. Conclusion Our data suggest that miR-29b restoration may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent severe BPD in prematurely born infants.

On postnatal day 14 or 28, mouse lung tissues were analyzed for changes in miR-29 expression, alveolarization, and matrix protein expression. Results Decreases in alveolarization and increases in septal thickness were observed at both 14 and 28 days after LPS/O2 exposure. Administration of AAV9- miR29b modestly improved alveolarization at 28 days but completely prevented the increases in septal thickness observed at both 14 and 28 days. AAV9-miR29b also prevented the increases in phospho-SMAD2/3, aSMA, vimentin, and MMP-9. Conclusion Our data suggest that miR-29b restoration may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent severe BPD in prematurely born infants.

AB  - Background We have earlier demonstrated that genetic knock out of sphingosine kinase1 (SphK1) ameliorated hyperoxia (75%) induced lung injury in a neonatal murine model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). SphK 1 catalyzes the formation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which acts through G protein coupled receptors S1P1-5. Exposure of neonatal mice pups to hyperoxia enhanced SphK1 expression and S1P levels and promoted formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lungs. In vitro, exposure of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) to hyperoxia (3-24 h) stimulated SphK1 activity, S1P generation and ROS production via p47phox, which was blocked by PF-543, a potent and specific SphK1 inhibitor. Hypothesis PF-543 protects neonatal lungs from hyperoxia-induced BPD. Methods Neonatal mice were administered PF-543 (5 mg/kg/dose, intraperitoneal injection) starting on postnatal day 3 (PN3) and exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (75% O2) for 7 days. Mice received three additional doses of PF-543, which were administered on alternate days and mice were sacrificed on PN 11. Broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue were collected, and markers of inflammation and lung histology were evaluated. Plasma S1P levels were measured to determine the efficacy of PF-543 in inhibiting SphK1. Results SphK1 inhibition by PF-543 resulted in amelioration of hyperoxia-induced BPD as evidenced by improved alveolarization characterized by decreased mean linear intercept compared to controls. Also, neonatal pups that received PF-543 showed decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells in alveolar space, lower levels of protein and ROS in BAL fluid compared to controls. Administration of PF543 was accompanied by reduced plasma S1P levels. Conclusions Inhibition of SphK1 activity by, PF-543 significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and BPD in newborn mice. These results suggest that PF-543 can serve as a potential therapeutic drug to treat BPD.

AB  - Rationale Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic disease of preterm babies. While current clinical care has largely improved the survival of preterm babies, incidence of BPD and poor health outcomes associated with this disease remain major clinical problems. Lung cellular stress and inflammation have been linked to BPD pathogenesis in humans and experimental models. Fra-1 (Fosl1) is a heterodimeric partner of Jun/AP-1 transcription factor and is known to differentially regulate gene expression involved in various cellular processes, including cellular stress and inflammation, which are known to contribute to BPD pathogenesis. We examine whether Fra-1/AP1 transcription factor is a critical modulator of BPD pathogenesis. Methods To test our hypothesis, we have used Fra-1 floxed (Fra-1FF or WT) and Fra-1 null (Fra-1-/-) mice, and mice with a conditional deletion of Fra-1 in myeloid cells. Fra-1 in myeloid cells was deleted by crossing Fra-1 floxed mice with a transgenic mice bearing Cre under the control of the LyzM promoter (hereafter notated as Fra-1-/-LysM mice). Fra-1F/F, Fra-1-/- and Fra-1-/-LysM pups (1-day-old) (n = 3-5/group) with mothers were exposed to 95% O2 for 72 h and allowed to recover in room air for two weeks. Mice were sacrificed, the left lungs were fixed, sectioned, and stained with H&E to visualize alveolar simplification and to quantify mean chord length (MCL) by morphometry analysis. Fra-1F/F, Fra-1-/- and Fra-1-/-LysM pups exposed to 95% O2 for 72 h were immediately sacrificed and the left lung was collected for RNA isolation, and right lobe was used for protein analysis. Expression levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators and antioxidant genes in the lungs of WT (Fra-1F/F) and Fra-1-/- pups exposed to 95% O2 for 72 h were analyzed by qPCR. Results We found increased expression of Fra-1 in the lungs of pups exposed to hypeorixia. Fra-1 null pups showed markedly reduced levels of hyperoxia-induced alveoli simplification (or MCL) as compared to WT pups (33% vs 6%, WT vs Fra1-/ -), suggesting that Fra-1 signaling is required for BPD development. Alveoli simplification in the lungs of Fra-1-/-LysM pups exposed to hyperoxia was 12% lower than WT counterparts (33% vs 21%, WT vs Fra-1-/-LysM), suggesting that Fra-1 signaling in myeloid cells partly contributes to BPD. The expression levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6) were markedly lower in the lungs of Fra1-/- pups exposed to 72 h hyperoxia than in WT counterparts. Surprisingly, antioxidant gene expression in the lungs of hyperoxia exposed Fra-1-/- pups was also markedly lower than in WT counterparts. Conclusion Our findings suggest that Fra-1 signaling both in lung resident and inflammatory cells play an important role in promoting hyperoxia-induced BPD, and that Fra-1 regulates this process at least in part by modulating inflammatory cytokine and antioxidant gene expression in the lung.

AB  - Background With no effective treatment to prevent or reverse bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a multifactorial chronic lung disease of preterm infants, the need for new therapies is urgent. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have shown promise in numerous preclinical models of lung pathologies relevant to neonatology. We have shown that the therapeutic capacity of MSCs is comprised in their secretome, and our recent studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic vector is represented by the exosomes (extracellular vesicles; EVs) they release. Here, we aimed to purify and comprehensively characterize MSC-EVs from both human bone marrow (BMSC) and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (WJ) and investigate the efficacy of MSC-EV treatments in BPD. Methods EVs in conditioned media were isolated by density on iodixanol gradient and characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot. Proteomic profiling was obtained by LC-MS. Immunomodulatory capacity of MSC-EVs was assessed by an in vitro macrophage polarization assay. Newborn FVB mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% O2) for 7 days (postnatal day (PN) 1-7). At PN 4 mice were treated with a bolus intravenous dose of purified MSC-EVs or human dermal fibroblast-EVs (HDF-EVs). After hyperoxic exposure the mice were placed in room air for one to five weeks. Histological analysis of lungs harvested at PN 14 and PN 42 was performed to assess alveolar injury, blood vessel number and vascular remodeling. At PN 42, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed and pulmonary function tests were conducted. Results EVs immunoblots were positive for CD9, TSG101 and Alix. Proteomic profiling of WJMSC-EVs and HDF-EVs detected species unique or differentially enriched in MSC-EVs. In vitro, addition of MSC-EVs to alveolar macrophages (MH-S cell line) significantly reduced the induction of M1 markers such as TNFalpha and CCL5. Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited a significantly higher mean linear intercept compared to normoxic controls or to hyperoxia-exposed mice treated with either BMSC-EVs or WJMSC-EVs, whereas HDF-EV treatment had no beneficial effect on lung architecture. Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited elevated RVSP compared to normoxic control mice, which was effectively reduced by treatment with BMSC-EVs or WJMSC-EVs. Conclusion We show that a bolus dose of purified human MSC-EVs, from two different MSC sources effectively alleviates core features of hyperoxia-induced BPD, drastically improving lung development and associated pulmonary hypertension, providing a novel platform for a new therapeutic intervention in newborn cardio-respiratory diseases.

AB  - Background Preeclampsia (Pre E), a de novo development of Hypertension in consort with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation is the prominent cause of morbidity and mortality in mother and the neonates. It affects approximately 3-8% of overall pregnancies. Although, particular etiologies remain unknown, It has been reinforced by numerous studies that Pre E is not just a single disorder, but a syndrome of pertinent multiple pathophysiological factors. Methods A retrospective chart review over a year of 2014 ( January 2014 to December 2014) was conducted of all pregnancies occurred at Baylor Scott and White Health System, Temple, Texas. (N=3704). We distributed subjects into two different groups: Preeclampsia (N=299) vs. Non preeclampsia (N=3405) and compared their basic characteristics such as sex, race, birth numbers, mode of delivery, APGAR score, gestational age, birth weight as well as occurrences of gestational age, birth weight, admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality between two groups using two separate analyses. Results We learned amongst two groups, infants born to Preeclamptic mothers have significantly lower birthweight (Mean=2739, SD=845 grams) compared to Non Preeclamptic mothers (Mean=3200, SD=659 grams), significantly higher rates of C-sections (44%) compared to Non Preeclamptic (28%), significantly lower GA (Mean=36.4 weeks, SD=2.59 weeks) compared to Non Preeclamptic group (Mean=38.3 weeks, SD=3.38 weeks), significantly higher rates of multiple gestation (7%) compared to Non Preeclamptic group (3%), significantly higher occurrence of hypoglycemia (26%) compared to non Preeclamptic group (20%), significantly higher rate of thrombocytopenia (28%) compared to Non Preeclamptic group (17%) and significantly higher length of stay (Mean=19 days, SD=20 days) compared to Non Preeclamptic group (Mean=14 days, SD=20 days). Conclusion Infants born to Preeclamptic mothers have higher risk of c/s, higher risk of multiple gestation pregnancy, lower birth weight indicating intra uterine growth restriction and the lower gestational age indicating preterm birth. The data indicate the higher rate of hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia and requirement of increased length of hospital stay in infants born to Preeclamptic mothers compared to Non Preeclamptic mothers.

AB  - Introduction: MECP2 related disorders overwhelmingly occur in females. Three variants have been described: 1) Classic Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with apparently normal psychomotor development until 18 months of life, followed by regression in language and motor skills; 2) Atypical Rett syndrome, identified in patients with learning or intellectual disabilities along with motor findings of tremor or spasticity; and 3) Severe neonatal encephalopathy, described mainly in affected males with death before 2 years of age. Herein we present a case of the severe encephalopathy phenotype in a female infant with central sleep apnea. Report of Case: We report a case of a 7 month old girl with a history of 29 week prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia who presented with recurrent apneic spells at home during wakefulness and sleep, some requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Polysomnography revealed a total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 26.1/hour, obstructive AHI of 5.2/hour, central index of 20.9/ hour, and end-tidal CO2 levels greater than 50mmHg for 48.8 % of the total sleep time (worse during NREM). A diagnosis of central hypoventilation was confirmed. Testing for Phox 2B was negative. Full genome sequencing reported a mutation in the MECP2 gene. Additional workup revealed a patent ductus arteriosus, cortical visual impairment and EEG findings of encephalopathy without seizure activity. A tracheostomy was performed and respiratory support with mechanical ventilation was initiated. Conclusion(s): Although congenital central hypoventilation syndrome is a common cause of central hypoventilation in infancy, other etiologies must be considered in the differential diagnosis especially when testing is inconclusive. The presence of central sleep apnea in older females with Classic Rett syndrome has been reported. However, presentation during infancy in a female (as in our case) is rare.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary transplantation can be the only therapeutic alternative for infants with early onset severe lung disease. Lung transplantation in infants arises some ethical issues and poses a special challenge due to the difficulties in monitoring lung function, and the technical issues in performing lung biopsies. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed our pediatric transplant recipients aged under 2 years between 1997 and 2016. Demographic information, primary disease, age at transplantation, waiting list time, main complications, and mortality are presented as total, mean, and percentages. Immunosuppressive regimen included basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, mycophenolate (azathioprine in early cases) and steroids. RESULT(S): Ten pulmonary transplants at an age range of 4-23 months were performed, which corresponds to 17.2% of the total pediatric lung transplants (58) performed in our institution. The primary lung diseases were the following: interstitial lung disease (ABCA 3 deficiency, protein C deficiency, chronic pneumonitis of infancy): 5 (50%), pulmonary arterial hypertension: 2 (20%), pulmonary vein stenosis: 2 (20%) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia: 1 (10%). Mean waiting time on the transplant list was 102.1 days. Before transplantation, 8 patients (80%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (mean 107 days) and 1 patient (10%) non-invasive mechanical ventilation (mean 150 days). Bronchial complications included bronchomalacia and bronchial stenosis requiring dilatation in 4 patients and 1 stent. Two patients required pulmonary artery dilatation. Four patients had an episode of acute cellular rejection and 1 of acute humoral rejection. Two patients developed posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease which was treated with rituximab (1) and rituximab plus chemotherapy (1). Five patients developed chronic lung allograft dysfunction expressed as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). At 5 years of transplantation 6 patients were alive (60%) and at 10 years there were 5 patients alive (50%). Causes of death were: primary graft dysfunction (1), obliterans bronchiolitis in 2 patients (one chronic rejection, one post adenovirus infection), and infection in 2 cases (metapneumovirus pneumonitis and Aspergillus infection). CONCLUSION(S): Infants have comparable survival to older children even when transplant is performed in patients needing prolonged mechanical ventilator support.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To compare perinatal outcomes of preterm premature of membranes treated with 3rd generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole (regimen A) versus 3rd generation cephalosporin plus clarithromycin (regimen B). METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review compared perinatal outcomes in 186 patients with PROM <34 weeks receiving antibiotics regimen A (n=110) versus regimen B (n=76). Ninety-eight patients with PPROM between 25 and 32 weeks of gestation were chosen for comparing changes of the lipid peroxide, the protein carbonyl groups, ORAC values, and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the maternal venous plasma (regimen A; n=54, regimen B; n=44). RESULT(S): The rates of spontaneous preterm delivery within 2 days after initiation of antibiotic treatment were significantly lower in those receiving regimen B (4/76, 5.3%) than in those receiving regimen A (18/110, 16.4%) (p=0.022). There was no difference in the mean antibiotic-to-delivery interval (regimen A; 11.0 days, regimen B; 11.5 days). There is no difference in the presence of acute histologic chorioamnionitis and funisitis. There is no difference in the rate of neonatal outcomes including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, intra-ventricular hemorrhage, peri-ventricular leukomalacia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. There was no significant difference in lipid peroxide levels, protein carbonyl formation, ORAC, and IL-6 of the venous plasma before the antibiotics administration, day 3 and day 7 after the antibiotics administration between regimen A and B. CONCLUSION(S): Our results show that two antibiotics regimens may not effect on the latency period and improvement of neonatal outcomes. And they may not effect on the changes of oxidative stress. Although there was no significant difference in neonatal outcomes, 3rd generation cephalosporin plus clarithromycin regimen may have beneficial effect for short-term prolongation of pregnancy (up to 48 hours) to allow for the administration of antenatal steroids.

AB  - Poractant alfa (Curosurf) is a natural, porcine-derived surfactant that is well established as an effective and generally well-tolerated agent in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. The efficacy of poractant alfa in RDS is better than that of early-generation synthetic surfactants, and limited data are available regarding its efficacy versus new-generation synthetic agents. Poractant alfa 200 mg/kg is more effective than poractant alfa 100 mg/kg or bovine-derived beractant 100 mg/kg. Techniques for administering poractant alfa include via an endotracheal tube or less invasive techniques [e.g. less invasive surfactant administration (LISA)] performed during non-invasive ventilation of spontaneously breathing infants via nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Administration of poractant alfa 200 mg/kg in early rescue [i.e. fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) >= 0.3] via LISA is associated with increased successful management on continuous positive airway pressure, as well as reductions in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and death/BPD.Copyright © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many factors contribute to the development of BPD basically by increasing inflammation in preterm lungs. However, premature neonates have insufficient anti-inflammatory capacity. We aimed to evaluate the effect of etanercept, an anti-TNF agent, on BPD development in newborn rat model with hyperoxia-induced lung injury., METHODS: Thirty-two newborn rats were divided into 3 groups as control group (Group 1, n = 11), hyperoxia + placebo group (Group 2, n = 10), and hyperoxia + etanercept group (Group 3, n = 11). Histopathological and biochemical analysis were performed in order to assess inflammation and oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were studied, histopathological scoring and radial alveolar count were applied in lung tissue. Lamellar body membrane protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) gene expressions were studied in immunohistochemical evaluation of tissue samples. All three groups were compared with each other in terms of all parameters., RESULTS: SOD and GSH-Px activities were significantly higher, whereas MDA levels were lower in group 3, compared to group 2 (p < 0.001). Histopathological scores were lower, lamellar body membrane protein expression and radial alveolar count were higher in group 3 (p < 0.05). NF-kappaB expression was higher in group 2, but lower in group 3 in comparison with group 1. Expression of VEGF was decreased in group 2 but came close to group 1 with etanercept treatment in group 3., CONCLUSIONS: We found etanercept treatment to be protective in newborn rats with hyperoxia-induced lung damage.

AB  - Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have chronic, irreversible airway inflammation; currently, there is no effective or curative treatment and the main goals of COPD management are to mitigate symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. Stem cell based therapy offers a promising therapeutic approach that has shown potential in diverse degenerative lung diseases. Preclinical studies have demonstrated encouraging outcomes of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) therapy for lung disorders including emphysema, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This review summarizes available data on 15 studies currently registered by the ClinicalTrials.gov repository, which used different stem cell therapy protocols for COPD; these included bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), bone marrow-derived MSCs, adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ADSCs), and adipose-derived MSCs. Published results of three trials indicate that administering BMMCs or MSCs in the setting of degenerative lung disease is safe and may improve patients' condition and quality of life; however, larger-scale studies are needed to evaluate efficacy. Results of another completed trial (NCT01872624) are not yet published, and eleven other studies are ongoing; these include MSCs therapy in emphysema, several studies of ADSCs in COPD, another in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and plerixafor mobilization of CD117 stem cells to peripheral blood.Copyright © 2017 Shih-Lung Cheng et al.

AB  - Hyperoxic lung injury is pathologically characterized by alveolar edema, interlobular septal edema, hyaline membrane disease, lung inflammation, and alveolar hemorrhage. Although the precise mechanism by which hyperoxia causes lung injury is not well defined, oxidative stress, epithelial cell death, and proinflammatory cytokines are thought to be involved. Probucol - a commercially available drug for treating hypercholesterolemia - has been suggested to have antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. This study aimed to assess whether probucol could attenuate hyperoxic lung injury in mice. Mice were exposed to 95% O2 for 72 h, with or without pre-treatment with 130 mug/kg probucol intratracheally. Probucol treatment significantly decreased both the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the degree of lung injury in hyperoxia-exposed mice. Probucol treatment reduced the number of cells positive for 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and suppressed NF-kappaB activation, Bax expression, and caspase-9 activation in lung tissues from hyperoxia-exposed mice. These results suggest that probucol can reduce oxidative DNA damage, apoptotic cell death, and inflammation in lung tissues. Intratracheal administration of probucol may be a novel treatment for lung diseases induced by oxidative stress, such as hyperoxic lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.Copyright © 2017 Kawaguchi et al.

AB  - Background: Very-low-birth-weight infants are largely dependent on parenteral nutrition after birth. Parenteral nutritionassociated liver disease is often observed in long-term parenteral nutrition with pure soybean oil lipid emulsion. A novel multicomponent lipid emulsion may prevent liver injury, improve growth, and decrease morbidity in preterm infants. Objective(s): To compare the effects of a multicomponent lipid emulsion with a conventional pure soybean oil lipid emulsion on the incidence of neonatal cholestasis, neonatal growth, neonatal morbidity, and the biochemical assessment of liver enzymes. Material(s) and Method(s): Preterm infants weighing less than 1,250 g were allocated using a double-blind method. Both groups received parenteral nutrition, based on the same protocol. The study group received multicomponent lipid emulsion, while the control group received the standard pure soybean oil lipid emulsion. Serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were measured before enrollment, and at week 1, 2, and 3. Clinical data on neonatal outcomes were collected until the day of discharge. Result(s): Each group was comprised of 22 preterm infants. The mean total parenteral nutrition (TPN) days were 12.5+/-8.1 and 10.5+/-5.9 in the study group and the control group respectively. There were no significant differences in laboratory parameters, including liver enzymes and GGT between the two groups. The incidence of cholestasis was 4.5% in the study group, and 9% in the control group, which was not statistically significant. No differences were observed in neonatal growth or neonatal morbidity including sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis between the two groups. Eight infants (36%) in the study group experienced growth failure before discharge compared with 12 infants (54%) in the control group. Conclusion(s): Multicomponent lipid emulsion appeared to be safe and well tolerated in preterm infants. No beneficial effects on the prevention of liver dysfunction were seen based on the type of lipid emulsion.Copyright © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.

AB  - The survival rate of preterm neonates increases significantly with the development of neonatal care and comprehensive treatment, but more and more high-risk preterm neonates suffer from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD, thus it is still a major cause of disability and mortality in neonates. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the pathogenesis and treatment of BPD in depth. Fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) is a paracrine growth factor binding its receptors (FGFR1 and FGFR2) to regulate a lot of biological processes. FGF-10, with mitotic and chemotactic activities, plays an important role in histogenesis during embryonic stage. It can prevent and attenuate mechanical or infection induced inflammation in lung. Results showed lung FGF-10 expression reduced significantly in neonatal mice with BPD, and exogenous FGF-10 was able to promote the growth of pulmonary mesenchymal stem cells and alveolar epithelial cells type II and reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We preliminarily explored the relationship between FGF-10 and NF-kappaB in this animal model and found FGF-10 could inhibit NF-kappaB p65 expression as a feedback. Thus, to investigate the protective effects of FGF-10 on hyperoxia induced BPD in neonatal mice will provide a new strategy for the treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on neonatal rat alveolar arrest induced by intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Method(s): A neonatal SD rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was constructed by intra-amniotic injection of LPS in pregnant rats. The pregnant rats (E19) were randomly assigned to Saline group, LPS group and LPS+anti-IL-1beta group. The lungs of the neonatal rats were randomly collected 1, 3 and 7 days after birth. Pathological changes in the lungs were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining, and expression of IL-1beta mRNA and protein was detected by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Rat bone marrow derived primary macrophage was cultured in vitro, and given LPS intervention, then genes related with IL-1beta were detected through whole transcriptome sequencing. Result(s): Compared with the Saline group, the alveolar counts and secondary septa counts significantly decreased, and mean liner intercept significantly increased in LPS group. Moreover, the expression of IL-1beta mRNA and protein in lungs significantly increased in LPS group. The LPS-induced pathological changes of lung tissues in neonatal rats were improved by anti-IL-1beta. LPS could up-regulate the expression of genes including Gbp5, Ccl3, Nod2, Ccr5, Mefv, Casp4 and Ifnar1, but down-regulate Lgals9 and Gstp1. Among these genes Gbp5, Ccl3, Nod2, Ccr5, Casp4, Ifnar1 and Lgals9 could positively regulate IL-1beta production. Conclusion(s): LPS can induce alveolar arrest through up-regulating the expression of IL-1beta in macrophages in neonatal rat BPD model. Whole transcriptome sequencing reveals that LPS can regulate the expression of IL-1beta in macrophages through several paths.Copyright © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

AB  - It is well-known that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Angiopoietin (Ang)-1 are important regulators of alveolar and pulmonary vascular development. This study investigated the expression of VEGF and Ang-1 in postnatal rats with hyperoxia-induced lung injury and its effect on pulmonary development. Forty-eight 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups and exposed to either hyperoxia (>= 95%) or air. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to measure the mRNA and protein expression levels of VEGF and Ang-1 in pulmonary tissues. No significant differences in the expression levels of VEGF and Ang-1 protein or mRNA were noted between the control and hyperoxia groups on days 1 and 3 (P>0.05); however, an obvious significant difference was noted on day 7 (P<0.05). The mRNA expression levels of VEGF and Ang-1 were 0.722 +/- 0.372 and 0.828 +/- 0.462, respectively, in the control group and 0.239 +/- 0.293 and 0.327 +/- 0.184, respectively, in the hyperoxia group. The protein expression levels of VEGF and Ang-1 were 0.632 +/- 0.289 and 0.573 +/- 0.436, respectively, in the control group, 0.358 +/- 0.128 and 0.204 +/- 0.068, respectively, in the hyperoxia group. The pulmonary tissues of the hyperoxia group manifested dysplastic characteristics with alveolar simplification, a reduction in alveolar numbers, and retardation in microvascular development. Since VEGF and Ang-1 are important regulators of alveolar and pulmonary vascular development that are involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury and development, their expression profile may be helpful for studying the pathogenic mechanism of and treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

AB  - The paper contains structure analysis of the lower respiratory tract recurrent disease in 180 children aged one to five years, residents of Odessa, who were treated in pulmonology department of Children's Academician BJ Reznik City Clinical Hospital. The examinees are represented by two groups: 150 children with recurrent wheezing and 30 - with recurrent pneumonia. The selection criteria were: abnormality of central nervous system, abnormality, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart defects, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus-infection. The analysis detected that in the survey sample with recurrent lower respiratory tract disease 3.88% of children had Orphan disease. Thus in the group of children with recurrent wheezing were diagnosed 2 cases of congenital lobar hyperexpansion (ORPHA 1928), one case of lung bronchogenic cyst (ORPHA 2357), one case of pulmonary hypoplasia in the lower lobe of the left lung (ORPHA 2257), and one case of primary ciliary dyskinesia (ORPHA 98,861). Regarding the entire structure of recurrent wheezing, most frequently was detected atopic asthma (49.33%). In 24.6% cases the cause of recurrent wheezing was associated with the otolaryngological pathology. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed in two children. Recurrent pneumonia cases were differentiated if the localization of process was at the same or different places. When one-sided localization of pneumonia was established, next congenital airway malformations were diagnosed - 3 cases of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (type I). Genetic pathology often occurred in cases with different lesions location. In all cases of uncertain diagnosis, predictors of recurrent lower respiratory tract diseases were revealed.Copyright © by Larisa Koval 2017.

AB  - Aim: This study evaluated cardiac function and its associations with lung function and neonatal pulmonary morbidity in very low birthweight (VLBW) children, with and without severe radiographic bronchopulmonary dysplasia (radBPD), at school age. Method(s): We examined 18 VLBW children with radBPD, 17 VLBW children without radBPD and 18 healthy term-born children using conventional echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging, speckle tracking echocardiography and real-time three-dimensional echocardiography at six years to 14 years of age. Lung function was studied by impulse oscillometry. Plasma N-terminal-proBNP concentrations were measured. Result(s): Cardiac function and N-terminal-proBNP concentrations did not differ between the groups. No associations were found between cardiac function and neonatal dexamethasone, oxygen or ventilator therapies. In VLBW children, poorer reactance correlated with larger left ventricle (LV) end-systolic (Spearman's rho = -0.45) and end-diastolic (rho = -0.50) volumes and higher resistance correlated with higher LV dyssynchrony indexes, with rho ranging from 0.37 to 0.48. Greater bronchodilation responses correlated with lower early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocities, with rho ranging from 0.39 to 0.42. Conclusion(s): BPD survivors had normal cardiac function at the age of six years to 14 years. No associations were found between neonatal pulmonary morbidity and cardiac parameters. Poorer lung function correlated modestly with LV echocardiographic parameters in VLBW children.Copyright ©2016 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Neonatal pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common manifestation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality of preterm birth. Postnatal growth restriction (PNGR) and hyperoxia are independent contributors to PH development, as indicated by our previous work in a rat model of BPD. Objective(s): To explore the metabolic consequences of induction of PH with hyperoxia and PNGR in a rat model of BPD. Method(s): Sprague-Dawley rat pups (n = 4/group) underwent three modes of PH induction: (1) growth restriction-induced by larger litter size; (2) hyperoxia-induced by 75% oxygen exposure; (3) combined growth restriction and hyperoxia. Primary metabolism, complex lipids, biogenic amines, and lipid mediators were characterized in plasma and lung tissue using GC- and LC-MS technologies. Result(s): Specific to hyperoxic induction, pulmonary metabolomics suggested increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as indicated by: (1) increased indicators of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial respiration; (2) changes in ROS-sensitive pathway activity and metabolites including the polyol pathway and xanthine oxidase pathways, and reduced glutathione; (3) decreased plasmalogens. Unlike the lung, circulating metabolite changes were induction mode-specific or additive in the combined modes (e.g. 1) growth-restriction reduced phosphatidylcholine; (2) hyperoxia increased oxylipins and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO); (3) additive effects on 3-hydroxybutyric acid and arginine. Conclusion(s): The present study highlights the variety of metabolic changes that occur due to PNGR- and hyperoxia-induced PH, identifying numerous metabolites and pathways influenced by treatment-specific or combined effects. The rat model used in this study presents a robust means of uncovering the mechanisms that contribute to the pathology of PH.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background Progesterone administration has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth and neonatal morbidity in women at high risk, but there is uncertainty about longer term effects on the child. Methods We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of vaginal progesterone, 200 mg daily taken from 22-24 to 34 weeks of gestation, on pregnancy and infant outcomes in women at risk of preterm birth (because of previous spontaneous birth at <=34 weeks and 0 days of gestation, or a cervical length <=25 mm, or because of a positive fetal fibronectin test combined with other clinical risk factors for preterm birth [any one of a history in a previous pregnancy of preterm birth, second trimester loss, preterm premature fetal membrane rupture, or a history of a cervical procedure to treat abnormal smears]). The objective of the study was to determine whether vaginal progesterone prophylaxis given to reduce the risk of preterm birth affects neonatal and childhood outcomes. We defined three primary outcomes: fetal death or birth before 34 weeks and 0 days gestation (obstetric), a composite of death, brain injury, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (neonatal), and a standardised cognitive score at 2 years of age (childhood), imputing values for deaths. Randomisation was done through a web portal, with participants, investigators, and others involved in giving the intervention, assessing outcomes, or analysing data masked to treatment allocation until the end of the study. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN14568373. Findings Between Feb 2, 2009, and April 12, 2013, we randomly assigned 1228 women to the placebo group (n=610) and the progesterone group (n=618). In the placebo group, data from 597, 587, and 439 women or babies were available for analysis of obstetric, neonatal, and childhood outcomes, respectively; in the progesterone group the corresponding numbers were 600, 589, and 430. After correction for multiple outcomes, progesterone had no significant effect on the primary obstetric outcome (odds ratio adjusted for multiple comparisons [OR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.22) or neonatal outcome (OR 0.62, 0.38-1.03), nor on the childhood outcome (cognitive score, progesterone group vs placebo group, 97.3 [SD 17.9] vs 97.7 [17.5]; difference in means -0.48, 95% CI -2.77 to 1.81). Maternal or child serious adverse events were reported in 70 (11%) of 610 patients in the placebo group and 59 (10%) of 616 patients in the progesterone group (p=0.27). Interpretation Vaginal progesterone was not associated with reduced risk of preterm birth or composite neonatal adverse outcomes, and had no long-term benefit or harm on outcomes in children at 2 years of age.

AB  - Lung inflammation in premature infants contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease with long-term sequelae. Pilot studies administering budesonide suspended in surfactant have found reduced BPD without the apparent adverse effects that occur with systemic dexamethasone therapy. Our objective was to determine budesonide potency, stability, and antiinflammatory effects in human fetal lung. We cultured explants of second-trimester fetal lung with budesonide or dexamethasone and used microscopy, immunoassays, RNA sequencing, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and pulsating bubble surfactometry. Budesonide suppressed secreted chemokines IL-8 and CCL2 (MCP-1) within 4 hours, reaching a 90% decrease at 12 hours, which was fully reversed 72 hours after removal of the steroid. Half-maximal effects occurred at 0.04-0.05 nM, representing a fivefold greater potency than for dexamethasone. Budesonide significantly induced 3.6% and repressed 2.8% of 14,500 sequenced mRNAs by 1.6- to 95-fold, including 119 genes that contribute to the glucocorticoid inflammatory transcriptome; some are known targets of nuclear factor-kappaB. By global proteomics, 22 secreted inflammatory proteins were hormonally regulated. Two glucocorticoid-regulated genes of interest because of their association with lung disease are CHI3L1 and IL1RL1. Budesonide retained activity in the presence of surfactant and did not alter its surface properties. There was some formation of palmitate-budesonide in lung tissue but no detectable metabolism to inactive 16alpha-hydroxy prednisolone. We concluded that budesonide is a potent and stable antiinflammatory glucocorticoid in human fetal lung in vitro, supporting a beneficial antiinflammatory response to lung-targeted budesonide:surfactant treatment of infants for the prevention of BPD.

AB  - Objective To assess whether late surfactant treatment in extremely low gestational age (GA) newborn infants requiring ventilation at 7-14 days, who often have surfactant deficiency and dysfunction, safely improves survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Study design Extremely low GA newborn infants (GA <=28 0/7 weeks) who required mechanical ventilation at 7-14 days were enrolled in a randomized, masked controlled trial at 25 US centers. All infants received inhaled nitric oxide and either surfactant (calfactant/Infasurf) or sham instillation every 1-3 days to a maximum of 5 doses while intubated. The primary outcome was survival at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) without BPD, as evaluated by physiological oxygen/flow reduction. Results A total of 511 infants were enrolled between January 2010 and September 2013. There were no differences between the treated and control groups in mean birth weight (701 +/- 164 g), GA (25.2 +/- 1.2 weeks), percentage born at GA <26 weeks (70.6%), race, sex, severity of lung disease at enrollment, or comorbidities of prematurity. Survival without BPD did not differ between the treated and control groups at 36 weeks PMA (31.3% vs 31.7%; relative benefit, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.75-1.28; P =.89) or 40 weeks PMA (58.7% vs 54.1%; relative benefit, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.92-1.27; P =.33). There were no between-group differences in serious adverse events, comorbidities of prematurity, or severity of lung disease to 36 weeks. Conclusion Late treatment with up to 5 doses of surfactant in ventilated premature infants receiving inhaled nitric oxide was well tolerated, but did not improve survival without BPD at 36 or 40 weeks. Pulmonary and neurodevelopmental assessments are ongoing. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01022580.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Despite remarkable improvements in survival of extremely premature infants, the burden of BPD among survivors remains a frustrating problem for parents and caregivers. Advances, such as antenatal steroids and surfactant replacement, which have dramatically improved survival, have not reduced BPD among survivors. Other advances that have significantly improved the combined outcome of death or BPD, such as vitamin A and avoidance of mechanical ventilation, have had smaller magnitude effects on the outcome of BPD alone. Postnatal steroids have a clear beneficial effect on BPD, but the optimal preparation, dose, and timing for maximizing benefit and minimizing harm have yet to be determined. This persistent burden of BPD among the most immature survivors remains a challenge for the NRN and other researchers in neonatal medicine.Copyright © 2016

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an inflammatory lung disorder common in premature infants who undergo mechanical ventilation with supplemental oxygen. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been used to prevent experimental and clinical BPD. Earlier studies showed that NO effects in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) are mediated by S-nitrosothiol uptake via L-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1). Because LAT1 expression could influence the efficacy of iNO therapy, we sought to determine whether pulmonary LAT1 expression is altered in preterm baboons with experimental BPD and in human newborns susceptible to developing BPD. Using fixed lung obtained from 125 d to 140 d gestation baboon models of BPD, LAT1 immunostaining was measured in control and BPD animals. In adult controls and in 140 d gestational controls (GC), LAT1 was expressed in both type I and type II AECs. In 140 d BPD lungs, LAT1 expression density in alveolar tissue was decreased. In 125 d GC baboons, LAT1 immunostaining was largely confined to cuboidal AECs, whereas animals given 14 d of mechanical ventilation exhibited diminished alveolar septal LAT1 Labeling. The pattern in adult human donor lung was comparable to that observed in adult baboons. LAT1 was expressed in lungs obtained from some but not all very premature newborns at autopsy. In human and baboon lung, adult and newborn, pulmonary vascular cells expressed LAT1. In summary, LAT1 is expressed in AECs and pulmonary vascular cells in baboons and humans. Experimental BPD in premature baboons decreases pulmonary LAT1 expression and alters its spatial localization. Heterogeneity of functional LAT1 could affect S-nitrosothiol importation, which could impair iNO therapy. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:1048-1056. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Supplemental O2 to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants, is a major risk factor producing alteration in lung function, airway reactivity, and predisposition to respiratory infections. This study explores inflammatory and airway responses following neonatal hyperoxia in adult mice. Method(s): Newborn mouse litters were randomized to 85% O2 or room air (RA) on P3 for 12 days; mice were sacrificed either on P15 or at 15 weeks following recovery in RA. Airway hyper reactivity (AHR) was assessed in vivo (8 and 12 weeks) and in vitro (15 weeks) with methacholine; Lung and BAL were assayed for inflammatory mediators, cell counts, CD3 immunohistochemistry, and histopathology. Result(s): Hyperoxic mice had increased airway reactivity at baseline and following methacholine challenge in vivo (8 and 12 weeks); isolated tracheal rings had a significantly higher constriction response to methacholine in vitro compared to RA group. Inflammatory markers were higher at 2 weeks (MCP-1, IL-12, INF-gamma) and at 15 weeks (LTB4, VEGF); Lipoxin-A4 was lower in the hyperoxia group at both time points. Increased airway smooth muscle thickness and angiogenesis in the lung was seen at 15 weeks. Hyperoxic lungs exhibited alveolar simplification at 2 and 15 weeks. Absolute lymphocyte count was higher in lavage fluid with an increased CD3 cell count at 15 weeks suggesting persistent inflammation in adult mice following neonatal hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): Exposure to hyperoxia in newborn mice increases long-term airway reactivity with persistent lung inflammation associated with a marked increase in lymphocytes, suggesting long-term consequences in adults.

AB  - Background: While cor pulmonale has been noted in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), information on right ventricular (RV) function is limited. Objective(s): To assess RV function in infants with severe BPD and ascertain correlation with respiratory outcomes. Method(s): We prospectively assessed RV function using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), 2D fractional area change (FAC), M-mode tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and myocardial performance index (MPI) using echocardiography. Additionally, we compared RV function with preterm infants with no BPD. Result(s): Eighteen preterm infants with severe BPD were enrolled at 36 weeks' gestation. Higher E/E' (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) and lower FAC (r = 0.8, p < 0.0001) showed strong correlations with the subsequent duration of respiratory support. Correlations with TDI isovolumic velocity and Tei index were significant (-0.69, p = 0.002 and 0.58, p = 0.011, respectively). On comparison with infants with no BPD, TDI peak systolic velocities (0.06 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.01 m/s, p < 0.0001), peak isovolumic systolic velocities (0.05 +/- 0.009 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.008 m/s, p < 0.0001) and RV FAC (31 +/- 4.7 vs. 36 +/- 3.6%, p = 0.019) were significantly lower. Cardiac relaxation was impaired [higher TDI E/E' ratio (9.6 +/- 1.8 vs. 5.2 +/- 0.5, p < 0.0001) and higher RV MPI (0.33 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.03, p < 0.0001)]. Conclusion(s): Impaired RV performance in the infants with severe BPD at 36 weeks' corrected gestation correlated with a longer duration of subsequent respiratory support.Copyright © 2016 S.

AB  - Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Elevated levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and decreased levels of amino acid precursors of nitric oxide (NO) have been associated with PH, but have not been studied in infants with PH secondary to BPD. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to identify a biochemical marker for PH in infants with BPD. Method(s): Twenty infants, born at <27 weeks' gestational age (GA) and/or with a birth weight (BW) <=750 g, who met the criteria for BPD at 36 weeks' corrected GA (CGA) were enrolled in this cross-sectional pilot study. A screening echocardiogram was conducted at 36-38 weeks' CGA and plasma NT-proBNP and amino acid levels were obtained within 1 week of the screening echocardiogram. Result(s): Five infants (25%) had echocardiographic evidence of PH. GA and BW were not significantly different between the 2 groups (a PH group and a No PH group). NT-proBNP was significantly elevated in the PH group (median 1,650 vs. 520 pg/ml; p = 0.001) but citrulline levels were significantly lower (median 21 vs. 36 mumol/l; p = 0.005). Arginine levels were not significantly different between the groups (median 78 vs. 79 mumol/l; p = 1). Conclusion(s): NT-proBNP and the NO precursor citrulline may be cost-effective biochemical markers for screening for the presence of PH in preterm infants who have BPD. If validated in a larger study, such biochemical markers may, in part, replace PH screening echocardiograms in these patients.Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Objective To describe the epidemiology, risk factors, and in-hospital outcomes of tracheostomy in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Study design We analyzed electronic medical records from 348 neonatal intensive care units for the period 1997 to 2012, and evaluated the associations among infant demographics, diagnoses, and pretracheostomy cardiopulmonary support with in-hospital mortality. We also determined the trends in use of infant tracheostomy over time. Results We identified 885 of 887 910 infants (0.1%) who underwent tracheostomy at a median postnatal age of 72 days (IQR, 27-119 days) and a median postmenstrual age of 42 weeks (IQR, 39-46 weeks). The most common diagnoses associated with tracheostomy were bronchopulmonary dysplasia (396 of 885; 45%), other upper airway anomalies (202 of 885; 23%), and laryngeal anomalies (115 of 885; 13%). In-hospital mortality after tracheostomy was 14% (125 of 885). On adjusted analysis, near-term gestational age (GA), small for GA status, pulmonary diagnoses, number of days of forced fraction of inspired oxygen >0.4, and inotropic support before tracheostomy were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. The proportion of infants requiring tracheostomy increased from 0.01% in 1997 to 0.1% in 2005 (P <.001), but has remained stable since. Conclusion Tracheostomy is not commonly performed in hospitalized infants, but the associated mortality is high. Risk factors for increased in-hospital mortality after tracheostomy include near-term GA, small for GA status, and pulmonary diagnoses.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Continuous improvements in perinatal care have allowed the survival of increasingly more prematurely born infants. The establishment of respiration in an extremely immature yet still developing lung results in chronic lung injury with significant mortality and morbidity. We experimentally evaluated a novel medical strategy to prevent hyperoxia-induced lung injury by prenatal rosiglitazone. Material(s) and Method(s): Pregnant rabbits were injected with saline or rosiglitazone (3 mg/kg) 48 and 24 h prior to preterm delivery at 28 days of gestation (term = 31 days). The pups were held in normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (>95% O2), and assessment was done at three different time points (1 h, 24 h and 7 days). Result(s): The administration of rosiglitazone resulted in a significant decrease in tissue damping (resistance) on day 7. Furthermore, significantly increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, fetal liver kinase 1 and surfactant protein B immediately after delivery was noted by immunohistochemistery. On day 7, there was a more mature lung parenchymal architecture in rosiglitazone-exposed pups. Discussion(s): In a preterm rabbit model, prenatal maternal administration of rosiglitazone attenuates neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and results in a more mature pulmonary parenchyma.Copyright © 2015 S.

AB  - Background: Systemic maternal inflammation and neonatal hyperoxia arrest alveolarization in neonates. The aims were to test whether human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduce lung inflammation and improve lung development in perinatal inflammation- and hyperoxia-induced experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Method(s): Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 mg/kg/ day) on Gestational Days 20 and 21. Human MSCs (3x105 and 1x106 cells) in 0.03 ml normal saline (NS) were administered intratracheally on Postnatal Day 5. Pups were reared in room air (RA) or an oxygen-enriched atmosphere (O2) from Postnatal Days 1 to 14, and six study groups were obtained: LPS+RA+NS, LPS+RA+MSC (3x105 cells), LPS+RA+MSC (1x106 cells), LPS+O2+NS, LPS+O2+MSC (3x105 cells), and LPS+O2+MSC (1x106 cells). The lungs were excised for cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, and histological analyses on Postnatal Day 14. Result(s): Body weight was significantly lower in rats reared in hyperoxia than in those reared in RA. The LPS+O2+NS group exhibited a significantly higher mean linear intercept (MLI) and collagen density and a significantly lower vascular density than the LPS+RA+NS group did. Administering MSC to hyperoxia-exposed rats improved MLI and vascular density and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 6 levels and collagen density to normoxic levels. This improvement in lung development and fibrosis was accompanied by an increase and decrease in lung VEGF and CTGF expression, respectively. Conclusion(s): Human MSCs attenuated perinatal inflammation- and hyperoxia-induced defective alveolarization and angiogenesis and reduced lung fibrosis, likely through increased VEGF and decreased CTGF expression.Copyright © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen, which is routinely administered to preterm infants with pulmonary insufficiency, contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in these infants. Hyperoxia also contributes to the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults. The mechanisms of oxygen-mediated pulmonary toxicity are not completely understood. Recent studies have suggested an important role for cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1/1A2 in the protection against hyperoxic lung injury. The role of CYP1B1 in oxygen-mediated pulmonary toxicity has not been studied. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that CYP1B1 plays a mechanistic role in oxygen toxicity in pulmonary cells in vitro. In human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, hyperoxic treatment for 1-3 days led to decreased cell viability by about 50-80%. Hyperoxic cytotoxicity was accompanied by an increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by up to 110%, and an increase of TUNEL-positive cells by up to 4.8-fold. Western blot analysis showed hyperoxia to significantly down-regulate CYP1B1 protein level. Also, there was a decrease of CYP1B1 mRNA by up to 38% and Cyp1b1 promoter activity by up to 65%. On the other hand, CYP1B1 siRNA appeared to rescue the cell viability under hyperoxia stress, and overexpression of CYP1B1 significantly attenuated hyperoxic cytotoxicity after 48 h of incubation. In immortalized lung endothelial cells derived from Cyp1b1-null and wild-type mice, hyperoxia increased caspase 3/7 activities in a time-dependent manner, but endothelial cells lacking the Cyp1b1 gene showed significantly decreased caspase 3/7 activities after 48 and 72 h of incubation, implying that CYP1B1 might promote apoptosis in wild type lung endothelial cells under hyperoxic stress. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that CYP1B1 plays a mechanistic role in pulmonary oxygen toxicity, and CYP1B1-mediated apoptosis could be one of the mechanisms of oxygen toxicity. Thus, CYP1B1 could be a novel target for preventative and/or therapeutic interventions against BPD in infants and ALI/ARDS in adults. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infancy, currently, no effective therapy is available for it. The aim of the present study was to investigation the treatment effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in combination with recombinant human erythropoietin combination (rHuEPO) in hyperoxiainduced BPD injury and discussion the mechanism. Method(s): The BPD model was prepared by continuous high oxygen exposure to 14 days, 1 x 106 BMSCs and 5000 U/kg rHuEPO were injected respectively at 1h before and 7d after hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice, the animals received 4 different treatments (n=10 in each group). After raised the mice to 14-day, the body weight and airway structure, mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 , the protein levels of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected by histology, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting. Cell differentiation was observed type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2)-specific marker surfactant protein-C (SP-C) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) by immunofluorescence. Result(s): Compared with BMSCs alone, the body weight, airway structure, the levels of inflammatory cytokines and VEGF were significantly improvement in BMSCs/EPO group. Fourteen days after engraftment, BMSCs co-expressed PECAM-1 and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2)-specific marker SP-C, but not AEC1-marker AQP5. Conclusion(s): Two weeks after injection of BMSCs in combination with EPO significantly promoted lung repair after hyperoxia-induced alveoli dysplasia injury, decreased inflammation and enhanced angiogenesis. Therefore, the protective effect maybe through modulation of paracrine mechanism and provides firm information for clinical trial.

AB  - The Club cell 10kDa protein is one of the most abundant proteins in the respiratory mucosa. Lowered pulmonary or systemic CC10 levels correlate with poorer outcomes in several respiratory conditions such as neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma, COPD, and post-lung transplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). CC10 suppresses inflammation by at least two distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of phospholipase A2 enzymes and the arachidonic acid cascade and inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in respiratory epithelial cells, but CC10 is also chemically modified by inflammatory processes. Lindahl et al (1999) first reported on at least 3 distinct isoforms of CC10 in respiratory mucosal fluids in adults with significant respiratory sequelae to inhaled industrial chemical exposures. Ramsay et al (2001) reported on a CC10 isoform in TAF from premature infants who went on to develop BPD. Arias-Martinez et al (2012) extended that observation to identify up to 7 CC10 isoforms in premature infants experiencing severe RDS who developed BPD. We investigated the possibility that the CC10 isoforms resulted from chemical modification of amino acid residues mediated by reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (ROS or RNS) in a series of in vitro reactions using recombinant human CC10 protein (rhCC10). At least a dozen new isoforms of CC10 were generated by reaction with ROS using three different oxidants, including NaOCl, mCPBA, and neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) plus H2O2. Reaction products were characterized by HPLC, isoelectric point, Western blot, and peptide mapping. Comparison of mCPBA reaction products with NaOCl and MPO-H2O2, using different reaction times and amounts of oxidizing equivalents, revealed that methionines were initially oxidized prior to other amino acids. Each human CC10 monomer contains 4 methionines, 3 of which are readily oxidized by ROS, suggesting that each CC10 homodimer can absorb at least 6 oxygen radicals, thereby protecting other proteins, cells, and tissues and augmenting its other anti-inflammatory activities. Preliminary data also suggest that ROS-modification of CC10 enhances its anti-neutrophil activity and anti-viral activity.

AB  - Oxygen toxicity and antioxidant deficiencies contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We recently demonstrated that a single injection of aurothioglucose (ATG), a thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibitor, attenuated lung injury and increased Nrf2 activation in a C3H/HeN mouse model of BPD. Nrf2 activation was greatest in ATG-treated hyperoxia-exposed mice. Additional unpublished data in vivo suggests that ATG treatment also enhances endogenous glutathione (GSH) levels. Hyperoxic sensitivity in newborn mice is strain-dependent, therefore we first tested the hypothesis that the protective effects of ATG are strain independent and dosedependent. C57Bl/6 mice were pre-treated with a single dose of 0, 25 or 50 mg/kg ATG at 4d of life and were subsequently exposed to room air (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from 4-14d. Histologic analyses of formalin fixed lungs were performed to evaluate lung development. Our data revealed that hyperoxic exposure resulted in lung developmental abnormalities in saline-treated mice. Preliminary qualitative analyses of H&E-stained lung sections revealed dose-dependent attenuation of ATG treatment on hyperoxia-induced lung development with the most robust protective effect observed in mice pretreated with 50 mg/kg ATG. Studies in vitro tested the hypothesis that ATG inhibits TrxR1, protects against hyperoxia-induced anti-proliferative effects in lung epithelial cells, and enhances cellular GSH levels. Murine transformed club cells (mtCCs) were treated with 0 or 5 muM ATG and were exposed RA or hyperoxia (85% O2) for 24 h. For each condition the following was determined: cell counts, TrxR1 activity via insulin-disulfide reductase assay, and glutathione levels via the glutathione reductase recycling assay. ATG treatment increased viable cell numbers in RA-exposed cells, which directly correlated with a 25% decrease in TrxR1 activity. In addition, ATG-treated hyperoxia-exposed cells TrxR1 activity was 50% less than in control-treated cells and was associated with enhanced total GSH levels. In summary, the effects of ATG on hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits are dose-dependent and strainindependent. In vitro, our data reveals synergism between ATG and hyperoxia similar our previous observations in C3H/HeN mice. The inverse correlation between the degree of TrxR1 inhibition and ATG-mediated protection elicited by the combination of ATG and hyperoxia suggests a threshold of TrxR1 inhibition necessary for the protective effects of ATG. Future studies will define doseresponse characteristics and mechanisms by which ATG is protective in vivo and in vitro with the overall goal of optimizing TrxR1 inhibition as a viable therapeutic strategy to prevent BPD.

AB  - The trend today in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) is to be as gentle and less invasive as possible in the care of neonates. This attitude takes place in every field of Neonatology, and will discuss its implementation specifically in the respiratory care administered to premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).1, 2 Prenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended in all pregnancies with threatened preterm labor below 34 weeks' gestation. Recently, it was shown that such therapy could also be beneficial in late preterm infants as it significantly reduced the rate of a neonatal composite of respiratory treatments in the first 72 hours or stillbirth or neonatal death within 72 hours after delivery.3 At delivery, the termstabilization and not resuscitation is preferred for the vast majority of very preterm infants. Only a minority of babies should require delivery roomintubation. Neopuff can be helpful in the delivery roomand the transport to the NICU, and enables the administration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and intermittent positive pressure ventilation under controlled conditions. Recent large trials that reflect current practice (including greater utilization of maternal steroids and routine post delivery stabilization on NCPAP) demonstrated less risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death when using early stabilization on NCPAP with selective surfactant administration to infants requiring intubation. The comprehensive strategy to prevent BPD in the NICU is based on ventilatory and non-ventilatory measures.4 The ventilatory route allows an individualized endotracheal intubation approach. Recent studies concluded that early nasal CPAP (NCPAP) is a safe alternative to immediate intubation even in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.1, 2, 4 Endotracheal intubation and ventilation can result in significant damage to premature lungs and are independently associated with cerebral palsy. Furthermore, despite new modes of ventilation and surfactant, BPD remains a significant morbidity and its incidence was correlated with the use and length of endotracheal mechanical ventilation. BPD in itself is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Thus, we need to avoid endotracheal ventilation, if possible. When the infant requires nasal respiratory support (NRS), we should aim for adequate oxygenation (SpO2 of 90-95%),1 permissive hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 45-55mm Hg, pH>7.22) and gentle ventilation, similarly as in endotracheal ventilation.1, 4 NCPAP is recommended as the early primary treatment of active respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (to avoid intubation or as part of the INSURE [INtubation SURfactant Extubation] approach), or later, post extubation at RDS resolution, in order to allow shortening of the duration of endotracheal ventilation and to treat apnea of prematurity.1, 2 Recent studies1, 4 report comparable rates of BPD in ELBW infants treated initially with NCPAP as compared to endotracheal ventilation with surfactant administration. Can we enhance NCPAP and get better outcome for NRS by using nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)? NIPPV was defined as a method of augmenting NCPAP by delivering ventilator breaths via nasal prongs. The rationale behind the use of NIPPVis the administration of "sigh" to the infant, thus opening microatelectasis and recruiting more ventilation units. It was shown that synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV) compared with NCPAP may improve the patency of the upper airway, could activate the respiratory drive, improves thoraco-abdominal synchrony, stabilizes the chest wall, improves lung mechanics and decreases the work of breathing in premature infants. When NIPPV was compared to NCPAP for the different indications of NRS, it was shown to enhance the potential of NRS.4 A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a relative risk reduction for intubation in the first 72 hours in the NIPPV group compared with NCPAP (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43, 0.83).5 The NIPPV trial6 was a large international multicenter randomized trial powered to study the important outcome of BPD, recruiting 1,009 extremely low birth weight babies, and it showed no difference between babies randomized to NIPPV compared with CPAP. SNIPPV vs. NCPAP for later use, post extubation at RDS resolution, as a "bridge" to spontaneous unsupported breathing, was shown to be more effective than NCPAP. A pooled meta-analysis showed that SNIPPV was more effective than NCPAP in preventing failure of extubation [RR 0.21 (0.10, 0.45)] and the number needed to treat was only 3 infants to prevent one extubation failure.7 SNIPPV vs. NCPAP, post extubation, also tended to decrease the rate of BPD. SNIPPV may also be more effective than NCPAP for apnea of prematurity.4 A meta-analysis regarding apnea of prematurity suggests that SNIPPV is more efficacious with apnea that is frequent or severe. However, the studies performed addressed short-term outcomes and as such could not properly address the incidence of requirement for reintubation. Thus, more studies are needed before recommending SNIPPV as standard of care for apnea of prematurity. While non-invasive ventilation is probably safe, its success depends on gestational age. The data indicate that surfactant may still have a significant role in the treatment of RDS, especially in ELBW infants. Recent studies reported on an intubation rate of ~50% in their NCPAP group in ELBW infants.1, 2, 4 This leads us to the INSURE approach. This approach may allow the infant to benefit from both surfactant and NRS. A Cochrane review8 concluded that the INSURE approach with NCPAP compared with later selective surfactant administration, continued mechanical ventilation, and extubation from low respiratory support was associated with less need for mechanical ventilation, lower incidence of BPD and fewer air leak syndromes. Another option for surfactant application to the trachea without endotracheal intubation was described by using a thin catheter in spontaneously breathing preterm infants receiving NCPAP. This technique was reported to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.9 There are ongoing trials with inhaled surfactant. To summarize, NCPAP is still the most common mode of non invasive respiratory support worldwide.1, 2 The available evidence supports the preference of early or later use of NIPPV/SNIPPV compared to NCPAP because of minimizing the use and the length of endotracheal ventilation.4 There are data to suggest that this approach may also reduce the rate of BPD, however this has yet to be shown.4 The results of a large international RCT comparing both primary and post-extubation use of NIPPV with NCPAP, with a composite primary outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' corrected age, indicate no additional benefit, or risk, conferred by NIPPV in comparison to NCPAP.6 Whether NIPPV/SNIPPV is more beneficial than NCPAP within the INSURE approach needs to be shown. Recently, heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) is frequently used as a mode of NRS. High flows result in washout of anatomical and physiological dead space and contribute to improved fractions of alveolar gases with respect to carbon dioxide as well as oxygen and decrease the work of breathing and the energy cost of gas conditioning. HHHFNC probably creates positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) that may contribute to its beneficial effect. However, the PEEP that is not monitored had raised concerns regarding the safety of HHHFNC in terms of air leak. Recent prospective studies support the notion that HHHFNC is as effective as NCPAP for early stages of RDS, post extubation10 and for apnea of prematurity. Yet, more studies, especially in the initial treatment of RDS and in ELBW infants, are needed before adopting HHHFNC as an alternative mode of NRS in these conditions. New modes of NRS such as neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA), and nasal high frequency ventilation, need to be further studied before concluding on benefits for the short and long term outcomes in premature infants. Non-ventilatory measures in the treatment of RDS, such as caffeine, nutrition, fluid and PDA management and postnatal steroids in certain conditions should be included in the care of premature infants with RDS in order to minimize the rate of BPD.1, 4 The noninvasive ventilator strategy needs to be confirmed by large prospective randomized controlled trials (with long-term follow up) in order to assure it is applicable to most ELBW infants. Furthermore, the strategy needs to be tailored to individualized infants according to the infant's maturation; antenatal steroid treatment and severity of RDS; general condition; and to certain practical NICU conditions such as experience, personnel and timing during the day.

AB  - Advances in vascular biology have provided new insights into basic mechanisms of lung development during embryonic, fetal and postnatal life. Investigation of growth and development of the pulmonary circulation is critically important for understanding clinical disorders that are associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Past studies have shown that persistent echocardiographic evidence of PH beyond the first few months of life is associated with up to 40% mortality in infants with BPD. The association of PH with poor survival in BPD has continued into the recent era of the "new BPD," especially in infants with severe disease who require prolonged support with mechanical ventilation. Thus, developing insights into the pathogenesis and pathobiology of PH and related pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) in BPD continue as an important challenge and may help to improve early and late cardiopulmonary outcomes after preterm birth. Mechanisms that coordinate normal vascular growth and alveolarization during development or cause abnormal lung growth in BPD are poorly understood. Disruption of key signals between airway epithelium and endothelial cells can alter vascular and alveolar growth, resulting in decreased arterial and airspace structure. For example, hyperoxic lung injury in newborn animals decreases expression of the critical proangiogenic and endothelial cell survival factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Early impairment of VEGF production inhibits vascular growth and impairs endothelial function, which leads to PH. In addition, disruption of angiogenesis due to adverse antenatal factors, such as chorioamnionitis, preeclampsia or maternal smoking, and postnatal events after premature birth, can cause vascular injury that not only lead to PH but can also impair distal lung growth. Ongoing laboratory studies suggest that the developing endothelial cell plays a key role in the regulation and coordination of epithelial growth and distal airspace structure through the production of critical "angiocrines," such as nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor, vitamin A, insulin growth factor-1 and others. Thus, since angiogenesis is necessary for normal alveolarization, it has been suggested that protecting the developing pulmonary vasculature from early injury may not only lower PVR and improve gas exchange, but may enhance distal lung growth and improve long term outcomes. Abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation in severe BPD include altered tone and reactivity, structure and growth, which can cause right heart failure, impaired gas exchange, pulmonary edema, decreased exercise capacity and other clinical problems. Physiologic abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation in BPD include elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and abnormal vasoreactivity, as evidenced by the marked vasoconstrictor response to acute hypoxia and by impaired gas exchange due to abnormal distribution of lung blood flow. Abnormal pulmonary vascular structure also contributes to high PVR due to increased smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and altered vascular compliance caused by increased production of an abnormal extracellular matrix. Growth of the distal lung circulation is abnormal in infants with severe BPD, and decreased arterial growth (angiogenesis) reduces vascular surface area that further impairs gas exchange and increases the risk for the development of PH and impaired exercise capacity in older children. Prominent bronchial or other systemic-to-pulmonary collateral vessels were noted in early morphometric studies of infants with BPD, and can be readily identified in many infants during cardiac catheterization. Although these collateral vessels are generally small, large collaterals may contribute to significant shunting of blood flow to the lung, causing edema and need for higher FiO2. In addition, recent autopsy studies suggest the presence of striking intrapulmonary anastomotic, or "shunt," vessels that link the distal pulmonary and bronchial vessels, and may contribute to poor oxygenation. Past clinical studies have further shown that metabolic function of the pulmonary vasculature is impaired inBPD, as reflected by the lack of pulmonary clearance of circulating norepinephrine during passage through the lung, which may contribute to left ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypertension. Clinical studies have recently shown that early echocardiographic findings of PVD after preterm birth are strongly associated with the development and severity of BPD and PH at 36 weeks corrected age. Interestingly, these findings were not only associated with a worse respiratory course during the initial hospitalization, but also late respiratory outcomes, including respiratory exacerbations, hospitalizations and the need for asthma medications. Ongoing studies are exploring the impact of PH-specific drug therapies, such as sildenafil and other agents, onPHand related complications. Thus, PVD in preterm infants with BPD is characterized by altered lung vascular development, growth, structure, and function, which precede the onset of measureable PH. PVD due to disruption of normal pulmonary vascular development in association with preterm birth is an important determinant of the pathobiology of BPD and contributes significantly to morbidity andmortality.Exposure to adverse stimuli during the antenatal and/ or early postnatal periods impairs normal pulmonary vascular development and creates an imbalance between risk and resiliency factors. Recent studies have revealed the magnitude of PH in preterm infants, but many aspects of PVD remain understudied, and ongoing investigations continue to explore risk factors, mechanisms of disease, and long-term outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to definitively establish standardized clinical criteria for PVD and PH in BPD, and to determine the best methods for early diagnosis, risk stratification and disease monitoring. Larger collaborative studies and improved clinical infrastructure to conduct these important investigations will provide answers to these critical questions. (Figure presented) .

AB  - Introduction Measuring lung function in "non-collaborating" children has always been one of most difficult tasks for pediatric pulmonologists. This is because young children are not able to perform the voluntary forced expiratory maneuvers generally used in adults and schoolchildren. In infants and children up to 2 years, this problem has been generally overcome by the use of sedation, although this contributes to make lung function measurements less suitable for routine clinical use in this age group. Preschool children (2-5 years) are too old to be sedated and yet too young to properly perform the forced expiratory maneuvers required for spirometry. For this age group, several techniques that just require tidal breathing have been implemented during the past decades. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Working Group on Lung Function in Young Children has published technical recommendations for most infant (1,2) and preschool techniques (3) and their clinical applications have also been recently summarized (4). This lecture will focus on the most used pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in infants and preschool children. Infants Chloral hydrate (80-100 mg/kg, maximum 1 g) is commonly used to sedate infants and young children up to 2 years for performing lung function testing. However, chloral hydrate is no longer available in the U.S.A. and the use of other sedatives might lead to different results (4). The most commonly used PFTs in infants are the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression and infant plethysmography. Other PFTs that are performed during tidal breathing (e.g.: tidal breathing measurements, multiple breath washout, forced oscillation technique) are more suitable to be used without sedation, especially in younger infants. The raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RVRTC) allows for the measurement of forced expiratory flow and volume in sedated infants (2). Repeated inflations using a pressure of 30 cmH2O are applied through a facemask and an inflatable jacket is then activated to rapidly compress the infant's chest and abdomen to obtain forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds (FEV0.5) and forced expiratory flow (FEF) at defined proportions of FVC. To ensure that flow limitation has been reached, the inflation pressure of the jacket is increased at each maneuver until no further increase in flow is noticed. Recently published reference equations using a current commercially available device (5) will improve the interpretation of the results. RVRTC has been successfully used in children with all kinds of respiratory diseases, including children with cystic fibrosis (CF), children born prematurely, and those with recurrent wheezing (4), showing its capability to distinguish disease populations from healthy control subjects and to detect lung function changes in clinical intervention trials. However, its long-term clinical utility still remains to be established. Moreover, the need for sedation along with the time and resource intensity required are other important limitations for its use in routine clinical practice (4). Infant plethysmography is used to measure functional residual capacity (FRCpleth) in sedated infants (1). Specific airway resistance (sRaw) can also be measured, provided that a proper electronic thermal compensation is applied to the system to account for thermal artifacts. This technique is based on the same principle (Boyle's law) as plethysmography for older subjects and uses an infant whole body plethysmograph where the infant lies supine breathing through a facemask sealed with silicon putty (1). Infant plethysmography has been successfully applied to children with lung disease, especially CF and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (4). However, as for RVRTC, its long-term clinical utility remains to be ascertained and its role in routine clinical practice is hence very limited. Preschool children Preschool children (2-5 years) are too old to be sedated, but also too young to properly perform the forced expiratory maneuvers required for spirometry. For this age group, several techniques that just require tidal breathing have been implemented during the past decades, allowing for lung function to be measured in awake children (3). Also, modified acceptability criteria for spirometry have been proposed for the use in preschool children (3). It is important to highlight that the feasibility of any lung function technique in preschool children strongly depends on the capability of the operator of keeping the child quiet and focused (3). Spirometry has been proposed for preschool children using modified acceptability criteria (3). Since the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) often cannot be obtained in preschoolers due to their different lung physiology, the use of FEV in 0.5 (FEV0.5) or 0.75 seconds (FEV0.75) is recommended in this age group. Also, FVC should not be reported if flow stops at more than 10% of peak flow (early termination), but FEV may still be reported. Less stringent repeatability criteria have also been proposed in preschool children: at least two acceptable maneuvers should be obtained with the two FVC and FEV within 100mL or 10%, but in case of a single acceptable maneuver, this should be recorded nevertheless (3). Spirometry is reported to be feasible in 55-85% of 4-5 year old children, but its feasibility tends to be much lower in younger children (4). Global multiethnic reference equations including preschool children have recently be published (6). Spirometry has been reported to discriminate healthy controls from preschool children with CF and with recurrent wheezing, although substantial overlap between groups may occur and bronchodilator response appears to be more sensitive than baseline values (4). However, a careful and rigorous approach to the use of spirometry must be taken in preschool children and several gaps in our knowledge still limit the application of this technique to clinical practice in this age group (4). The interrupter technique is based on the principle that a sudden flow interruption at the mouth during tidal breathing would make alveolar pressure rapidly equilibrate with mouth pressure, thus allowing an estimation of alveolar pressure by measuring mouth pressure. The interrupter resistance (Rint) is then calculated dividing the change in mouth pressure by the flow measured immediately before the interruption ("classical" technique) or immediately after the interruption ("opening" technique). Measuring Rint has been proved to be particularly suitable for preschool children, its feasibility being generally higher than 80% in this age group (4). Proper reference values have been published (7) and cut-off values for the bronchodilator response have also been reported.Rint is able to detect changes in the airway caliber and has been successfully used in preschool children with recurrent wheezing (4). However, its utility in clinical care remains to be established, especially by longitudinal studies (4). The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is used to measure the impedance of the respiratory system (Zrs) during tidal breathing by applying, through a mouthpiece and a filter, low-frequency pressure oscillations generated by a loudspeaker (usually 4-48Hz) (3). Changes in flow and pressure measured at the mouth are used to calculate Zrs and its two components, resistance (Rrs, reflecting frictional losses) and reactance (Xrs, reflecting elastic properties at low frequencies and inertial forces at higher frequencies). Forcing signals based on sinusoidal waves or impulses have been used, both as single-frequency or composite signals. Frequencies between 5 and 10Hz are considered to reflect the mechanical properties of the total airways. FOT has a good feasibility in preschool children (>80%) and several reference equations have been published (8). FOT has been used in many studies on children with recurrent wheezing, showing a good capability in discriminating health from disease, especially when bronchodilator response is used (4). However, for this technique as well, longitudinal studies on its clinical utility in young children are still needed (4).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most important complication following mechanical ventilation in preterm infants and no definite therapy can eliminate this complication. Although the mechanism is not completely clear, pulmonary inflammation is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis. Glucocorticoid is one of the most effective therapies to treat or prevent BPD. However, systemic glucocorticoid therapy is not generally recommended because of long-term adverse events (1,2). Our previous pilot study in neonates and studies in animals indicated that surfactant can be used as a vehicle to deliver a topical glucocorticoid, budesonide, to the lung periphery and effectively suppress lung inflammation and lung injury (3.4.5). The mechanismfor the effective delivery of budesonide using surfactant as vehicle is based on a physical phenomenon, the "Marangoni effect": in the interface between high and lowsurface tension, a convection force is generated and this force can be used as a vehicle to facilitate the delivery ofmedication (6).This is an important delivery method because inhaled glucocorticoid is technically difficult and the effect has been shown to be limited (7,8). A multi-center trial was therefore conducted in three medical centers (John Stroger's Hospital of Cook County, Chicago; China Medical University Hospital, Taichung; and National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei; Taiwan) to compare intra-tracheal administration of surfactant/budesonide with that of surfactant alone on the incidence of death or BPD. The results of this study were recently published in AJRCCM (9). Between April 1, 2009 and March 1, 2013, all infants with respiratory distress shortly after birth were assessed for eligibility for the study. The inclusion criteriawere determinedwithin 4 hours after birth and included: 1) birth weight less than 1,500 g, 2) radiographic evidence of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (grades III-IV), 3) on mechanical ventilation, 4) fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) at least [271] 0.5, and 5) absence of severe congenital anomalies or lethal cardiopulmonary disorder. These infants were considered to be at high risk for developing BPD. Two hundred and sixty-five infants with severe RDS were randomly assigned into 2 groups: 131 intervention (surfactant and budesonide), 134 control (surfactant only). The intervention infants received surfactant (100mg/kg) (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and budesonide (0.25mg/kg), (Pulmicort nebulizing suspension; Astra Zeneca, London, UK) and the control infants received surfactant only (100mg/kg). In the intervention group, this dose provided a concentration ratio of surfactant to budesonide greater than 50:1; this mixture was demonstrated in vitro, using a surfactometer and high-performance liquid chromatography, not to affect the biophysical and chemical properties of the surfactant. Repeated administrations of surfactant/ budesonide or surfactant only were given every 8 hours to infants in the intervention or control group, respectively, until they required a FIO2 less than 0.3, or were extubated or received a maximum of 6 doses. During the study, a respiratory care protocol was followed by the participating hospitals. BPD was diagnosed at 36 postmenstrual weeks if the infant continuously required supplemental oxygen. Tracheal aspirates were assayed for interleukin (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) levels. A follow up study on neuromotor function and cognitive function was performed at 2-3 years of corrected age. The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of BPD or death than the control infant group [55/131 (42.0%) vs. 89/134 (66%); risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.77, P<0.001; (NTT) 4.1 (95% CI: 2.8 to 7.8). The intervention group required significantly fewer doses of surfactant than the control group [one dose: 85/131 (64.9%) vs. 49/134 (36.6%;) p<0.001; two doses: 43/131 (32.8%) vs. 58/134 (43.3%) p=0.09; three doses: 3/131 (2.3%) vs. 23/134 (17.2%), p<0.001; four doses 0/131 (0%) vs. 1/134 (0.7%); six doses: 0/131 (0%) vs. 3/134 (2.2%)]. The intervention group had significantly lower interleukin levels (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) in tracheal aspirates at 12 hours and lower IL-8 at 3-5 and 7-8 days. There was no significant difference between the groups during the study in serum electrolytes, glucose, BUN and in blood pressure, and in physical growth. There was no significant difference between the groups in neuromotor function, and in MDI, PDI and in neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) score when examined at 2-3 years of corrected age. We concluded that in very low birth weight infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome, intra-tracheal administration of surfactant/budesonide compared with surfactant alone significantly decreased the incidence of BPD or death without apparent short term or long term adverse effect. Further large-sample, double-blind trials are warranted.

AB  - Chronic obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have a high prevalence and are a major public health concern. It seems clear that the early stages of life play a key part in the onset of chronic obstructive respiratory diseases, although they may become clinically apparent only later on. Gene-environment interactions and early-life risk factors can lead to permanent developmental adaptations that result in impaired lung structure and metabolism.1 Consequently, altered immunological responses and abnormal levels of inflammation can trigger a maladaptive response to harmful agents in adulthood, accelerating the agerelated decline in respiratory function.2,3 Lung repair processes involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases reiterate many mechanisms and pathways implicated in the lung's original development. Lung morphogenesis begins at 5 weeks of gestation and includes five different stages, the last of which - alveolarization - may continue throughout childhood and adolescence, and even into adulthood. Perinatal insults can alter both gene expression and epigenetic determinants, thereby influencing the lung's capacity for growth and repair. For instance, extensive epithelial damage with exposure of the basal lamina causes inflammation and cell apoptosis. If the subsequent regeneration process is ineffective, then remodeling occurs, and the resulting aberrant tissue features (e.g. fibrosis and emphysema) can predispose to COPD. Perinatal insults may also induce the release of excessive levels of growth factors and cytokines common to lung development and repair processes, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) and vascular endothelial growth factor. Appropriate levels of these mediators are crucial to lung development, but excessive amounts promote fibrosis and abnormal microvascular endothelial regeneration and repair.2 Another crucial aspect in the genesis of chronic obstructive lung diseases is an altered immunological response. Innate immune defense mechanisms are the mainstay of the newborn's immune system, whereas an adaptive immune response is almost completely lacking. Infants are born with a limited capacity to produce Th1 cytokines, and neonates' antigenpresenting cells generally show weaker responses to innate stimuli than those of adults. Experimental and human observational studies have shown that the degree of innate mucosal immune stimulation determines whether innate responses prevent or enhance the onset of allergic reactions. New data are emerging on the relationship between the airway microbiome and the immune system. Newborns colonized by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis in the hypopharyngeal region are at higher risk of developing an inflammatory/immune response of their airway mucosa that can lead to recurrent wheezing and toddler asthma. Potentially pathogenic bacteria (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and P. aeruginosa) are reportedly found in the distal airways of almost one in three COPD patients. Bacterial colonization of the lower airways is associated with higher neutrophil counts and higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers, and affected individuals experience a more severe decline in lung function and more exacerbations.2,4 Recent studies have identified microorganisms in the lungs of healthy individuals as well. The lung microbiome is already complex in health, and disrupted in asthma and COPD. Interaction between the epithelial cells and the microbiome is considered crucial for maintaining an adequate barrier function and for lung homeostasis, hence changes in the microorganisms colonizing the lower airways may interfere with the protective action of epithelial cells.5 Alongside anomalous lung development and repair processes, and altered immune responses, early environmental factors are important in the onset of respiratory diseases. They may take effect in utero (e.g. amniotic fluid composition, exposure to smoke and maternal micronutrient intake), perinatally (e.g. factors relating to premature birth and the onset of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]), and/or postnatally (e.g. exposure to nicotine and environmental pollutants, diet, growth patterns, respiratory infections and early allergic sensitization).2 Fetal airway development is definitely linked to the amniotic fluid, which induces lung growth and maturation via mechanical and cytokine-induced mechanisms. The amniotic fluid contains high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, which peak at the time of delivery. These proinflammatory mediators are thought to be involved in fetal lung maturation, and this could explain why preterm birth and caesarean section are risk factors for asthma. As the composition of the amniotic fluid changes during pregnancy, preterm infants are exposed to suboptimal proinflammatory cytokine levels and patterns, and this may impair normal airway development. Infants born by scheduled caesarean section are similarly exposed to lower concentrations of inflammatory mediators in the amniotic fluid; furthermore vaginal delivery may protect against the onset of allergic asthma thanks to the newborn's acquisition of bacteria such as Clostridium difficile at birth.2 Lung maturation is particularly impaired by premature birth before the 32nd week of gestation, when the lungs are still in the saccular stage of development. The newborn's airways are more compliant, smaller, and have fewer alveolar attachments. Intrauterine inflammation (often associated with premature birth) can further interfere with lung development and have a role in BPD, although evidence of this issue is conflicting. A number of early postnatal therapeutic interventions that cause hyperoxia and volutrauma may also exacerbate lung injury in the premature newborn. The association between pretermbirth and a higher risk ofwheezing disorders is particularly strong for children born under 32 weeks of gestation, but even late-preterm children have a significantly higher than normal respiratory morbidity.The impaired lung function of pretermchildren persists throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.2,3,6 Maternal smoking during pregnancy and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke are major risk factors for lung function impairment and a higher risk of wheezing and asthma, and the harmful effects of pre- and postnatal exposure to smoke persist into adulthood. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that the mechanisms underlying the harmful effects of smoke on fetal lung development involve an interaction with asthma susceptibility genes and a dysregulated cytokine production.2,3 Environmental agents such as airborne pollutants and industrial chemicals involved in plastics manufacturing are also recognized risk factors for chronic obstructive airway diseases. Exposure to traffic-related pollutants in utero and during the first year of life has been related to a higher risk of asthma and lung growth impairment; these adverse effects regress when children move to areas with cleaner air. Contradictory results have emerged on the association between exposure to indoor biomass fuel use for cooking and/or heating and the risk of asthma. Although some studies have correlated exposure to plastics manufacturing with the onset of childhood respiratory problems, it is not clear which specific plastic components might be responsible.2 Diet in pregnancy and childhood is known to influence lung development, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still lacking. Prenatally, poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy has been recognized as a risk factor for obstructive airway disease in adulthood. On the other hand, different dietary patterns during pregnancy (Mediterranean, vegetarian or "processed" diets) do not influence the risk of developing respiratory diseases in childhood and later on. Specific micronutrient intake (e.g. folate, homocysteine, vitamin B12, vitamin E, vitamin D, probiotic supplementation) during pregnancy has been extensively investigated, but most studies found no association with the risk of asthma and COPD. Postnatally, breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of respiratory diseases. Exposure to a greater variety of foods in the first year of life appears to protect against the risk of childhood asthma and food allergies.

AB  - Postnatal lung development involves two processes, angiogenesis and alveolarization. It is well known that angiogenesis is essential for alveolarization, however the mechanism is still unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) knockout mice showed impaired lung angiogenesis and alveolarization and that GIT1 inhibited retinal sprouting angiogenesis by suppressing Dll4-Notch1 pathway. Recent transcriptome analysis predicts that Notch signaling plays an inhibitory role in perinatal lung maturation. Dll4 is exclusively expressed in endothelial cell (EC) but Notch1 is expressed in both EC and airway epithelial cell (AEC). We hypothesize that increased Dll4 in EC mediates Notch1 activation in AEC, which contributes to impaired alveolarization in GIT1-KO mice. To test this hypothesis, we measured Dll4 mRNA and protein expression and found 3 fold and 7 fold increases respectively in lungs of GIT1-KO mice compared to WT mice. Notch1 is the major receptor of Dll4. Notch1 activation, measured by intracellular domain of Notch 1 (N1-ICD) protein expression, was increased 4 fold in lungs of GIT1-KO mice. Most importantly, immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that Dll4 is enhanced in EC of GIT1-KO mice. In contrast, N1-ICD increased in both EC and AEC in GIT1-KO mice, which suggests Dll4 in EC activated Notch1 in AEC. In vitro, we studied the effects of Dll4 on AEC. Immobilized Dll4 significantly activated Notch1 and its downstream target genes Hey1 and Hes1. Dll4 treatment decreased AEC proliferation and increased apoptosis as demonstrated by BrdU incorporation and the level of cleaved Caspase 3 respectively. Similarly, the proliferation of AEC was decreased and apoptosis increased when they were co-cultured with GIT1-KO lung ECs compared to those with WT lung ECs. These data suggest that EC derived Dll4 activates Notch 1 in AEC to inhibit AEC proliferation and increase apoptosis. In summary, we describe a novel mechanism for how angiogenesis affects alveolarization. This observation furthers our knowledge of postnatal lung development, and suggests that Dll4 is a potential therapeutic target for lung development related diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine pregnancy outcomes in twin and singleton pregnancies after previable preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (<23 wks). METHOD(S): This study is retrospective cohort from a single institution from 2000-2014 with singleton or twin pregnancies complicated by PPPROM at 14.0-22.9 weeks, without chorioamnionitis at presentation, who elected expectant management and achieved at least 24 hours latency. Pregnancies with fetal anomalies, higher order multiples, PPPROM within 2 weeks of CVS/amniocentesis, or delayed interval twin deliveries were excluded. The primary outcome was any infant in the pregnancy surviving to hospital discharge. Of those pregnancies that delivered >= 23 weeks, we also examined composite major neonatal morbidity (grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and/or death prior to discharge) and death prior to discharge of any infant in the pregnancy. Twin outcomes were compared to singleton outcomes using chi-square, Fisher's exact, ttest, and Wilcoxon rank-sum as appropriate. RESULT(S): 104 pregnancies (82 singleton, 22 twin) were included. There were no significant differences in maternal age, parity, smoking, race/ethnicity, insurance status, or medical problems (hypertension or diabetes) between singleton and twin pregnancies. When singleton pregnancies were compared to twin pregnancies, PPROM and delivery occurred at similar gestational age, 20.6 wks (IQR 18.7, 22.1) vs. 20.5 wks (IQR 18.7, 21.9) (p=0.9) and 22.8wks (IQR 20.6, 25) vs 23.1 wks (IQR 20.4, 23.6) (p=0.8), respectively. There was no difference in chorioamnionitis between singleton and twin pregnancies (37 vs 59%, p=.06) (Table). In the entire cohort, there was increased survival in at least 1 twin vs. singletons (55% vs 32% p=0.048. Among only those pregnancies that delivered at or beyond 23 weeks (38 singleton and 12 twin pregnancies), major neonatal morbidity and/or death (63 vs 50%, p=0.41). However, survival to hospital discharge of at least one infant (68 vs 100%, p=0.03) more common in twin gestation. CONCLUSION(S): Initial neonatal outcomes following previable PPROM are poor with high rates of chorioamnionitis. The majority of both twins and singletons delivered prior to viability (23 weeks). For those pregnancies that continue to >= 23 weeks, neonatal morbidity and mortality was high, though survival of at least one infant may be more likely in twins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication in preterm infants that involves the downregulation of tight junction (TJ) proteins. However, the mechanism underlying downregulation of the expression of TJ proteins during at the early stages of hyperoxia-induced BPD remains to be understood. Here, we aimed to identify the role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in hyperoxia-induced pulmonary epithelial barrier breakdown., METHODS: First, we established an in vitro pulmonary epithelial barrier models using primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-II) from newborn rats. AEC-II was assigned to the hyperoxic (85 % O2/5 % CO2) or normoxic (21 % O2/5 % CO2) groups. Second, AEC-II was transfected with Cav-1-siRNA to downregulate Cav-1 under normoxic exposure. Third, AEC-II was transfected with a cDNA encoding Cav-1 to upregulate Cav-1 expression under hyperoxic exposure. Then, expression levels of Cav-1 and TJ proteins were examined by immunofluorescence staining, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. The TJ structures visualized using a transmission electron microscope, and transepithelial resistance and apparent permeability coefficient of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, which are indicators of barrier function, were measured., RESULTS: Our data showed that exposure to hyperoxia disrupted the structure and function of the pulmonary epithelial barrier and decreased the ZO-1, occludin, claudin-4, and Cav-1 expression levels. Moreover, Cav-1 knockdown attenuated the expression of the other three genes and disrupted pulmonary epithelial barrier structure and function under normoxic exposure. However, Cav-1 upregulation markedly antagonized the hyperoxia-induced pulmonary epithelial barrier destruction and TJ protein loss., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to present evidence illustrating the novel role of Cav-1 downregulation-mediated TJ protein loss in pulmonary epithelial barrier destruction during BPD.

AB  - Retinopathy of prematurity is a potentially blinding disease, which is associated with low neonatal IGF-1 serum concentrations and poor growth. In severe cases impaired retinal vessel growth is followed by pathologic neovascularization, which may lead to retinal detachment. IGF-1 may promote growth even in catabolic states. Treating preterm infants with recombinant human (rh) IGF1 to concentrations normally found during gestation has been suggested to have a preventative effect on ROP. A recent phase 2 study treating infants (gestational age between 23 weeks + 0 days and 27 weeks + 6 days) with rhIGF-1/IGF binding protein-3 until 30 postmenstrual weeks showed no effect on ROP but a 53% reduction in severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 44% reduction in severe intraventricular hemorrhage. Oxygen is a major risk factor for ROP and during the phase 2 study oxygen saturation targets were increased to 90-95%, due to national guidelines, which might have affected ROP rate and severity making increased IGF-1 a weaker preventative factor for ROP.

AB  - Background: Preeclampsia (PreE), a de novo development of Hypertension in consort with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in mother and the offspring. It affects approximately 3-8% of overall pregnancies. Although, specific etiologies remain unknown, it has been supported by various studies that PreE is not just a single disorder, but a syndrome of pertinent multiple pathophysiological factors. Method(s): An IRB approved retrospective chart review over a year (January 2014 to December 2014) was conducted of all pregnancies occurred at Baylor Scott and White Health System, Temple, Texas (N = 3704). We divided all pregnancies into two separate groups: PreE (N = 299) vs. Non PreE (N = 3405). We compared the neonatal outcomes between two groups including their offspring's gestational age, birth weight, admission rate to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and lengtH2O2f hospital stay (LOS). Result(s): We found amongst these two groups, infants born to PreE mothers have significantly lower birthweight (Mean = 2807 grams, SD = 841 grams) compared to Non PreE mothers (Mean = 3383 grams, SD = 619 grams) (P<0.05), significantly lower GA (Mean = 36.7 weeks, SD = 3.25 weeks) compared to Non PreE group (Mean = 38.7 weeks, SD = 2.1 weeks) (P<0.05), significantly higher rate of BPD (11%) compared to Non PreE group (6.9%)(P<0.05), significantly higher occurrence of hypoglycemia (26%) compared to non PreE group (20%) (P<0.05), significantly higher rate of thrombocytopenia (28%) compared to Non PreE group (17%) (P<0.05) and significantly higher lengtH2O2f hospital stay (Mean = 19 days, SD = 20 days) compared to Non PreE group (Mean = 14 days, SD = 20 days) (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): We can conclude from this retrospective analysis that infants born to PreE mothers have lower birth weight indicating the intrauterine growth restriction and the lower gestational age indicating preterm birth. Moreover, the data indicate the higher rate of BPD, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia and requirement of increased lengtH2O2f hospital stay in infants born to PreE mothers compared to Non PreE mothers.

AB  - Prematurity is a worldwide health problem, with an increasing incidence of up to 10% around the world. In recent years we have improved the survival of premature infants, although the incidence of related diseases has also raised, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia or central nervous system related disorders. Among these, one of the most feared central complications is the germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH), affecting up to 30 % of babies with extremely low birth weight (<1000 grs) and 15%of those with very low birth weight (<1500 grs). On the other hand, previous studies have shown that central proliferation and neurogenesis may respond to different insults, although it remains unclear whether these mechanismsmight be altered after the lesion of a neurogenic niche, as in GM-IVH. In order to further characterize GM-IVH and its long-term effects on central proliferation and neurogenesis, we have inducedmild or severe GM-IVH by injecting 0.1 or 0.3 IU of proteolytic enzyme collagenase, into the right ventricle of p7 (equivalent to 28 weeks of human gestation) CD1 mice. Sham animals followed the same protocol and they received PBS instead. Animals were allowed to complete development into adulthood and received ip BrdU (70 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days immediately before sacrifice at p70. We quantified the presence of hemorrhages by Prussian blue staining and we also analyzed central proliferation and neurogenesis by BrdU and doublecourtin immunostaining. Hemorrhage burden was increased in a dose-dependent manner after collagenase lesions in p70 mice. Cell proliferation was maintained in the subventricular zone and the dental gyrus, while neurogenesis was significantly reduced after collagenase lesions in p70 mice. When we quantified the cortex and whole hippocampus we detected an overall dose-dependent reduction in the number of BrdU and doublecourtin positive cells after collagenase lesions. Altogether our data show that intracerebroventricular collagenase administration provides a useful tool to recreate a GM-IVH in a murine model, showing bleeding and reduced neurogenesis. Moreover, these outcomes are chronically observed, suggesting a long-term effect of this type of perinatal lesions.

AB  - Preterm birth affects 8-10% of human pregnancies. Individuals born preterm, especially if they develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), have an increased risk of impaired lung function in infancy, childhood and adulthood. The etiology of BPD is multifactorial. Genetic susceptibility and environmental factors have all been implicated in the etiology of BPD. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during fetal or neonatal stages has been involved in lung growth and differentiation process. The present study tests the hypothesis that exposure during critical stages of lung development to ACE inhibitors could be associated with alterations in pulmonary structure that mimics human BPD. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered subcutaneously (osmotic mini-pumps, Alzet) during late gestation (E13-E21) with captopril or enalapril (2,85 mg/kg/day) and lungs from their offspring were analyzed at P0, P8 and P15 postnatal ages. We performed an histological and morphometric analyses, as well as immunolocalization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). At the different ages, animals showed impaired alveolarization, hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle and increased muscularization of pulmonary vessels. These anatomical changes were present as early as P0 with both treatments. Differences between treatments were observed with regard to the level of PCA. This model could be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of BPD and to define therapies to ameliorate human BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common and serious chronic lung disease of premature infants that is characterized by impaired alveolarization and interstitial fibrosis. While oxygen toxicity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease, the cellular and molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and there is no effective therapy. Recent studies have found that CTGF expression is increased in clinical BPD and in hyperoxia-induced rodent models of BPD. In order to determine the mechanistic role of CTGF in the pathogenesis of BPD, we generated a novel inducible transgenic mouse model with overexpression of CTGF in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). Induction of CTGF expression in the neonatal lung resulted in hypoalveolarization and interstitial fibrosis, the pathological hallmarks of BPD. In vitro overexpression of CTGF in AEC induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). These histopathological changes were associated with activation of beta-catenin signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of beta-catenin signaling improved alveolarization and decreased interstitial fibrosis in CTGF transgenic lungs. Utilizing neonatal rat model of BPD, we tested the effects of CTGF neutralizing antibodies and beta-catenin inhibitors in the prevention of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. We found that treatment wi t h CTGF antibodies increased alveolarization, decreased interstitial fibrosis, reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in hyperoxia exposed rats. In addition, CTGF antibody blocked beta-catenin signaling activation during hyperoxia. Similarly, treatment with beta-catenin inhibitors improved alveolarization, and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in hyperoxic rats. These finds indicate that CTGF-beta-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of BPD, and targeting this pathway may provide novel therapy for this disease.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by abnormal alveolar septation and microvascular development. Certain types of monocytes and macrophages have been implicated in epithelial growth and angiogenesis, while others play a role in immune defense and inflammation. Aim(s): To investigate whether monocyte/macrophage profiles and their products correlate with BPD development. Method(s): We investigated lungs of neonatal mice and tracheal aspirates (TAs) from preterm born infants. Result(s): We found that M2-MDSC like monocytes are abundantly present in the lungs of neonatal mice. These monocytes also showed high expression of proangiogenic genes (a.o. EMMPRIN, ENA78, GDF15, VEGFR2 and IGF-1) and strong immune suppressive capacity in vitro, supporting a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and lung growth. Upon repetitive exposure to LPS the monocytes lost their M2-profile and suppressive capacity and upregulated inflammatory markers (IL-8, IL-1b and IL-6 but not TNFa). We also found monocytes/macrophages in TAs from preterm born infants. Proteome profiling these TAs revealed high concentrations of both M2 and inflammatory monocyte/macrophage derived factors and angiogenic mediators. Addition of TAs to pericyte-endothelial cell co-cultures either enhanced or inhibited angiogenesis. Luminex analysis of TAs of preterm infants with (n=22) and without (n=23) BPD showed significant lower concentrations of the angiogenic factors EMMPRIN, ENA78, MCP1, GDF15, TNF-alpha, Angiopoietin-1, -2 and HGF in those infants who developed BPD. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that monocyte/macrophage profiles in TAs of premature children correlate with BPD development and may be used to identify new preventive or therapeutic targets.

AB  - Background and Aim: Pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) following preterm birth. We aimed to measure inflammation and oxidative stress non-invasively, using exhaled breath condensate (EBC), in neonates with and without BPD. We also aimed to determine if markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were present later in infancy and relate biomarker levels to disease severity. Method(s): EBC was collected from very preterm infants (GA < 32 weeks (w)) with and without BPD at 36 w postmenstrual age (PMA) and 12-15 months corrected. Inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were measured using enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Untargeted metabolomic profiles were generated using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Result(s): EBC collection is feasible in preterm infants at 36w PMA (N=5) and 12-15 months (N=20) at a volume that allows metabolomic profiling (215.0 +/- 121.2 muL). Markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were detected above 3.9 pg.mL-1 and 0.8 pg.mL-1 respectively (ELISA) in all infants, regardless of BPD classification. Surprisingly, biomarker levels were higher in infants without BPD (48.8 +/- 28.0 pg.mL ) than in infants with BPD (17.8 +/- 14.1 pg.mL-1 ; p < 0.05). Distinctive metabolomic EBC profiles were identifiable between infants. However, all infants displayed alterations in surfactant metabolism and Conclusion(s): EBC is a non-invasive technique capable of determining the lung metabolome in preterm infants. Preterm infants exhibit on-going inflammation and oxidative stress at 12-15 months corrected age, regardless of BPD classification.

AB  - Background: Bronchial muscle tone and hyperresponsiveness (BHR) are essential features of asthma and lung disease after preterm birth. Methacholine (Mtc) is a direct parasympathetic airway smooth muscle (ASM) constrictor. Nitric oxide (NO) relaxes ASM, is synthesized from arginine and inhibited by the arginine metabolite ADMA which is negatively correlated to birth weight (BW) and higher in asthma. Aim(s): Study lung function and NO metabolites vs gestational age at birth (GA), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and BW appropriate or <10th centile for GA (AGA or SGA) in preterm children. Method(s): Lung function, Mtc-BHR, FeNO, Arginine, ADMA, SDMA were determined in a populationbased sample of 57 preterm-born 11 year old children and matched normal BW term-controls. Result(s): Growth restricted children born preterm had markedly increased Mtc-BHR and higher levels of arginine, ADMA and SDMA, which may affect NO production. Mtc-BHR and ADMA correlated significantly. Conclusion(s): If BHR and NO metabolism are similarly linked to SGA in the general population, it can be an inborn cause rather than a consequence of asthma. (Table Presented).

AB  - Neonates display a marked gender disparity in morbidity and mortality. A higher percentage of premature male than female infants require invasive respiratory support and preterm males have a higher incidence of lung disease e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).The TLR4 pathway is an essential component of innate immunity and results in NFkappaB activation. Many TLR4 signalling genes are encoded on the X chromosome, including IKBKG/NEMO, IRAK-1, and BTK. Genes which escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) may contribute to the immune advantage observed in female neonates. The aim of this study was to quantify expression of X-linked TLR4 signalling intermediates in umbilical cord blood from term female versus male neonates. Cord blood samples were collected from neonates (>=37w+0) delivered by elective Caesarean section (M:F, 10:10, n=20). RNA was isolated from the buffy coat, cDNA was synthesised and used in qRT-PCR reactions with IKBKG/NEMO (Xq28), IRAK-1 (Xq28), and BTK (Xq21) gene-specific primers. IRAK-1 protein expression was quantifed by Western blot and subcellular localisation was characterised in PBMCs by confocal microscopy. At the mRNA level, there was no significant difference in relative expression of IKBKG/NEMO or BTK. IRAK-1 gene and protein expression was significantly higher in females versus males (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001). Confocal microscopy confirmed significantly increased cytosolic IRAK-1 expression in females. XCI occurs early in embryogenesis however some genes can escape inactivation. Increased expression of IRAK-1 in female verus male neonatal immune cells could be responsible, in part, for sex-specific responses to infection and subsequent immune advantage.

AB  - PURPOSE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is associated with hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress-associated ferroptosis. This study examined the effect of E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1) on oxidative stress-associated ferroptosis in BPD., METHODS: Hyperoxia-induced A549 cells and neonatal mice were used to establish BPD models. The effects of ETS1 on hyperoxia-induced ferroptosis-like changes in A549 cells were investigated by overexpression of ETS1 plasmid transfection and erastin treatment. Glucose consumption, lactate production, and NADPH levels were assessed by the glucose, lactate, and NADP+/NADPH assay kits, respectively. The potential regulatory relationship between ETS1 and Nrf2/HO-1 was examined by treating hyperoxia-induced A549 cells with the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385. ETS1 effect on the Nrf2 promoter was explored by dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The effect of ETS1 on the symptoms of BPD mice was examined by injecting an adenovirus overexpressing ETS1., RESULTS: ETS1 overexpression increased hyperoxia-induced cell viability, glucose consumption, lactate production, and NADPH levels and reduced inflammation and apoptosis in A549 cells. In animal experiments, ETS1 overexpression prevented weight loss, airway enlargement, and reductions in radial alveolar counts in BPD mice, while reducing the mean linear intercept, mean alveolar diameter and inflammation. ETS1 overexpression suppressed PTGS2 and CHAC1 expression, reduced ROS, MDA and ferrous iron (Fe2+) production and increased GSH levels in hyperoxia-induced A549 cells and BPD mice. In addition, ETS1 can bind to the Nrf2 promoter region and thus promote Nrf2 transcription. ETS1 overexpression increased the mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, xCT, and GPX4 in hyperoxia-induced A549 cells and BPD mice. In hyperoxia-induced A549 cells, erastin and ML385 treatment abolished the effect of ETS1 overexpression., CONCLUSION: ETS1 is important in oxidative stress-related ferroptosis in a hyperoxia-induced BPD model, and the effect is partially mediated by the Nrf2/HO-1 axis.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to determine the association between hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the first 3 days of life and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Study Design The study population comprises 147 neonates with a gestational age (GA) of less than 32 weeks who were admitted to BaYi Children's Hospital Affiliated to Beijing Military General Hospital from January 2014 to May 2015. Hb levels in the first 3 days of life, maternal and infant characteristics, were recorded and then analyzed. Results BPD patients had a lower GA and birth weight than non-BPD patients. Rates of surfactant use, use of early inhalation hormone, days of mechanical ventilation > 2 weeks, and patent ductus arteriosus in BPD patients were higher and have a significant difference. Number of transfusions was higher in BPD patients. Lower Hb levels in the first 3 days of life were also observed in BPD patients. A cutoff value of Hb levels was determined as 155.5 g/L. Hb <= 155 g/L in the first 3 days of life was a significant risk factor for BPD. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that lower Hb levels in the first 3 days of life may increase the risk of developing BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is complication of premature birth characterised by stunted alveolar growth. Caffeine is a candidate for the management of BPD. We set out to assess the impact of caffeine administration on (i) inflammatory mediators, (ii) expression of components of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling machinery, and (iii) the development of the mouse lung in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD. Our preliminary data indicate that daily administration of caffeine (25 mg/kg/day) to newborn mice over the first fourteen days of life did not impact the deleterious effects of hyperoxia on lung development, assessed by lung surface area (SA) in mice treated with room air (21% O2 ) plus vehicle (physiological saline; SA approx. 152 cm2); hyperoxia (85% O2 ; SA approx. 105 cm2); room air plus caffeine (SA approx. 142 cm2); and hyperoxia plus caffeine (SA approx. 102 cm2). SA was assessed by a stereological approach. In contrast, caffeine administration normalized the body mass of caffeine-treated pups, in the background of hyperoxia exposure. Hyperoxia modulated tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-8, and IL-10 levels in the lung, however, concomitant caffeine administration did not impact the effect of hyperoxia on the expression of these inflammatory mediators . In contrast, caffeine administration did impact the expression levels of both bone morphogenetic protein and TGF-beta receptors. These data suggest that caffeine administration in the hyperoxia model cannot correct stunted lung development, however, may impact growth factor pathways relevant to lung development.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by impaired alveolarization, vascularization, ECM remodeling and growth factor signaling critical for lung development. Studies show association of cigarette smoke (CS) exposure during gestation with premature birth and increased risk for long term complications. Whether moderate prenatal CS (pCS) causes pulmonary injury in preterms is still unknown. We therefore studied the role of moderate pCS in neonatal lung development and response to injury upon postnatal mechanical ventilation with oxygen (MVO-2). Method(s): C57BL/6 mice were exposed to moderate pCS (500mg/m3,50min/2Xday) or filter air (FA) from day 7-18 of gestation. P5-7 old newborn mice from both groups received MVO-2 (FiO2=0.4) or spontaneously breathed 40% O2 for 8 hours. Analysis of Histology and microvessel number, TUNEL assay and immunofluorescence for apoptosis, endothelial cell marker and growth factors was performed. Result(s): Newborn mice exposed to pCS and mild hyperoxia displayed no effect on alveolar structure when compared to the FA group. In both groups, MVO-2 led to larger and fewer alveoli. In contrast to FA group, lungs of newborn mice exposed to pCS and mild hyperoxia exhibited relocalization of elastic fibers. Significant decrease in no. of microvessels and vascular markers with an increase in cleaved caspase-3 positive cells was seen in lungs of newborn mice receiving pCS and mild hyperoxia. Newborn mice in both groups demonstrated significant decrease of PDGFRalpha expression upon MVO-2. Conclusion(s): Moderate pCS predisposes immature lung to the development of pathophysiological changes induced by postnatal MVO-2, hence contributing to BPD.

AB  - Pulmonary diseases of the lung are characterized by a loss (chronic obstructive lung disease) or impaired formation (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) of the alveolar structure. New therapeutic concepts are urgently needed since therapeutic options are not available. Fibroblasts subtypes such as the lipofibroblasts (LFs), myofibroblasts (MFs) and PDGFRalpha+ fibroblasts, have been demonstrated to be key players in the lung during alveolarization but their distinct functions remain unknown. The present study aimed to characterize and elucidate the role of LFs during alveolarization using CreloxP based approaches for linage tracing. The localization, mode of differentiation and function of the LFs subset during alveolarization was analyzed. Double transgenic mice which stably express a red (Tomato) fluorophore lose the red label and acquire a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorophore label upon Cre recombinase activation. Using a novel ADRPCreERT2 mouse line crossed with a stop/loxP reporter-line, we investigated the dynamics in the lipofibroblast population throughout development. Postnatal transgenic mice treated with tamoxifen at postnatal days P1, P7, and P10 permitted the temporal delineation of the appearance, and spatial delineation of the localization of lipofibroblasts at postnatal day (P)14. These data revealed spatiotemporal changes in LFs in the developing lung, where LFs were present in the lung on P0, and decreased over time in the distal (developing) lung. By P14, the bulk of the remaining LFs were also PDGFRalpha+, but SMA-. These data add to a growing body of evidence that fibroblast phenotypes are plastic and that transdifferentiation phenotypes between PDGFRalpha+ fibroblasts, LFs, and SMA+ fibroblasts may overlap.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of premature birth, characterised by arrested secondary septation. Molecular mechanisms of arrested secondary septation are not known. Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta growth factor superfamily are accredited with key roles in lung development and BPD. We profiled lung expression of the TGF-beta signaling machinery in mice in a hyperoxia-based BPD model, and detected a down-regulation Tgfbr3 expression. Using laser-capture microdissection, Tgfbr3 mRNA expression was reduced in both the lung vascular and parenchymal compartments in response to hyperoxia. Abrogation of Tgfbr3 expression using siRNA caused a two-fold increase in proliferation and the migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Tgfbr3 in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells caused a decrease in endothelial tube formation. We then created a floxed Tgfbr3 (Tgfbr3fl/fl) mouse line, and used this mouse line, in combination with smooth muscle (SMMHC-CreERT2 ) and endothelial (Tie2-CreE R T 2 ) mouse driver lines where Cre-recombinase can be selectively induced in cells with smooth muscle properties and in endothelial cells, respectively, after tamoxifen injection. Induction of Cre-recombinase in post-natal mouse pups at post-natal day (P)1 and P2 caused a 50% decrease in alveolar number at P7 in SMMHC-CreERT2/Tgfbr3fl/fl mice, without any change in septal thickness (assessed by stereological analysis). In contrast, there was no effect noted in lung structure in Tie2-CreERT2/Tgfbr3fl/fl mice. These data implicate Tgfbr3 in cells with smooth muscle properties, as a key mediator of post-natal lung alveolarisation.

AB  - A disturbed extracellular matrix (ECM) is a feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). How the ECM structures are malformed is not understood. Transglutaminases are ECM cross-linking enzymes, and transglutaminase 2 (Tgm2) is deregulated in experimental and clinical BPD. No role for Tgm2 in lung development has been demonstrated. We hypothesized that Tgm2 plays a role in lung alveolarization. To address this, we employed Tgm2-l- mice in a hyperoxia-based experimental animal model of BPD. Normoxia (21% O2)-exposed Tgm2-l- mice exhibited a decreased body mass (4.98 g vs. 5.51 g; P<0.0001) and lung volume (0.23 cm3 vs. 0.27 cm3 ; P=0.0022) at postnatal day (P)14.5 compared to normoxiaexposed controls. Changes in lung structure were detected comparing the two groups, suggesting an arrest in alveolarization in Tgm2-l- mice. Total surface area (163.9 cm2 vs. 201.7 cm2 ; P=0.0155), septal thickness (10.36 jm vs. 8.45 j m ; P=0.0142) and total alveoli number (3.253 x 106 vs. 4.067 x 106; P=0.0541) were perturbed in Tgm2-l- mice. Expression levels of Tgm2-l- were increased by hyperoxia exposure. Total surface area (124.2 cm2 vs. 201.7 cm2 ; P< 0.0001), MLI (61.91 Lim vs. 31.73 mum; PO.0001), septal thickness (10.27 jm vs. 8.45 mum ; P=0.693) and total alveoli number (1.536 x 106 vs. 4.067 x 106 ; P<0.0001) were markedly altered upon hyperoxia-exposure in wild-type animals at P14.5. Tgm2 expression was upregulated by hyperoxia-expsoure in developing mouse lungs, however, genetic abrogation of Tgm2 expression was not protective. These data indicate that Tgm2 most likely plays a role in normal lung alveolarization, but does not contribute to the aberrant alveolarization seen in hyperoxiaexposed developing mouse lungs.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of premature birth and is modeled in rodents by exposure of newborns to 85% O2 . Perturbations to extracellular matrix (ECM) production and remodeling play a causal role in arrested lung development associated with BPD. An unbiased microarray screen of microRNA (miR) abundance in the developing lung revealed miR-29c-3p, which targets ECM components (elastin and collagens), to be deregulated in experimental BPD. Changes in miR-29c expression were validated by real-time RT-PCR, where miR-29c was significantly (up to four-fold) increased in developing mouse lungs in response to hyperoxia exposure. Further in vitro studies in primary lung fibroblasts validated both eln mRNA (encoding tropoelastin), and mRNA encoding col4a1 and col4a5 and other basement membrane collagens, as well as fbnl (fibulin 1) as targets of miR-29c-3p. Treatment of newborn mouse pups with an antagomiR-29c-3p, which blocks miR-29c-3p function in vivo, resulted in a partial protection against the damaging effects of hyperoxia on lung structural development. Notably, hyperoxia drove increased septal wall thickness, and antagomiR-29c application concomitantly with hyperoxia protected against any increase in septal wall thickness, which remained normal (10.00 Lim). Biochemical and histological analyses further revealed that antagomiR-29c application drove increased insoluble elastin protein abundance, and partially normalized the deposition of elastin into foci at the tips of developing septa, in the lungs of newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia. These data identify miR-29c as a causal factor in the arrest alveolarization seen in experimental BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Despite an increase in the use of high frequency ventilation, particularly high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), as a rescue modality in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants in recent years, there is a lack of information about its impact on outcomes. Aim(s): To evaluate if the use of rescue HFOV prognosticates for higher rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death, in comparison with the use of conventional mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation. Secondary outcomes - severe BPD, severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), duration of stay in neonatal intensive care unit and weight at discharge. Method(s): Prospectively collected cohort study using data keyed into and retrieved from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Neonatal Department's REDCap database. Inclusion criteria - all VLBW infants < 1500g at birth who were admitted to SGH from 1 January 2012 to 31 January 2015. Result(s): 151 infants were studied, of whom 15 required HFOV (8.4% of VLBW infants). Rescue HFOV in VLBW was associated with increased BPD or death (OR = 11.21, p-value < 0.027) [See table 1]. Other significant secondary outcomes included IVH (88.9% vs. 23.1%). It was not associated with ROP or NEC [See table 2]. Complications associated with HFOV use included hypotension, thrombocytopenia and pulmonary haemorrhage. Rescue HFOV was associated with lower gestation and birthweights, lower APGAR scores, presence of pre-existing maternal medical conditions and these neonates were more likely to require intubation/chest compression. A common aetiology was persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Conclusion(s): Rescue HFOV in VLBW identified a high risk group associated with BPD or death, as well as increased neurological complications. (Table Presented).

AB  - Background: Impaired gas exchange in infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is quantified by right shift and shunt of the oxyhaemoglobin saturation dissociation curve (ODC). Shift and shunt are obtained by plotting inspired oxygen pressure (PiO2 =FiO2 at sea level) against peripheral oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpO2). A single recorded pair of PiO2 and SpO2 obtained whilst SpO2 is between86and 94%is sufficient to predict shift of theODC (Quine et al., 2006). TheANZNN will introduce simplified shift for infants <28 weeks gestational age (GA) in 2016, but current prediction tables do not give outcomes for infants with SpO2>94% in air (FiO2 0.21). Method(s): Infants <32 weeks GA were tested at 36weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). PiO2 was adjusted from 0.14 to 0.5 to achieve SpO2 86-98%. Shift and shunt were calculated from the ODC of each infant using customised software (Quine et al. 2006). Predicted shift for infants with SpO2 >94%in air was determined via linear regression of SpO2 in air versus calculated shift. Result(s): A total of 54 infants at median (range) 28 (234-315) w GA were tested at 353 (335-374)w PMA. Median (range) SpO2 value in air was 95.7% (87.6-99%). SpO2/PiO2 were significantly correlated (Spearman's Rho -0.97, P<0.01). Shift values for SpO2 95-100% in air were calculated from the linear regression (R2 = 0.80): shift = -0.773 x PiO2 + 83.504 (see table). Conclusion(s): This table provides estimates of shift from a single paired SpO2/PiO2 measurement for infants saturating >94% in air, facilitating disease severity quantification across all BPD stages.

AB  - Background: A randomised controlled trial (N3RO trial- ACTRN#12612000503820) is evaluating the efficacy of a DHA emulsion (NuMega) on the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We aimed to examine the effect of the DHA and other commercially available emulsions on the inflammatory response of respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. Method(s): Type II alveolar cells (A549) were stimulated with TNFalpha (2 ng/mL) and dosed with the equivalent of 50 muM DHA for NuMega DHA, ClinOleic, Omegaven, SMOFlipid emulsions and 50 muM LA for NuMega soy and Intralipid for 24 h. Cytokine levels (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) at baseline and post 24-h incubation were measured using cytometric bead array (BD Biosciences). Result(s): DHA attenuated the release of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8 compared to LA. No significant effect of DHA was seen for IL-1beta and IL-10. NuMega DHA and Omegaven emulsions resulted in the largest reduction in IL-8 (P<0.05), while there was a non-significant trend for both of these high-DHA emulsions to reduce IL-6 compared to NuMega soy. Conclusion(s): Inflammatory processes underpin BPD in preterm infants. The ability of DHA to reduce inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in an in vitro model of the respiratory epithelium is suggestive of an immunomodulatory role for omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to prevent BPD. The results support the use of intravenous fluids containing omega-3 fatty acids.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Purpose /Aim of Study: The renin angiotensin system is involved in experimentally induced lung fibrosis. Angiotensin (ANG)-II is profibrotic. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) cleaves ANG-II and is thus protective. ACE-2 has recently been reported to be significantly decreased under hyperoxic conditions. Hyperoxia is linked to Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and lung fibrosis. Fetal lung cells normally do not undergo fibrotic changes with physiologic hypoxemia. We hypothesized that hypoxia prior to hyperoxic exposure in fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90 cell line) might be protective by preventing ACE-2 downregulation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: IMR-90 cells were exposed to hypoxia (1%O2/99%N2) followed by hyperoxia (95%O2/5%CO2) or normoxia (21%O2) in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2, TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), alphaSmooth muscle actin (alphaSMA)-myofibroblast marker-, N-cadherin, and beta-catenin immunoreactive protein., RESULTS: ACE-2 significantly increased when IMR-90 were hypoxic prior to hyperoxic exposure with no recovery. In contrast to hyperoxia alone, ACE-2 did not decrease when IMR-90 were hypoxic prior to hyperoxic exposure with recovery. TACE/ADAM17 protein and mRNA were significantly decreased under these conditions. alphaSMA N-cadherin, and beta-catenin proteins were significantly decreased with or without normoxic recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia prior to hyperoxic exposure of fetal lung fibroblasts prevented ACE-2 downregulation and decreased ADAM17/TACE protein and mRNA. alphaSMA, N-cadherin, and beta-catenin were also significantly decreased under these conditions.

AB  - Rationale: Neonatal chronic lung disease, i. e. BPD, determines long-term pulmonary and neurologic development. As to date, the diagnosis is solely stated with respect to its clinical course referring to oxygen dependency on day 28 post partum or at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Early markers are urgently needed for timely diagnosis and personalized treatment. Objective(s): The prospective study determined structural and functional changes in the preterm lung at the time of diagnosis and identified early disease markers by proteome screening in plasma in the first week of life. Method(s): 40 preterm infants (27.7 +/- 2.09wks, 984 +/- 332 g) were included for advanced MR imaging (3-Tesla) and complemented by Infant Lung function testing (ILFT) in spontaneously breathing infants. Samples from plasma, tracheal aspirate and urine were processed for proteomic screening. Key findings were confirmed in an independent study cohort (n = 21 infants). Statistical analysis used penalized and Poisson regression analysis for protein analysis confounder effects were subtracted by lasso regression. Long-term follow-up with 2 and 5 years is intended. Result(s): Statistical analysis confirmed a high correlation of MRI and lung function variables and identified a pattern characterizing changes in the lungs of preterm infants by T2- and T1-weighed image analysis and lung volume measurements as well as ILFT. Statistical modelling using the outcome variables 'days of oxygen' or 'days of MV' instead of BPD diagnosis confirmed the analysis indicated above. Functional enrichment analysis showed overrepresentation of the GO categories 'immune function', 'extracellular matrix', 'cellular proliferation/migration', 'organ development' and 'angiogenesis' in infants with BPD. One protein was identified as a potential biomarker. Conclusion(s): We identified a structural pattern characterizing BPD by advanced MRI confirmed by ILFT. The findings reflect the characteristic picture outlined by previous studies of human tissue samples, i. e. the presence of interstitial and emphysematous changes. The identified protein indicated BPD development in the first week of life enabling personalized treatment strategies. Further investigation will be the establishment of this biomarker in a clinical study in a number of tertiary perinatal centers.

AB  - Background and aims We report results from a phase 2 trial evaluating rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 for prevention of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and comorbidities of prematurity. Methods Infants with GA 23w+0d to 27w+6d were randomised to rhIGF-1/ rhIGFBP-3 (250mug/kg/day, continuous infusion from day-of-birth to PMA 29w+6d) or standard neonatal care, with follow-up to PMA 40w +/-4d. Target drug exposure was >=70% IGF-1measurements within normal intrauterine range (28-109mug/L) and >=70% intended duration of therapy. Primary endpoint was maximum severity of ROP. Secondary endpoints included bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), growth parameters, and time to discharge from neonatal intensive care (TDNIC). Results 61 infants were randomised to rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3, 60 to standard neonatal care (full analysis set; FAS). 24/61 treated infants achieved target exposure (evaluable set; ES). rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 did not reduce the primary endpoint of ROP severity, or the occurrence of ROP. There was, however, 53% reduction in severe BPD in the FAS (44.9% standard neonatal care vs 21.3% treated), and 89% reduction in the ES (44.9% vs 4.8%). There was also 44% reduction in IVH Grades III/IV in the FAS (23.3% vs 13.1%), and 64% reduction in the ES (23.3% vs 8.3%). No effect was observed on growth parameters or TDNIC. There were no safety signals with rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3, and no deaths/serious adverse events were considered related to treatment. Conclusions rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 treatment in extremely preterm infants did not affect development of ROP but substantially decreased the occurrence of severe BPD and IVH Grades III/IV, both of which will be endpoints in a phase 3 trial.

AB  - Background and aims Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is caused by a combination of environmental stressors and a component of inheritability that seems to elude Mendelian inheritance mechanisms, suggesting the possibility that BPD has epigenetic origins. We suggest the use of Mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs), derived from tracheal aspirates of intubated preterm newborns, to determine the transcriptome profile at different stages of lung development. We will also compare the chromatin landscape of patientderived LMSCs with stillborn-derived LMSCs. Our hypothesis is that genes, involved in lung development, are subjected to an environmental reprogramming process, through changes in their chromatin structure, that leads to altered gene expression and ultimately to a pathological lung. Methods Rna-Seq will be performed on patients-derived LMSCs (n=16) collected as previously reported from intubated preterm newborns at different weeks of gestation; stillborn-derived LMSCs have been purchased (n=4). Whole genome Promoters and Enhancers topography will be obtained performing ChIP-Seq for specific histone marks as previously described. Results Preliminary results show that LMSCs coherently express specific genes in accord with the stage of lung development, suggesting that these cells reflect the lung microenvironment they belong to. As expected, patientsderived LMSCs present altered expression of several genes involved in lung maturation, possibly reflecting the impact of prematurity on their regulation. Conclusions For their tissue and age-specificity LMSCs appears to be a powerful system to study the molecular aspects of the preterm lung. Promoters and enhancers genomic analysis of these lines may provide novel insights about the role that chromatin plays in preterm lung morbidities and in its altered development.

AB  - Background and aims Volumetric capnography indices obtained 4 to 6 weeks after the expected date of delivery discriminate between preterm infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We aimed to determine whether early measurement of such indices at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) discriminates between infants with and without BPD. BPD was defined as oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks PMA. Methods We performed tidal breathing analysis including volumetric capnography in spontaneously breathing preterm infants using an ultrasonic flowmeter and a mainstream CO2 sensor. Volume capnography slopes of phase II (SII) and phase III (SIII) were calculated. We assessed the association between BPD and capnography slopes using linear regression analyses. Results We calculated SII and SIII from 99 infants born with mean (SD) gestational age of 28.3 (2.4) weeks and birth weight of 1040 (370) g (n=83 without BPD, n=16 with BPD). SIII was significantly associated with BPD after adjusting for weight at test (P<0.001, R2=0.17). We found a negative association of SII with BPD (P<0.001, R2=0.11). Conclusions Volumetric capnography slopes measured at 36 weeks PMA are associated with the presence of BPD in preterm infants. Volumetric capnography appears to be a promising tool for early and objective assessment of respiratory outcome after preterm birth.

AB  - Background and aims To define characteristics of premature infants referred for surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). To define morbidity, mortality and associated risk factors following PDA ligation. Methods During a four years period (2010-2013) 31 consecutive preterm neonates underwent PDA ligation through posterolateral thoracotomy. Referral characteristics were prematurity, left atrium to aorta relation bigger than 1.6, inability to wean from mechanical ventilation and prior failed treatment with nonsteroid anti inflammatory drug. Patients with associated intracardiac anomalies and severe genetic disorders were excluded. Median gestational age was 27 weeks (range 24-35), mod for Apgar score was 3, and median birth weight was 1100 grams (600-2000). Median age at ligation was 27 days (13-69), median duration of mechanical ventilation before ligation was 22 days (0-69). Results There was no mortality; all patients were discharged from hospital with median follow up of 24 months. Median time to extubation after the surgery was 6 days, median duration of hospitalization was 112 days. Incidence of rethinopathy was 29% (9/31), neurodisability 25% (8/31), vocal cord palsy 19% (6/31), bronchopulmonary dysplasia 45 % (14/31) with one patient requiring home oxygen therapy. There was no hemodynamic instability, pneumothorax or chylothorax following surgery. Incidence of systemic infection following surgery was 3% (1/31). Conclusions Surgical ligation of PDA is safe and effective treatment that is associated with short term respiratory improvments. Incidences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, rethinopathy and neurodisability are not necessary related to surgery according to recent data.

AB  - Background and aims Despite significant improvements in the management of premature infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most prevalent long-term morbidity in surviving extremely preterm infants. This study was aimed to investigate the role of right ventricular performance index (RIMP) for early prediction of BPD and to assess the correlation between RIMP and Nterminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels (NT-proBNP) in premature infants. Methods Prospective echocardiography were performed in 80 preterm infants < 32 weeks of gestation on day of life (DOL) 7 (median (quartiles) gestational age 28 (25-30) weeks, birth weight 995 (840-1490) g), concomitant with urinary NT-proBNP determination. Of these, 10 infants developed a BPD, as defined by need for supplemental oxygen at 36 postmenstrual weeks. Results RIMP derived by conventional pulsed Doppler technique on DOL 7 was increased in infants who subsequently developed BPD (0.31 (0.21-0.43)) compared with infants who did not develop BPD (median 0.18 (0.11-0.25), p=0.025). Similarly, urinary NT-proBNP levels on DOL 7 were elevated in infants who developed BPD, as compared to controls (8873 (5676-25743) pg/ml vs. 708 (230-3161) pg/ ml, p<0.001). RIMP was correlated positively with NT-proBNP (Rs = 0.39, p = 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for prediction of BPD was 0.72 for RIMP and 0.89 for NT-proBNP. Conclusions An increase in RIMPat DOL 7, reflecting right ventricular dysfunction, is associated with raised NT-proBNP concentration and provides early prognostic information in risk-stratification of preterm infants who subsequently develop BPD.

AB  - Background and aims Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer technology that generates threedimensional environments which the subject interacts with, in real time. High costs associated, have prevented their widespread implementation. Recently, new technologies have enabled a reduction thereof, allowing usefulness in medical interventions. Case Report of managing anxiety with Immersive VR on an extreme preterm infant's mother. Methods Voluntary participation of the mother of a premature 27-week of gestational age and 1,000 grams of birth weight. with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and Necrotizing Enterocolitis. He was 5 weeks-old, and 32 weeks GCA at the time of intervention. She underwent an interview to get connection with the emotions associated to her son experience, and then assessed with Beck Anxiety Inventory score. Afterwards, the VR viewer was applied with headsets; a beautiful sightseeing and a relaxing not NICU related music were selected. After the VR session, she underwent the same assessment score. Results The mother reported calm with the experience, and anxiety scale significantly decreased, dropping down his score from 39 points (severe anxiety) to 7 points (minimum level). Conclusions VR has been used in phobias and panic disorders, showing a significant reduction in associated symptoms. Recently, research has focused on its effectiveness in inducing emotional states of gratification and relaxation, in order to achieve a distraction from stressors that generate anxiety in patients. It has proved to be an effective technique. Results seen in this case report and other studies, have encouraged us to continue assessing the therapeutic potential of this technique.

AB  - Background and aims While Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) are investigated as a possible therapeutic agent for the prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), the role of resident lung MSCs in the development of BPD still is not fully understood. We investigated if the phenotype of MSCs from tracheal aspirates of preterm infants might correlate with the severity of BPD. Methods The proliferative capacity of MSC from the tracheal aspirates of n=50 neonates <29 weeks of gestation was assessed by CellScreen: The expression of alpha-Smooth-Muscle-Actin (alphaSMA) and Nuclear Factor kB p65 (NFkBp65) was measured by western blot and quantified with AIDA imaging software. The correlation between severity of BPD and the proliferative capacity, alphaSMA resp. NFkB expression was tested using a proportional odds model. Results The higher proliferative capacity was associated with a more severe degree of BPD. A high expression of alphaSMA was associated with less severe BPD. High NFkBp65 expression on the other hand correlated with more severe BPD. MSCs that showed a high proliferative capacity showed more nuclear NFkBp65 accumulation than MSC with low proliferation rates. A score consisting of proliferative capacity, NFkB- and alphaSMA-expression was predictive for the development of severe BPD in an ROC with an AUC of 0.847 and sensitivity/specificity of 0.65/0.80. Conclusions Depending on their environment, MSCs have been shown to exhibit pro- or anti-inflammatory properties. Our data suggest that MSCs in preterm infants differ interindividually in their phenotype and that these differences in phenotype are predicitive for the pulmonary outcome.

AB  - Background and aims Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of prematurity. BPD has a significant heritability, but the predisposing genes are insufficiently known. The aim of this study was to identify genetic loci associating to moderate-to-severe BPD by means of a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Methods The initial GWAS was performed on 174 Finnish preterm infants, gestational age 24-30 weeks. The most promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in both Finnish (n = 555) and non-Finnish (n = 388) replication cohorts. Results In GWAS, we detected suggestive association signals (p<10-4) for 29 SNPs. Of them rs11265269, located 44 kb upstream of the CRP gene was the strongest (odds ratio, OR = 3.22, p = 3.43x10-6). This association replicated in Finnish (OR 1.47, p = 0.029) and African (OR = 2.48, p = 0.02) populations. Other SNPs in the CRP region, including rs3093059, had nominal associations with BPD. Levels of plasma CRP during the first week of life associated with rs3093059 (p = 0.05), and with BPD (p < 10-4). In a logistic regression analysis considering the known antenatal risk factors, rs11265269 was identified as a risk factor for BPD (OR 1.82, p = 5.32 x 10-5). Conclusions In a GWAS, rs11265269 upstream of CRP gene revealed suggestive association with BPD. This association was replicated. Plasma CRP associated with BPD and several CRP-upstream SNPs associated with plasma CRP. The rs11265269 was shown to be an independent risk factor of BPD. We propose a role for CRP-associated inflammation in the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Background: Asthma hospitalization, mostly due to severe exacerbations, is an indication for uncontrolled asthma symptoms. Montelukast, categorized as leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), is prescribed as a long term control medication. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration has approved generic versions of Montelukast. More than 90% of patients switched from brand to generics by the 4th quarter of 2012. Objective(s): The main aim is to assess the differences in hospitalization due to asthma between generics and brand Montelukast. Method(s): The study population draws from the Truven MarketScanR database. The study periods is defined as two periods. The first one, from 1st July 2011 - 30th June 2012, is prior to the approval of Montelukast generics. The second period, which is from 1st July 2013 - 30th June 2014, is after the generics entered the market. Patients included in the study must have 6 months' available information prior the study period, full enrollment during two study periods, at least 2 ICD-9 asthma code (493xx) in the outpatient setting or 1 ICD-9 asthma code in the inpatient setting and at least one Montelukast prescription. We excluded patients with COPD, Cystic Fibrosis, Bronchiectasis, Bronchiectasis, Embolism, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or Congestive heart failure. Result(s): 3,521 patients are identified as switchers to generics before the second study period starts. Since patients in two periods are the same, there is no differences in sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The proportion of asthma hospitalization among patients using the brand is 3% compared to 1.9% in patients taking the generics (P-value <0.01). In both periods, pre and post, patients younger than 12 years old have a higher proportion of hospitalization due to asthma compared to asthma patients older than 12 years old (P-value<0.01). Conclusion(s): Compared to the brand version, generics Montelukast show more protective effect in hospitalization due to asthma.

AB  - Oxygen toxicity and antioxidant deficiencies contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Aurothioglucose (ATG) and auranofin potently inhibit thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1), and TrxR1 disruption activates nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a regulator of endogenous antioxidant responses. We have shown previously that ATG safely and effectively prevents lung injury in adult murine models, likely via Nrf2-dependent mechanisms. The current studies tested the hypothesis that ATG would attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits in newborn mice. Newborn C3H/HeN mice were treated with a single dose of ATG or saline within 12 hours of birth and were exposed to either room air or hyperoxia (85% O2). In hyperoxia, ATG potently inhibited TrxR1 activity in newborn murine lungs, attenuated decreases in body weight, increased the transcription of Nrf2-regulated genes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase 1, and attenuated alterations in alveolar development. To determine the impact of TrxR1 inhibition on Nrf2 activation in vitro, murine alveolar epithelial-12 cells were treated with auranofin, which inhibited TrxR1 activity, enhanced Nrf2 nuclear levels, and increased NQO1 and heme oxygenase 1 transcription. Our novel data indicate that a single injection of the TrxR1 inhibitor ATG attenuates hyperoxia-induced alterations in alveolar development in newborn mice. Furthermore, our data support a model in which the effects of ATG treatment likely involve Nrf2 activation, which is consistent with our findings in other lung injury models. We conclude that TrxR1 represents a novel therapeutic target to prevent oxygen-mediated neonatal lung injury.

AB  - Background: Given a paucity of randomized controlled trials on the topic, we applied physician preference- associated practice variation to evaluate mortality and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) following non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment to close patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Objective(s): To determine whether NSAID treatment for PDA affects mortality or moderate/severe BPD at 36-weeks postmenstrual age. Method(s): We included <=28-weeks gestation infants admitted to NICUs on their birth date as recorded in the 2006-2013 Pediatric Health Information System. Indomethacin or ibuprofen initiated on postnatal days 2-28 was considered to be PDA treatment. We first calculated a traditional generalized estimating equation (GEE) estimate of NSAID treatment on mortality/BPD. We then calculated the percent of NSAID-treated infants at each individual infant?fs institution within the period 6 months prior to 6 months after that infant?fs birth. This percent of treated infants was used as an instrument to reduce bias and more accurately determine the effect of NSAID treatment on a primary composite outcome of mortality or BPD. Result(s): The cohort included 11,419 infants in 24 hospitals. GEE models controlling only for gestation, gender, and race showed an increase in the mortality/BPD composite outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.29; [95% CI: 1.11-1.49]) and increased BPD (OR 1.50; [1.32, 1.72]) following NSAID treatment, but showed decreased mortality (OR 0.56; [0.46, 0.66]). The instrument, the % of infants at each infant?fs hospital receiving NSAID treatment within a year of that unique infant?fs birth, was a strong predictor of NSAID treatment (p<0.001, F=900) and not significantly associated with gestation, race, or gender. Instrumental variable analysis demonstrated no significant risk difference between NSAID treatment and mortality/ BPD (-0.03 [95% CI:-0.10, 0.04]), mortality (-0.02 [- 0.07, 0.03]), or BPD in survivors (-0.02 [-0.10, 0.06]). Conclusion(s): Among similar <=28-week gestation preterm infants admitted to the NICU on their birthdate, we found no significant increase in mortality or BPD at 36-weeks during periods of decreased center-specific usage of NSAIDs to treat PDA.

AB  - Learning Objectives: Rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by elevated creatinine kinase (CK) levels due to muscle necrosis from traumatic and nontraumatic etiologies. We report this case of a 13 months old child, who had a history of recurrent rhabdomyolysis, developed life threatening CK level of 145,920 U/L. This high level in an infant is rarely reported in the literature. Method(s): Patient was born at 23 weeks of gestation and had a prolonged NICU stay. He has a history of dystonia, spasticity and recurrent rhabdomyolysis; for which he has been receiving clonazepam, baclofen and clonidine. He also has a history of pulmonary hypertension and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. He was admitted with fever, vomiting, tachycardia, respiratory distress and CK level of 82,090 U/L. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and urine alkalinizaion was started. He was also sedated with dexmedetomidine and midazolam infusion to decrease CK production. Despite of all these measures, his CK levels continued to rise and peaked at 145,920 U/L within 24 hours. At this stage aralysis with vecuronium infusion and mechanical ventilation was started. His renal function was well preserved; electrolytes were closely monitored and replaced. He responded to these therapies and CK level normalized after 20 days. Result(s): Diagnostic work up included respiratory viral panel, urine organic acid, plasma amino acid, carnitine/ acylcarnitine profile, biotinidase, thiamine, copper and ceruloplasmin levels, fatty acid oxidation and purine/pyrimidine panels; which were within normal limits. EEG was normal and MRI brain showed chronic sequelae of intraventricular hemorrhage without periventricular leukomalacia or acute findings. Chromosomal microarray was suggestive of increased risk for recessive allele. Clinical exome sequencing was sent. This case report gives an important message. Despite of life threatening CK level, timely initiation of medical management can halt the disease progression, can preserve renal function and the need of renal replacement therapy can be averted. Appropriate diagnostic work up should be performed in severe cases.

AB  - Learning Objectives: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to rescue children with cardiopulmonary failure after congenital heart surgery. However, ECMO is not used in all patients and some patients die without ECMO support (DWE) while other patients are supported with ECMO (ES). This study examines patient and hospital level characteristics that are associated with death without ECMO support in children undergoing congenital heart surgery. Method(s): All congenital heart surgery patients in the Pediatric Health Information Systems database from 2003 to 2014 were classified as: surviving without ECMO, receiving ECMO support and dying without ECMO support. Multivariate regression models examining death without ECMO support versus ECMO support were constructed. Result(s): Of 104,407 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 2,211 patients (2.1%) received ES while 1,823 (1.8%) died without ECMO support. DWE patients accounted for 62% of all surgical mortality. In multivariate models, prematurity (Relative Risk Ratio (RR)=1.9, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=1.6-2.3), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (RR=1.6, 95%CI=1.2-2.1), and complex chronic conditions [gastrointestinal (RR=1.8, 95%CI=1.4-2.2), other congenital/genetic (RR=1.6, 95%CI=1.4-1.8), respiratory (RR=1.4, 95%CI=1.1-1.7), renal (RR=1.3, 95%CI=1.1-1.5)] were associated with DWE but not associated with ES. Increasing hospital surgical volume was associated with lower odds of DWE (RR=0.69, 95%CI=0.51-0.92 for highest surgical tertile). Hospitals with higher rates of DWE had significantly higher proportions of patients with gastrointestinal conditions, pre-operative mechanical ventilation, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Conclusion(s): Patients who die without ECMO support account for the majority of deaths after congenital heart surgery. Various forms of underlying medical complexity are risk factors for death without ECMO and variations in patient populations may contribute to hospital variations in death without ECMO.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes for women of AMA undergoing two IVF pregnancies resulting in singleton gestations versus women with one IVF pregnancy resulting in a twin gestation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients 37 years old and greater at the time of oocyte retrieval, who had either two consecutive singleton gestations from IVF (n = 45) or one twin gestation from IVF (n = 175), were included. Both IVF and delivery at our center were required. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were obtained by chart review. Primary maternal outcomes included antepartum admission, length of hospital stay, preeclampsia, PPROM, and cesarean section. Primary neonatal outcomes included low birth weight (LBW), very low birth weight (VLBW), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, length of NICU/neonatal stay, and markers of severe neonatal morbidity including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), sepsis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). For singleton pregnancies, outcomes were counted as having occurred if present in one or both pregnancies. Continuous outcomes were log-transformed. Bivariate tests were performed using t-tests for continuous variables, and chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Outcomes with p-values<0.10 were tested in regression framework to obtain odds ratios. RESULT(S): There were significantly increased rates of antepartum admission (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.54-17.66), PPROM (OR 8.92, 95% CI 1.18-67.39), cesarean section (OR 10.08, 95% CI 4.58-22.47), LBW (OR 24.52, 95% CI 8.35-72.02), and NICU admission (OR 5.12, 95% CI 2.17-12.10) in the twin group as compared to the singleton group. Length of neonatal hospital stay and length of NICU stay were also longer in the twin group (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.24), and OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.49). The twin group demonstrated a tendency towards an increased rate of preeclampsia (OR 3.98, 95% CI 0.91- 17.40) and IUGR (OR 6.41, 95%CI 0.84-48.49). All cases of VLBWoccurred in the twin group (n = 20). The only cases of ROP (n=6), sepsis (n=3), BPD (n=3), and IVH (n=1) occurred in the twin group. There were three neonatal deaths in the IVF twin group, and none in the singleton group. CONCLUSION(S): In women of AMA, undergoing two subsequent IVF singleton pregnancies is less morbid than undergoing one IVF twin pregnancy. However, severe morbidity and neonatal mortality were relatively rare in the twin group. Patients with the goal of having two children should be counseled about the neonatal and maternal risks associated with twin pregnancies as compared to two consecutive singleton pregnancies, prior to making decisions about how many embryos to transfer.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a common morbidity in preterm infants. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Dysregulation of innate immunity genes may contribute to pathogenesis of BPD. The Notch pathway functions in many processes including lung development and T-cell differentiation. It consists of transmembrane receptors Notch1 through Notch4 and ligands Delta-like (Dll) and Jagged ( Jag). These interactions lead to altered gene expression. The role of Notch in innate immunity of preterm infants has not been described. Here, we examined expression of Notch pathway components in innate immunity cells from lungs of mechanically ventilated preterm neonates. Methods Used Samples of tracheal aspirate fluid (TAF) were obtained according to IRB protocol during routine suctioning of intubated neonates of various gestational ages (GA). When possible, additional samples were obtained at different time points from same patients. Total cells in TAFs were used for RNA isolation. PCR using primers for Notch pathway components Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Jag1, Jag2, DLL1 and DLL2 was used to analyze their expression. Summary of Results At time of abstract submission, preliminary analysis of multiple samples from 8 preterm infants was completed. Nearly all samples revealed robust expression of two Notch receptors, Notch1 and Notch2. Other Notch pathway components including Notch3, Jag1, Dll1 and Dll2 were expressed dynamically in various samples. No expression of Jag2 was found. Preliminary gene array analysis of FACS-isolated lung macrophages revealed a 44 fold increase in Notch2 between a 24 week GA infant and a 30 week GA infant on day 3 of life. Both Notch1 and Notch3 decreased in the 30 week preterm infant. Conclusions Notch is a major signalling pathway, both during development and in disease processes. While some information regarding expression & function of Notch in adults exist, little information is available in preterm lung inflammatory cells. We show that most Notch components are expressed in cells from the lungs of human preemies. Their pattern of expression suggest they may be critical in regulating the inflammatory response in the lungs of neonates born prematurely.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic disease of preterm infants caused by oxygen toxicity, inflammation, and ventilator use leading to arrested alveolar development. Current therapies lack effectiveness and cause undesirable side effects. Our work has shown mesenchymal stem cell conditioned-media to have protective effects in mouse BPD models. Analysis identified Osteopontin (Spp1) and Macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf1) as key factors to suppress the TGF-B surge in the lungs, leading to protection against BPD. Our pilot study has shown it to be feasible to quantify Spp1, Csf1, and TGF-B in the tracheal aspirate fluid (TAF) of preterm infants and generated standard curves. Our aim is to determine the association between Spp1 and Csf1 and BPD by quantifying these markers in the TAF of preterm infants. Methods Used Infants under 32 weeks gestational age intubated within 24 hours of life were enrolled into the UCI IRB-approved study. Those with neuromuscular or congenital anomalies or pulmonary hemorrhage were excluded. The 1st TAF sample was obtained at intubation, before surfactant dosing. The 2nd was obtained at extubation or the 4th day if still intubated. Spp1, Csf1, TGF-B, and IgA levels were analyzed using ELISA. IgA was used as control to correct for TAF volume. Infants were followed prospectively for outcomes data including the development of BPD. Summary of Results 21 infants were enrolled and TAF obtained. Subjects were similar in their maternal and neonatal characteristics. Half of the samples have been analyzed. Processing of the remaining samples and collection of outcomes data is ongoing. Standard curves were used from the pilot study. Approximately half of the subjects have developed BPD and demonstrated low baseline Csf1 levels and rising TGF-B levels post-ventilation. The subjects without BPD had stable Spp1, Csf1, and TGF-B levels. Conclusions Levels of Spp1, Csf1, and TGF-B are associated with BPD. Further data collection is underway to reach study power. Statistical analysis will follow completion of sample processing. Larger multi-center studies are needed to confirm this association, which will guide targeted therapy against BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study Exposure to inflammatory stress is an independent risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, the molecular mechanisms linking inflammation to impaired lung development are unknown. Both IL-1 alpha (IL-1a) and IL-1 beta (IL-1b) induce inflammation by binding the IL-1 receptor. Importantly, IL-1 receptor antagonism attenuates lung injury and abnormal lung development in neonatal animals exposed to inflammatory stress. While many studies have linked IL-1b to BPD development, little is known about inducible IL-1a expression. The objective of our study was to determine whether systemic inflammatory stress induces IL-1a expression in the neonatal lung, and if so, whether this occurred via an NFkB dependent mechanism. Methods Used Both adult (6-10 wks) and neonatal (P0) WT mice were exposed to endotoxemia (IP LPS, 5 mg/kg, 2-6 hrs). Pulmonary and hepatic IL-1a expression were assessed by RT-qPCR and immunoblot. The role of NFkB in regulating inducible IL-1a expression was assessed using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to inhibit NFkB activity in isolated macrophages. Summary of Results Endotoxemia induced both IL-1a mRNA (150 fold, p<0.05) and protein expression in the neonatal lung, an effect not observed in the neonatal liver or the adult lung. Induction of IL-1a expression was temporally associated with pulmonary NFkB activation, determined by cytosolic degradation of NFkB inhibitors and nuclear translocation of the NFkB subunit p65. In isolated macrophages, pharmacologic (BAY 11-7085) and genetic (IkBa over-expression) inhibition of LPS-induced NFkB activation attenuated IL-1a expression (p<0.05). Finally, silencing expression of the NFkB inhibitory proteins IkBa and IkBb significantly increased IL1a expression (p<0.05). Conclusions Together these results suggest that in the neonatal lung, inducible IL-1a expression occurs via and NFkB dependent mechanism. Due to the profoundly pro-inflammatory effect of Il-1a, we speculate that pulmonary Il-1a expression may uniquely contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD. Better characterization of the mechanisms leading to IL-1a induced lung injury may lead to new therapies for BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is thought to arise from arrest of lung development. Mice & sheep models are useful for studying human BPD. Here, we examined expression of novel genes identified in a mouse model of lung development, in lambs exposed to invasive or non-invasive ventilation. Methods Used Genes of interest were identified by microarray of mouse lung tissue RNA during development. A select group with relevant purported functions included Cyr61, Egr1, Slit2 & Slitrk6. Expression of genes was examined in sheep lungs delivered at gestational ages (GA) ranging from 128 to 150 days (term). We also examined expression in lungs from 2 groups of preterm sheep delivered at 130 GA. 1 group was exposed to invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) & the other was on non-invasive high frequency nasal ventilation (HFNV). Ventilation was for 3 or 21 days. RNA was isolated & gene expression assessed by quantitative PCR. Summary of Results In uninjured sheep lungs Egr1, Slitrk6 & Cyr61 remained unchanged between 128 to 136 GA, but increased significantly at term. Slit2 remained constant. In ventilated lambs, Egr1 & Cyr61 increased in both MV & HFNV groups on day 3. This increased adaptation was greater in HFNV compared to MV group. After 21 days, Egr1 & Cyr61 decreased significantly in both groups. No change in Slit2 occured on day 3 in either group. Slitrk6 decreased in both MV & HFNV groups on days 3 and 21. Conclusions Our study found progressive increase in Egr1, Cyr61 & Slitrk6 mRNA during fetal sheep lung development. This novel finding suggests that expression of these genes is needed for normal pulmonary maturation & adaptation at birth. Egr1 & Cyr61 adaptation is more robust in HFNV vs MV ventilated preemies on day 3, suggesting possible association with better outcome. Slit2 & Slitrk6, which have not been described in lung development or injury were decreased in injured lungs. While the results are preliminary, they suggest adaptive changes in expression of developmentally critical genes in the lung in response to preterm birth.

AB  - Purpose of Study In the Trial of Late Surfactant (TOLSURF), all infants received iNO. Infants of mothers with African American (AA) RE had higher rates of survival without BPD. We sought to determine the relationship of RE to survival without BPD after adjustment for confounders, and to evaluate the effect of maternal RE and infant genetic ancestry in logistic regression (LR) models. Methods Used Infants enrolled in TOLSURF [<= 28 wks' gestational age (GA), ventilated at 7-14d)] were included. The primary outcome was survival without BPD (determined at 36 wks' GA by physiologic O2/flow challenge). DNA was isolated from tracheal aspirate samples following parental consent. Infants were genotyped at >800,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms on the Axiom LAT1 array (WorldArray4, Affymetrix). Global proportions of African (AFR), European (EUR) and Native American ancestry were estimated using the program ADMIXTURE. Mixed effects LR accounted for clustering by study site and infants of multiple gestation. Potential co-variates were considered for inclusion if associated with RE and a risk factor for BPD; our final model was informed by fit. For evaluation of RE and ancestry, only infants with adequate quality DNA sample were included. Summary of Results See Table. White/EUR ancestry are referent groups. Conclusions Maternal AA RE and infant proportion of AFR ancestry had similar effects on increased survival without BPD in infants treated with iNO. Further evaluation of the genetic basis for this relationship is warranted, particularly as response to manipulation of the NO pathway differs in AA in other settings. (Table Presented).

AB  - Purpose of Study Prolonged ventilation and O2 therapy are associated with BPD; less is known about the predictive value of early neonatal supplemental O2 exposure. We compared the utility of cumulative supplemental O2 exposure for prediction of Death or BPD in ELGAN at various time points up to 28d. Methods Used This is a secondary analysis from the randomized controlled Trial of Late Surfactant (TOLSURF). TOLSURF enrolled infants (n=511) who were <=28 wks' gestational age (GA), intubated and ventilated at 7-14d, without serious anomalies or life expectancy <7d. The primary outcome was Death or BPD at 36 wks' GA, determined as need for support by physiologic O2/flow challenge. Respiratory support settings were recorded 3x/d. Infants missing >=1d of respiratory support data (n=16) were excluded. Supplemental O2 (FiO2-0.21) was averaged for each 24h. Cumulative supplemental O2 (CSO) was the sum of supplemental O2 over the time period of interest. Cumulative mean airway pressure (MAP) was calculated similarly. Area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC) were generated to evaluate the utility of CSO for prediction of Death/BPD. We compared AUROC in the first 28d, and performed logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between CSO and Death/BPD. Summary of Results At 14d, AUROC for CSO was significantly better than earlier time points and did not increase with addition of later data (Table). Increasing CSO at 14d increased the odds of Death/BPD (OR=1.6, p<0.001), after adjustment for MAP. Conclusions Critical supplemental O2 exposure predicts Death/BPD in the first 14d. This may identify infants who could benefit from early intervention to prevent BPD.

AB  - AIM: Premature infants are often exposed to hyperoxia to maintain adequate oxygenation, which may lead to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Sex-specific differences exist in the development and severity of BPD. Only a few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying these sex-related differences. The aim of the present study is to examine the sex-related long-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia on the lungs of adult mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newborn mice were exposed to 95% oxygen (hyperoxia) for 96 hours and were allowed to recover in room air to adulthood (8 weeks of age). Lung tissues were excised at 4 days, 14 days, or 8 weeks of age. Short-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia on the mouse lung and sex-related differences in pulmonary function, airway hyper-responsiveness, and lung structure in adult mice were assessed., RESULTS: Neonatal hyperoxia was found to have no differential effect on body weight, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression, or bronchiolar epithelial thickness in adult mice. Respiratory resistance was increased and sensitivity to methacholine was decreased in male adult mice following exposure to neonatal hyperoxia, whereas delayed alveolarization was observed in female adult mice following exposure to neonatal hyperoxia., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study demonstrate that neonatal hyperoxia differentially affects pulmonary outcome in female and male adult mice.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading cause of morbidity in premature infants. While there are experimental animal models that approximate BPD with environmental exposures, there is currently no comparative human model of BPD. The overall goal is to create a disease model of BPD in order to investigate the cellular pathways involved in the disease pathophysiology. Methods Used 21-week gestation human fetal lung fibroblasts (FLF) were cultured on 2D plates or on alginate beads to form 3D organoid structures. The organoids were exposed to a hypoxia-hyperoxia model of BPD. Comparisons in gene expression patterns and histology were made using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), immunofluorescence, and H&E staining. Summary of Results In the 3D model, FLFs exposed to hypoxia and hyperoxia demonstrated fibroblast proliferation by brightfield microscopy and increased alpha-SMA expression by immunostaining. qPCR analysis showed expression profiles of 10 targets consistent with known expression patterns in BPD, including alpha-SMA, TGFbeta, collagen, PDE5, and elastin. These findings were specific to the FLFs in the 3D model in hypoxia-hyperoxic conditions; they were not seen in normoxic controls, in 2D models, or in 3D constructs made from neonatal skin fibroblasts. Exposure to hypoxiahyperoxia caused increased expression of Notch-2, Notch-3, and other downstream effectors in the Notch pathway. Treatment of FLF organoids with a gamma-secretase inhibitor of Notch prior to exposure to hypoxia-hyperoxia prevented the development of the BPD phenotype. Examination of autopsy specimens from infants who died from BPD showed evidence of Notch expression by pulmonary fibroblasts. Conclusions The fibroblast proliferation and gene expression pattern seen in the 3D model are similar to the histopathology of the fibrotic component of BPD in human infants. Increased expression of Notch was found in our model as well as in autopsy specimens from infants who died from BPD and inhibition of Notch obviated the development of the BPD phenotype, suggesting that the pathophysiology of BPD may result from a Notch-mediated mechanism in response to hypoxia-hyperoxia. With further validation of the model we hope to broaden our understanding of BPD and use this model to identify novel therapies.

AB  - Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection during the first two years of life, especially in preterm neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition, RSV acts as a trigger for elevated pulmonary morbidity (wheezing, bronchial asthma) in later infancy. Underlying pathomechanisms are largely unknown so far. Methylxanthines such as caffeine have been ascribed positive effects on airway inflammation as well as remodeling. The aim of the current in vitro study was to define the impact of RSV on regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in lung epithelial cells which plays a key role in airway remodeling. Furthermore, the impact of corticosteroids and caffeine on expression of CTGF was characterized. Material(s) and Method(s): The human airway epithelial cell line H441 was infected with recombinant RSV and subsequently treated with different corticosteroids and caffeine. CTGF, TGF-beta1-3 and TNF-alpha mRNA expression were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Clinical cases and summary results: Infection with RSV significantly induced CTGF mRNA levels in H441 cells (10.4 +/- 1.8-fold, p<0.0051), while no effect was observed on expression of TGF-beta1-3. Surprisingly, the additional treatment with dexamethasone (DXM) led to further amplification of CTGF (2.5 +/- 0.4-fold, p<0.0004) indicating additive effects. Caffeine was able to significantly antagonize dexamethasoneand RSV-mediated induction of CTGF (p<0.0001). The increased expression of TNF-alpha (53.9 +/- 14.5-fold, p<0.0001), which has been described as potent inhibitor of CTGF expression, might provide a potential explanation for the observed caffeine-mediated inhibition. In accordance with DXM, also other corticosteroids like betamethasone, prednisolone, budesonide, and hydrocortisone were able to induce CTGF expression in lung epithelial cells. Again, caffeine was able to antagonize these corticosteroid-mediated induction. Conclusion(s): This in vitro study describes an upregulation of CTGF expression in H441 lung epithelial cells by infection with RSV and by corticosteroids. In addition, caffeine was able to abrogate these negative effects of corticosteroids and RSV. Should this effect of RSV infection, steroid and caffeine on CTGF expression be also seen in vivo, caffeine might help to restore normal lung physiology during infection with RSV and may serve as an additional medication to steroids.

AB  - Introduction: Lung inflammation in premature infants contributes to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease with long-term sequelae. Pilot clinical trials administering the corticosteroid budesonide suspended in surfactant have found reduced BPD without apparent adverse effects as occur with systemic dexamethasone therapy. The objective of this study was to determine potency, stability and anti-inflammatory effects of budesonide in vitro to inform design of an appropriate dosing regimen of lung-targeted corticosteroid therapy for future clinical trials. Material(s) and Method(s): We used cultured explants of second trimester human fetal lung treated with either budesonide or dexamethasone and examined responses by microscopy, immunoassays, RNAseq, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and pulsating bubble surfactometry. Clinical cases and summary results: Treatment of lung explants with budesonide suppressed secreted chemokines IL-8 and CCL2 (MCP-1) within 4 h reaching 90% decrease at 12 h, which was fully reversed 72 h after removal of steroid. Half-maximal effects occurred at 0.04- 0.05 nM, representing a 5-fold greater potency than for dexamethasone. Budesonide significantly induced 3.6% and repressed 2.8% of 14 500 sequenced mRNAs by 1.6- to 95-fold, including 119 genes that contribute to the glucocorticoid inflammatory transcriptome, 29 of these genes are known targets of NF-kappaB. By global proteomics, 22 secreted inflammatory proteins were hormonally regulated. Budesonide retained activity in the presence of surfactant and did not alter the in vitro surface properties or stability of surfactant. There was some formation of palmitate-budesonide in lung tissue, which serves as a tissue reservoir of steroid, but no detectable metabolism to inactive 16alpha-hydroxy prednisolone. Conclusion(s): We conclude that budesonide is a potent and stable antiinflammatory glucocorticoid in human fetal lung in vitro. The study provides new findings for molecular effects of budesonide that define the glucocorticoid inflammatory transcriptome, identify new potential biomarkers for both budesonide action in lung cells and the pathogenesis of BPD, and inform design of the optimal budesonide:- surfactant treatment regimen for clinical trials to prevent lung disease in premature infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common lung disease of premature infants, with devastating consequences. As no therapy for BPD exists, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory protein C (PC) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) prevent murine BPD. BPD was precipitated by perinatal inflammation (intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide to pregnant dams) followed by postnatal exposure of pups to hyperoxia (65% or 85% O2). Pups were treated daily with PC, IL-1Ra (10mg/kg or 100mg/kg), or vehicle (up to 28d). Vehicle animals in hyperoxia developed severe BPD (alveolar number and gas exchange-area decreased <= 60%, alveolar size increased 4-fold). PC and IL-1Ra prevented structural lung damage in 65%, but not 85% O2. Significant lung improvement was observed in mice treated with 10mg/kg of IL-1Ra immediately after birth compared to vehicle-treated hyperoxia group (p < 0.001) and in comparison to IL-1Ra (100mg/kg) and the delayed treatment with IL-1Ra (p < 0.05). Perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia each triggered distinct pulmonary immune responses (20-fold increase), some reduced (<= 94%) by PC or IL-1Ra or both. Pulmonary inflammatory mediators IL-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and TREM-1, was found to play a critical role in murine BPD. Although the effectiveness of administering IL-1Ra to prevent alveolar lung damage is dose and timing dependent, our findings show that IL-1Ra and PC protect the lungs of newborn mice from detrimental effects of hyperoxia and perinatal inflammation by attenuating the pulmonary immune response. Therefore, these two antiinflammatory drugs could fundamentally change the prognosis of premature infants by treating or preventing the currently irremediable BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic disease of extreme prematurity that has serious longterm consequences including increased asthma risk. We earlier identified Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) as a potent inhibitor of murine BPD induced by combining perinatal inflammation (intra-peritoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide to pregnant dams) and exposure of pups to hyperoxia (FiO2 0.65). The aim of this study was to determine whether airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness similar to asthma are evident in this model, and whether IL-1Ra is protective. Pups received daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle or 10mg/kg IL-1Ra. At 28d, lungs were prepared for histology and morphometry of alveoli and airways, or inflated with agarose to prepare lung slices to visualise ex vivo airway contraction and relaxation by phase-contrast microscopy. Pups reared in hyperoxia developed a severe BPD-like lung disease, with fewer, larger alveoli, and increased subepithelial collagen and airway alpha-smooth muscle actin. Following hyperoxia, methacholine elicited contraction with similar potency but increased maximum reduction in lumen area (air 44%; hyperoxia 89%), and the dilator potency of salbutamol was reduced. IL-1Ra treatment prevented hyperoxia-induced alveolar disruption and airway fibrosis, but surprisingly not the increase in methacholine-induced airway contraction. The current study is the first to demonstrate ex vivo airway hyperreactivity and impaired dilator responsiveness caused by perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia and reveals further preclinical mechanistic insights of IL-1Ra as a treatment for BPD.

AB  - Objective Twin pregnancies are associated with increased perinatal mortality and morbidity. We have recently demonstrated that discordance in estimated fetal weight (EFW) and cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) are independent predictors of perinatal loss in twin pregnancy, and that their combination can identify the majority of such pregnancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the prediction of neonatal morbidity in twin pregnancies using discordance in fetal biometry and Doppler. Study design A cohort study of twin pregnancies born at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation in a tertiary centre. The EFW, umbilical artery (UA) pulsatility index (PI), middle cerebral artery (MCA) PI, CPR and their discordance were recorded at the last ultrasound assessment before delivery. Pregnancies complicated by major structural abnormalities, chromosomal abnormalities, genetic syndromes, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS) were excluded. The primary outcome was a composite consisting of one or more of: neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, culture-proven sepsis, stage 2 or 3 necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, grade 3/4 intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify and adjust for potential confounders. Predictive accuracy was assessed using ROC curve analysis. Results The study included 561 twin pregnancies (1119 fetuses). Composite neonatal morbidity complicated 114 (10.2%) pregnancies. The gestational age (GA) at delivery (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.42-0.58, P < 0.001), EFW discordance (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P = 0.007), CPR discordance (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96- 0.99, P < 0.001) and chorionicity (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.31-0.90, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of neonatal morbidity, even after adjusting for confounding variables. The combination of GA at delivery, EFW and CPR discordance had significantly better predictive performance (AUC: 0.68, 95% CI 0.64-0.73) than each individual variable or the combination of EFW centile and GA at delivery (P < 0.01 for all). Conclusion EFW discordance and CPR discordance are independent predictors of the risk of neonatal morbidity in twin pregnancies born at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation.

AB  - Cell proliferation and migration have been shown to be regulated by actin dynamics/cytoskeletal remodeling. Profilin1, cofilin1 and VASP (phosphorylated at serine-157 (pVASP-S157) or serine-239 (pVASP-S239)) are the major regulators of actin remodeling within the cell. Infants that develop Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) exhibit decreased alveolarization resulting from altered cellular proliferation and migration during septal formation. Using our mouse model of BPD, we tested the hypothesis that changes in expression and cellular localization of profilin1, cofilin1 and phosphorylated VASP play a key role in decreases in secondary septal formation and thus alveolarization. Human lung autopsy tissues from infants that died with BPD or controls were assessed for total F-actin content and expression of profilin1, colfilin1, and phosphorylated VASP by immunofluorescence. Lung tissues were obtained from our murine model of maternal LPS exposure followed by 7 days of 85% hyperoxia. Murine tissues were harvested at 7 days of life and lung homogenates were assessed for profilin1, colfilin1, and VASP phosphorylation by western blot. A significant decrease in F-actin content, pVASP-157, pVASP-S239, and profilin1 and an increase in cofilin1 were observed in BPD tissues compared to controls. Western blots from lung tissue homogenates indicated increases in cofilin1, profilin1, and pVASP-S239 but a decrease pVASP-S157 at 7 days. In conclusion, we propose that these alterations in expression and phosphorylation of ABP may be contributing to the decrease in cell migration and septal formation in immature lungs injured by hyperoxia exposure. The differences between the findings in humans and mice are likely to be due to the early age of the mice, prior to onset of severe symptoms. Further investigations are needed to define the specific cell types affected and the role of actin binding proteins in lung development.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species contribute to the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic pulmonary disorders, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a respiratory condition affecting preterm infants. BPD treatment often involves respiratory support with high O2, and oxidative stress is an adverse effect associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Genetic polymorphisms in a few candidate genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood. Understanding the role of genetics is critical to improving treatment strategies and reducing oxidant injury in developing lungs. We developed a neonatal mouse model to mimic many features of BPD, and utilized genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of quantitative phenotypes to identify susceptibility genes for neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. One day after birth, neonatal mice from 29 inbred strains were exposed for 72 hr to normoxia (room air, 20% O2) or hyperoxia (>95% O2). Hyperoxia induced phenotypes (inflammatory cells/histopathology) that are similar to BPD when compared to normal postnatal lung development in normoxia. We also measured hyperoxia-induced lesions in nuclear (nuc) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA, and mitochondrial copy number from lung homogenates. Significant inter-strain variation was found for mtDNA and nucDNA lesions after normoxia and hyperoxia. GWA mapping identified significant quantitative trait loci for mtDNA lesions, nucDNA lesions, and mitochondrial copy number after normoxia and for hyperoxia. We ultra-deep sequenced neonatal lung mtDNA from mice exposed to normoxia and hyperoxia and found 385 sequence variations in wild-derived PWD/PhJ inbred mice compared to reference C57BL/6J mice. Higher variation frequency (1/32 bases) was found in the D-loop region compared to the rest of the mitochondrial genome (1/42 bases). There was also more heteroplasmy in PWD/PhJ mice compared to C57BL/6J. We found five haplotype groups among 27 strains that were sequenced, with classical inbred strains in haplotype 1, NZB and NZO mice in haplotype 2, and PWD/PhJ and PWK/PhJ mice in haplotype 3. Wild derived strains had more variation than classical inbred strains. We conclude that exposure to low (20%) and high (>95%) concentrations of oxygen early in life cause lesions in mouse lung mtDNA and nucDNA that are strain dependent. Ultra-deep sequencing identified mtDNA sequence variation and differences in heteroplasmy and indels across inbred mouse strains that associate with disease phenotypes. Through these combined approaches, we have identified novel candidate susceptibility genes that may improve our understanding of neonatal lung injury and development.

AB  - Objective Preeclampsia (PreE) is a complex syndrome with multiple pathophysiologic triggers and mechanisms affecting 3-8% of pregnancies. PreE is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity & mortality that is characterized by de novo development of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. PreE has a significant link to alterations of placental stress and apoptotic factors that pass to the offspring. We assessed the comparison of pregnancy outcomes between patients with and without preE. Methods We recruited 20 normal pregnant (NP) and 20 PreE consenting patients after deliveries in an IRB approved prospective study from Scott & White Hospital, Temple, Texas. We evaluated the following parameters for mothers; age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressures, proteinuria, gestational age at delivery. Placental thickness and volumes and stress signaling proteins; p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38 MAPK), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Bcl-2-associated-X protein (Bax), anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 were measured by western blotting. We also evaluated babies for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), gestational age at birth, anthropometric measurements including ponderal index (PI), length of hospitalization and complications like hypoglycemia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Comparisons were performed using Student's t test. Results The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were higher in preE (SBP 166 +/- 11; DBP 92 +/- 12) compared to normal pregnancies (SBP 122 +/- 10; DBP 72 +/- 9; p = 0.001 for each case). PreE mothers had higher urinary protein excretion (457mg/24h +/- 140) compared to NP (160 mg/24h +/- 44; p = 0.002). We did not find any difference in maternal ages & BMI, placental thickness and placental volumes between the two groups. The average gestational age at delivery was lower in preE (36.2 weeks +/- 2.7) compared to NP (38.8 weeks +/- 1; p = 0.017). Average hospital stay for preE babies were longer (20 days +/- 25) compared to NP (2 days +/- 1; p = 0.0019). No complications were reported for NP babies; however, preE babies had multiple complications like hypoglycemia, RDS, BPD, ROP, IVH, Infections and GERD. The birth weights of the preE babies were much lower (2672gms +/- 727) than the NP babies (3345gms +/- 451; p = 0.027) indicating the IUGR. The preE babies were small for gestational age with lower PI (2.46 +/- 0.3) when compare to the NP babies (2.95 +/- 0.2; p = 0.0004). The placental stress signaling proteins p38 MAPK, COX-2 and Bax/Bcl-2 were up-regulated in preE compared to normal pregnancy (p<0.05, in each case). Conclusions PreE alters the intrauterine environment and activates the detrimental signaling that is transported to fetus resulting in premature deliveries, IUGR babies and their related complications with extended hospitalization. The detrimental signaling molecules that have been overexpressed in preE patients raises the possibility that those signals could be therapeutically blocked one day.

AB  - Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting pre-term infants characterized by decreased alveolarization and impaired vascular development, and may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and subsequent right ventricular dysfunction. Currently, little is known about the long-term cardiac outcomes of individuals with BPD. The aim of this project is to evaluate markers of autophagy and apoptosis in the right ventricle of aged rats exposed to brief postnatal hyperoxia. We hypothesize that the right ventricle from rats exposed to postnatal hyperoxia will demonstrate decreased or impaired autophagy with age. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either 85% oxygen (HYP) (n=12, 6 males) or 21% oxygen (CTL) (n=8, 3 males) for 14 days within 12 hours following birth. After 14 days, these animals were allowed to age out for one year in room air. At one year, the rats were sacrificed and tissues collected. Markers of autophagy and apoptosis (BCL2, Bax, Beclin-1, LC3B, LAMP2, and P62) in the right ventricle were evaluated using Western Blot analysis. Statistical analysis was done via t-test. Results Aged HYP rats demonstrate a persistent right ventricular hypertrophy, with the right ventricle to left ventricle plus septum ratio significantly elevated compared to CTL rats (0.21 +/- 0.02 CTL versus 0.25 +/- 0.03 HYP, p=0.002). Beclin-1, a protein necessary for nucleation of autophagosomes, is significantly upregulated in HYP as compared to CTL (46580+/-1405 CTL HYP versus 34633+/-3008, p=.004). LC3B, a protein needed for elongation of autophagosomes, is significantly downregulated in HYP rats than in CTL rats (.036 +/- .001 HYP versus .052 +/-.006 CTL, p=.01). Lamp2, a membrane bound lysosomal protein needed for phagosomal and autophagsomal maturation, is significantly downregulated in HYP compared to CTL (.01 +/- .0008 HYP versus .017 +/- .001 CTL, p=.001). p62 and Bax were not significantly different in the right ventricles of HYP as compared to CTL. Conclusion The purpose of this study was to determine if there are effects of post-natal hyperoxic exposure in the right ventricle at one year of age. We found that the elevated Fulton Index persists which has previously been associated with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. The significant upregulation of beclin-1 in the aged HYP right ventricles suggests that there is an increase in autophagic activation. However, the downregulation of LC3B and LAMP2 in HYP may represent impaired phagosomal maturation and an accumulation of autophagosomes consistent with impaired completion of autophagy. The data suggests that while there is significant right ventricular hypertrophy and an upregulation of autophagic activation, this autophagy may not be completed in rats exposed to hyperoxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Variability in the incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) among premature infants suggests that genetic susceptibility plays a role in pathogenesis. An assessment of copy number variants (CNV) in BPD subjects may help to identify loci that harbor genetic susceptibility factors., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical DNA microarray data from our institution. We identified 19 BPD subjects, and 2 controls groups (full-term and preterm) with no lung-related disease. We reanalyzed raw data from each of these subjects to identify recurrent CNV loci in BPD subjects., RESULTS: We identified three loci (at 11q13.2, 16p13.3, and 22q11.23-q12.1) with recurrent CNV in BPD subjects. The frequency of these CNV was significantly higher in BPD subjects when compared with at least one control group. We interrogated 21 genes residing within the recurrent CNV regions for development-associated changes in expression. Fifteen genes demonstrated significant changes in expression between the pseudoglandular and canalicular stage in human lungs, a time commensurate with birth at highest risk for BPD. We also identified pathways represented by the genes present within the recurrent loci., CONCLUSION: These data identify novel loci that may harbor genes contributing to the genetic susceptibility of BPD.

AB  - Pulmonary vasodilatation at birth underlies the fetal transition to lung breathing. Failure to vasodilate causes persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn, persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia-related hypoxia, often with dire consequences. The mechanism of pulmonary vasodilatation at birth is poorly understood. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) isolated from 4th and 5th order resistance vessels of ovine near-term fetus exhibited resting membrane potentials 8 mV more depolarized than adult (P<0.05), consistent with vasoconstriction. Whole-cell Kv current densities for voltage-clamped fetal and adult PASMCs were similar. In contrast, large-conductance, calcium-activated K+ (BK) channel current densities for fetal cells were significantly lower than adult at +20 to +60 mV, but equal to adult at higher potentials. By Western immunoblots, fetal PASMCs expressed twice the pore-forming BKalpha subunit protein as adult, but only half as much accessary BKbeta subunit. By flow cytometry, cell surface betal expression was also significantly lower in fetal PASMCs. Since optimal BK channel activity occurs at 1:1 beta-to-alpha stoichiometry, our results suggested the near-term fetus expressed BK beta:alpha ratios about 1/4 that of adult. These findings suggest near-term fetal PASMCs are more depolarized than adult due to lower BK activity and lower BKbeta subunit expression. In agreement with BKalpha protein levels, BKalpha mRNA levels were two-fold higher in near-term fetus than in adult by qRT-PCR. However, in contrast to BKbeta protein levels, BKbeta mRNA levels were two-fold higher in near-term fetus than adult. These findings suggest that BKbeta mRNA levels may be poised to express higher levels of BKbeta protein at birth in order to enhance BK channel activity and promote pulmonary vasodilatation upon transition to lung breathing.

AB  - Endothelial cell apoptosis is an early event in the development of inflammatory lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In studies utilizing cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells we have shown that the Src family tyrosine kinase (STK) yes activated caspase-3, while the STK fyn inhibited caspase-3 activation. Therefore, in this study we tested the hypothesis that mice deficient in fyn will have more severe lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary apoptosis and lung injury than will similarly treated wild-type mice. Wild-type and fyn-/- mice (all on the same 129S1/SvImJ background) were given LPS 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally or saline for 24 hours and lungs were harvested for determination of proteins related to apoptosis. LPS treatment resulted in greater levels of cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and p21 in the lungs from fyn-/- mice than in the lungs from wild-type mice. In a second set of studies, lung sections from wild-type and fyn-/- mice were stained for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), we found that the fyn-/- mice had less PECAM-1 expression, thicker alveolar septa, and more leukocyte infiltration than did wild-type mice. In another set of studies wild-type and fyn-/- mice were given LPS 2 mg/kg intratracheally or an equal volume of saline, and 24 hours later lung mechanics were measured using a Flexivent system (SCIREQ, Montreal, Canada). The fyn-/- mice had significantly (p<0.01) lower lung compliance (0.030 +/- 0.003 ml/cmH2O) than did wild-type mice (0.040 +/- 0.001 ml/cmH2O). The fyn-/- mice also had significantly (p<0.05) higher tissue elastance (32.6 +/- 3.1 cmH2O/mL) than did wild-type mice (23.8 +/- 0.8 cmH2O/mL). The fyn-/- mice had greater (p = 0.046) lung resistance (0.67+/-0.06 cmH2O/ml/s) than did wild-type mice (0.55+/-0.02 cmH2O/ml/s). These results demonstrate that mice lacking fyn develop more apoptosis and more severe lung injury following LPS exposure than do wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that fyn is an important negative regulator of LPS-induced apoptosis and the resultant lung injury in a mouse model of inflammatory lung diseases such as ARDS.

AB  - Introduction/Aims: Higher survival rates of extremely preterm babies are associated with an increasing incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and multiple complications including airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and asthma. In a mouse BPD model combining perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia, interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) was shown to be a major driver of impaired alveolar development (Nold et al., PNAS 2013). The aim of this study was to test the effects of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra (Anakinra), in this model, examining airway remodelling and contractile responses associated with AHR. Method(s): Pregnant C57BL/6J dams received 150 mug/kg lipopolysaccharide or saline i.p. at 14 d gestation.Within 24 h of birth, pups were randomized to normoxic (N, 21% O2) or hyperoxic (H, 65% O2) conditions and treated daily for 28 days with IL-1Ra or saline. Lung sections were analysed for alveolar changes, epithelial thickening, subepithelial collagen and expression of the contractile protein alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared to visualize changes in intrapulmonary airway area to methacholine (MCh) by phase-contrast microscopy. Result(s): Hyperoxic mice developed a severe BPD-like lung disease (60% fewer alveoli, 4-fold increase in alveolar size). Epithelial thickness, subepithelial collagen and alpha-SMA expression increased in airways following hyperoxia. MCh elicited contraction with similar potency in both groups (pEC50: N 7.4 +/- 0.4, n = 6; H 7.2 +/- 0.2, n = 7), but increased maximum following hyperoxia (% reduction in airway area: N 44 +/- 10; H 89 +/- 10; P < 0.05). IL- 1Ra treatment normalized alveolar development and reduced epithelial/subepithelial changes but did not prevent up-regulation of alpha-SMAor increased contraction to MCh. Conclusion(s): This mouse model mimics key features of BPD, namely, increased alveolar disruption, airway fibrosis and AHR. IL-1Ra may be a novel treatment to prevent lung damage and remodelling in BPD; however, alternative therapeutic targets need to be identified to limit the increased airway contraction and associated respiratory consequences in premature infants.

AB  - Objectives and study: Human milk is the optimal food for human infants, including infants born prematurely. In the event that a mother of a hospitalized infant cannot provide breast milk, donor milk is considered an acceptable alternative. It is known that the macronutrient composition of donor milk is different than human milk, with variable fat content and protein content lower than mature milk. However, much less is known about the micronutrient content of donor milk, including nutritional antioxidants. There is increasing evidence that links early exposure to oxidative stress with potentially lifelong consequences. The premature infant is especially susceptible to damage from oxidative stress for two reasons: 1). Adequate concentrations of antioxidants may be absent at birth; 2). The ability to increase synthesis of antioxidants is impaired. This can lead to an increased risk for the development of oxidative stress-induced diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and periventricular leukomalacia. Therefore, it is critical in premature infants to ensure an adequate supply of dietary antioxidants. The objective of this analysis was to compare the nutritional antioxidant profile of different types of feedings for premature infants, including samples of maternal breast milk collected during neonatal hospitalization and pasteurized pooled donor milk. Method(s): Samples of breast milk from 12 mothers of infants hospitalized in the Newborn Intensive care until were collected and analyzed for concentrations of nutritional antioxidants, including alphacarotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein+zeaxanthin, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol. Additionally, a homogenized sample of donor milk available from a commercial milk bank, a premature infant formula, and a transitional infant formula were also analyzed. Concentrations of nutritional antioxidants were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Result(s): Mean concentrations of the nutritional antioxidants are shown in the following table: (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Compared to breast milk collected from mothers of hospitalized infants, commercially available donor milk had 18-53% of the nutritional antioxidant content of maternal breast milk. As donor milk is becoming a common nutritional intervention for the high risk preterm infant the nutritional antioxidant status of donor milk fed premature infants and their adverse outcomes related to oxidative stress, may merit further investigation.

AB  - IL-33 is an IL-1 cytokine family member that promotes inflammatory responses via activation of many immune cell types. IL-33 is expressed in epithelial barrier tissues such as lung epithelium under both resting and inflammatory conditions. Secreted IL-33 plays an important role in type 2 innate immunity and adaptive immune responses. To characterize the roles of IL-33 in tissue and immune homeostasis in lung epithelium, we generated a novel transgenic mouse in which IL-33 was overexpressed only in lung epithelial cells driven by the tetracycline-sensitive Club cell secretory protein (CCSP) promoter. When IL-33 expression was induced in adult mice, overexpression of IL-33 protein approximately 3-fold above normal levels produced no pathological or immunological changes in the lungs. However, these animals developed significant increases in innate type 2 immune responses when exposed to natural or model allergens. When IL-33 expression was induced in pre- and post-natal mice, these mice had increased mortality, which was accompanied by lung hemorrhage and lung lobe malformation without detectable signs of inflammation and immune responses. Furthermore, IL-33 transgenic mice that survived to adulthood exhibited simplified and enlarged alveoli resembling bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Correspondingly, the epithelial cells from IL-33 transgenic mice displayed altered expression of genes involved in tissue and hematological system development. These data indicate dual effects of IL-33 overexpression depending on the developmental stage of the lungs, namely impairment of lung morphogenesis in the neonatal period and heightened sensitivity of innate type 2 immunity in adult mice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in composite perinatal outcomes in patients with preeclampsia one year after implementation of the 2013 ACOG Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy guidelines which eliminated proteinuria as a criterion for preeclampsia diagnosis METHODS: A nested cohort study from November 2012 to November 2014 using a perinatal data repository at a large tertiary care center. The composite perinatal outcome was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), culture proven neonatal sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) or fetal or neonatal death. Between group comparisons were made using Chi square analysis. The mean gestational age at delivery was compared before and after implementation of the guidelines using the student's t test. RESULT(S): There was no significant change in the composite adverse perinatal outcomes, however there was a significant decrease in the rates of preeclampsia and NICU admission. (Table presented) CONCLUSION(S): The implementation of the new guidelines, in the absence of other practice changes, did not have a significant effect on neonatal outcome.

AB  - Background: Cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH) is a ribosomopathy characterized by hypoplastic anemia, immune deficiency, short-limbed dwarfism, hypoplastic hair, and increased risk of malignancy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is curative for the hematologic and immunologic manifestations of CHH. Limited data is available regarding the use of unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in CHH. In this single center retrospective review, UCBT outcomes for 6 patients with CHH are reported. Method(s): The records of all patients who underwent UCBT for CHH at Duke University Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program were reviewed. Information regarding patient demographics, diagnosis, cord blood unit (CBU) characteristics, graft-related outcomes, and immune reconstitution was collected. Descriptive statistics were performed. Result(s): Six children underwent UCBT for CHH from 1996 to 2013. All patients had short-limbed dwarfism and combined immunodeficiency. RMRP gene mutations were noted in 4 patients. Pre-transplant comorbidities included neutropenia (n = 2), hypoplastic and immune hemolytic anemias (n = 3), recurrent infections/chronic lung disease (n = 5) including CMV viremia and mycobacterium avium infection, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity (n = 1). Median age at transplant was 3.1 years (range 0.3-13.4). Four patients received myeloablative (MA) conditioning with busulfan/cyclophosphamide/anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Two patients received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) using thiotepa/ATG or alemtuzumab/fludarabine/melphalan/thiotepa/hydroxyurea. CBUs were human leukocyte antigen matched at 6 (n = 1), 5 (n = 4) or 4 (n = 1) loci. Median infused nucleated cell dose was 14.5 x 107/kg (range 5.4- 26.5). Median neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred at 16 days (range 12-27) and 70 days (range 64-124), respectively. Two patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), grades I and III; no extensive chronic GvHD was observed. Four patients were fully engrafted with donor chimerism. Autologous recovery occurred in the 2 patients who received RIC. Both subsequently underwent successful unrelated bone marrow transplantation. One patient died 4 months post-UCBT due to pulmonary toxicity and venoocclusive disease. The remaining 5 (83%) are alive and well with predominantly donor chimerism (median >=98%, range 61 - >=98) and normal immune function without recurrent infections at a median follow-up of 5.4 years (range 3.1-18.6). Conclusion(s): We report a cohort of patients who underwent UCBT for CHH. Rejection occurred with a RIC regimen. UCBT with MA conditioning for CHH provides an acceptable alternative for patients without matched related donors and results in excellent survival and sustained immune reconstitution. UCBT should be considered for pediatric patients with CHH lacking matched donors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal tobacco use has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but most available data pertain to singleton gestations. We aim to quantify perinatal risks associated with maternal smoking status in twin gestations. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate 17-OH progesterone (17- OHP) in twin gestations to prevent preterm birth (PTB). Exposure was tobacco use during pregnancy. Primary outcome was gestational age at delivery (EGA). Secondary outcomes were indication for delivery, mode of delivery, birthweight, gestational diabetes (GDM), preeclampsia, markers of neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality. Descriptive statistics were generated. We performed univariate and multivariable regression to determine the potential association between primary outcome and smoking status. Results were considered significant if p<.05. RESULT(S): There were 1316 women included in the analysis: 138 who smoked during pregnancy, 1178 who did not. Women who smoked were significantly different by age, race, BMI, type of conception, parity, previous PTB, cervical length at 24 weeks gestation, and marital status. In the univariate analyses, there was no statistical difference in EGA (p=.17). There was a statistical difference in csection as mode of delivery (p=.05) by smoking status. This difference was statistically significant in adjusted models (p=.0006). In univariate analyses, statistically significant differences were seen in rates of Stage 3-4 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP, p=.01), mean birthweight (mean BW, p=.02), low birthweight (LBW, p=.0042), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, p=.0045) by smoking status. Only mean BWremained statistically significant after controlling for potential confounders (ROP, p=.89; mean BW, p=.02; LBW, p=.056; BPD, p=.90). No significant differences were seen in GDM, pre-eclampsia, or neonatal mortality. CONCLUSION(S): This data shows an increased rate of c-section and decreased mean BW among twin gestations in women who smoke.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common type of chronic lung disease in infancy, for which no effective therapy is currently available. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of treatment with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in combination with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on BPD-induced mouse lung injury, and discuss the underlying mechanism. The BPD model was established by the exposure of neonatal mice to continuous high oxygen exposure for 14 days, following which 1x106 BMSCs and 5,000 U/kg rHuEPO were injected into the mice 1 h prior to and 7 days following exposure to hyperoxia. The animals received four treatments in total (n=10 in each group). After 14 days, the body weights, airway structure, and levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected using histological and immunohistochemical analyses. The effect on cell differentiation was observed by examining the presence of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) and VEGF using immunofluorescence. Compared with the administration of BMSCs alone, the body weight, airway structure, and the levels of MMP-9 and VEGF were significantly improved in the BMSCs/rHuEPO group. The results of the present study demonstrated that the intravenous injection of BMSCs significantly improved lung damage in the hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mouse model. Furthermore, the injection of BMSCs in combination with intraperitoneal injection of rHuEPO had a more marked effect, compared with BMSCs alone, and the mechanism may be mediated by the promoting effects of BMSCs and EPO. The results of the present study provided information, which may assist in future clinical trials.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between umbilical cord blood interleukin (IL)-6 concentration and preterm morbidity and mortality in premature infants born with fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS). Method(s): This prospective, observational study included 84 preterm infants with a gestational age of 24-36 weeks who had been admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). FIRS was defined as umbilical cord blood IL-6 > 11 pg/mL. In premature infants with FIRS, morbidities (multiple organ failure [MOF], respiratory distress syndrome [RDS], patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity) and death were evaluated. Critical umbilical cord blood IL-6 concentrations for the development of RDS, death, and for MOF were determined in premature infants with FIRS. Result(s): Fifty-two infants with IL-6 concentration > 11 pg/mL constituted the FIRS group. Thirty-two infants without FIRS served as a control group. RDS, MOF, and mortality were significantly higher in the FIRS group (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.005, respectively). Umbilical cord blood IL-6 concentration > 26.7 pg/mL in the FIRS group was found to be predictive of RDS, with 70% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Umbilical cord blood IL-6 concentration > 37.7 pg/mL was found to be predictive of death, with 78.6% sensitivity and 60% specificity. The predictive value of IL-6 for the development of MOF was 17.5 pg/mL, with 91% sensitivity and 66% specificity. Conclusion(s): Umbilical cord blood IL-6 concentration > 26.7, 37.7, and 17.5 pg/mL in premature infants with FIRS was found to be predictive for RDS, death, and MOF, respectively.Copyright © 2015 Japan Pediatric Society

AB  - Introduction: Vascular malformations are anomalies caused by errors in the embryonic differentiation including a large number of diseases of the venous and lymphatic capillary network. They are rare (0.05-3%), and are classified according to their basic structural components (capillary, venous, lymphatic, arterial and combined forms) Case description: Three-months-old boy, was admitted with respiratory distress; and medical history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic malnutrition, both treated with unknown manage. During the physical examination he was found: with poor general condition, atrial murmur grade IV and bilateral crackles on auscultation. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the chest were taken; which they revealed polyhedral images in mediastinum and right chest; as well as cardiac silhouette shifted. It was performed chest CT; in where multiple intrapulmonary air cysts in the middle lobe were observed; just as in previous and basal segments of the lower lobe of the right lung lesions rounded morphology. It was made right middle lobectomy. Pathologic findings reported cellular elements compatible with hemangio-lymphangioma. Conclusion(s): Despite its "benign" histological quality, the hemangiolynphangioms are relate to severe deformity of cavity and limbs, due to the high capacity to invade locally organs and adjacent tissues (muscle, bone and soft tissue), accompanied by growth fast and high probability of local recurrence. Therefore, generally associated symptoms are mainly mechanical nature and depend on the damage to adjacent tissue, anatomic location of the lesion and the samesize.Copyright © 2016 Sociedad Medica del Hospital General de Mexico.

AB  - Objective: To determine the cause and disease pattern of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the secondary care neonatal unit of a district hospital. Study Design: Descriptive prospective study. Setting(s): Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital, Sec 16, Chandigarh. This hospital is providing optimal neonatal Level 2 care. Participant(s): All neonates who born in General Hospital Sec 16, Chandigarh, over 1 year were enrolled in the study. Outside born neonates and those who were re-admitted in the neonatal nursery after their discharge from hospital were excluded from the study. Method(s): All consecutive live-born babies in the period of 1-year were included in the study. Babies received in labor room or operation theater were assigned Apgar score, and vital parameters were recorded. Sick babies were shifted to neonatal nursery as per admission policy, and rest of the babies were shifted with mother. All the babies were examined within 24 h of birth and daily thereafter till their discharge from the hospital. Main Outcome Measure(s): Antenatal and postnatal services, maternal education. Result(s): There were 6509 live births, of which 50 were twin pairs and 6409 were singleton birth. About 4.33% babies were born prematurely (<37 weeks), 21.7% babies were low birth weight (LBW) (<2500 g) including 0.4% very LBW (VLBW) babies (<1500 g), and 0.26% as extra LBW (ELBW) (<1000 g) babies. Five hundred and ninety-two (9.09%) babies were suffered from various morbidities, and 67 (1.03%) died during the hospital stay. Hyperbilirubinemia (7%) was the leading cause of neonatal morbidity followed by sepsis (3.99%) and respiratory distress (3.9%) among the various causes of respiratory distress transient tachypnea of the newborn was the leading cause (33%) followed meconium aspiration syndrome (20.5%) and pneumonia (14.9%). Hyaline membrane disease was seen in 11.8% of cases. Congenital malformations were seen in 1.75% of cases. Limb defects (31.3%) were the most common malformation followed by cardiac 49.9%, neural tube defect (13.9%), and Down syndrome 7.8%. Birth asphyxia (29.85%) and respiratory distress (22.38%) were the leading cause of death followed by extreme prematurity (22.3%) and sepsis (14.9%). Morbidity and mortality among LBW babies (22.3% and 3.53%) and ELBW (100% and 88%) and VLBW (84.6% and 46.2%) were higher as compared to normal birth weights (5.44% and 0.33%). Morbidity and mortality among preterm babies (58.5% and 11.7%) were high as compared to term babies (6.97% and 0.53%). Morbidity was higher among large for date babies (41%) as compared to small for date (SFD) (17.7%) and appropriate for date (AFD) (6.8%) babies higher mortality was seen in SFD babies (1.9%) as compared to 0.8% in AFD babies. Conclusion(s): Hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis, and respiratory distress were the leading causes of morbidity in our study. Birth asphyxia, prematurity, and neonatal sepsis were the leading causes of neonatal mortality in our study. Interventions to reduce preterm delivery, LBW, and birth asphyxia should be planned and implemented by health-care managers at the community level. Improvements in neonatal care at different levels will definitely reduce the neonatal deaths.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the changes and mechanisms of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) in the lung tissues of neonatal rats with intrauterine infection (II). Method(s): The pregnant rats were divided into the intrauterine infection group (group LPS) and the control group (group NS). The rats in group LPS were intraperitoneally injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish the II animal model; the neonatal rats of the two groups were selected on D1, D3, D7, and D14 after birth for the HE staining and radiation alveolar count (RAC); meanwhile, the protein expression and mRNA quantification of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the lung tissues were detected. Result(s): Group LPS showed significantly increased infiltration of alveolar inflammatory cells and decreased RAC than group NS. The protein and mRNA expressions of MMP-9 in group LPS were significantly higher than group NS on D3, D7, and D14, and those expressions in group LPS showed no significant difference. The protein and mRNA expressions of TIMP-1 in group LPS were gradually increased after birth, and showed significant difference with group NS on D3, D7, and D14. Conclusion(s): The post-II expressions of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the lung tissues of the neonatal rats were significantly increased, and its imbalance might play an important role in repairing lung injuries and abnormalities.Copyright © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Background: Complications which are frequently observed in preterm infants, such as intraventricular hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), are still major determinants of mortality and long-term morbidity. Objective(s): This article gives a review of clinical and genetic risk factors for complications in preterm infants with a birth weight below 1500 g. Material(s) and Method(s): An assessment of published epidemiological data and analysis of the current databank of the German Neonatal Network were carried out. Result(s): During the last 5 years no relevant decline in the prevalence of typical complications has been observed. All complications were associated with unfavorable short-term and long-term outcomes. Clinical risk factors for complications were identified by epidemiological studies; however, the pathophysiology of many complications has not yet been clarified. Genetic studies have failed to identify specific biochemical pathways involved in the occurrence of typical complications. More recent genetic trial designs, such as Mendelian randomization studies, are basically feasible in preterm infants and will hopefully contribute to identification of relevant pathways and biomarkers in the near future. Conclusion(s): The reduction of complications associated with preterm birth will be a major goal in the forthcoming years as this will be one of the few opportunities to achieve a durable reduction in short-term and long-term morbidity.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the role of Vitamin D (VitD) on amelioration of chorioamnionitis-induced alveolarization arrest and possible mechanisms. Method(s): A neonatal rat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model was constructed by intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in pregnant rats. Rats were randomly assigned to the Saline group, LPS+Saline group, LPS+VitD (L) group, and LPS+VitD (H) group. Neonatal rats in the LPS+VitD (L) group and the LPS+VitD (H) group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 and 3 ng/g 1, 25(OH)2D3 respectively once a day for 7 d. Meanwhile, neonatal rats in the Saline group and the LPS+Saline group were intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of normal saline. The pulmonary tissues of neonatal rats were harvested 1, 3, and 7 d after the final injection and were stained by H-E staining for observing pathological changes. The mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and IFN-gamma were detected using real-time PCR. Result(s): Different concentrations of VitD could improve the birth rate of neonatal rats (P=0.003). The LPS+VitD (L) group and the LPS+VitD (H) group had significantly higher alveolar counts (P=0.001, P=0.000), remarkably decreased mean liner intercept (P=0.000), and significantly decreased mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and IFN-gamma as compared with the LPS+Saline group 7 d after birth (P=0.000). Conclusion(s): Administration of VitD can significantly decrease the expressions of IL-1beta and IFN-gamma in lungs of neonatal rats and alleviate the pathological changes of BPD.Copyright © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

AB  - Inflammation and oxidative injury play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). It is a chronic lung disease sternly affecting life-expectancy of premature infants. Due to well-know pharmacological effect of esculin (ES) as anti-oxidant and inflammatory agents, the present study was intended to elucidate its protective effect on hyperoxia-induced lung injury model in newly born rats. Results of the histopathological examination of lung tissues followed by treatment of ES, showed drastic reduction in the smooth muscle actin (SMA) score. Moreover, in biochemical analysis, it reduces the NO and TNF-alpha activities together with improvement in endogeneous antioxidant capacity, i.e., increases the level of GSH and SOD in the hyperoxia group (p < 0.05). Therefore, it has been confirmed that ES exert favorable effects on alveolarization as well as inflammation and oxidative stress markers in the animal model of BPD.Copyright © 2016 Latin American Journal of Pharmacy.

AB  - Purpose Intrauterine infection may induce the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) and may cause cerebral palsy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns. The aim of the study was to evaluate the importance of FIRS for the early and later adaptation of preterms. Methods Hundred and fifty-eight preterm infants, born at 22-34 weeks of gestation, were investigated at Vilnius University Children hospital in 2007-2009. The data were evaluated at the first week after birth and at 36-37 weeks of post conceptual age. The levels of IL-6, tTNF-a (total), tVEGF-A (total), aTNF-a (active) and aVEGF-A (active) were determined. Results Correlation between IL-6 and tTNF-a from umbilical blood and the degree of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was found (p\0.001). The concentration of tTNF-a[345 pg/ml and IL-6[12.7 pg/ml was determined allowing to predict the lethal outcome. Conclusions The correlation between the concentration of the inflammatory markers IL-6 and tTNF-a in umbilical cord blood at 22-34 weeks of gestation and acute RDS, and the death of preterms was determined. Significant values of umbilical cord blood IL-6 and tTNF-a concentration for predicting the lethal outcome in the later adaptation of preterms were determined.Copyright © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

AB  - Objective To compare neurodevelopmental outcomes of extremely preterm infants diagnosed with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) who were treated medically or surgically and those who were not diagnosed with PDA or who did not undergo treatment for PDA. Study design This retrospective population-based cohort study used data from a geographically defined area in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory served by a network of 10 neonatal intensive care units. Patients included all preterm infants born at <29 completed weeks of gestation between 1998 and 2004. Moderate/severe functional disability at 2-3 years corrected age was defined as developmental delay, cerebral palsy requiring AIDS, sensorineural or conductive deafness (requiring bilateral hearing AIDS or cochlear implant), or bilateral blindness (best visual acuity of <6/60). Results Follow-up information at age 2-3 years was available for 1473 infants (74.8%). Compared with infants not diagnosed with a PDA or who did not receive PDA treatment for PDA, those with medically treated PDA (aOR, 1.622; 95% CI, 1.199-2.196) and those with surgically treated PDA (aOR, 2.001; 95% CI, 1.126-3.556) were at significantly greater risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 2-3 years. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that treatment for PDA may be associated with a greater risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at age 2-3 years. This was particularly so among infants born at <25 weeks gestation. These results may support permissive tolerance of PDAs; however, reasons for this association remain to be elucidated through carefully designed prospective trials.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: With improved survival rates, short- and long-term respiratory complications of premature birth are increasing, adding significantly to financial and health burdens in the United States. In response, in May 2010, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded a 5-year $18.5 million research initiative to ultimately improve strategies for managing the respiratory complications of preterm and low birth weight infants. Using a collaborative, multi-disciplinary structure, the resulting Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) seeks to understand factors that correlate with future risk for respiratory morbidity. Methods/Design: The PROP is an observational prospective cohort study performed by a consortium of six clinical centers (incorporating tertiary neonatal intensive care units [NICU] at 13 sites) and a data-coordinating center working in collaboration with the NHLBI. Each clinical center contributes subjects to the study, enrolling infants with gestational ages 23 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks with an anticipated target of 750 survivors at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. In addition, each center brings specific areas of scientific focus to the Program. The primary study hypothesis is that in survivors of extreme prematurity specific biologic, physiologic and clinical data predicts respiratory morbidity between discharge and 1 year corrected age. Analytic statistical methodology includes model-based and non-model-based analyses, descriptive analyses and generalized linear mixed models. Discussion(s): PROP incorporates aspects of NICU care to develop objective biomarkers and outcome measures of respiratory morbidity in the <29 week gestation population beyond just the NICU hospitalization, thereby leading to novel understanding of the nature and natural history of neonatal lung disease and of potential mechanistic and therapeutic targets in at-risk subjects.Copyright © Pryhuber et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Lung inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of premature infants. The challenge in BPD management is the lack of effective and safe antiinflammatory agents. Leukadherin-1 (LA1) is a novel agonist of the leukocyte surface integrin CD11b/CD18 that enhances leukocyte adhesion to ligands and vascular endothelium and thus reduces leukocyte transendothelial migration and influx to the injury sites. Its functional significance in preventing hyperoxiainduced neonatal lung injury is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that administration of LA1 is beneficial in preventing hyperoxiainduced neonatal lung injury, an experimental model of BPD. Newborn rats were exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85%O2) and received twice-daily intraperitoneal injection of LA1 or placebo for 14 days.Hyperoxia exposure in the presence of the placebo resulted in a drastic increase in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the alveolar airspaces. This increased leukocyte influx was accompanied by decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis and increased pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension (PH), the pathological hallmarks of BPD. However, administration of LA1 decreased macrophage infiltration in the lungs during hyperoxia. Furthermore, treatment with LA1 improved alveolarization and angiogenesis and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. These data indicate that leukocyte recruitment plays an important role in the experimental model of BPD induced by hyperoxia. Targeting leukocyte trafficking using LA1, an integrin agonist, is beneficial in preventing lung inflammation and protecting alveolar and vascular structures during hyperoxia. Thus, targeting integrin-mediated leukocyte recruitment and inflammation may provide a novel strategy in preventing and treating BPD in preterm infants.© Copyright 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.

AB  - Very low birth weight infants (VLBW; birth weight<1500g) are exposed to potentially harmful phthalates from medical devices during their hospital stay. We measured urinary phthalate concentrations among hospitalized VLBW infants participating in a nutritional study. Possible associations between different phthalates and birth weight (BW), septicemia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were evaluated. Forty-six VLBW infants were enrolled in this randomized controlled nutritional study. The intervention group (n=24) received increased quantities of energy, protein, fat, essential fatty acids and vitamin A, as compared to the control group (n=22). The concentrations of 12 urinary phthalate metabolites were measured, using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, at 3 time points during the first 5weeks of life. During this study, the levels of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites decreased, whereas an increasing trend was seen regarding metabolites of di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP). Significantly higher levels of phthalate metabolites were seen in infants with lower BW and those diagnosed with late onset septicemia or BPD. A significant positive correlation between the duration of respiratory support and DEHP metabolites was observed (p<=0.01) at 2.9weeks of age. Birth weight was negatively associated with urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations. Infants with lower BW and those diagnosed with septicemia or BPD experienced prolonged exposure from medical equipment containing phthalates, with subsequent higher levels of phthalate metabolites detected.

AB  - Microbes are ubiquitous on the human body and comprise approximately 90% of the cells and 99% of the genes of the human supraorganism. High-throughput sequencing technology has permitted the development of culture-independent means to identify the microbiota that are unique to the various microenvironments of the body and probably contribute some function. Although the respiratory tract interfaces with the environment, the lungs were always thought to be a sterile environment - until recently, when these techniques were applied to healthy and disease states. Further, there appears to be a complex interplay between the development of the gastrointestinal and respiratory microbiota and the regulation of immune function. The contribution of this dynamic metabolic mass to respiratory disease in the newborn is unknown. This article will review emerging data from recent human and murine studies that suggest there is a microbial influence on the development of respiratory disease, but it will also highlight many of the gaps that remain in understanding the function of the respiratory microbiome.Copyright © 2015 S.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication in preterm infants. Clinical prediction of BPD at an early stage in life is difficult. Plasma proendothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) is a lung injury biomarker in pulmonary hypertension and respiratory distress. Objective(s): To assess the prognostic ability of CT-proET-1 in BPD. Method(s): In 227 prospectively enrolled preterm infants born at <32 weeks gestational age (GA), plasma CT-proET-1 was measured at birth, day of life (DOL) 2, 3, 6 and 28, and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). BPD was defined as mild in infants requiring supplemental oxygen at DOL 28 and moderate/severe in those requiring it at 36 weeks PMA. Result(s): The predictive ability of CT-proET-1 for any BPD was poor at birth [area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.654, 95% CI 0.494-0.814], moderate at DOL 2 and 3 (AUC 0.769, 95% CI 0.666-0.872) and excellent at DOL 6 (AUC 0.918, 95% CI 0.840-0.995). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that CT-proET-1 levels at DOL 2, 3, 6 and 28 were strongly related to the duration of oxygen supplementation, independently of GA and the duration of respiratory support. Conclusion(s): CT-proET-1 is a novel promising biomarker for predicting the development of BPD in preterm infants when measured at the end of the first week of life.Copyright © 2015 S.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that depends on supplementary treatment with oxygen at 28 days of life. Mechanical ventilation is the main risk factor to develop this pathology. Objective(s): Identify the frequency of the most common risk factors associated with BPD in patients with such diagnostic. Method(s): This study was observational, retrospective and descriptive. Data was collected from medical records with BPD diagnostic from General Hospital "Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez" between January 2009 to December 2014. 69 patients were sampled. Different variables were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Result(s): 60.9% were males, 15.9% used prenatal steroid therapy, mean gestational age was 32.8 +/- 2.3 weeks, weight birth 1,438.1 +/- 559.9 g, 94.2% required mechanical ventilation with an average of 18.2 days. The most frequent comorbidities were sepsis or pneumonia, anemia, retinopathy of prematurity and intraventricular hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): In this study we found the most frequently associated risk factors to BPD being the prematurity related the most common of them all.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increase in bronchopulmonary dysplasia morbidity in premature infants, which is associated with improved survival. We analyzed the risk factors for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It is known that the most important factors are low gestational age and birth weight, as well as prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and late onset of neonatal infection. Genetic factors can alter the body's ability to withstand oxidative stress and infection. Many candidate genes may participate in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, especially those related to the regulation of the growth of alveoli, the inflammatory response, antioxidant protection and recovery processes of cells. For this study we selected glutathione-S-transferase family genes - GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1. We carried out a retrospective study on the basis of a case-control. The study included 21 prematurely born babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (main group) and 52 premature infants who did not have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (control group). All the children underwent clinical, instrumental and laboratory examination, as well as genetic testing. Polymorphism of the genes in question and various combinations of polymorphic variants do not affect the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and its severity. We have detected the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the indicators that characterize respiratory support, frequency of the use of mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, oxygen therapy, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the duration of non-invasive ventilation, maximum inspiratory pressure and the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the infants under study. We have found a similar indirect effect of genetic polymorphisms on other independent risk factor - late neonatal infections. For proper evaluation of the contribution of genetic polymorphism it is necessary to conduct a preliminary analysis of possible clinical and laboratory parameters to identify strong independent predictors, and then analyze the indirect effects of genetic factors. Further research and development of new approaches to the mechanical lung ventilation regimens in premature infants and consideration of the genetic polymorphisms will create a set of preventive measures and reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2015, Yerevan State Medical University.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the prohepcidin levels in premature newborns with oxygen radical diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity and necrotizing enterocolitis and to compare these levels with those of healthy premature newborns. Eighty premature infants (25-34 weeks gestational age) were enrolled. The patient group was composed of 38 premature babies with oxygen radical diseases, and the control group consisted of 42 healthy premature newborns. Complete blood count, serum iron and ferritin concentrations, iron-binding capacity (IBC), transferrin and prohepcidin levels were measured. The mean ferritin and prohepcidin levels were higher in the patient group than in the control group (p = 0.038 and p = 0.022, respectively). No significant correlations were found between serum prohepcidin levels and iron parameters. We believe that this finding will contribute to a greater understanding of the etiopathogenesis of oxygen radical diseases. There is a need for future studies to explore the link between underlying inflammatory mechanisms and hepcidin in oxygen radical diseases.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - Background: Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of hospitalisation in infants <1 year and might cause severe symptoms in preterm infants. Our aim was to analyse admissions due to respiratory infections in moderate, late and term infants, and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation in preterm versus term. Method(s): Prospective study in a cohort of moderate and late preterm, and term infants born between October/2011 and December/2012. Admissions due to respiratory infections during the first year of life were analysed and compared among moderate (32-33), late (34-36) and term infants. Sixteen respiratory viruses were detected by RT-PCR. Clinical data were collected. Result(s): 30 (20.9%) out of 143 preterm infants required admission for respiratory infection, versus 129 (6.9%) of 1858 term infants born in the same period (p< 0.0001, OR: 3.6 CI 2.0 to 5.0). Hospitalised children had a higher prevalence of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) at birth (p< 0.001, OR: 7.7 CI: 2.121 to 27.954) and needed more mechanical ventilation (p< 0.001, OR: 5.7 CI: 1.813 to 18.396). Virus was identified in 25/30 (83%) preterm babies, and in 110/129 (85%) term infants. The most frequent viruses in preterm infants were RSV (76%) rhinovirus (20%). Clinical and epidemiological characteristics among term and preterm infants were similar. Conclusion(s): The risk of respiratory admissions during the first year of life is up to 3.6 times higher in moderate and late preterm. Once admitted, clinical features of respiratory episodes requiring hospitalisation are similar among term and preterm infants. Hyaline membrane disease and mechanical ventilation were also risk factors for respiratory admissions.Copyright © 2014 SEICAP.

AB  - The development of the human lung starts at 4 weeks of gestation with the appearance of the tracheal outgrowth from the foregut and continues into early childhood. Survival at birth is dependent on adequate development and maturation of the lung in utero. Abnormal bronchopulmonary development results in congenital lung malformations, and inadequate development is thought to contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Complex processes and factors influencing lung development are beginning to be elucidated, and further knowledge will hopefully lead to improved interventions to enhance outcomes in vulnerable or affected infants.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cathepsin K (CatK), contributes to the development of chronic lung disease in newborn infants, but the impact of CatK for the lungs may be multifaceted. We have previously demonstrated that low level of CatK is associated with newborn lung injury and CatK deficiency aggravates lung injury in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. Thus, we hypothesized that sustained/higher expression of CatK could ameliorate hyperoxia-induced injury and restrain the development of pulmonary fibrosis. We studied the lungs of newborn wild-type (WT) and CatK overexpressing transgenic mice (TG) that were exposed to hyperoxia or room air for 7 or 14 days after birth. Fourfold pulmonary overexpression of CatK did not affect the growth or lung weight in room-air bred TG mice. The distal airspaces in TG mice were, however, enlarged on postnatal days (PN) 7 and 14, the latter together with increased apoptosis, compared with WT controls. Survival rate was normal and no respiratory distress was observed in air-bred TG mice. Hyperoxia inhibited alveolarization and increased collagen accumulation in WT mice. In TG mice, hyperoxia for 1 week did not aggravate the lung injury, and the lung morphology and already enlarged alveoli remained unchanged in TG mice at PN7. Prolonged hyperoxic exposure caused significant lung injury and mortality similarly in both group of mice, and only few mice survived until PN14. In summary, CatK overexpression slightly enlarges distal airways in infant mice, but hyperoxic environment is initially better tolerated when compared to WT mice. These findings suggest multifaceted role for CatK in lung development and newborn lung injury.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acylcarnitines are biomarkers of fatty acid metabolism, and examining their patterns in preterm newborn may reveal metabolic changes associated with particular conditions related to prematurity. Isomeric acylcarnitines in dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma have never been assessed in preterm infants. METHOD(S): We studied 157 newborn divided into four groups by weeks of gestational age (GA), as follows: 22-27 wk in group 1; 28-31 wk in group 2; 32-36 wk in group 3; and 37-42 wk in group 4. Samples were collected on the third day of life. Acylcarnitines were separated and quantified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULT(S): Acylcarnitine concentrations correlated significantly with GA and birth weight in both DBS and plasma samples. Concentrations were lower in preterm newborn, except for acylcarnitines derived from branched-chain amino acids, which were higher and correlated with enteral feeding. On day 3 of life, no correlations emerged with gender, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, surfactant administration, or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION(S): We established GA-based reference ranges for isomeric acylcarnitine concentrations in preterm newborn, which could be used to assess nutritional status and the putative neuroprotective role of acylcarnitines.Copyright © 2015 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Caffeine is a commonly used food additive found naturally in many products. In addition to potently stimulating the central nervous system caffeine is able to affect various systems within the body including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Importantly, caffeine is used clinically to treat apnoea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature babies. Recently, caffeine has been shown to exhibit antifibrotic effects in the liver in part through reducing collagen expression and deposition, and reducing expression of the profibrotic cytokine TGFbeta. The potential antifibrotic effects of caffeine in the lung have not previously been investigated. Using a combined in vitro and ex vivo approach we have demonstrated that caffeine can act as an antifibrotic agent in the lung by acting on two distinct cell types, namely epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Caffeine inhibited TGFbeta activation by lung epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on TGFbeta activation in fibroblasts. Importantly, however, caffeine abrogated profibrotic responses to TGFbeta in lung fibroblasts. It inhibited basal expression of the alpha-smooth muscle actin gene and reduced TGFbeta-induced increases in profibrotic genes. Finally, caffeine reduced established bleomycin-induced fibrosis after 5 days treatment in an ex vivo precision-cut lung slice model. Together, these findings suggest that there is merit in further investigating the potential use of caffeine, or its analogues, as antifibrotic agents in the lung.

AB  - Background: Respiratory failure due to lung immaturity is a major cause of mortality in preterm infants. Although the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) in neonates with respiratory failure saves lives, its use is associated with lung injury and chronic lung disease (CLD). A newer form of ventilation called high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) has been shown to result in less lung injury in experimental studies. Objective(s): The objective of this review is to determine the effect of the elective use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) as compared to conventional ventilation (CV) on the incidence of chronic lung disease, mortality and other complications associated with prematurity and assisted ventilation in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Search strategy: Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal hand searching by the Cochrane Collaboration, mainly in the English language. The search was updated in January 2009. Selection Criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing HFOV and CV in preterm or low birth weight infants with pulmonary dysfunction, mainly due to RDS, who required assisted ventilation. Randomisation and commencement of treatment needed to be as soon as possible after the start of CV and usually in the first 12 hours of life. Data Collection and Analysis: The methodological quality of each trial was independently reviewed by the various authors. The standard effect measures are relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). From 1/RD the number needed to treat (NNT) to produce one outcome were calculated. For all measures of effect, 95% confidence intervals were used. In subgroup analyses the 99% CIs are also given for summary RRs in the text. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model. Where heterogeneity was over 50%, the random effects RR is also given. Main Result(s): Seventeen eligible studies of 3,652 infants were included. Meta-analysis comparing HFOV with CV revealed no evidence of effect on mortality at 28 - 30 days of age or at approximately term equivalent age. These results were consistent across studies and in subgroup analyses. The effect of HFOV on CLD in survivors at term equivalent gestational age was inconsistent across studies and the reduction was of borderline significance overall. The effect was similar in trials with a high lung volume strategy for HFOV targeting at very low FiO2and trials with a high lung volume strategy with some what higher or unspecified target FiO2. Subgroups of trials showed a significant reduction in CLD with HFOV when no surfactant was used, when piston oscillators were used for HFOV, when lung protective strategies for CV were not used, when randomisation occurred at two to six hours of age, and when inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:2 was used for HFOV. In the meta-analysis of all trials, pulmonary air leaks occurred more frequently in the HFOV group. In some studies, short-term neurological morbidity with HFOV was found, but this effect was not statistically significant overall. The subgroup of two trials not using a high volume strategy with HFOV found increased rates of Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage and of periventricular leukomalacia. An adverse effect of HFOV on long-term neurodevelopment was found in one large trial but not in the five other trials that reported this outcome. The rate of retinopathy of prematurity is reduced overall in the HFOV group. Authors' conclusions: There is no clear evidence that elective HFOV offers important advantages over CV when used as the initial ventilation strategy to treat preterm infants with acute pulmonary dysfunction. There may be a small reduction in the rate of CLD with HFOV use, but the evidence is weakened by the inconsistency of this effect across trials and the overall borderline significance. Future trials on elective HFOV should target those infants who are at most risk of CLD (extremely preterm infants), compare different strategies for generating HFOV and CV, and report important long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To clarify the association between amniotic neutrophil elastase levels and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Method(s): The database between July 2001 and December 2012 was reviewed for women with amniocentesis on admission for amniotic fluid neutrophil elastase levels and with singleton deliveries between 22+0 and 31+6 weeks of gestation. Following deliveries, placentas were examined for histologic chorioamnionitis. The peripheral blood of the neonates was analyzed for acute phase reactants. Result(s): Among 294 infants, no, mild, moderate or severe BPD was observed in 126, 89, 40 and 39 infants, respectively. The medians of gestational age on admission, at premature rupture of membranes and at delivery were significantly smaller in BPD (+) when compared with BPD (-) (p<0.001). The median level of amniotic neutrophil elastase on admission was significantly greater in BPD (+) than that in BPD (-). Histologic chorioamnionitis and funisitis were both detected more frequently in BPD (+) patients than in BPD (-) patients. In a logistic regression model, the only variable that affected an increased chance of BPD was the gestational age at delivery (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.92; p=0.021). Conclusion(s): The level of amniotic neutrophil elastase cannot be a definitive risk factor for BPD.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Background Preterm newborns that receive oxygen therapy often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is abnormal lung development characterized by impaired alveologenesis. Oxygen-mediated injury is thought to disrupt normal lung growth and development. However, the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced BPD has not been extensively investigated. We established a neonatal mouse model to investigate the effects of normobaric hyperoxia on retinoid metabolism and retinoid receptor expression. Methods Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxic or normoxic conditions for 15 days. The concentration of retinol and retinyl palmitate in the lung was measured by HPLC to gauge retinoid metabolism. Retinoid receptor mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR. Proliferation and retinoid receptor expression in A549 cells were assessed in the presence and absence of exogenous vitamin A. Results Hyperoxia significantly reduced the body and lung weight of neonatal mice. Hyperoxia also downregulated expression of RARalpha, RARa, and RXRa in the lungs of neonatal mice. In vitro, hyperoxia inhibited proliferation and expression of retinoid receptors in A549 cells. Conclusion Hyperoxia disrupted retinoid receptor expression in neonatal mice.Copyright © 2015 Chen, Chiang.2015 Chen, Chiang.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common complications in premature infants. Although several different drugs have been developed for BPD, there is a wide variation in the choice of drug used among facilities. The aim of this study was to carry out a survey of the current drugs used to treat BPD in Japan. Questionnaires regarding the current use of drugs for BPD were sent to tertiary neonatal units. The response rate was 80% (77/96). Most units used antenatal steroids and oral diuretics for the prevention and treatment of BPD, respectively. Only 4% used caffeine for prevention, whereas 88% used systemic corticosteroids for treatment. Few units used inhaled anticholinergics and i.v. vitamins for the prevention and treatment of BPD, respectively. It was found that the drugs used to treat BPD vary greatly among institutions. Further research is required to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines for BPD in premature infants.Copyright © 2015 Japan Pediatric Society.

AB  - Background: Preterm infants with neonatal lung injury are prone to wheezing and are often treated with beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonists although the benefits of beta-AR agonists may be lost with chronic use. Objective(s): To investigate if repeated beta-AR agonist exposure downregulates beta-ARs in the immature lung resulting in a decreased response to bronchodilator rescue and whether hyperoxic exposure aggravates this response. Method(s): Newborn mice were raised for 21 days in 60 or 21% oxygen and received daily aerosols of formoterol or saline. Respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs) were measured in response to methacholine challenge and rescue bronchodilation with levalbuterol. Western blot analysis quantified the relative amount of lung beta-ARs. Result(s): Hyperoxia increased the airway reactivity to methacholine. Animals raised in hyperoxia that received daily formoterol were most sensitive to methacholine and exhibited a blunted response to levalbuterol bronchodilation. Hyperoxia-exposed animals receiving daily formoterol versus saline showed a significant decrease in the relative amount of lung beta-ARs. Conclusion(s): In this hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mouse model, repeated beta-AR agonist treatments increased the airway reactivity and attenuated the response to a rescue bronchodilator. The blunted bronchodilator response could be explained by a reduced quantity of lung beta-ARs. Our findings may account for the time-dependent decrease in the therapeutic benefit of beta-AR agonists in preterm infants with neonatal lung injury, which may have clinical consequences for patients already prone to airway hyperreactivity.Copyright © 2014 S.

AB  - Introduction: This paper features new therapies that have recently received orphan drug designation in the European Union (EU) for various rare diseases. As in the previous papers of this series, orphan drugs designated for diseases with no therapy authorized in the EU are discussed.Areas covered: From repurposed therapies such as retinol for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or acamprosate calcium for Fragile-X syndrome to gene therapy for enzyme deficiencies or monoclonal antibodies for inherited metabolic disorders, a large range of diseases and therapies are discussed.Expert opinion: Inherited conditions can be tackled with various approaches, including 'etiologic' therapies (i.e., treating the cause or origin) or with 'pathogenic' therapies (i.e., inhibiting pathogenic pathways). In this paper, this is best exemplified by two very spectacular therapies, a gene therapy to treat a mitochondrial disorder (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy) and a monoclonal antibody for X-linked hypophosphatemia. In both cases, the preclinical evidence supports the feasibility of the approaches but clinical efficacy data are needed to enable these therapies to be authorized on the market.Copyright © Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Pulmonary surfactant instillation is the treatment of choice in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. The development of artificial surfactant has three decades of history. Animal-derived artificial surfactant is used in most countries and consists of 80% phospholipids and glycerol. 10% of the formulation is comprised of surfactant proteins, which have the critical role in surfactant function of lowering surface tension in the alveoli. Synthetic surfactants are made using synthetic peptide analogues as the surfactant protein counterparts. These are not the same as the human surfactant protein sequences; however, researchers are attempting to find the ideal synthetic peptide sequence for use in synthetic surfactants. Prophylactic and rescue surfactant therapy are two main therapeutic options. A recent recommendation emphasizes the importance of rescue therapy with continuous positive nasal airway pressure, rather than prophylactic use immediate after birth. This article briefly reviews the history and physiology of surfactant use, as well as clinical practice of surfactant and future studies.Copyright © Korean Medical Association.

AB  - Premature infants requiring an ophthalmic examination or even surgery for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) have a high prevalence of co-existing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Reactive airway is one of the clinical presentations of BPD. We report two cases of bronchoconstriction following instillation of mydriatic eye drops. One occurred during induction of anesthesia for laser photocoagulation and the other before screening of ROP. The most likely cause in each case was phenylephrine eye drops. We recommend that the minimal dosage of phenylephrine needed to attain proper mydriasis should be instilled to infant patients, and the possibility of bronchoconstriction occurrence kept in mind, especially for infants with low body weight with BPD.Copyright © The Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2015.

AB  - Arginase is an enzyme that limits substrate L-arginine bioavailability for the production of nitric oxide by the nitric oxide synthases and produces L-ornithine, which is a precursor for collagen formation and tissue remodeling. We studied the pulmonary vascular effects of arginase inhibition in an established model of repeated systemic bleomycin sulfate administration in neonatal rats that results in pulmonary hypertension and lung injury mimicking the characteristics typical of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We report that arginase expression is increased in the lungs of bleomycin-exposed neonatal rats and that treatment with the arginase inhibitor amino-2-borono-6-hexanoic acid prevented the bleomycininduced development of pulmonary hypertension and deposition of collagen. Arginase inhibition resulted in increased L-arginine and L-arginine bioavailability and increased pulmonary nitric oxide production. Arginase inhibition also normalized the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and reduced bleomycin-induced nitrative stress while having no effect on bleomycin-induced inflammation. Our data suggest that arginase is a promising target for therapeutic interventions in neonates aimed at preventing lung vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.Copyright © 2015, The American Physiological Society.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells have therapeutic efficacy in neonatal hyperoxia- induced lung injury (HILI). c-kit, a tyrosine kinase receptor that regulates angiogenesis, is expressed on several populations of BM-derived cells. Preterm infants exposed to hyperoxia have decreased lung angiogenesis. Here we tested the hypothesis that administration of BM-derived c-kit+ cells would improve angiogenesis in neonatal rats with HILI. To determine whether intratracheal (IT) administration of BM-derived c-kit+ cells attenuates neonatal HILI, rat pups exposed to either normobaric normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (90% O2) from postnatal day (P) 2 to P15 were randomly assigned to receive either IT BM-derived green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ c-kit- cells (PL) or BM-derived GFP+ c-kit+ cells on P8. The effect of cell therapy on lung angiogenesis, alveolarization, pulmonary hypertension, vascular remodeling, cell proliferation, and apoptosis was determined at P15. Cell engraftment was determined by GFP immunostaining. Compared to PL, the IT administration of BM-derived c-kit+ cells to neonatal rodents with HILI improved alveolarization as evidenced by increased lung septation and decreased mean linear intercept. This was accompanied by an increase in lung vascular density, a decrease in lung apoptosis, and an increase in the secretion of proangiogenic factors. There was no difference in pulmonary vascular remodeling or the degree of pulmonary hypertension. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 1% of total lung cells were GFP+ cells. IT administration of BM-derived c-kit+cells improves lung alveolarization and angiogenesis in neonatal HILI, and this may be secondary to an improvement in the lung angiogenic milieu.Copyright © 2015 Cognizant Comm.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity, has been linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To investigate a causal role for ER stress in BPD pathogenesis, we generated conditional knockout (KO) mice (cGrp78(f/f)) with lung epithelial cell-specific KO of Grp78, a gene encoding the ER chaperone 78-kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a master regulator of ER homeostasis and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Lung epithelial-specific Grp78 KO disrupted lung morphogenesis, causing developmental arrest, increased alveolar epithelial type II cell apoptosis, and decreased surfactant protein and type I cell marker expression in perinatal lungs. cGrp78(f/f) pups died immediately after birth, likely owing to respiratory distress. Importantly, Grp78 KO triggered UPR activation with marked induction of the proapoptotic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Increased expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and cell death and decreased expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes suggest a role for oxidative stress in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis. Increased Smad3 phosphorylation and expression of transforming growth factor-beta/Smad3 targets Cdkn1a (encoding p21) and Gadd45a suggest that interactions among the apoptotic arm of the UPR, oxidative stress, and transforming growth factor-beta/Smad signaling pathways contribute to Grp78 KO-induced AEC apoptosis and developmental arrest. Chemical chaperone Tauroursodeoxycholic acid reduced UPR activation and apoptosis in cGrp78(f/f) lungs cultured ex vivo, confirming a role for ER stress in observed AEC abnormalities. These results demonstrate a key role for GRP78 in AEC survival and gene expression during lung development through modulation of ER stress, and suggest the UPR as a potential therapeutic target in BPD.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease with a significant genetic component. Twin studies indicate that heritability of BPD is estimated at 53 to 79% [1]. Association studies have identifiedseveral potential candidate genes encoding components of innate immune and antioxidant defenses, mechanisms of vascular and lung remodeling, matrix remodeling proteins, surfactantproteins [2,3]. We planned a prospective multicentre study aimedto identify rare genetic variants contributing to the BPD phenotypeby exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Material(s) and Method(s): 26 unrelated newborns with a clinicaldiagnosis of severe BPDaccording with NIH Consensus Criteria [4]were selected among a collected cohort of 366premature neonates of European origin with gestational age <= 32 wfrom 12Italiancenters. Genomic DNAwas extracted from peripheral blood and exome sequencing was carried out on an IlluminaHiSeq2000 platform. In order to identify potentially interesting variants related to BPD pathogenesis, we adopted two different strategies: 1) Candidate genes previously associated with BPD in association studies 2) Prioritization analysis based on pathways potentially involved in the pathogenesis of BPD (ToppGene Prioritization tool). Result(s): 1) Candidate genes: we identified a total of 61variants in 19 candidate genes previously associated with BPD and confirmed them with Sanger; 31 are commonpolymorphism, 25 are rare and classified as dbSNPrs with a MAF <0.05and 6 are novel. Considering all the variants, the most mutated genes are those belonging to the TLR-family (TLR10, TLR1, TLR4), to oxidative stress-related genes (EPHX2, MTHFR, EPHX1)and to surfactant metabolism genes (SFTPD, ABCA3).2) Prioritizationanalysis: we decided to focus first on the list of the top 5 genes: TLR1, MMP1, NOS2, CRP and LBP. To evaluate the possible interaction between candidate genes previously associated with BPD and showing variants in our sample(ABCA3, SFTPD, SPOCK2, ACE, MTHFR, EPHX1, EPHX2, TLR5, TLR10, TLR1, TLR6, TLR4, GSTP1, MBL2, TLR10, TLR2) and the top 5 genes (NOS2, TLR1, MMP1, CRP, LBP) highlighted with prioritization analysis we usedString 9.122. The results allow the possibility of a networking with a main focus ongenes involved in inflammation (figure 1) [5]. Conclusion(s): In consideration of the results obtained in this pilot study, we canconclude that our approachmay be interesting to initiate the dissectionof genetic pathogenesis of BPD.Our study indicates that genes regarding inflammatory response and tissue remodeling may be relevant in BPD pathogenesis. These preliminary resultsneed to be confirmed and may contribute in improving knowledge of pathogenesis of BPD and targeting therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Cortisol production by the human fetal adrenal cortex has been shown to be not adequate at early gestation. This is due to an inefficient expression of 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of progesterone from pregnenolone, before about 23 weeks of gestation. Whereas, the fetal adrenal cortex it is able to produce dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate for placental estrogen synthesis and to convert placental progesterone to cortisol [1,2]. During the last trimester of pregnancy the fetal adrenal gland undergoes significant anatomical and functional maturation for adaptation to extra-uterine life and cortisol production increases greatly in the last two months of gestation. Cortisol increases synthesis of surfactant, enhances the reabsorption of lung fluid, promotes the conversion of T4 to T3, favors the closure of the ductus arteriosus and maturation of liver and intestinal enzymes [2]. Adrenal insufficiency can be caused by rare conditions such as adrenocortical hypoplasia or congenital enzymatic deficiencies of steroidogenesis, with clinical variables depending on the hormone involved. In preterm infants, the developmental immaturity, combined with increased demands in critical illness, may result in insufficient cortisol production to maintain homeostasis in the face of acute stress or illness, despite apparently normal cortisol levels. This condition is known as "transient or relative adrenal insufficiency" (TAI) [3,4]. TAI usually appears in the first week of life and normalizes in the second week. Infants with TAI can exhibit refractory hypotension (hypotension not responsive to volume expanders and inotropic drugs, but responsive to corticosteroids), respiratory distress, patent ductus arteriosus and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [2,3]. Diagnosis of TAI is not easy because many other conditions can cause hypotension in VLBW infants: hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, deficient vascular tone, hyaline membrane disease, infection or a combinations of these factors. In addition, normal basal cortisol levels are extremely variable in preterms and to date there is no consensus on the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency based on tests with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [5-8]. Appropriate dose and duration of steroid therapy have not been established yet. On the other hand refractory and persistent hypotension is associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, increased mortality and neurological disability [9]. Poor adrenal response has been shown to be associated with later development of BPD and with death [10,11]. For these reasons further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids in the treatment of cardiovascular failure due to TAI in ill preterm and term infants [12,13].

AB  - Mechanical ventilation in newborns, children and adults leads to lung injury and has been shown to induce the formation of proteinaceous lung oedema causing epithelial disruption and resulting in changes in lung perfusion. Lung injury leads to reduced compliance, worsening of shunt fraction and an inflammatory response that results from high end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressures (Ptp) and inadequate End Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV). Lung injury results if a lung is ventilated from collapsed state with each ventilator cycle. Thus the first concept of treatment in acute hypoxic respiratory failure is: "Open collapsed lung units and keep them open without overdistending them". The open lung is one in which there is little or no atelectasis and an optimal gas exchange. Lung recruitment strategies transiently increase Ptp to reopen the alveolar units not aerated or poorly aerated but recruitable. Lung recruitment maneuvers may restore EELV resulting in more stable alveoli, and reduce shear stress associated with the alveolar cyclic opening and closing. Lung recruitment can be performed in several ways: in delivery room with a T-piece device, in the NICU setting by using a conventional or high frequency oscillation (HFO) ventilator, and is commonly achieved by increase of end-expiratory lung volume with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or end inspiratory lung volume by inspiratory holds or sustained inflation. Recruitment during both, HFO and CMV (Conventional Mechanical Ventilation), follows similar concepts when using small tidal volume ventilation but is easier to achieve at bedside during HFO. The Sustained Inflation maneuver (SI) applies a high pressure to the lung for a short period (30 sec) before returning to previous mean airway pressures. This volume recruitment strategy has been shown to be as protective as high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFO) at similar lung volumes. Infants treated with a SI in delivery room had improved short-term respiratory outcomes (reduced need of tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation), but major outcomes (BPD Bronchopulmonary dysplasia-and/or death) were not improved. Recent reports describe improvements in arterial oxygenation with the use of recruitment maneuvers during CMV and/or HFO. However, the impact of these strategies on patient important outcomes such as survival is still unclear. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of SI, including selection of patients, setting of SI maneuver in terms of duration and peak pressure, timing of surfactant administration. Further studies are also needed to elucidate the impact of recruitment maneuvers during mechanical ventilation, including survival and BPD.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) of the newborn is a severe complication that occurs more frequently in term infants but can be demonstrated also in preterm infants. The incidence of PH in preterm infants is currently unknown because it is often masked by the contemporary respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), there are not important echocardiography studies in the early transitional period assessingthe presence of PH in this population, and its echocardiographic diagnosis is not always simple. Similarly to term infants, PHin preterm infants can result from an abnormal transition from fetal to neonatal life (persistence of fetal circulation) but more frequently complicates RDS, or is secondary to the abnormal lung growthcaused by maternal pregnancy diseases, such as preterm premature rupture ofmembranes (PPROM) and oligohydramnios or, finally, is associated to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). On the other hand, it has been recently demonstratedthat early PH occurring in association with severe RDS is a risk factor for late PH and BPD in preterm infants. The first choice drug for the PH of the newborn is inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), but its effectiveness in preterm infants is highly debated. American Academy of Pediatrics in 2014 reported that previous studies indicate thatneither rescue nor routine use of iNO improves survival in preterm infants with respiratory failure. However, preterm infants with echocardiographic diagnosis of PH have not been specifically evaluated in previous studies and it is possible that theyrepresent a subgroup witha different response. Interestingly, milrinone has been recently found to be effective in improving oxygenation of preterm infants with PH refractory to iNO. In conclusion, it seems that PH actually exists in extremely low birth weight infants, and that many efforts are needed to improve their finding and their treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Despite constant progress in support of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a very common issue. Compared to babies born at the same gestational age, children who had BPD are more likely to suffer from persistent respiratory symptoms. Several studies have shown the importance of early energy and protein intake to improve lung development and maturation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the long term influence of early parenteral protein intake on respiratory function in children with BPD. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighteen very preterm infants who were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Poitiers and suffering from BPD were included and respectively divided into two groups according to their initial parenteral caloric and protein intake. Early protein intake was defined as introduction of parenteral amino acid solutions from day 1 of life, late intake from day 2 or later. Respiratory function of these children was studied between 3 and 6 years by lung function tests, including measurements of airway resistance, functional residual capacity (FRC) by helium dilution and exhaled NO. Result(s): Airway resistance was significantly lower in the group who received early protein intake [p=0.002]. In addition, an inverse correlation was shown between total protein intake on the first 3 days of life and lung resistance [r=-0.68; p=0.002]. However, we did not find any significant relationship between caloric intake and studied lung function parameters. FRC was significantly higher in children who had received a low protein intake during their first week of life. Exhaled NO was not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion(s): Early parenteral protein intake appears to reduce bronchial obstruction in children with BPD. This long term improvement in lung function underlines the importance of adapting both quantitatively and qualitatively parenteral nutrition of very premature infants.

AB  - Purpose Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a complication of preterm birth affecting lung development, is treated with postnatal oxygen. Postnatal oxygen can also cause retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and approximately 60-70% of infants with ROP also have BPD. Using a mouse model of BPD, we hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) would be generated in the retina upon removal from hyperoxia. Methods Mice pups (C57BL/6) were exposed to 75% oxygen from P0 to P14. Exposure to hyperoxia was continuous with brief interruptions for animal care. Dams were rotated from hyperoxia to room air every 48 hours. Following the hyperoxia exposure, mice were either euthanized immediately (P14) or left in room air for either 1 day (P15), or 7 days (P21). Agematched control room air mice were euthanized at similar time points. One group of eyes (N=4 per group) at each time-point was flash frozen for cryo-sectioning. For the remaining eyes, retinas were freshly dissected and homogenized for protein extraction. The sectioned eyes were stained with dihydroethidium (DHE), a marker that stains DNA in the presence of superoxide, and dichlorofluorescein (DCF), a marker for reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1) and NOX4 protein expression were quantified using western blots of retinal lysates. Results Hyperoxic mice had increased DHE and DCF staining in the inner and outer segments compared to room air mice. NOX1 and NOX4 protein levels did not differ significantly at P14 between high oxygen and room air mice. NOX4 protein levels were increased at P21 hyperoxic mice compared to room air mice. Analysis of NOX1 and NOX4 protein levels in retinal lysates for remaining time-points are currently underway. Conclusions In a mouse model of BPD, relative hypoxia following removal from hyperoxia exposure leads to oxidative stress in the photoreceptors. Further analysis is underway to improve our understanding of the mechanism of ROS generation in the BPD model, which may ultimately reveal new therapeutic strategies for treating BPD and ROP.

AB  - Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections can be prevented by good hygiene and prophylactic palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the fusion protein of VRS. The criteria for selecting patients for palivizumab prescription in our hospital are: <28 weeks preterm infants (PI) and age <12 months (criterion 1), <32 weeks PI and age <6 months (criterion 2), age <2 years with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (criterion 3), age <2 years with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (criterion 4). Purpose To describe the use of palivizumab in the vaccination campaign in our hospital, evaluating the appropriateness of its use by the established criteria and its effectiveness. Material and methods We performed a retrospective observational study. All patients who received palivizumab between 01/10/2013 and 31/03/2014 were included. The data collected using the clinical records were: sex, gestational age, selection criteria, and number of hospitalizations due to acute bronchiolitis between 01/10/2013 and 30/09/2014. RSV was analysed in these patients by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Results Palivizumab was administered to 68 patients (48.5% female) with a median gestational age of 209 days (176-287). 24 patients (35.3%) fulfilled criterion 2, 14 (20.6%) criterion 1, 10 (14.7%) criterion 4, 5 (7.3%) criteria 1 and 3, 4 (5.9%) criteria 2 and 4, 3 (4.4%) criterion 3, 2 (2.9%) criteria 3 and 4. 4 patients did not meet any criteria and 2 had no data. Only 6 patients who received palivizumab were hospitalised with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis and their RSV PCRs were negative. Conclusion Palivizumab is used under the established criteria in our hospital. The study data show that immunising these at-risk patients with the palivizumab vaccine was an effective strategy for at least one year. Although the study period was 1 year, it would be desirable to measure effectiveness over a longer period.

AB  - Background: Lutein, a fat-soluble carotenoid present in green leafy vegetables and eggs, has strong antioxidant properties and could therefore be important for respiratory health. Method(s): We systematically reviewed literature for articles that evaluated associations of lutein (dietary intake, supplements or blood levels) with respiratory outcomes, published in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar, up to August 2014. Result(s): We identified 13 studies (one trial, five longitudinal and seven cross-sectional studies). In children: two studies reported on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and four on asthma. In adults: one reported on asthma, five on respiratory function and one on respiratory mortality. For BPD, the longitudinal observational study found no difference in plasma lutein levels between neonates who developed BPD and controls. The intervention study found no significant effect of lutein/ zeaxanthin supplementation in neonates (140 mcg lutein/0.6 mcg zeaxanthin daily for 36 weeks) on lowering risk of BPD (OR 0.43 (95 % CI 0.15:1.17) versus placebo), but this study was not sufficiently powered. For asthma, one longitudinal and three cross-sectional studies in children found lower lutein intake or blood levels in asthma patients as compared to controls, but this association disappeared after adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. In adults, a case-control study also reported lower lutein blood levels in asthma cases versus controls, but no adjustment for potential confounders was made. For respiratory function (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC-ratio), three out of five observational studies, all in adults, found small, but significant, beneficial effects of lutein. One cross-sectional study in patients with chronic airflow limitation found both intake and levels of lutein to be positively associated with increases in FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC-ratio. One longitudinal study in adults from a general population reported a beneficial effect of lutein intake on FVC only. The third study again found a beneficial effect of lutein blood levels on slower declines of FVC only. No association was found in the other two studies. For respiratory mortality, one longitudinal study in elderly showed that higher lutein blood levels were associated with a decreased risk (HR 0.77 (95 % CI 0.60: 0.99), per SD increase in lutein level). Conclusion(s): The published literature suggests possible beneficial effects of lutein on adult respiratory health, especially for respiratory function. However, literature is scarce, especially on respiratory function in children, and most studies are observational. Further large scale prospective cohort studies and intervention studies are needed to clarify the role of lutein in respiratory health.

AB  - Introduction: Improved perinatal and neonatal care has been associated with a significant increase in the survival of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants (<1500g). However, extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) still remains a serious problem in these infants. Recent researches had found an association between EUGR, later growth, neurodevelopmental outcome and long-term morbidity. But the causes of EUGR have been inconclusive. Moreover, there are little data regarding the incidence and associated risk factors of EUGR in VLBW infants in China. Method(s): A 6-year retrospective review of 107 VLBW infants <34weeks of gestational age, born at the first affiliated hospital of SunYat-Sen University between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010, were free of major congenital anomalies and survived until discharge. EUGR was defined as body weight at discharge<=10th percentile of the growth expectation based on estimated postmenstrual age. The VLBW infants were divided into EUGR group and non-EUGR group. Perinatal factors, nutritional practice, and neonatal morbidities were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the predictors of EUGR in VLBW infants. Result(s): The incidence of EUGR in VLBW infants was 62.6%, 86% for SGA and 47.7% for AGA (P<0.001). The age of lowest weight and days to regain birthweight were significantly longer in EUGR infants than in non-EUGR infants (both P<0.01). While the velocity of weight gain was significantly lower in EUGR infants (P<0.05). Compared to non-EUGR infants, the age to achieve full enteral feedings, 3g/ kg/d protein and 120kcal/kg/d calories were significantly longer in EUGR infants (all P<0.05). The cumulative caloric deficit and cumulative protein deficit in the first two weeks of life of EUGR infants were significantly higher than those of non-EUGR infants all P<0.05). The rate of late-onset sepsis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were more frequent in EUGR infants (P<0.05).The result of logistic regression analysis showed that SGA, gestational age, BPD, late-onset sepsis, age to achieve full enteral feedings and 3g/kg/d protein and the cumulative caloric deficit in the first two weeks of life were the independent risk factors for EUGR. Conclusion(s): EUGR should be recognized as a serious issue in VLBW infants especially for SGA infants in NICU. Early aggressive nutritional strategy, prevention of BPD and infection, and improvement of perinatal care may help to prevent EUGR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of CASZ1 and its relationship with the pulmonary microvascular development in lung tissue of newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia which induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHOD: Forty-eight newborn Sprague Dawley(SD) rats (male and female unlimited) were randomly divided into two groups: experimental group and control group according to random digits table with 24 in each. The rats in experimental group were exposed to high oxygen volume fraction of 800 ml/L and the rats in control group were exposed to normal air. Eight rats were randomly selected from each group on day 3 and 7 after oxygen exposure. The sections of lung were stained with HE method in order to assess lung histological changes, the alveolar development was evaluated by the number of radial alveolar count (RAC) and septal wall thickness. CD31 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) method and the capillary density was calculated. The location, distribution and expression of CASZ1 in the lung tissue were detected by the immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative PCR (qPCR)., RESULT: (1) Stained by HE, lungs of experimental group showed destroyed alveoli, alveoli fusion and increased septal wall thickness, RAC were significantly lower than those in control group(14 d: septal wall thickness (12.69 +/- 0.63) mum vs. (6.53 +/- 0.16) mum, RAC 5.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 8.4 +/- 1.0, t = 19.046, 4.760, P both = 0.000). (2) CD31 protein was expressed predominantly in cytoplasm of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. The experimental group CD31 average optical density (AIOD) were decreased compared with control group((16.6 +/- 1.6) x 10(3) vs.(40.1 +/- 2.4) x 10(3), (18.1 +/- 1.4) x 10(3) vs.(83.2 +/- 5.2) x 10(3), (49.2 +/- 5.4) x 10(3) vs.(136.2 +/- 28.1) x 10(3), t=16.185, 16.066 and 6.078, P<0.01 for all comparisons). Capillary density in experimental group was also significantly decreased compared with control group ((3.84 +/- 0.15)% vs.(6.01 +/- 0.22)%, (4.17 +/- 0.38)% vs.(6.15 +/- 0.24)%, (5.43 +/- 0.44)% vs. (9.13 +/- 0.25)%, t = 16.124, 8.773 and 14.076, P all < 0.01). (3)RT-qPCR and Western blotting showed that the CASZ1 mRNA significantly increased in experimental group compared with control group(0.56 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.26, 0.32 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.14, 0.14 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.15, t=3.890, 3.303 and 2.388, P < 0.05 for all comparisons), and the protein expression of CASZ1 also significantly increased in experimental group compared with control group (0.65 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.23, 0.46 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.05, 0.34 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.04, t=6.200 and 10.485 and 14.998, P < 0.05 for all comparisons). (4)The protein level of CASZ1 in experimental group was positively correlated with capillary density (r=0.519, P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: CASZ1 is involved in the whole process of newborn rats BPD and may be linked to pulmonary microvascular dysplasia.

AB  - Human milk (HM) has a positive impact on health of preterm infants by reducing the prevalence of necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis and by supporting neurocognitive development. However, unfortified HM does not provide preterm infants with sufficient amounts of nutrients (protein, minerals, sodium, zinc,...) to obtain a postnatal growth at least equivalent to fetal growth. Even using HM from mothers who delivered preterm, as the protein content of preterm HM is only slightly higher than term HM, and only during the first month of lactation. Standardized fortification relies on the addition of a multicomponent fortifiers starting after few days of life when 50 to 100 ml/kg.d of enteral feeding is well tolerated. Preterm infants fed fortified HM grow better than when HM is not fortified, but slower than infants fed a preterm formula. In some infants fed HM, standardized fortification may be inappropriate because nutrients' intake may be insufficient or nutrients' needs could be particularly high. It is now well-known that protein and lipid contents of HM is variable and may be low. On the other hand, nutrient's need may be high in infants with severe intrauterine growth retardation, or with diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Henriksen et al reported that a significant proportion of preterm infants are growth retardated at discharge (Henriksen 2009). The insufficient nutrient content may be compensated by an appropriate fortification of HM. Optimization of HM fortification relies on the use of high quality standard fortification completed by an individualized fortification. Evaluation of optimal standard fortification relies on the evaluation the safety (osmolality, digestive and metabolic tolerance) and efficacy (protein and energy intakes, growth. Individualized fortification is either "targeted" or "adjustable". The first one requires the analysis of HM and then a fortification adapted to reach the targeted nutrients' intake. The definition of the target nutrient's content relies on an assumption about nutrient's requirement. Adaptation of fortification is performed by using protein (Polberger 1989) and /or energy: lipids (De Halleux 2007) and/or carbohydrates (Rochow 2013). The second one relies on periodic determinations of serum urea assessment as a marker of the individual metabolic response to standardized fortification. Additional protein fortification is proposed (Arsanoglu 2006). The only randomized controlled trial about individualized fortification has been performed by Arslanoglu et al in very low birth weight infants (Arslanoglu 2006). These authors and reported a significant positive effect on weight gain and head circumference growth. In our unit, we observed that a third of extremely low birth weight infants needed additional protein fortification to reach a sufficient weight gain (20 g/ kg.d). That additional protein fortification improved significantly short term weight, length and head circumference growth. By improving protein to energy ratio in infants fed adjustable fortification of HM, we observed that body composition at discharge can be improved, with increased fat free mass. Recent study suggested a relationship of fat-free mass to speed of brain processing in preterm infants Diminished linear growth and FFM gains could be markers of future cognitive deficit in VLBW preterm infants (Pfister 2014). Therefore nutritional care of preterm infants, and especially in HM-fed infants, has beneficial shortterm (postnatal growth) and long-term (cognitive development) effects.

AB  - PURPOSE: Ipratropium is an anticholinergic bronchodilator that inhibits muscarinic acetylcholine stimulation in the vagal nerve, resulting in smooth muscle dilation of the bronchial tubes. Ipratropium is not FDA-approved in children under 12 years for pulmonary conditions, and limited studies on proper use in a young patient population have been performed. Despite this, ipratroprium is used in practice for bronchiolitis, asthma, and respiratory distress in patients <2 years. The purpose of this study was to determine prescribing practices for ipratroprium at West Virginia University Children's Hospital (WVUCH) in patients <=2 years. The primary objective was evaluation of patients receiving a scheduled order for ipratropium, focusing on dose, frequency, duration, and indication for use. Secondary objectives were description of prescribing service, use of respiratory support, and concurrent pulmonary medications. METHOD(S): This study was a retrospective chart review using the electronic medical record at WVUCH. A report generated included all patients discharged from the pediatric ICU, neonatal ICU, and general pediatric medicine from June to December of 2014 with an order for ipratropium. Inclusion criteria are inpatients <=2 years who received a scheduled dose of ipratropium. Exclusion criteria included one-time/PRN orders. Data points collected include: age, gender, weight, dose, frequency, route, total doses administered, duration of therapy, prescribing service, concurrent respiratory medications, indication, and co-morbidities. RESULT(S): Twenty patients qualified for this study, including twenty-three encounters and fifty orders for ipratropium. The most common indication of use was respiratory distress (8) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (5). 44/50 orders were via nebulization with the most frequently ordered dose of 0.25 mg (12) and 0.5 mg(9) every 6 hours. CONCLUSION(S): At WVUCH ipratroprium use in patients <=2 is primarily in the ventilated neonatal population for BPD. Due to inconsistencies in prescribing, an opportunity arises for a consensus in practice amongst the physicians.

AB  - Oxygen toxicity and antioxidant deficiencies contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Aurothioglucose (ATG) potently inhibits thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) and activates nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). ATG attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits in a mouse model of BPD. The present study tested the hypothesis that this attenuation is associated with TrxR1 inhibition and Nrf2 induction. Newborn C3H/HeN mice were treated with a single i.p. dose of 25 mg/kg ATG or saline within 12 h of birth and were exposed to either room air (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2). TrxR1 activity in lung homogenates was determined by insulin disulfide reduction assay. Since our previous data indicated that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was the Nrf2 regulated gene most strongly induced by TrxR1 inhibition in vitro, Nrf2 activation in lung tissues was assessed using qRT-PCR for HO-1. TrxR1 activity was 90% lower in lungs from ATG-treated mice when compared to saline-treated mice at 1 d; and 67% less at 3 d. There were independent effects of and an interaction between ATG and hyperoxic exposure on HO-1 expression at 1 d. HO-1 expression in the lungs of ATG-treated mice was 1.8 fold greater than in saline-treated controls. Conversely, HO-1 levels were not increased in hyperoxia-exposed saline-treated or RA-exposed ATG-treated lungs. At 7d, an independent effect of hyperoxic exposure on HO-1 expression was detected. When compared to saline-treated RA controls, HO-1 expression was increased 3.4 and 3.9-fold in lungs from hyperoxia-exposed saline and ATG-treated mice, respectively. These data suggest that ATG pre-treatment enables the hyperoxia-exposed newborn lung to mount a rapid antioxidant response that correlates with attenuated lung developmental deficits. Though hyperoxia elicits an antioxidant response in neonatal murine lung by 7 d, it is insufficient to protect the lung. We conclude that the attenuation of hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits by ATG is associated with TrxR1 inhibition and enhanced Nrf2 activation early in the course of hyperoxic exposure. If pharmacologic TrxR1 inhibition can be safely utilized in preterm neonates, this strategy could prevent BPD.
