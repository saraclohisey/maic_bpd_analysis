AB  - Purpose of Study: Alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s) that are the target of WNT signaling serve as facultative stem cells in the mature lungs of adults. These AT2 stem cells can be identified by expression of the AT2 canonical marker, SFTPC, and the WNT downstream target gene Axin2. Axin2-AT2 stem cells proliferate in response to various injuries to maintain functional homeostasis through the regeneration of damaged tissue. What about the immature lungs of neonates born before the completion of gestation? There is virtually no information as to whether AT2 stem cells exist in the lungs of neonates born prematurely and whether they are capable of responding to injuries occurring during the NICU course. To address this important gap in our knowledge we investigated whether AXIN2-AT2 cells can be detected in the lungs of preterm infants who died of non-pulmonary causes to those of infants who died from the neonatal chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD. Methods Used: BPD and non-BPD postnatal human lung tissues were provided by the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine and the National Disease Research Interchange and were classified exempt from human subject regulations (RSRB00056775). A combination of immunofluorescence for SFTPC (green) and RNAscope for AXIN2 (red) used to identify regenerative SFTPC(+);AXIN2(+) double-positive cells. Combination IF for SFTPC (red) and RNAscope for MKI67 (white) was used to identify and quantify proliferative AT2s. Multiple samples (greater than 20 experimental replicates) were manually scored. Summary of Results: Our results showed that AXIN2-SFTPC cells are indeed present in control neonatal lungs and represent 28% of the total AT2 cell population. This is remarkably similar to what has been reported in the mature adult human lung. We were surprised to find that the relative abundance of AXIN2-SFTPC cells increased to 36.5% in BPD lungs. This could represent an either incomplete or blunted response to injury. Importantly, while the relative pool of "regenerative" cells is larger, the relative number of proliferating AT2s was smaller in BPD lungs compared to controls. Conclusion(s): The sum of these data indicates that BPD may more likely be caused by a failure in recruitment, rather than a lack of presumptive regenerative epithelial cells. The latter has obvious implications for the pathogenesis of BPD and may offer novel preventive or therapeutic strategies for this neonatal chronic lung disease.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and Pulmonary hypertension secondary to BPD (BPD-PH) are chronic inflammatory diseases in preterm infants. Due to the multifactorial nature of BPD and BPD-PH, its pathogenesis remains poorly characterised despite considerable research efforts. We discovered that the type 2 immune response plays a role in disease development. Method(s): MURINE STUDIES: In a murine BPD "double hit" model, pregnant dams were injected with 150mug/kg LPS ip at E14. At birth, WT and STAT6-KO pups were randomised into continuous hyperoxia (65% O 2 ) or room air (21% O 2 ) as a control. Pulmonary inflammation was characterised by cytokine abundance, lung structure by histology, pulmonary vasculature by echocardiography and synchrotron micro-CT imaging to visualise pulmonary vasculature remodelling. HUMAN STUDIES: 5 blood samples were collected from 51 preterm infants longitudinally, plus 20 healthy term infants at birth and age 3 to 16weeks, and 5 healthy adults. Result(s): In preterm infants type 2 immune polarization in circulating T cells is associated with cardiopulmonary illness. Maternal magnesium sulfate therapy and delayed hepatitis B vaccination were associated with attenuated type 2 polarization. In mice blocking type 2mediators or STAT6 prevented changes in cell type composition, cytokine increase, and losses of pulmonary capillaries. Thereby, type 2blockade ameliorated lung inflammation, protected alveolar and vascular integrity and confirmed the pathological impact of type 2 cytokines and STAT6. Conclusion(s): This work advances knowledge on developmental immunology and its impact on early life disease and identifies multiple therapeutic approaches that may relieve inflammation-driven suffering in the youngest patients.

AB  - IMPACT: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia has multiple definitions that are currently based on phenotypic characteristics. Using an unsupervised machine learning approach, we created BPD subclasses (e.g., endotypes) by clustering whole microarray data. T helper 17 cell differentiation was the most significant pathway differentiating the BPD endotypes., INTRODUCTION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extreme prematurity. Discovery of BPD endotypes in an unbiased format, derived from the peripheral blood transcriptome, may uncover patterns underpinning this complex lung disease., METHODS: An unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach applied to genome-wide expression of profiling from 62 children at day of life five was used to identify BPD endotypes. To identify which genes were differentially expressed across the BPD endotypes, we formulated a linear model based on least-squares minimization with empirical Bayes statistics., RESULTS: Four BPD endotypes (A, B,C,D) were identified using 7,319 differentially expressed genes. Across BPD endotypes, 5,850 genes had a p value < 0.05 after multiple comparison testing. Endotype A consisted of neonates with a higher gestational age and birthweight. Endotypes B-D included neonates between 25 and 26 weeks and a birthweight range of 640 to 940 g. Endotype D appeared to have a protective role against BPD compared to Endotypes B and C (36% vs. 62% vs. 60%, respectively). The most significant pathway focused on T helper 17 cell differentiation., CONCLUSION: Bioinformatic analyses can help identify BPD endotypes that associate with clinical definitions of BPD.

AB  - Background: Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are frequent in preterm infants and may have long-term impact on respiratory morbidity, especially those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP). The immune response and respiratory are key defence elements, so the purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response regulation and the respiratory epithelial barrier integrity in the preterm infants suffering RVIs during Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission. Method(s): Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) were obtained, separating cells from supernatants. Viral detection was performed by RT-nested PCR, and gene expression by qPCR. Proteins were detected by western blot and ELISA or Luminex. Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were stimulated with Poly:IC and/or wounds. Result(s): Levels of filaggrin, IL-1beta, MIP-1beta, VEGF and HIF-1alpha were higher in pre-infection supernatant samples (p < 0.05), from 26 preterm infants compared to 23 noninfected controls, being infection-risk biomarkers (AUC over 0.7). Conversely, re-infection samples that later developed RVIs had less frequency of filaggrin gene expression and fewer protein levels (p = 0.06). IL-17A, RANTES, VEGF, and HIF-1alpha levels were higher during and post infection (p < 0.05), while MCP-1 and amphiregulin were reduced after infection (p < 0.05 and p = 0.07, respectively). Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) stimulated by poly:IC reduced filaggrin gene expression and increased its levels at supernatant (p < 0.05 and p = 0.08, respectively). Finally, poly:IC stimulation over SAEC increased TLR3 and TSLP expression, while reduced AREG expression (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Filaggrin gene expression and protein quantity was reduced at cellular level of the NPA, while its secreted levels were increased in basal samples from infected newborns and in SAEC stimulated with poly:IC. Our findings highlight the importance of filaggrin as a factor facilitating RVIs.

AB  - Previous studies showed that increased urinary Beta 2-microglobulin (beta2-M) level is associated with fetal inflammatory response and successfully predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We aimed to investigate the clinical utility of serum beta2-M levels to predict BPD in preterm infants. Infants born between May and November 2018 and whose gestational age (GA) was <32 weeks were included into the study. During routine blood work in the first couple of hours of life an extra 0.5 mL blood was drawn to study beta2-M levels later on. beta2-M levels were compared between infants who developed BPD or not. Data analysis of 111 infants was performed. Out of 111 infants, 37 died before BPD diagnosis and out of the rest 74 infants, 38 (34.2%) were diagnosed with BPD. Mean GA was 28 +/- 1.8 and 29.9 +/- 1.4 weeks (p < 0.01) and mean birth weights (BW) were 1,086 +/- 316 and 1,395 +/- 348 g (p < 0.01) in BPD group and without BPD respectively. Demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. While the white blood cell count, CRP and IL-6 levels were similar in both groups, beta2-M levels were significantly higher in BPD group (4.84 +/- 1.0 and 3.79 +/- 0.95 mg/L, p = 0.01). Furthermore a weak correlation between beta2-M level and BPD was observed (r = 0.23, p = 0.04). Serum beta2-M levels which obtained in the early postnatal life could predict developing BPD. Monitoring beta2-M levels in infants who have high clinical risk factors for BPD development may provide additional benefit in predicting BPD. Copyright © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Asthma is the most common pediatric lung disease characterized by an inflammatory activation of T helper (Th) 2 cells. Evidence suggests a similar skewing of Th2 cells in premature neonates who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Being that many neonates with BPD develop asthma, the objective of this study was to test the significance of an asthma transcriptomic signature in neonates with BPD. Methods Used: We tested the applicability of a previously derived asthma transcriptomic signature (n = 10 genes) in a publicly available whole microarray data set of 111 very low birthweight neonates. The transcriptomic signatures were evaluated over three timepoints (days 5, 14, and 28) using generalized estimating equations. Next, we validated our findings in blood and lung tissue samples of extremely preterm baboons. Summary of Results: The median gestational age and birthweight of the premature cohort was 27.8 weeks (SD:2.5) and 1029 g (SD:290), respectively. Sixty-eight (61%) neonates developed BPD (defined per the NICHD criteria). The asthma transcriptomic signature predicted severe BPD on day of life 5 with an area under the curve of 88%. The figure below demonstrates the discriminatory ability of the transcriptomic signature across BPD severity. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) 5 and IL-6, as well as lung levels of Th2-driven inflammatory cytokines, were elevated in our ventilator-induced BPD model of baboons. [Figure presented] Conclusion(s): Our study provides novel evidence suggesting a shared genetic component in the pathophysiologic processes involving BPD and asthma.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in preterm neonates. The current definitions of BPD do not take into consideration the molecular changes occurring in the lung. The purpose of this study was to create subclasses of BPD using an unbiased approach derived from gene expression data to potentially uncover patterns underpinning this complex disease. Methods Used: Using publicly available data, we analyzed whole blood microarray gene expression from 97 neonates at three times points (day 5, 14 and 28). Of neonates with a gestational age <32 weeks and birth weight =1500 g, 67 developed BPD (69.1%) when defined as oxygen exposure for least 28 days. Regression modeling was performed to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point and then across all timepoints. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was utilized to separate significant genes and enriched gene ontology pathways associating with BPD. Summary of Results: From an initial set of 33 252 genes per patient, 10 875 genes were significantly expressed at any time point (false discovery rate <0.05). One hundred and nine genes were significant across all 3 time points. Differentially expressed genes localized to the cell membrane (fold enrichment [FE] 28.3) and endoplasmic reticulum (FE 24.8), and highlighted the ribosomal pathway (cytosolic ribosome and ribosome subunit with adjusted p-values of 4.6 x 10-21 and 2.2 x 10-18, respectively). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that in preterm neonates, genomic expression within the first month of life points towards ribosome homeostasis as an overarching theme in the development of BPD. Bioinformatic analyses are novel approaches that may help uncover patterns underlying complex neonatal diseases.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extreme prematurity. Existing definitions of BPD rely heavily upon clinical and phenotypic characteristics. A bioinformatic approach towards identifying BPD subclasses may offer better insight into molecular pathways that contribute to the disease process. The aim of this study was to use whole genome expression data to stratify BPD into molecular subclasses (e.g. endotypes) and pathways that associate with phenotypic outcomes. Methods Used: A secondary analysis of whole microarray data from premature neonates (?1500 g) at day of life five was performed. An unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering was conducted to identify optimal number of endotypes. A model based on least-squares minimization with empirical Bayes statistics was used to discover genes that were differentially expressed. Pathways of these genes were determined using a gene ontologic software program. Next, a machine learning (ML) model was utilized to highlight the optimal set of genes that could discriminate between the endotypes. Summary of Results: Among 62 neonates with BPD (per the NICHD definition), 61% (n = 38) were male, 54% (n = 34) had mild BPD, and 46% (n = 28) had moderate/ severe BPD. Three distinct endotypes (A, B, C) were identified. Compared to endotypes A and C, endotype B had a lower median birth weight (690 g vs 950 g(A) and 835 g(C)) and had a median gestational age of 28 weeks [IQR 26-29weeks]. Endotypes B and C had higher rates of moderate/severe BPD compared to endotype A (62% vs 53%(B) and 7.7%(C)). From 4000 genes (p-adjusted value <1%), 12 ontologic processes were generated (Figure). A random forest ML algorithm yielded 121 genes that best classified the endotypes. [Figure presented] Figure: 12 distinct ontologic processes generated from 4000 genes Conclusion(s): Unsupervised clustering of genome-wide expression data can potentially subclassify BPD into molecular pathways that associate with clinical data and outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication after preterm birth that is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has been identified as a biomarker for neuroaxonal damage in preterm infants, but its relation with BPD has not yet been established. We hypothesized that BPD is associated with increased NfL levels at an early stage, indicative of early neuroaxonal damage. Method(s): In this prospective observational study we included preterm infants born <30 weeks of gestation, admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Amsterdam UMC between October 2019 and March 2021. Serum NfL levels were determined using Simoa assay in cord blood and blood obtained at postnatal days 3, 7 and 14. Linear regression analysis was used to compare NfL levels between infants with moderate/severe BPD (BPD group) and infants with no/mild BPD (no BPD group), while linear mixed model analysis was performed to assess the effect of time on NfL levels between the two groups. Next, analyses were adjusted for gestational age (GA) and small for gestational age (SGA). Result(s): Sixty-seven infants with a GA of 27+/-1.3 weeks were included for analysis, of whom 19 infants (28%) developed moderate/ severe BPD. Although the NfL levels were significantly higher at every time point in the BPD group, statistical significance was lost after adjusting for GA and SGA (Table 1). No differences were found between the groups in NfL change over time. Conclusion(s): We showed that the positive association between BPD and NfL among preterm infants in their first weeks of life could be explained by GA and SGA rather than by the development of BPD.

AB  - Objective: To explore the diagnostic value of IGF-1 and IL-18 in premature infants with BPD. Method(s): Through a prospective observational study, the serum samples of infants in the BPD group and the non-BPD group were collected at different targeted time points, and the serum IGF-1 and IL-18 concentrations were dynamically monitored by ELISA. The Student t-test and one-way analysis of variance were adopted to analyze data, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to test the diagnostic value. Result(s): A total of 90 VLBW premature infants admitted to NICU between January 2020 and 2021 were finally included. Compared with the non-BPD group, infants diagnosed with BPD had a significantly lower serum concentration of IGF-1 (P < 0.05) but a higher level of IL-18 (P < 0.05) on days 1, 7, 14, and 28 after birth. With the ROC curve analysis, the serum concentration IGF-1 on day 14 and IL-18 on day 28 reported high sensitivity and specificity to predict the risk of BPD (IGF-1: sensitivity: 89.29%, specificity: 77.78%, AUC: 0.8710; IL-18: sensitivity: 53.57%, specificity: 83.33%, AUC: 0.7887). And more substantial predictive power was found in combined analysis of IGF-1 and serum IL-18 on day 14: the sensitivity was 91.07% and the specificity was 83.33%, with the AUC of 0.9142. Conclusion(s): IGF-1 and IL-18 might be closely involved in the occurrence and development of BPD. The serum concentration of IGF-1 combined with IL-18 could be potentially sensitive markers for the early diagnosis and severity of BPD.Copyright 2022 Huang, Guo, Cheng, Wang, Chen and Shi.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity complicating preterm birth and affects long-term respiratory outcomes. The objectives of this study were to establish whether serum periostin at birth, day of life (DOL) 28, and corrected 36 weeks' gestational age could be potential biomarkers for BPD. Method(s): A total of 98 preterm Japanese infants born at <32 weeks and comparing 41 healthy controls born at term, were divided into BPD (n = 44) and non-BPD (n = 54) cohorts. Serum periostin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Result(s): Among 98 preterm infants, the median serum periostin levels at birth were higher with BPD (338.0 ng/mL) than without (275.0 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that serum periostin levels at birth were significantly associated with BPD (P = 0.013). Serum periostin levels at birth with moderate/severe BPD (345.0 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those with non-BPD/mild BPD (283.0 ng/mL, P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): Serum periostin levels were significantly correlated with birth weight and gestational age, and serum periostin levels at birth in BPD infants were significantly higher than that in non-BPD infants. Impact: This study found higher serum periostin levels at birth in preterm infants subsequently diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.It also emerged that serum periostin levels at birth significantly correlated with gestational age and birth weight.The mechanism by which serum periostin is upregulated in BPD infants needs further investigation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The poor survival rate of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) transplanted into recipient lungs greatly limits their therapeutic efficacy for diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) overexpression on improving the potential for bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) to confer resistance against hyperoxia-induced cell injury., METHODS: 80% O2 was used to imitate the microenvironment surrounding-transplanted cells in the hyperoxia-induced lung injury in vitro. BMSC proliferation and apoptotic rates and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. The effects of Trx-1 overexpression on the level of antioxidants and growth factors were investigated. We also investigated the activation of apoptosis-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)., RESULT: Trx-1 overexpression significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced BMSC apoptosis and increased cell proliferation. We demonstrated that Trx-1 overexpression upregulated the levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase as well as downregulated the production of ROS. Furthermore, we illustrated that Trx-1 protected BMSCs against hyperoxic injury via decreasing the ASK1/P38 MAPK activation rate., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that Trx-1 overexpression improved the ability of BMSCs to counteract hyperoxia-induced injury, thus increasing their potential to treat hyperoxia-induced lung diseases such as BPD.

AB  - The aim of the research was to study the polymorphism of the genes of the detoxification system and genes of the main histocompatibility complex HLA class II in premature infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g and a gestation period of less than 32 weeks. Materials and methods of research: 103 extremely premature infants without congenital malformations, having respiratory disorders and requiring respiratory therapy in one volume or another, were under observation. All children were divided into 2 groups: 1st - 81 extremely premature babies with favorable outcome (recovery); 2nd - 22 children with unfavorable outcome (death, disability). Result(s): an association was established between the presence of DQA1*0301 alleles in the genotype and the development of unfavorable outcome in extremely premature infants with respiratory pathology (p=0.041). In addition, the genotype GSTM1+/+ GSTT1+/+ DRB1*13 DQA1*0301 DQB1*0602 was determined only in children with poor outcomes (p=0.041). The presence of genotypes GSTM1 - GSTT1+/+ DRB1*11 DQA1*0501 DQB1*0301 and GSTM1 - GSTT1+/+ DRB1*15 DQA1*0102 DQB1*0602 17 times, and the presence of the DQA1*0401 allele 8 times increases the risk of death (p=0.028).Copyright © 2022 The authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common inflammation-related neonatal diseases of prematurity affecting approximately 50% of extremely preterm infants. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in breast milk (BM) may predispose the offspring to inflammation through immunological modulation. In addition, omega(n)-6 and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) play a critical role in lung development. We aimed to test the role of BM cytokines, and n-6 and n-3 LC-PUFAs in the development of BPD in preterm infants in the first month of life. Fifty-two infants born less than 28 weeks from the Nutrition and Infant Health program were enrolled at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA). Inclusion criteria were infant on full enteral feedings at day 14, receiving greater than 70% of mother's BM, and feeding samples available at day 14 and day 28. BPD was defined as a need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (62.3% in the cohort). In feeding samples, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 levels were determined by semiquantitative enzyme-linked Immuno-Assay and arachidonic (ARA), alpha-linolenic (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) were quantified by GC/MS. The association between cytokines and LC-PUFAs with BPD was tested by multivariate logistic regression models using a stepwise time-oriented approach, adjusted for maternal/ neonatal variables. In feeding samples at day 14, ARA, ALA, EPA, and DHA levels, but not ARA:DHA or n-3:n-6 ratios, were significantly lower in BPD infants compared to non-BPD. At day 28, in feeding samples the level of MCP-1 was significantly higher in BPD than non- BPD infants. Adjusted models at day 14 corroborated the protective association between EPA (aOR=0.65 [0.41; 0.90]; P=0.027) and DHA (aOR=0.51 [0.25; 0.91]; P=0.039) with BPD. In the first month of life, low BM n-3 LC-PUFAs, and potentially later an increase in MCP-1, were biomarkers of BPD development. Lipids and cytokines are part of a network of metabolites that needs to be explored in depth. Additionally, the exposure to bioactive compounds should be explored.

AB  - RATIONALE: Tracheal aspirate (TA) is non-invasive biofluid, easily obtained in intubated preterm infants. Its transcriptomic expression has been studied in complications of prematurity including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (1). However, TAs can be difficult to obtain in non-intubated infants. This study examines saliva as non-invasive source for microRNAs (miRNA) analysis in the preterm infants at risk for BPD. METHODS : This cross-sectional study included six extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks gestation), who later were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate BPD. TAs were obtained at multiple time points along with saliva using DNA Genotek saliva collection swabs within 30 days of delivery. Exosomes were isolated from TAs samples using ExoQuick reagent and total RNAs were extracted, and all circulating RNAs were extracted from saliva samples using Quick-RNA Microprep (Zymo Research). Small RNA-sequencing libraries were prepared from using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit (QIAGEN), per manufacturer instructions (2). The resulting multiplexed high-throughput sequencing data was mapped and UMI analysis conducted via the GeneGlobe Data Analysis Center (QIAGEN). The DESeq2 R package (REF) was used to identify miRNA features with similar expression patterns between paired TA and saliva samples (which might serve as non-invasive markers of BPD). Similarly expressed miRNAs were those with adjusted p-value > 0.1 (calculated by the Benjamini-Hochberg method) and fold change < 2. The list of similarly expressed small RNAs was analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for functional enrichment (3). RESULTS We isolated 939 miRNAs from TA exosomes, and 917 of these were also expressed in the salivary samples. We identified 161 miRNAs as similarly expressed in both TA and saliva samples with high correlation (r=0.97). IPA Bioinformatic analysis of the 161 similarly expressed exosomal miRNAs in TAs and salivary samples identified organismal injury and abnormalities as the top disease, cellular development as the top molecular function and organismal development as the top physiological system development and function. CONCLUSIONS Our study establishes feasibility of saliva collection in extreme preterm infants born < 28 weeks of gestation at less than 30 days of age. Although TA and saliva are distinct biofluids, arising from lower airway and upper airway microenvironments, we isolated 161 miRNAs similarly expressed in both biofluids. These miRNAs may represent non-coding RNA signals that regulate pathways of organismal growth, development and injury throughout the infant respiratory tract. Noninvasive measurement of these miRNAs in the saliva of extreme preterm infants with BPD may provide molecular information about pulmonary disease. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common causes of death and morbidity in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. It is characterized by exposure to environmental stimuli such as: mechanical ventilationpressure, volume; hyperoxia; and inflammation; within a background of genetic susceptibility. Impaired lung development affects the respiratory epithelium, the vascular endothelium, and the extracellular matrix. The Hippo signaling pathway is known to play a key role in tissue growth suppression and modulation in lung development, physiology, and injury. Specifically, variants of yes-associated protein (YAP), transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and transcription enhancer factor (TEA/ATTS) domain (TEAD) are important regulators of the Hippo pathway and are associated with changes in lung function in asthma and in small-cell lung cancer. Perturbations to YAP, TAZ and TEAD of the Hippo pathway result in altered pulmonary tissue growth and vascular development. Because alterations in pulmonary lung and vascular development are also characteristic of BPD, we hypothesize that genetic variants in YAP, TAZ and TEAD of the Hippo pathway are associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. Methods Used DNA extracted from buccal swabs collected from ELBW infants following IRB-approved parental consent was subjected to allelic discrimination using specific Taqman probes for rs10895256, rs2846836, rs1820453, rs16861979, rs2304733, rs6918698 and rs11225163 during RT-PCR. Statistics included Chi-square, t-test, and z-test, with significant p value 0.05. Summary of Results Demographic characteristics did not differ between those with BPD and those without BPD except for gestational age and postnatal steroids (table 1). TEAD variant rs2304733 was found to have a significantly different genotype distribution in the BPD group compared to the Non-BPD group (p=0.05) (table 2). There were no statistical differences in the genotype distributions of the other YAP1 or TAZ variants tested. Conclusions The TEAD variant rs2304733 is associated with BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that while preterm birth perturbs the HIPPO pathway and accelerates pulmonary growth suppression, this specific TEAD genetic variant may play a role in modulating YAP/TAZ nuclear localization, contributing to increased susceptibility to BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study Extremely preterm infants born under 28 weeks of gestation are at risk of developing the acute pulmonary disease of prematurity as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and chronic disease as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Meanwhile, there are no sensitive biomarkers available to identify the transition from RDS to BPD, predict prognosis and monitor therapeutic response. One promising biomarker may be present in circulating extracellular vesicles (EV). Secreted by cells into biological fluids, EVs are nanoparticles that play an important role in local and systemic cell-to-cell communication by transporting genetic (microRNA, DNA) and protein cargo to distal recipient cells. As a suitable liquid biopsy, EVs encapsulate molecular information cargo in a bilayer lipid membrane that is stable to freezing and thawing and protects from degradation. However, EVs are not well characterized in extremely preterm infants. In this study, we sought to investigate the proteomic profile of EVs from preterm infants at risk for BPD. Methods Used Preterm infants born under 28-week gestation and 1500-gram birth weight at Penn State Children's Hospital NICU are consented to and included in the study. Infants with chromosomal abnormalities, congenital heart disease, or multisystem organ failure were excluded from the study. Blood and tracheal aspirates were collected from the infants within 7 days of life. EVs were isolated using the pureEXO precipitation kit (101Bio, CA, USA). The isolated EVs were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western blot analysis of EV markers CD63, HSP70, and Flotillin. EV size distribution and concentration were quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The EV proteomic profile was investigated by mass spectrometry analysis and identification tools. Venn diagrams and protein ontology classifications analysis was performed using the functional enrichment analysis tool (FunRich). This ongoing study is approved by the IRB at Penn State College of Medicine Summary of Results EVs were successfully isolated from extremely preterm infants' biofluids collected from blood and tracheal aspirates as indicated by morphological, biophysical (figure 1), and biochemical criteria. In addition, protein comparison and ontology analysis of mass spectrometry data revealed unique proteins and enrichment of proteins involved in BPD samples compared to EV proteins in Exocarta and Vesiclepedia databases (figure 2). Conclusions We report the successful isolation of EVs from biofluids of extremely preterm infants. BPD EVs are a promising approach to identify biomarkers and obtain a mechanistic understanding of disease related to prematurity and the development of BPD. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Oxidative stress is regarded as a key regulator in the pathogenesis of prolonged hyperoxia-induced lung injury, which causes injury to alveolar epithelial cells and eventually leads to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Many studies have shown that hydrogen has a protective effect in a variety of cells. However, the mechanisms by which hydrogen rescues cells from damage due to oxidative stress in BPD remains to be fully elucidated. This study sought to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on hyperoxia-induced lung injury and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) were divided into four groups: control (21% oxygen), hyperoxia (95% oxygen), hyperoxia + hydrogen, and hyperoxia + hydrogen + LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor). Proliferation and apoptosis of AECIIs were assessed using MTS assay and flow cytometry (FCM), respectively. Gene and protein expression were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and western blot analysis. Stimulation with hyperoxia decreased the expression of P-Akt, P- FoxO3a, cyclinD1 and Bcl-2. Hyperoxic conditions increased levels of Bim, Bax, and Foxo3a, which induced proliferation restriction and apoptosis of AECIIs. These effects of hyperoxia were reversed with hydrogen pretreatment. Furthermore, the protective effects of hydrogen were abrogated by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. The results indicate that hydrogen protects AECIIs from hyperoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibiting apoptosis factors and promoting the expression of anti-apoptosis factors. These effects were associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of 14 cytokine gene polymorphisms with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) among Han Chinese newborns. The 14 polymorphisms investigated were IL18 rs1946519, rs1946518, rs187238, rs360718, and rs360717 polymorphisms, IL10 rs3024493 polymorphism, IL6 rs1800795, rs1800796, and rs1800797 polymorphisms, TNF rs361525 and rs1800629 polymorphisms, and TGFB1 rs1800469, rs1800468, and rs1800471 polymorphisms., WORKING HYPOTHESIS: The polymorphisms could be associated with the risk of BPD among Han Chinese newborns., STUDY DESIGN, PATIENT-SUBJECT SELECTION, AND METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective study. Genotyping of these polymorphisms were performed on BPD cases (N = 1022) and non-BPD controls (N = 1039) who were ascertained using the established Jobe and Bancalari criteria. The odds ratios (ORs) of polymorphisms whose genotype distribution in the controls fulfilled the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were calculated to evaluate the strengths of genetic association., RESULTS: Genotype distributions of IL6 rs1800795 and rs1800797 polymorphisms deviated significantly from HWE and were omitted from the analysis. Among the 12 remaining polymorphisms, only TNF rs361525 polymorphism demonstrated a statistically significant association with BPD risk. The heterozygous GA genotype of TNF rs361525 polymorphism showed an OR of 1.932 (1.512-2.470), while the homozygous AA variant genotype showed an OR of 2.927 (1.216-7.048) (P = 0.000 and P = 0.017, respectively). Besides, the allelic OR was also analyzed, and it was found that the variant A allele of TNF rs361525 polymorphism showed an OR of 2.146 (1.718-2.680) (P = 0.000)., CONCLUSION: TNF rs361525 polymorphism could influence BPD risk among Han Chinese newborns.

AB  - A prospective study was performed to investigate the effects of hyperoxia on the expression of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) proteins, and to examine interactions between these proteins in premature neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from residual venous blood samples of 20 premature infants with BPD and 20 gender-matched premature infants without BPD (non-BPD group). Expression levels of SUMO and SIRT1 proteins in PBMCs were assessed by western blot analysis, and their interactions in PBMCs were detected using the immunoprecipitation assay. Based on the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) administered, neonates were divided into normoxia, low-(21%<FiO2<30%), medium-(30%<=FiO2<40%) and high-oxygen (FiO2>=40%) groups. Expression levels of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 proteins in the normoxia group were significantly lower than those in the medium- or high-oxygen groups (P<0.01), but were comparable to those in the low-oxygen group. SIRT1 expression levels in both the medium- and high-oxygen groups were significantly lower than those in the normoxia group (P<0.01). In the BPD group, the expression of SIRT1 protein was significantly lower (P<0.01), and its interaction with SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 was significantly attenuated compared with that in the non-BPD group (P<0.01). Supplemental oxygen with FiO2>=30% was associated with upregulation of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 expression and downregulation of SIRT1 expression. The present findings suggest that decreased SIRT1 expression and its SUMOylation by SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 may be associated with the development of BPD.

AB  - The study investigates the role of the oxidative and proteolytic inactivation of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected on the 3rd day of life from mechanically ventilated neonates with gestational age <= 30 weeks and analyzed without previous treatment (top-down proteomics) by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. AAT fragments were identified by high-resolution LTQ Orbitrap XL experiments and the relative abundances determined by considering the extracted ion current (XIC) peak area. Forty preterm neonates were studied: 20 (50%) did not develop BPD (no-BPD group), 17 (42.5%) developed mild or moderate new-BPD (mild + moderate BPD group), and 3 (7.5%) developed severe new-BPD (severe BPD group). Eighteen fragments of AAT and a fragment of AAT oxidized at a methionine residue were identified: significantly higher values of AAT fragments 25-57, 375-418, 397-418, 144-171, and 397-418 with oxidized methionine were found in the severe BPD group. The significantly higher levels of several AAT fragments and of the fragment 397-418, oxidized in BALF of preterm infants developing BPD, underlie the central role of an imbalance between proteases and protease inhibitors in exacerbating lung injury and inducing most severe forms of BPD. The study has some limitations, and between them, the small sample size implies the need for further confirmation by larger studies.© Copyright © 2021 Tirone, Iavarone, Tana, Lio, Aurilia, Costa, Castagnola, Messana and Vento.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extremely preterm birth. This study was aimed at detecting cytokine and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels to evaluate their mechanisms and predicted significance for BPD. Preterm infants born at gestational age<=32 weeks were recruited, and clinical data were collected. We detected ten cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha on Days 1-3, Days 7-14, and Days 21-28 after birth by using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology. The FeNO levels of infants were measured when they met the discharge criteria. A total of 46 preterm infants were enrolled, consisting of 14 infants in BPD group and 32 infants in the control group. The gestational age (27.5+/-1.3 vs. 29.9+/-1.3 weeks) and birth weight (1021+/-261 g vs. 1489 +/- 357 g) were lower in the BPD group. The following were high-risk factors for BPD, as determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis: gestational age<30 weeks, birth weight<1000 g, PDA, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher FeNO. The cytokines of IL-6 and IL-8 on Days 7-14 and IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha on Days 21-28 were also high-risk factors for BPD. IL-6 contributed to BPD disease severity. Conclusion. The preterm infants with PDA and prolonged mechanical ventilation tended to develop BPD. The IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased on Days 7-14 and were high-risk factors for BPD. Moreover, the IL-6 level was associated with BPD disease severity. We speculated that NO was related to BPD via Th2 cell-mediated inflammatory responses such as IL-4 and IL-6. Cytokines might predict the occurrence of BPD.Copyright © 2021 Zhenjie Zhang et al.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in neonates, for which no specific preventive or therapeutic agent is available. Here we show that lung micro-RNA (miR)-34a levels are significantly increased in lungs of neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia. Deletion or inhibition of miR-34a improves the pulmonary phenotype and BPD-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in BPD mouse models, which, conversely, is worsened by miR-34a overexpression. Administration of angiopoietin-1, which is one of the downstream targets of miR34a, is able to ameliorate the BPD pulmonary and PAH phenotypes. Using three independent cohorts of human samples, we show that miR-34a expression is increased in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome and BPD. Our data suggest that pharmacologic miR-34a inhibition may be a therapeutic option to prevent or ameliorate HALI/BPD in neonates.

AB  - Background: BPD is a common lung disease whose prevalence continues to rise with the increasing survival of ELBWs. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, with a strong genetic foundation. Genetic variants of FAM13A are associated with multiple human lung pathological conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and lung cancer. In our previous study, FAM13A SNP (rs2609255) was found to be associated with BPD in ELBWs. While FAM13A's function is still unknown, 3 possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) acting as a signal transduction gene, as its significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie within an intronic region downstream of a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain, which is important for regulation of cell proliferation and survival; (2) activating Wnt signaling pathway, which has a role in airway and alveolar epithelial development as well as repair; and (3) regulating carnitine palmitoyl transferase-fatty acid oxidation, which plays a role in regulating reactive oxygen species production, contributing to lung epithelial cell death. FAM13A protein level expression is increased in COPD patients. Objective(s):To determine if airway expression of FAM13A protein is higher in ELBW infants with BPD compared to NonBPD. Method(s):DNA from buccal swabs of ELBWs were collected, isolated, and analyzed with RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probes for rs2013701, rs2609264, rs2869967, rs7671167, rs2609261, rs6837671, rs6830970, rs2609260, rs1458551, rs7682431, rs1903003, rs17014601& rs2609255 following parental consent. BPD was defined as O2 dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Tracheal aspirates were collected from intubated infants within first 7 days of life. FAM13A airway protein concentrations were measured with ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, t-test, and z-test, with significant p < 0.05. Result(s):In our previous study, BPD infants were born earlier (p<0.001) and at lower birth weight (p<0.001). For rs2609255, there is a significant difference (p=0.04) in genotype distributions between BPD & NonBPD, although this difference was not independent from prematurity following multiple logistic regression analysis. Infants with BPD had higher airway concentrations of FAM13A [median (IQR) 138.5 (0-499) pg/ml] than those with NonBPD [0 (0-0) pg/ml; (p=0.013)]. Conclusion(s):FAM13A rs2609255 is associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. Airway expression of FAM13A in the first week of life was increased in ELBW infants who progressed to BPD. We speculate that this early increased FAM13A protein expression contributes to impaired alveolar epithelial development and subsequent BPD in ELBW infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely low birthweight infants consists of interrupted lung alveolar and microvascular development. Strategies that minimize the interruption of microvascularization are critically needed. Animal and clinical studies suggest Vitamin A (retinoic acid, RetA) and Nitric Oxide (NO) may benefit lung microvascularization in BPD. We showed that exposure to combined NO and RetA in O2-treated endothelial cells improved endothelial tube formation compared to 02 alone. The molecular pathways for positive microvascular effects of RetA plus NO are not understood. We hypothesize that moderate 02 exposure alters the balance of a set of angiogenic and angiostatic proteins impacting lung microvascular development, and that combined treatment with RetA+NO partially rectifies the O2-induced developmental imbalance. Gestational day 19 fetal mouse lung endothelial cells (ATCC) were cultured in Room Air (RA), 02 (0.4 FiO2), or O2+/-NO (1Oppm) +/- RetA (10-8) for 48 hours. A targeted protein microarray of angiogenesis regulatory proteins was used to analyze 32 angiogenic and 11 angiostatic proteins in cell lysates. Treatment responses were analyzed using R and Python. Significant changes were identified by multivariate analysis with a FDR of 0.01. Parallel coordinate plots showed that 02 alone, O2+RetA, O2+NO, and combined therapy (O2+RetA+NO) elicited response patterns distinct from each other and from RA. On multivariate analysis, 30 proteins were significantly altered by exposure to 0.4 FiO2 compared to RA. Among these 30 proteins, 19 angiogenic proteins were increased and 6 decreased; 2 angiostatic proteins were increased and 3 were decreased. Eight proteins (Table) were significantly altered by exposure to combined therapy with O2+NO+RetA compared to 02 alone. Five of the 8 proteins altered by combined therapy were also impacted by 02 alone, with all showing combined therapy reversed the 02 effect except IP1O which was further decreased by combined therapy. Three angiogenic proteins modified by combined therapy were not significantly impacted by 02 alone. O2-induced alterations in microvascular development in immature lung, and correction thereof, is a complex balancing of angiogenic and angiostatic signals. Moderate 02 exposure profoundly impacts a subset of vasculogenic regulatory proteins in fetal lung endothelial cells. Concomitant therapy with NO+RetA during 0.4 FiO2 exposure partially reverses 02 effects, and also impacts some vasculogenic proteins not changed by 02 alone. This work suggests that combined NO+RetA therapy might rebalance a subset of proteins controlling positive and negative angiogenic pathways in microvascular formation that are disrupted in developing lungs exposed to 02.

AB  - Introduction: Hyperoxia-induced injury is a common form of damage in lung tissues, which could lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in newborns. Recent studies have discovered that FOXA2 played a substantial role in protecting lung tissues from various injuries and lncRNA-NEF could activate the expression of FOXA2. However, it is unclear whether lncRNA-NEF could alleviate hyperoxia-caused damage of lung tissues by activating FOXA2. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, we used the lentivirus to establish the lncRNA-NEF overexpression RLE-6TN and MLE-12 cells. After that, the lentivirus was also used to knockdown the expression of FOXA2 in the two lncRNA-NEF overexpression cells. ELISA was performed to detect the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. The production of ROS, SOD, MDA and LDH was determined with the commercial kits. The apoptosis rates of these cells were measured with the flow cytometry. Result(s): The secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 was inhibited in RLE-6TN and MLE-12 cells after the overexpression of lncRNA-NEF. Furthermore, the production of ROS, MDA and LDH was also suppressed after the upregulation of lncRNA-NEF. The promotion of lncRNA-NEF also restricted the hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. However, the knockdown of FOXA2 abolished all the inhibitory effects exerted by lncRNA-NEF. Conclusion(s): LncRNA-NEF regulated hyperoxia-caused inflammatory response, oxidative damage and apoptosis of RLE-6TN and MLE-12 cells by affecting the expression of FOXA2.Copyright © 2020 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Circular RNA (circRNA) has been increasingly proven as a new type of promising therapeutic RNA molecule in a variety of human diseases. However, the role of circRNA in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not yet been elucidated. Here, a new circRNA circABCC4 was identified from the Agilent circRNA chip as a differentially expressed circRNA in BPD. The relationship between circABCC4 level and BPD clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The function of circABCC4 was evaluated by performing CCK-8 and apoptosis analysis in vitro and BPD model analysis in vivo. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), luciferase reporter and rescue experiments were used to elucidate the interaction between circABCC4 and miR-663a. Luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to elucidate the interaction between PLA2G6 and miR-663a. CircABCC4 and PLA2G6 levels were increased, while miR-663a levels were decreased in the BPD group, compared to the control group. MiR-663a inhibited apoptosis by repressing PLA2G6 expression, while circABCC4 enhanced the apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells by sponging miR-663a and increasing PLA2G6 expression. In conclusion, circABCC4 promotes the evolving of BPD by spongening miR-663a and up-regulating PLA2G6 expression, which makes circABCC4 an ideal molecular target for early diagnosis and intervention of BPD.© Copyright © 2020 Chen, Feng, Wu, Lu, Banu Pasha, Permall, Chen, Sun, Li, Zhou, Yang, Zhang and Chen.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is associated with post-prematurity respiratory disease (PRD) in survivors of extreme preterm birth. Identifying early biomarkers that correlate with later development of BPD and PRD may provide insights for intervention. In a preterm baboon model, elevated gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is associated with BPD, and GRP inhibition mitigates BPD occurrence. Objective(s): We performed a prospective cohort study to investigate whether urine GRP levels obtained in the first postnatal week were associated with BPD, PRD, and other urinary biomarkers of oxidative stress. Method(s): Extremely low gestational age infants (23-28 completed weeks) were enrolled in a US multicenter observational study, The Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01435187). We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between urine GRP in the first postnatal week and multiple respiratory outcomes: BPD, defined as supplemental oxygen use at 36 + 0 weeks postmenstrual age, and post-PRD, defined by positive quarterly surveys for increased medical utilization over the first year (PRD score). Result(s): A total of 109 of 257 (42%) infants had BPD, and 120 of 217 (55%) had PRD. On adjusted analysis, GRP level more than 80 was associated with BPD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-3.25) and positive PRD score (aOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.35-4.48). Urine GRP levels correlated with duration of NICU ventilatory and oxygen support and with biomarkers of oxidative stress: allantoin and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. Conclusion(s): Urine GRP in the first postnatal week was associated with concurrent urine biomarkers of oxidative stress and with later diagnoses of BPD and PRD.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the current study was to investigate expression levels of serum macrophages MIF and PLTP in neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), examining their value and significance in clinical diagnosis. Method(s): A total of 31 BPD neonatorum cases, admitted from January 2017 to January 2018, were assigned to the experimental group. A total of 31 non-BPD neonatorum cases were assigned to the control group. This study analyzed various data, including gender, gestational age, birth body mass, and times of oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation. Samples of blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected. Expression levels of MIF and PLTP of all subjects in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks after birth were detected via ELISA. ROC curves were plotted in line with expression levels of MIF and PLTP of the two groups the first week after birth. Correlation levels between MIF and PLTP were also determined. Result(s): Gestational ages and birth body masses of the experiment group were substantially lower than the control group. Times of oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation were significantly longer than those of the control group. Differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). At all time-points after birth, levels of MIF in the serum and BALF of the experimental group were higher, while levels of PLTP were lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). According to ROC curves, areas under the MIF curve, and critical values of diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity levels were 0.860 (0.771-0.948), 10.49 ng/mL, 64.52%, and 87.10%, respectively. Levels of PLTP curves were 0.761 (0.641-0.881), 12.89 ng/mL, 64.52%, and 83.87%, respectively. A positive correlation was exhibited between MIF expression in serum and in BALF (r=0.682, P<0.001), as well as PLTP expression in serum and in BALF (r=0.714, P<0.001). A negative correlation was determined between expression levels of serum MIF and serum PLPT in BPD neonatorum cases (r=-0.741, P<0.001), as well as expression levels of MIF and PLTP in BALF (r=-0.576, P<0.001). Conclusion(s): MIF was overexpressed and PLTP was under-expressed in the serum and BALF of BPD neonatorum cases. A negative correlation was exhibited between expression levels of MIF and PLTP. Early detection of serum MIF and serum PLTP expression in BPD neonatorum cases is of diagnostic significance.Copyright © 2020, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alveologenesis is the most important and the least understood phase of lung development. Alveolar defects underlie both neonatal and adult lung diseases. Their arrested development is found in infants with BPD (BronchoPulmonary Dysplasia), while their destruction is characteristic of emphysematous lungs in adult COPD. We have developed 3 parallel, postnatal genetically-based models to analyze the molecular basis of alveologenesis. Conditional postnatal inactivation of genes encoding receptors for TGFb, or PDGFA or IGF1 in a unique cell type we have identified as Secondary Crest Myofibroblasts, or SCMF blocks alveologenesis & produces a phenotype similar to human BPD. We reasoned that due to nearly identical phenotypes, the three BPD phenocopy models must share genetic elements whose role in alveologenesis is indispensable. To test this hypothesis, we have isolated mutant and control SCMF and identified their transcriptomic profile by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data identified "pathway-specific" differentially expressed genes (DEG) for TGFb, PDGFA/PDGFRa and IGF1 mutant models. Most importantly however, as predicted, we identified a cluster of "shared" genes which we propose contains conserved core alveologenesis regulatory genes. The accumulated evidence reveals a constellation of genes that makeup the genetic architecture of alveologenesis in mice with relevance to pathogenesis of BPD in human preterm neonates.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops in 25-40% of BPD patients as a result of pathologic vascular remodeling, and PH is an independent predictor of death in BPD patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator and apoptotic mediator made in the pulmonary endothelium by nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous competitive NOS inhibitor. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) metabolizes the majority of ADMA in vivo and there are two isoforms, DDAH1 and DDAH2. Translational studies from our group analyzed a cohort of BPD patients and identified a potential biomarker, DDAH1 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs480414), that decreased the risk of PH in BPD by 61%. In the present study, we hypothesized that overexpression of DDAH1 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) would lead to greater apoptosis and lower proliferation of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMC) via effects in hPMVEC. We utilized a co-culture system where hPMVEC were transfected with AdDDAH1 or AdGFP control for 24h and then incubated in co-culture with hPASMC for 24h. Analysis included 1) western blot analysis for cleaved and total caspase-3, -8, -9, p21, PCNA, and beta-actin and 2) trypan blue exclusion for viable cell numbers. Transfection of hPMVEC with AdDDAH1 resulted in greater DDAH1 protein expression (n=6, p=0.003) as compared to control. After AdDDAH1 transfection of hPMVEC and co-culture with hPASMC, we found greater cleaved caspase-3 (n=6, p=0.01), greater cleaved caspase-8 (n=6, p=0.03), similar cleaved caspase-9 (n=6, p=0.94), similar p21 (n=6, p=0.7), and similar PCNA (n=3, p=0.82) protein expression as compared to control. After AdDDAH1 transfection of hPMVEC and co-culture with hPASMC, we found lower hPASMC viable cell numbers (n=3, p=0.008) as compared to control. After AdDDAH1 transfection of hPMVEC and co-culture with hPASMC treated with DETA NONOate 250muM or DETA NONOate 250muM + Hemoglobin 100muM, the hPASMC viable cell numbers were lower compared to control (n=3, p=0.001; n=3, p=0.003, respectively). There was no difference detected between DETA NONOate 250muM and DETA NONOate 250muM + Hemoglobin 100muM groups (n=3, p=0.429). In conclusion, DDAH1 overexpression in hPMVEC resulted in greater apoptosis and lower proliferation in hPASMC, consistent with our hypothesis. We propose that DDAH1 is a potential new therapy for BPD-PH via relieving pulmonary vascular endothelial ADMA-inhibition of eNOS, resulting in greater endogenous NO production, greater pulmonary vascular wall apoptosis, and potentially less pathologic vascular remodeling. Future studies will determine if DDAH1 endothelial knockout mice have worse lung function as compared to wild-type, after exposure to BPD-PH model of LPS and hyperoxia.

AB  - PURPOSE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a respiratory complication characterized by abnormal alveolar development in premature infants. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) can induce heat shock protein (HSP) 70, which has cytoprotective effects against various stressors. Here, we investigated whether GGA protected neonatal lungs from hyperoxic stress in a murine BPD model, and measured the serum HSP70 levels in preterm humans treated with oxygen., METHODS: Newborn mice were exposed to >90% oxygen and administered GGA or vehicle alone orally on days 1, 2, and 3 of life. At 2 days of age, HSP70 expression in the lung was determined by western blotting. At 8 days of age, the lungs were processed for histological analysis. Radial alveolar count (RAC) and mean linear intercept (MLI) were measured as parameters of alveolarization. Apoptosis was evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method and cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. Serum HSP70 levels in preterm humans treated with oxygen were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: GGA administration enhanced the HSP70 expression to two-fold compared with normoxia-exposed and vehicle-treated mice. Hyperoxia reduced HSP70 expression, whereas GGA abrogated the effects. Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited more apoptotic cells in lung parenchyma and a more simplified alveolar structure with less RAC and larger MLI than normoxia-exposed mice. GGA suppressed the increase in apoptotic cells and the structural changes of the lungs induced by hyperoxia. Serum HSP70 levels of preterm human infants gradually decreased with age., CONCLUSIONS: GGA may attenuate hyperoxic injury in neonatal lungs and thereby may prevent the development of BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease of prematurity. While inflammation contributes to BPD pathogenesis, mechanisms of neonatal lung injury are poorly understood. IL-33 promotes expression of type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to regulate immune cells. A single study found that the decoy/dominant negative receptor for IL-33 was increased in infants who develop BPD, suggesting that lack of functional IL-33 signaling is pathogenic. Consistent with this hypothesis, a downstream target of IL-33, amphiregulin (Areg) mediates epithelial repair. We investigated the roles of IL-33 and Areg during neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) to model evolving BPD. Human co-cultures were used to evaluate epithelial-monocyte cross-talk. Method(s): IL-33-/-, Areg-/-, and littermate mice were placed in >0.85 FiO2 at PN0. Epithelial cells (EpC) and interstitial monocytes/macrophages (IM) were isolated by FACS. Lung sections were stained with Movat's. Tracheal aspirates were collected from intubated premature infants at the UW NICU, who were eligible if born at <29 weeks GA and <28d old. All donors met criteria for BPD at 36 weeks CGA. Tracheal EpC were cultured in PneumaCult-EX medium and seeded into apical chambers of transwells CD14+CD16- (SP, similar to murine Ly6Chi) and CD14+CD16+ (DP, similar to Ly6Clo) monocytes were isolated by FACS from healthy donor pBMCs and placed in basolateral chambers. IL-33, Areg, and ST2 QPCR were performed on murine lungs/sorted cells and human co-cultures. Result(s): IL-33 is highly expressed in the mouse lung at PN0, with a 2-fold decrease by PN5 (p<0.05). EpC express 1000-fold more IL-33 mRNA than IM, but Ly6Clo and Ly6Chi IM also robustly express IL-33. CD11b-DTR+ depleter mice, lacking ~50% of IM, have increased mortality and alveolar hemorrhage in HILI. In these mice, IL-33 and Areg mRNA are decreased 3- fold (p<0.05) and 1.5-fold (p<0.05), respectively, compared with controls. IL-33-/- mice have impaired survival during HILI and decreased Areg expression (1.5-fold, p<0.05). Lungs from IL- 33-/- and Areg-/- mice demonstrate increased capillary leak and alveolar simplification after 3d of HILI (Figure 1). Tracheal EpC from infants with evolving BPD express 60-fold more Areg than monocytes. Compared with SP, DP express more ST2 and make 2-fold more Areg mRNA (p<0.05) after incubation with rIL-33 for 24h. Co-culture with epithelial cells increases monocyte expression of the IL-33 receptor ST2 20-fold. Conclusion(s): IL-33 and Areg are protective in acute HILI. Epithelial cell co-culture increases IL-33 signaling by monocytes through induction of ST2 IL-33-mediated immunomodulation may be important in BPD pathogenesis (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an extremely common chronic lung disease during infancy. The prevalence has continued to rise with the increasing survival of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates. The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial, with a strong genetic foundation. Recent studies show that the Family with sequence similarity 13, member A (FAM13A) polymorphism is associated with multiple human lung pathological conditions, including chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), asthma, silicosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. The FAM13A gene is located on 4q22 and is comprised of 25 exons. The function of FAM13A is still unknown, but recent studies propose three possible mechanisms for FAM13. One is that FAM13A acts as a signal transduction gene because its significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie within an intronic region downstream of a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain, which is important for the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. The second possible mechanism is that FAM13A is associated with activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which has a role in both airway and alveolar epithelial development as well as repair after injury Finally, FAM13A may regulate the carnitine palmitoyl transferase-fatty acid oxidation that plays a role in regulating the production of reactive oxygen species, which lead to lung epithelial cell death. In this pilot study, we seek to determine the association of FAM13A SNPs with BPD in ELBW infants. Objective(s): We investigated the hypothesis that the FAM13A gene variants rs2609264, rs2869967, rs2013701 and rs2609255 are associated with susceptibility to BPD in ELBW infants Design/Methods: DNA from buccal swabs of ELBW infants were collected, isolated, and analyzed with RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probes for rs2609264, rs2869967, rs2013701 and rs2609255. BPD was defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Parents gave informed consent prior to infant enrollment. Statistical analysis using chi-square, t-test, and ztest were performed, with p < 0.05 denoting significance. Result(s): Patients with BPD were born earlier (p<0.001) and at a lower birth weight (p<0.001) (Table 1). For rs2609255, there is a significantly different genotype distribution between ELBW infants who progress to BPD and those who do not (p=0.04). (Table 2) Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we found a genetic variant of FAM13A to be associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that this genetic variant may influence airway and alveolar development and remodeling (Table Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Angiogenesis plays an important role in pulmonary morphogenesis, and is disrupted in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Mast cells (MCs) derive from circulating progenitors (MCPs) and differentiate to mucosal subtype (MCT) after recruitment to the lung, under the instructions of the local microenvironment. Rarely, under pathological conditions such as in BPD recruited MCPs differentiate to connective tissue subtype (MCTC). Specific cues within the lung which regulate MC subtype are unknown. We hypothesize that MCTC accumulating in the parenchyma of preterm lungs may interfere with pulmonary angiogenesis. Method(s): Primary human cord blood-derived MC, primary human peripheral blood-derived MC and the LUVA human MC line was used as models of MCTC and MCT. The regulation of MC phenotype (MCT/MCTC) by primary human airway epithelial cells, the 16HBE human airway epithelial cell line, the A549 distal human lung epithelial cell line, and primary fetal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (feHPMECs) was studied. Molecular profiles distinguishing MCTLUVA and MCTCLUVA were comprehensively defined by RNAseq. The ability of MC to affect vascular organization during fetal lung development was tested in mouse lung explant cultures. The effect of MC on in vitro tube formation and barrier function was studied using feHPMECs. The mechanistic role of mast cell proteases was tested using specific inhibitors Results: Primary cultures of human MC, and LUVA, assume a predominantly MCTC phenotype in the absence of external stimulus. Airway epithelial cells, but not A549 or feHPMEC, promote the MCT phenotype, which is associated with increased TNFalpha signaling activity. TNFa alone is sufficient to stably reprogram MCTC to the MCT phenotype. MCTCLUVA cells cause vascular dysmorphia, with significant reduction of vascularity, in E16.5 embryonic mouse lung ex vivo. In vitro, MCTCLUVA potentiate feHPMEC interactions, but inhibite feHPMEC tube stability, and disrupted cell-cell junctions. Importantly, MCT LUVA cells do not disrupt angiogenesis ex vivo or in vitro. Serine protease inhibitors ameliorate the ability of MCTCLUVA to alter endothelial cell angiogenic activities both in vitro and ex vivo. Conclusion(s): We identify novel fundamental regulators of mast cell phenotypes, which are associated with different effector functions. Our data suggest MCTC effector functions may directly contribute to disrupted angiogenesis in BPD.

AB  - Antioxidant enzymes may play a significant role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the level of extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) in the serum at days 1 and 7 of life and the risk of developing BPD. The study comprised 103 neonates born before 32 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of <=1500 g. In the investigated group, the median serum SOD3 level at day 1 of life was 4.01 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR) 2.59-5.09 ng/mL] and at day 7 of life 3.13 ng/mL (IQR 2.49-4.34 ng/mL). A statistically significant decrease in the serum SOD3 level was found in the first week of life, P < 0.0001. No correlation was found between the serum SOD3 level at day 1 of life and gestational age R = 0.07, P = 0.4543 and birth weight R = 0.10, P = 0.3083. No statistically significant correlation was found between the dynamics of change in the SOD3 level in serum at days 1 and 7 of life and the risk of BPD development for the definition of BPD at day 28 of life, P = 0.8764 nor at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, P = 0.6598. The study revealed a statistically significant decrease in the serum SOD3 level in the first week of life in very and extremely low birth weight infants born before 32 weeks of gestation. In the clinical setting, no relationship was observed between the level of SOD3 in serum and the risk of developing BPD.Copyright © 2019 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Along with such well-known risk factors for the formation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), such as low birth weight, prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome in the neonatal period, prolonged oxygen dependence, genetic factors play a significant role in the development of this disease in children. In particular, genetic determination of BPD formation is possible in the presence of polymorphisms of proteolytic enzyme genes, cytokine cascade, surfactants, antioxidants, etc. Objective of the research: To identify genetic factors predisposing to BPD formation in premature infants in the Russian Federation and to compare them with clinical and anamnestic risk factors for the formation of this disease. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 200 premature infants born before the 37th week of gestational age. The main group included children with BPD (n=100), the control group - without BPD (n=100). Genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood samples by phenol-chloroform extraction. Further genotyping was performed using real-time PCR on ABI StepOnePlus thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). The study identified possible associations between frequencies of alleles and genotypes of gene variants FGFR4 (rs376618, rs1966265), FGFR2 (rs2981579, rs1219648), SFTPA1 (rs4253527), SFTPA2 (rs121917737, rs121917738), SFTPB (rs137853202), SFTPS (rs121918559, rs121918560, rs121917834, rs34957318, rs121917835, rs121917836, rs121918560), MMP2 (rs7201, rs17301608, rs243865), MMP9 (rs20544, rs3918242, rs17576), MMP12 (rs2276109, rs652438, ), MMP16 (rs2664352), PTPN22 (rs2476601), HLA-DRA (rs9268645), TAGAP (rs1738074), TYK2 (rs34536443, rs2304256), LOC102823878 (rs 694739) and BPD formation. Result(s): Rs652438 and rs694739 variants were associated with BPD formation in premature infants. Significantly more often in the group of premature infants with BPD, compared with the control group, the C allele (p=0,02, OR 1,78 (95% CI 1,09-2,9)), CC genotypes (p=0,03, OR 3,2 (95% CI 0,84-12,18)) and TC (p=0,03, OR 1,39 (95% CI 0,76-2,55)) variant g.102736642T>C (rs652438) of the MMP12 gene and the C allele (p=0,004, OR 1,8 (95% CI 1,21-2,67)), TC genotypes (p=0,0004, OR 1,05 (95% CI 0,57-1,96)) and CC (p=0,0004, OR 3,02 (95% CI 1,32-6,91)) of the rs 694739 variant of the LOC102823878 gene. Conclusion(s): In the era of personified therapy, the detection of gene polymorphisms associated with BPD formation can help develop new strategies for the prevention and treatment of this disease. Further studies of gene variants are necessary to identify the genetic determination of BPD formation in premature infants.Copyright © 2019, Pediatria Ltd. All right reserved.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an important clinical problem for premature infants. Previously, some biomarkers associated with severity of BPD have been studied. In our study, we aimed to investigate the value of interleukin-33 (IL-33) levels as a new biomarker in the follow-up of BPD severity and response to treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Premature infants of <32 weeks of gestational age and birth weight <1,500 g were included in the study. Infants with BPD were divided into moderate and severe BPD groups. Infants without BPD were assigned as the control group. Cord blood samples were taken from both groups immediately after birth. In addition, blood samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis of BPD and after the end of hydrocortisone (HC) treatment to measure IL-33 values in the serum. Result(s): During the study period, a total of 192 infants were eligible: 96 infants in the BPD group and 96 in the control group. Cord IL-33 values were similar between control (1.29 +/- 0.68 pg/mL) and BPD (moderate/severe) (1.31 +/- 0.84 pg/mL) groups (P = 0.813). The levels of IL-33 were higher in BPD group (3.43 +/- 0.98 pg/mL) than in the control group (0.98 +/- 0.51 pg/mL) (P < 0.001). IL-33 values decreased significantly after HC treatment (pretreatment: 3.43 +/- 0.98 pg/mL versus post-treatment: 2.97 +/- 0.28 pg/mL) (P < 0.001). In addition, IL-33 levels were significantly higher in severe BPD (3.91 +/- 1.22 pg/mL) than in moderate BPD (2.82 +/- 0.74) group (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Although the IL-33 level was not predictive of the development of BPD immediately after birth, it may be used as a new biomarker to diagnose, monitor, and follow the response to treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory lung disease of premature infants, with serious short- and long-term consequences. Early identification of premature infants at risk of BPD is critical to preventing the pathogenesis of disease. Thus, in the present study, we recruited 126 premature infants, collected peripheral blood samples at different time points during early life, and measured the concentration of Th1 (MCP-1, IP-10, and MIG) and Th2 (eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, and MCP-4) chemokines in serum. We found serum eotaxin-2 levels were significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group on day 1 [1662 pg/ml vs. 1221 pg/ml, P < 0.05], day 7 [1533 pg/ml vs. 1089 pg/ml, P < 0.05], and day 14 [1246 pg/ml vs. 704 pg/ml, P < 0.05] after birth, and serum MCP-4 levels were also significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group on day 1 [186 pg/ml vs. 128 pg/ml, P < 0.05], day 7 [199 pg/ml vs. 101 pg/ml, P < 0.05], and day 14 [238 pg/ml vs. 106 pg/ml, P < 0.05] of life. Conclusion(s): Increased levels of Th2 chemokines, eotaxin-2, and MCP-4, are associated with BPD in premature infants.What is Known:* The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and it is difficult to predict and prevent.* Previous studies have demonstrated that inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of BPD.What is New:* Increased Th2 chemokines, eotaxin-2 and MCP-4, were associated with BPD in premature infants.* Abnormal Th1/Th2 response in early life maybe associated with the subsequent development of BPD, which provide a new insight to understand the pathogenesis of the disease.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is seen in diseases associated with hypoxia (WHO classification Group 3), and one of those diseases is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is the most common co-morbidity following preterm birth, and the incidence is as high as 100% in babies born at 22 weeks' gestation. There are currently no available preventative or curative therapies for PH associated with BPD. Vascular remodeling is a hallmark of PH diseases including that seen with BPD. The proliferation of pulmonary endothelial cells, as well as release of pro-proliferative substances from endothelial cells that can induce vascular smooth muscle cells to proliferate, are central to the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling in PH. We have previously shown that human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) respond to hypoxia by proliferating. We have also shown that hypoxia-induced proliferation depends on epidermal growth factor (EGF) release resulting in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor proteins, of which there are 4 described and EGFR is also known as ErbB1. We have recently shown that hPMVEC express ErbB2 and ErbB4, but that ErbB3 mRNA and protein are absent in hPMVEC. We hypothesized that hypoxia would also regulate ErbB2 and ErbB4 expression levels in hPMVEC We used standard western blotting techniques to identify ErbB2 and ErbB4 protein levels in fetal hPMVEC incubated in normoxia (21% O2, 5% CO2) or hypoxia (1% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2) at 37degree C for 24 hours. We found that ErbB4 protein levels were similar between normoxic and hypoxic hPMVECs, while ErbB2 protein levels were lower in hypoxic hPMVEC than in normoxic hPMVEC. The absence of change in ErbB4 protein expression levels in hypoxia does not exclude the possibility for alteration in ErbB4 signaling in hypoxia. To begin to explore the role of ErbB4 signaling in hypoxia we determined if the ErbB4 ligand neuregulin-4 would increase protein levels of ErbB4 in hPMVEC and we found that in normoxic hPMVEC addition of neuregulin-4 increased protein levels of ErbB4. To determine if ErbB4 siRNA would knockdown ErbB4 specifically, i.e. without affecting ErbB1 or ErbB2 protein levels, we used an siRNA approach. Results show notable decreased protein expression level of ErbB4 exposed to siRNA as compared to cells exposed to scramble controls, but no notable changes in the expression levels of ErbB2 protein. We speculate that ErbB4 is involved in the hypoxic response of hPMVEC to hypoxia and may represent a potential novel therapeutic target for pulmonary hypertensive disorders associated with hypoxia.

AB  - Background Previous reports have identified decreases in miR-29b levels in preterm infants that go on to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The cause of depressed miR-29b levels is unknown but may reflect an adverse maternal and/or intrauterine environment that led to preterm birth. This study was designed to investigate relationships between antenatal circumstances related to preterm birth and cord blood levels of miR29b. Methods We analyzed 127 cord blood collected from consecutive deliveries (n=114) of liveborn infants born <=30 weeks gestation (median 27.4 weeks: IQR [25.6-29.0]). Data on maternal co-morbidities, antecendants to preterm birth (e.g., preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental inflammation) were collected prospectively. miR-29b levels were measured using RT-PCR and normalized to expression of SP2. Data were analyzed for correlations by Spearman's correlation coefficient or Generalizing Estimating Equations (GEE) for mixed models controlling for twins. Results Preliminary results indicate that miR-29b levels were correlated to umbilical funisitis (p=0.038). Regression analysis revealed miR-29b is associated with intrauterine growth retardation (p=0.011) and pre-term labor (p=0.007). Conclusions miR-29b levels are associated with fetal inflammation and poor fetal growth. Maternal health is also related to fetal inflammation and further analyses of the clinical data is likely to reveal new correlations.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by an arrest in lung development with severe impairment of alveolar septation and vascular development. Premature male neonates are at a greater risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. Neonatal female mice have improved alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development compared to male littermates in a murine model of BPD. Analysis of the pulmonary transcriptome suggests that miR-30a, may modulate these sex-specific differences in gene expression. HIF-1alpha plays an important role in post-natal lung development, especially in recovery from hyperoxic injury and acute lung injury. We hypothesized that differential sex-specific expression of miR-30a is mediated through HIF-1a. Methods Male and female neonatal WT (C57BL6) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (P1-P5; saccular stage of lung development) and euthanized on P7 or P21 after recovery in normoxia. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs; from 18-24 weeks gestation donors; 3 male and 3 female) were obtained from ScienCell (Carlsbad, California). They were cultured in endothelial cell media per protocol. Cells from passage from 3 to 6 were used for experiments. For hyperoxic exposure, cells were incubated in 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 degreeC for upto 72 hours. Cells in normoxia were maintained in air and 5% CO2. miR-30a and Dll4 (miR-30a target) expression was measured. Hif-1a binding to its targets genes (by ChIP-qPCR) and expression was measured in vivo. To further establish potential regulation of miR-30a by Hif-1a, miR-30a expression after Hif-1 a inhibition was measured in neonatal HPMECs. Results Expression of miR-30a was increased and Dll4 decreased on PND21 in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal female mice compared to males. On PND21, hyperoxia-exposed female mice showed a significant increase in Hif-1a binding to target genes compared to room air controls and hyperoxia-exposed male mice. In contrast to male mice, females did not show a decrease in Hif-1a expression at PND21 after early hyperoxia exposure and this was accompanied by a significant decrease in Phd2 expression in female mice, which metabolizes Hif-1a. Motif analysis revealed a hypoxia response element (HRE) [AG]CGTG site 428 base pairs upstream of miR-30a. siRNA mediated loss of Hif-1a expression in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells decreased miR-30a and increased Dll4 mRNA and protein expression. Conclusions Hif-1a mediated differential sex-specific miR-30a expression may contribute to protection from hyperoxic lung injury in female neonatal mice and contribute to the sex-specific differences seen in BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease associated with preterm birth. Our objective was to investigate whether the TNF, IL1B, IL6 genes polymorphisms have influence on BPD susceptibility. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 351 neonates with gestation period less than 32 weeks. Genotyping of IL1B-511 G/A, IL6-174 G/C and TNF-308 G/A variants was performed by Real-time PCR. The statistical differences in genotypes distribution among the groups were compared using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. Result(s): BPD was present in 36 neonates (11.43%). There were no significant differences in the genotypes distribution and allele frequencies for the IL1B and IL6 genes variants between neonates with and without BPD. The frequencies of TNF genotypes were GG 55.6%, GA 38.9% and AA 5.6% in neonates with BPD and GG 79.7%, GA 19.7% and AA 0.6% in neonates without BPD. TNF genotypes frequencies between these groups were statistically significantly different (p=0.001). Also, statistically significant difference was observed in TNF genotypes distribution between neonates with BPD and without BPD by dominant model (GG vs. GA/AA) (p=0.001; RR=2.188, 95% CI 1.428-3.348; OR=3.138, 95% CI 1.539-6.397). After the adjustment for BMW, gestational age, and sepsis, logistic regression confirmed statistically significant association between TNF-308G/A genotypes and development of BPD in premature infants (B=-0.992, p=0.003). TNF-308 A allele is risk factor for BPD (p=0.0007). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that TNF-308 A allele is a risk factor for development of BPD in premature neonates under the 32 weeks.

AB  - Objectives Antioxidant response plays a key role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis. The glutathione-S-tranferases pi 1 (GSTP1) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) detoxification enzymes protect cells from oxidative damage. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the A313G GSTP1 and G516T CYP2B6 inactivating polymorphisms could be associated with BPD susceptibility. Study Design To test this hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study enrolled 138 premature neonates <=32 weeks of gestational age; of the 138, 46 developed BPD and 92 did not develop BPD. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from neonates' peripheral blood and was used as template for GSTP1 and CYP2B6 genotyping using the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. Results Our report provides evidence for a possible pathogenetic role of the G516T CYP2B6 polymorphism in BPD susceptibility. Although no differences in the frequencies of the GSTP1 variant genotypes were noticed between premature neonates who developed BPD and neonates who did not develop BPD, a significantly higher frequency of the GSTP1 polymorphism was observed in extremely low birth weight infants. Despite the small sample size, it is very interesting the fact that all neonates <=1,000 g carrying the homozygous mutant GSTP1 genotype developed BPD. Conclusion Our results underscore the significance of both CYP2B6 and GSTP1 polymorphisms in modulating the risk of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease resulting from injury during postnatal lung development in premature infants. Supplemental oxygen exposure, as used in the NICU, may lead to alveolar simplification but also to loss of bronchial epithelial cilia (Al-Shmgani, 2012). These hair-like projections line the respiratory epithelium and function in clearance of mucus, pathogens, and debris. Mucociliary clearance can be perturbed by ciliary loss and/or dysfunction, which can lead to chronic infection and inflammation. Little is known about the mechanism of hyperoxic ciliary dysfunction in the respiratory tract and its impact in the pathogenesis of BPD. Method(s): Human airway epithelial cells (HAE) were grown at an air liquid interface that closely approximates a normal multiciliated respiratory airway epithelium both structurally and functionally (Whitcuff et al, 1988). The HAE was exposed to 95 % O2/5%CO2 or 5 % CO2 (controls) for up to 48 hours. Cilia length was measured from scanning electron microscopy images using a Matlab  program that measures curved cilia length. Maintenance of the cilia length is a function of intraflagellar transport (IFT), a highly organized protein transport mechanism that is important in ciliary axonemal assembly and lengthening (Hao et al, 2009). IFT involves cilia regulatory proteins including Foxj1, and motor proteins such as kinesin II and dynein II, as well as structural proteins including tubulin (Pooranachandran et al, 2016; Stepanek et al, 2016 ;Takemura et al, 1996). We therefore evaluated the levels of the IFT proteins Kif3b, dynein, acetylated alpha tubulin, and Foxj1 via western blot. Result(s): There was a significant time-dependent reduction (P<0.01) in cilia length after 24 hours of hyperoxia exposure. In addition, there was a significant time-dependent decrease in kinesin II motor protein Kif3b and an increase in Foxj1 after 36 hours of hyperoxia exposure. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that hyperoxia exposure leads to dysfunction in IFT with resultant decreased cilia length. This could result in dysfunctional mucociliary clearance and furthermore chronic infection and inflammation. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of airway dysfunction in patients with BPD could help to develop targets for treatment and prevention focused on IFT.

AB  - Rationale: We have shown that sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1)/sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) signaling contribute to hyperoxia induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) like morphology in neonatal mice. Sphk1-/- mice showed protection against hyperoxic lung injury accompanied by reduced collagen deposition in alveolar septae. Global deletion of Sphk1 in mice reduced expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a matrix modifying enzyme that promotes collagen deposition in lung tissue. Objective(s): To explore the mechanism by which SPHK1/S1P signaling pathway regulates LOX expression and its role in the pathogenesis of BPD. Method(s): Three day old wild type (WT) mouse pups were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia (75% oxygen) for 7 days, while being treated with the SPHK1 inhibitor PF543 or placebo. Lung injury and alveolar simplification was evaluated. LOX expression was determined by Western blotting. In vitro experiments were performed using human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) which were transfected with scrambled or SPNS2, S1P1 or STAT3 siRNA (50 nM, 48 h) to interrogate the S1P signaling pathway. Human tracheal aspirates were studied for LOX expression and S1P levels. Result(s): Tracheal aspirates from new born babies with BPD had significantly increased expression of LOX and elevated S1P levels in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Administration of PF543 (2.5mg/kg body weight) once a day to WT neonatal mice conferred protection against hyperoxia-induced BPD and reduced expression of LOX in lung tissue and LOX activity in BAL fluid. HLMVECs exposed to hyperoxia showed increased expression and activity of LOX in cell lysate and supernatant respectively which was inhibited by PF543. Hyperoxia-induced LOX expression was down regulated by S1P antibody, siRNA for S1P1 and STAT3. Further, PF543 attenuated hyperoxia-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus. Conclusion(s): Downregulation of SPHK1 or inhibition of SPHK1 activity reduced expression of LOX mediated via S1P1 and STAT3 signaling in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury.
