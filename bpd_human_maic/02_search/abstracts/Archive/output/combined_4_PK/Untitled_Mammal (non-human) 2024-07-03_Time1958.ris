AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is histopathologically characterized by alveolar simplification in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated. No treatment is available for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Preterm birth is associated with rapid decline in plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) protein level. We used our preterm lamb model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia to test the hypothesis that recombinant human (rh) IGF-1 bound to binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) will improve structural indices of alveolar formation in mechanically ventilated preterm lambs. Methods Used: Preterm lambs (128d; term ~150d; saccular stage of lung development, ~28w human gestation) were exposed to antenatal steroids, perinatal surfactant, and resuscitated and supported by mechanical ventilation for 7d (Drager VN500, PC-SIMV mode). Physiological targets were PaO2 60-90 mmHg, PaCO2 45-60 mmHg, O2 saturation 88-92%, pH 7.25-7.35. The control group received vehicle (IGF-1 diluent in saline; continuous iv infusion; n=8; 4F 4M). The treated group received rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 (optimized dose of 1.5 mg/Kg/d, iv; n=9; 4F 5M). We used morphometry and stereology to quantify structural indices of alveolar formation. Summary of Results: Radial alveolar count and secondary septal volume density were significantly greater (* p<0.05) in the IGF-1-treated group compared to the control group (Fig 1A and B). Distal airspace wall thickness was not statistically different between the groups (Fig 1C) possibly because of the short period of study. No differences were detected between females and males. Conclusion(s): We conclude that rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 improved indices of alveolar formation in preterm lambs that were mechanically ventilated for 7d. We speculate that rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 may be an effective treatment for preterm infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (Table Presented).

AB  - Purpose of Study: Although inflammation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the triggers, receptors and signaling pathways of the immune cells that respond to exogenous signals such as hyperoxia in the premature lung are incompletely understood.Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor expressed by macrophages and monocytes in the lung. Upon activation, TREM2 can induce p53, a transcription factor (TF) involved in DNA repair or apoptosis. In lung infections, TREM2 has been reported to regulate macrophage function. However, its role in BPD is not known. Our objective was to investigate the role of TREM2 and its downstream TF, p53 in lung macrophages and monocytes during hyperoxia exposure in the developing lung. Methods Used: C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen) between postnatal day 1 and 14. Gene expression changes were measured by single-cell RNAseq and bulk RNAseq of whole lung. To determine the functional importance of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes we used Trem2-deficient mice (TREM2 KO). To identify transcription factor binding sites we used ChIPseq. Protein expression was measured by immunoblot. Lung histology was assessed with H&E stained slides. RNAseq and ChIPseq data were analyzed with HOMER. Summary of Results: Unbiased genomic assessment using single-cell RNAseq showed that hyperoxia exposure upregulates Trem2 in three myeloid subsets; alveolar macrophages (AM), interstitial macrophages (IM) and monocytes. We next determined the functional importance of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes using TREM2 KO mice. Trem2-deficiency resulted in a marked improvement of the lung architecture. Gene expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the p53 pathway after hyperoxia in WT mice as compared to TREM2 KO mice. We validated these findings on the protein level by immunoblot. As predicted by the RNAseq results, hyperoxia exposed WT mice had higher p53 levels than the room air controls. In TREM2 KO mice, hyperoxia exposure did not induce significant changes in p53 protein levels. ChIP-seq analysis identified a significantly increased binding of p53 to active gene regions in the lungs of hyperoxia exposed mice. Conclusion(s): These data suggest that TREM2 is not merely a hyperoxia associated marker but an essential driver of the injury and abnormal lung development after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. Trem2 deficiency and the lack of p53 activation were associated with a protective phenotype. We propose that activation of the TREM2-p53 axis in myeloid cells is part of a dysregulated, injury-induced immune response that derails lung development, and that blocking TREM2 will results in lung regeneration and repair. The selective expression of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes, makes this receptor a highly attractive target for immunotherapy. Furthermore, an inhibitory anti-TREM2 antibody is available and its therapeutic value is currently being tested in phase one clinical trials.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, is characterized by impaired lung development with sustained abnormalities of lung function into adulthood. We have previously demonstrated that a single injection of intra-amniotic endotoxin (IA ETX) causes abnormal distal lung structure in a rodent model of BPD. Whether dysanapsis, defined as disproportionate growth of airways and parenchyma, contributes to sustained abnormalities of lung function in BPD is unknown. Methods Used: Fetal rats were exposed to IA ETX (10 mug) or saline (CTL) at embryonic day 20 (E20) and delivered at term (E22). At day 14, lung mechanics were measured via Flexivent followed by: 1) intratracheal fixation at 20 cmH2O for distal structure analysis; 2) perfusion fixation at 5 cmH2O for stereology; or 3) micro-computed tomography (muCT) at 5 or 20 cmH2O to measure conducting airway diameters. A dysanaptic ratio (DR) of airway diameter (AD) to inspiratory capacity (IC), DR=AD/IC, was calculated to define airway size relative to lung size. Airways reactivity was measured via methacholine challenge (MCh; dose range: 0-25 mg/ml). Response to albuterol (Alb; 0.083%) was assessed after MCh exposure. Summary of Results: Compared to CTL, ETX-exposed pups had decreased body weight and lung volume (p< 0.0001 for both), with no difference in crown-rump length. ETX-exposed pups had increased airways resistance (Rn) and total respiratory system resistance (Rrs), as well as decreased total lung compliance (p<0.01 for all). ETX-exposed pups had decreased radial alveolar counts (RAC), increased mean linear intercepts (MLI), and decreased surface area (p< 0.05 for all). muCT measurements of AD for large airways (trachea, 2nd, and 3rd generations) were decreased in ETX-exposed pups when measured at 5 cmH2O (p<0.005 for all), but there were no differences in 2nd and 3rd generation AD at 20 cmH2O. ETX-exposed pups had decreased IC; however, there were no differences in dysanapsis as assessed by DR (AD/IC). ETX-exposed pups had increased Rn and Rrs in response to MCh (p< 0.05), but sensitivity to MCh was not different from CTL. After MCh exposure, the Rrs percent change in response to Alb was not significantly different between ETX and CTL groups (ETX: 19.5% decrease in Rrs; CTL: 33.1% decrease). Conclusion(s): We found that antenatal ETX exposure impairs lung structure and function in infant rats, including reduced alveolarization and surface area in the distal lung with increased airways resistance. ETX-exposed pups have smaller diameters of the trachea and large airways. Although central airways and distal lung structure are altered after IA ETX, there were no differences in DR. We speculate that injury to both compartments-airways and distal lung-contribute to abnormalities of late lung function after antenatal stress.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants, with pulmonary hypertension (PH) being a common life-threatening sequela of the disease. Further, BPD-associated PH lacks curative therapies. We showed that hyperoxia increases lung AMPKalpha activation in neonatal mice. Whether this alteration is a compensatory or contributory phenomenon in hyperoxiainduced experimental BPD is unclear. Thus, we hypothesized that endothelial AMPKalpha-deficient neonatal mice would be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wild-type littermates. Methods used To determine the necessary role of endothelial AMPKalpha signaling in neonatal lung injury, we decreased endothelial AMPKalpha expression by breeding AMPKalpha-1flox/ flox mice with Tie-Cre mice, and exposed endothelial AMPKalpha-1 sufficient or deficient mouse pups to air (21% FiO2) or hyperoxia (70% O2) from PND1 to PND14. Lung morphometric studies and echocardiographic (echo) studies were done on PND28 to determine the effects of AMPKalpha-1 gene and hyperoxia on alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH. To determine the sufficient role of AMPK signaling in neonatal lung injury, C57BL6J wild-type mice were treated with daily i.p. injections of 1 mg/kg of the AMPK agonist, aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), or the vehicle, while they were exposed to air or hyperoxia through PND1-PND14. Lung morphometric studies were done on PND14 to determine the effects of hyperoxia and AMPKalpha activation on alveolarization and pulmonary vascularization. Summary of results Hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification, as evidenced by decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts. Additionally, hyperoxia decreased lung angiogenesis. Further, hyperoxia induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, as evidenced by increased medial wall thickness index of resistance lung vessels, decreased pulmonary acceleration time/ejection time ratio, and increased right ventricular systolic pressure. However, these effects of hyperoxia were augmented in the presence of endothelial AMPKalpha-1 deficiency. By contrast, AICAR-mediated AMPKalpha activation attenuated hyperoxiainduced lung injury. Conclusions These findings support our hypothesis that AMPKalpha signaling mitigates hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice. We propose that AMPKalpha is a potential therapeutic target for BPD infants with PH.

AB  - Purpose of Study Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) leads to worse clinical outcomes in former preterm neonates. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor, smooth muscle mitogen, and is increased in the lungs of infants who died with severe BDP. Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, is increased in patients and animals with experimental PH. Serotonin signaling blockade decreases pulmonary vascular resistance and prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling in preclinical neonatal PH models. We hypothesized neonatal TPH1 knock-out (KO) mice would be protected from hypoxia induced BPD and PH. Methods Used Neonatal wild-type (WT) and TPH1 KO offspring were placed in hypoxia or remained in normoxia at Denver altitude for 2 weeks. Weights were recorded at 2 weeks. Plasma 5-HT levels were measured by ELISA. To assess alveolar development, inflation fixed lungs were analyzed for surface area (SA) and mean linear intercept (MLI). To identify total number of small vessels (<30 mum), lung sections were immunostained with VWF. PH was assessed by Fulton's index and right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSPs). Data were analyzed by Prism via unpaired t-test or 2-way ANOVA via Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. Significance level p<0.05. Summary of Results TPH1 KO mice weighed less than WT mice in normoxia and hypoxia. Serotonin levels were significantly decreased in TPH1 KO mice. However, measurable levels of 5-HT remained in TPH1 KO mice. Alveolar development, vascular development, and RVSPs were similar in TPH1 KO and control mice. TPH1 KO mice were not protected from hypoxia induced alveolar simplification or hypoxia induced pulmonary vascular simplification. TPH1 KO mice displayed attenuated hypoxia induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, shown by reduction in RVSPs (32+/-0.66 - 29+/-0.55, p<0.006). Conclusions We speculate the lack of protection against hypoxia induced lung injury observed in TPH1 KO mice may be the result of decreased growth in KO animals and/or be a consequence of 5-HT levels.

AB  - miR-21 has been confirmed to be overexpressed in neonatal rat lungs with hyperoxia-mediated bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The specific function of miR-21 in BPD is still unclear. We established the hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model in vivo and the hyperoxia-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) model in vitro. Transwell assay was utilized to detect the migratory capability of PMVECs. Tube formation assay was utilized to measure angiogenesis ability. ELISA was utilized to test nitric oxide (NO) production and the intracellular and extracellular Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentration. Furthermore, the interaction between miR-21 and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) was evaluated using luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-21 expression in PMVECs was increased by hyperoxia stimulation. Inhibition of miR-21 improved the migratory and angiogenic activities of PMVECs and overexpression of miR-21 exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-21 increased NO production and decreased intracellular and extracellular ADMA concentration in hyperoxia-treated PMVECs. Next we proved that miR-21 could bind to DDAH1 and negatively regulate its expression. Rescues assays showed that DDAH1 knockdown reversed the effects of miR-21 depletion on hyperoxia-mediated PMVEC functions, NO production, and ADMA concentration. Importantly, miR-21 downregulation restored alveolarization and vascular density in BPD rats. This study demonstrates that inhibition of miR-21 improves pulmonary vascular responses in BPD by targeting the DDAH1/ADMA/NO pathway.Copyright © 2022 the author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine infection/inflammation plays an important role in the development of lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, While a multifactorial genesis is likely, mechanisms involved in BPD after intrauterine infection/inflammation are largely unknown. Recent studies have suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) are likely to play a role. Therefore, this study aimed to study the effects and mechanisms of intrauterine infection/inflammation on lung development, and to identify miRNAs related to lung injury and BPD., METHODS: An animal model of intrauterine infection/inflammation was established with pregnant SD rats endocervically inoculated with E.coli. The fetal and neonatal rats were observed at embryonic day (E) 17, 19, 21 and postnatal day (P) 1, 3, 7, 14, respectively. Body weight, lung weight, the expression levels of NLRP3, TNF-alpha, IL-lbeta, IL-6, VEGF, Collagen I, SP-A, SP-B and SP-C in the lung tissues of fetal and neonatal rats were measured. Expression profiles of 1218 kinds of miRNAs in the lungs of neonatal rats were detected by miRNA microarray technique. Target genes of the identified miRNAs were predicted through online software., RESULTS: Intrauterine infection/inflammation compromised not only weight development but also lung development of the fetal and neonatal rats. The results showed significantly increased expression of NLRP3, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, Collagen I, and significantly decreased expression of VEGF, SP-A, SP-B and SP-C in the fetal and neonatal rat lung tissues in intrauterine infection group compared to the control group at different observation time point (P < 0.05). Forty-three miRNAs with significant differential expression were identified. Possible target genes regulated by the identified miRNAs are very rich., CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine infection/inflammation results in lung histological changes which are very similar to those observed in BPD. Possible mechanisms may include NLRP3 inflammasome activation followed by inflammatory cytokines expression up-regulated, inhibiting the expression of pulmonary surfactant proteins, interfering with lung interstitial development. There are many identified miRNAs which target a wide range of genes and may play an important role in the processes of lung injury and BPD.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of Budesonide (BUD) on pulmonary vascular development and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in newborn rats with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) caused by intrauterine infection. Method(s): The 15-day-pregnant SD rats were divided into control group and infection group [intraperitoneal injection of 0.35 mg/(kg.d) lipopolysaccharide], and the newborn rats born by the above groups were divided into 3 groups: BUD group (0.5 mg of BUD suspension), normal control group (NC group, equal amount of 9 g/L saline), BPD group (equal amount of 9 g/L saline), with 40 rats in each group, all of them were inhaled twice a day for 14 days.Ten newborn rats were selected at birth, on the 3rd, 7th and 14th day after administration.Pulmonary histopathological changes and radial alveolar counts (RAC) were observed after HE staining, and the thickness of alveolar respiratory membrane was measured; the platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1/CD31) in lung tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the density of pulmonary microvessels was calculated; the expressions of VEGF, NLRP3 and Caspase-1 were detected by Western blot; and the levels of serum interleukin( IL)-1beta and IL-18 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Result(s): With the increase of day-old, the lung tissue of newborn rats in NC group was gradually developed and matured, the structure of alveoli was clear, the size was uniform, the count was significantly increased, and no obvious pathological changes were observed.In BPD group, the lung tissue structure was disordered, the alveoli were different in size and few in count, and inflammatory cells were exuded from the alveoli or the alveoli space.Compared with BPD group, the pathological changes of lung tissue in BUD group were significantly reduced.On the 3rd, 7th and 14th day after administration, compared with NC group, the RAC, average integral optical density of CD31 positive cells, density of pulmonary microvessel and level of VEGF protein in lung tissue of BPD group and BUD group were lower, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05); while the thickness of respiratory membrane, level of NLRP3, Caspase-1 proteins in lung tissue and serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-18 were significantly higher, and the differences were statistically significant(all P<0.05). Compared with BPD group, the RAC, average integral optical density of CD31 positive cells, density of pulmonary microvessel and level of VEGF protein in lung tissue of BPD group and BUD group were significantly higher, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05); while the thickness of respiratory membrane, level of NLRP3, Caspase-1 proteins in lung tissue and serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-18 were significantly lower, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). Conclusion(s): The occurrence and development of pathological changes of BPD newborn rats caused by intrauterine infection can affect the development of pulmonary vessels through the inflammatory response of lung tissue.BUD can alleviate pathological changes in lung tissues of BPD newborn rats by reducing inflammatory reaction and up-regulating VEGF expression, promoting pulmonary vascular remodeling, and increasing pulmonary microvascular density.Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association

AB  - [Objective] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that typically affects infants delivered at a gestational age of <30 weeks. Although surfactant replacement therapies and gentle ventilation are common strategies for preventing BPD-related lung injury, they have limited efficacy. Relatively new approaches using mesenchymal stem cells tMSCs) have shown promise as potential curative therapies. Previously, we showed that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1), released from injured tissue, induced regeneration through activating platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha-positive bone-marrow MSCs. Our another work also identified and synthesized a critical domain in HMGB1 that induces regeneration. In this study, we tested whether the HMGB1 peptide can ameliorate BPD-related lung injury. [Methods] We used a well-characterized mouse BPD model created with a hyperoxic chamber. Briefly, normoxic mouse pups were kept in room air, and hyperoxic mouse pups were raised in hyperoxic chambers v90% 02) from birth until postnatal day 14. Pups were administered with either HMGB1 peptide or saline on Postnatal 4,8 and 12. Mice were sacrificed at P14 for detailed evaluations. [Results] HMGB1 peptide significantly rescued BPD-related decreases in body weight and survival. The treatment also restored alveolar structure via suppressing inflammation and fibrosis in the lung. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the lung further showed that the peptide significantly suppressed a hyperoxia-induced inflammatory signature in macrophages and fibrotic signature in fibroblasts. These changes in the transcriptome were also confirmed at the protein level. [Conclusion] Our data show that treatment with the HMGB1 peptide suppressed inflammation and fibrosis, thus preventing BPD progression.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants that is associated with life-long morbidities and lacks curative therapies. Inflammatory insults are known contributors to BPD pathogenesis. T Helper 17 Cells (TH17) and their signature cytokine IL-17a are known to play a role in various neonatal inflammatory disorders. There are limited studies examining IL-17a's role in BPD pathogenesis. The objective of this study is to assess the role of IL- 17a in murine experimental BPD using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model through protein analysis, flow cytometry, neutralizing IL-17a antibody, and lung histology review. We will test the hypothesis that blocking IL- 17a signaling mitigates LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury in neonatal mice. Methods Used: Wild-type (WT) mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with PBS or LPS on post-natal days (P) 3, 4, and 5 (N = 11). On P6, the IL-17a expression was determined in whole lung cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in T cells by flow cytometry after stimulating lung cells with PMA and ionomycin in vitro. To determine the role of IL-17a in LPS-induced lung injury, we injected WT-mice i.p. with isotype antibody (Ab) or IL-17a neutralizing Ab on P2 and P4, while they were treated with PBS or LPS from P3 to P5, resulting in four study groups [PBS + Isotype Ab (n = 3), PBS + IL-17a Ab (n = 3), LPS + Isotype Ab (n = 3), LPS + IL-17a Ab (N = 3)]. We quantified inflammatory markers by western blotting on P6 and alveolarization by estimating the mean linear intercept (MLI) on P14. Summary of Results: Univariate analysis showed that LPS-injected mice had higher IL-17a protein and IL-17a+ T-cells than PBS-injected mice. ANOVA analysis showed that LPS treatment increased STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 levels to a greater extent in mice treated with isotype Ab compared to IL-17a antibody. ANOVA analysis of MLIs also revealed that LPS significantly decreased alveolarization in mice treated with isotype Ab compared to IL-17a antibody. Conclusion(s): IL-17a protein levels and IL-17a+ T-cells are increased in an LPS-induced murine experimental BPD model. Further, blocking IL-17a signaling decreases proinflammatory markers and improves alveolarization in LPS-treated neonatal mice. These observations suggest that IL-17a may play a significant role in BPD pathogenesis and could potentially be a target for BPD treatment.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main pathological features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia are stagnation of lung development and minor tissue damage. Fetal lung development needs to go through five stages, and a preterm infant cannot survive after birth until the cystic stage. Therefore, research on the pathogenesis of premature birth-and hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia has focused on cystic and alveolar phases. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the regulatory role of differentially expressed microRNAs in hyperoxia-associated bronchopulmonary dysplasia during two developmental stages - cystic and alveolar stages. METHOD(S): Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly into four groups: in 0 day group (n=10), rat lung tissue was taken immediately after birth; 4-, 7-, 14-day groups were further divided into two subgroups - hyperoxia group (exposed to persistent hyperoxia with an oxygen concentration of 85%-90%, n=10) and air group (exposed to the air with FiO2: 21%, n=10). Lung samples tissue were then taken at postnatal days 4, 7, 14. MicroRNAs in lung tissue were acquired using miRNA-Seq technology to build a library, and sequenced on the Illumina platform. Differently expressed microRNAs between different groups were screened by Deseq2 (Version 1.10.1) and Venn map. Gene ontology enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis were performed to predict target proteins of differentially expressed microRNAs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): There were 633 microRNAs in the 0-day group, 609, 614, and 584 microRNAs in the hyperoxia group at postnatal days 4, 7, 14, respectively, and 629, 608, and 581 in the corresponding air groups. The hyperoxia group obtained 130, 3, and 114 differentially expressed microRNAs during postnatal days 0-4 (cystic stage), 4-7, and 4-14 (alveolar stage), respectively. And the corresponding air group received 106, 0, 111 differentially expressed microRNAs respectively. There were 91, 0, and 79 differentially expressed microRNAs in the two groups at different stages. During the cystic and alveolar phases, miR-34a-5p and miR-21-5p were significantly expressed in the lung tissue of neonatal rats in the hyperoxia group. miR-34a-5p had 198 target proteins, which concentrated around the PDGFRB/PDGFRA/NGFR; miR-21-5p had 302 target proteins that mainly revolved around the MAPK1/STAT3. To conclude, miR-34a-5p and miR-21-5p are highly expressed in the cystic and alveolar stages under hyperoxia exposure, targeting the proteins about PDGFRB/ PDGFRA/NGFR and MAPK1/STAT3 respectively, which mediate the process of lung development and participate in the occurrence and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - Purpose: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and severe complication in preterm infants. Vitamin D (VitD) has been reported to protect against BPD; however, its role in the mitochondria-mediated and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways has not yet been reported. Method(s): We first performed in vivo studies using neonatal C57BL/6 mice in which we induced BPD by exposing them to a hyperoxic environment (85% O2). The mice were divided into room air (RA; 21% O2), RA+VitD, BPD, and BPD+VitD groups. Hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining were used to evaluate lung injury. Inflammation and apoptosis were measured using ELISA, RT-qPCR, and TUNEL assays. We then analyzed BEAS-2B cells divided into the same groups along with an additional BPD+VitD+inhibitor group. Mitochondrial apoptosis was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Western blotting. We then used VDR-shRNA to silence the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) in the BEAS-2B cells. The inflammation, apoptotic rate, and the phosphorylated forms of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in cells were detected by RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. Result(s): The mean linear intercept, septal thickness, and abnormal fibrosis increased, while radial alveolar count decreased in BPD lungs compared to RA lungs. VitD administration was able to ameliorate the phenotype in BPD lungs. IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha expression and the apoptotic rate decreased in the BPD+VitD lung group. VitD pretreatment restored abnormal mitochondrial morphology, reduced mitochondrial membrane loss, and reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in BEAS-2B cells. VitD administration also reduced IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha mRNA, as well as pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 expression and apoptosis rate in cells exposed to hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): We concluded that VitD treatment ameliorated apoptosis and inflammation by targeting the mitochondrial pathway and via the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway in BPD, thus supporting its potential therapeutic use in this condition.Copyright © 2022 Hu et al.

AB  - Background: Sepsis in premature newborns is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but underlying mechanisms of lung injury remain unclear. Aberrant expression of endothelial cell (EC) angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) disrupts angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1)/TIE2-mediated endothelial quiescence, and is implicated in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults. We hypothesized that recombinant ANGPT1 will mitigate sepsis-induced ANGPT2 expression, inflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), and alveolar remodeling in the saccular lung. Method(s): Effects of recombinant ANGPT1 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial inflammation were evaluated in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC). ALI and long-term alveolar remodeling were assessed in newborn mice exposed to intraperitoneal LPS and recombinant ANGPT1 pretreatment. Result(s): LPS dephosphorylated EC TIE2 in association with increased ANGPT2 in vivo and in vitro. ANGPT1 suppressed LPS and ANGPT2-induced EC inflammation in HPMEC. Neonatal mice treated with LPS had increased lung cytokine expression, neutrophilic influx, and cellular apoptosis. ANGPT1 pre-treatment suppressed LPS-induced lung Toll-like receptor signaling, inflammation, and ALI. LPS-induced acute increases in metalloproteinase 9 expression and elastic fiber breaks, as well as a long-term decrease in radial alveolar counts, were mitigated by ANGPT1. Conclusion(s): In an experimental model of sepsis-induced BPD, ANGPT1 preserved endothelial quiescence, inhibited ALI, and suppressed alveolar simplification. Impact: Key message: Angiopoietin 1 inhibits LPS-induced neonatal lung injury and alveolar remodeling.Additions to existing literature:Demonstrates dysregulation of angiopoietin-TIE2 axis is important for sepsis- induced acute lung injury and alveolar simplification in experimental BPD.Establishes recombinant Angiopoietin 1 as an anti-inflammatory therapy in BPD. Impact: Angiopoietin 1-based interventions may represent novel therapies for mitigating sepsis-induced lung injury and BPD in premature infants.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Background: Early pulmonary oxygen exposure is one of the most important factors implicated in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., Methods: Here, we analyzed short- and long-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia on NOS3 and STAT3 expression and corresponding epigenetic signatures using a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD., Results: Early hyperoxia exposure led to a significant increase in NOS3 (median fold change x 2.37, IQR 1.54-3.68) and STAT3 (median fold change x 2.83, IQR 2.21-3.88) mRNA levels in pulmonary endothelial cells with corresponding changes in histone modification patterns such as H2aZac and H3K9ac hyperacetylation at the respective gene loci. No complete restoration in histone signatures at these loci was observed, and responsivity to later hyperoxia was altered in mouse lungs. In vitro, histone signatures in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) remained altered for several weeks after an initial long-term exposure to trichostatin A. This was associated with a substantial increase in baseline eNOS (median 27.2, IQR 22.3-35.6) and STAT3alpha (median 5.8, IQR 4.8-7.3) mRNA levels with a subsequent significant reduction in eNOS expression upon exposure to hypoxia., Conclusions: Early hyperoxia induced permanent changes in histones signatures at the NOS3 and STAT3 gene locus might partly explain the altered vascular response patterns in children with BPD.

AB  - Rationale Preterm infants with oxygen supplementation frequently develop a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pathomechanistically, an inflammatory response with increased migration and activation of macrophages plays a major role. Elevated levels of CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), which has chemotactic and activating effects on proinflammatory inflammatory cells, were detected in lungs of infants evolving BPD. Therefore, we investigated whether CXCL10 deficiency protects newborn mice from hyperoxia-induced lung injury (as a model of BPD). Methods (1) Homozygous CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10-/- ) mice as well as wild-type mice (WT) were either exposed to hyperoxia (85% O , HYX) or normoxia (21% O2 , NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14 and studied at P14. (2) For recovery, some mice were transferred from HYX to NOX for two additional weeks and were then sacrificed at P28. Excised lungs were snap-frozen for molecular biology studies or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histomorphometric analyses. (3) J744A.1 macrophages were treated with CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist, and cell migration was studied. Results (1). Lungs of HYX-exposed WT showed significantly increased macrophage invasion at P14 compared with the control group. This inflammatory response after HYX resulted in impaired alveolarization, increased apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. CXCL10-/- protected the newborn mice from the inflammation and partially from the HYX-induced structural changes. (2) After recovery at P28, CXCL10 mice exhibited improved lung structure and attenuated matrix remodeling in comparison to WT. (3) Loss of CXCL10-/- prevented the macrophage influx to the lungs at both P14 and P28 after HYX. (3) Treatment with recombinant CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist significantly promoted and reduced the migration of macrophages, respectively. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that deficiency of CXCR3-CXCL10 axis blocks macrophage chemotaxis to the lung partially enables lung growth, and protects from ECM in experimental BPD.

AB  - Rationale Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of the premature infant following respiratory support, e.g., oxygen supplementation, and characterized by impaired alveolar and microvascular formation and a higher risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prior studies identified IL-6 signaling being central in clinical and experimental BPD. Since inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular and bronchial disease, we now investigate the functional role of IL-6 in vascular and bronchial remodeling in experimental BPD. Methods (1) Neonatal WT, IL-6 knockout mice (IL-6 ) as well as WT mice with pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis (IL-6 mAb) - and trans (sgp130-Fc) signaling were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O , HYX) or normoxia (21% O , NOX). Lungs were excised and used either for molecular biology studies or for histomorphometric analysis. (2) Primary murine bronchial smooth muscle cells (pmBSMCs) were exposed to hyperoxia and IL-6/sIL-6 receptor (IL-6+R), followed by assessment of viability and proliferation. Results (1) Histomorphometric analysis revealed a thickening of the vascular and bronchial wall of WT compared to WTNOX . WTHYX mice showed reduced microvascular formation and a higher number of partly and completely muscularized small vessels (20-100 micrometer) compared to WT . Moreover, the number of vascular KI-67+ /aSMA+ cells and the amount of aSMA cells per vessel, both indicators of proliferation, were higher in WTNOX than in WTHYX . In contrast, IL-6 deficiency (IL-6 ) and pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling protected from hyperoxia-induced vascular and bronchial remodeling, but not from reduced microvascularization. (2) Exposure of pmBSMCs to HYX decreased viability compared to NOX. While IL-6+R decreased viability of pmBSMCs under NOX, we detected an increase under HYX. Finally IL-6+R increased proliferation of pmBSMCs under both NOX and HYX. Conclusion Our data demonstrate a critical role of IL-6 signaling in vascular and bronchial remodeling via hyperproliferation of SMCs.

AB  - The present study investigated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 7 in a newborn rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and the biological effects of BMP7 on newborn rat lung fibroblast (LF) cells. For this purpose, a total of 196 newborn rats were randomly and equally assigned to a model group and a control group. Lung tissue was collected at days 3, 7, 14 and 21 for histological analysis. The location and expression of BMP7 was examined by immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. A total of 38 full-term newborn rats on the day of birth were sacrificed and LF cells were isolated and treated with BMP7. The biological effects of BMP7 on LF cells were assessed by cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis. The findings demonstrated that abnormal alveolar development due to BPD was gradually intensified in the model group over time. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the location of BMP7 in lung tissue was altered. Immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR assays demonstrated a gradual decrease in BMP7 expression in the model group induced by hyperoxia. MTT assays demonstrated that BMP7 inhibited LF cells and the inhibitory effect was dose-dependent and time-dependent. Flow cytometry revealed that the inhibitory effect of BMP7 in LF cells was causing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The present study demonstrated that BMP7 may serve an important role in alveolar development in a BPD model. BMP7 may be involved in abnormal alveolar development through the regulation of LF proliferation.

AB  - Objectives and Study: In the neonatal period, preterm infants show low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and this may further be exacerbated by inflammation. Clinical IGF-1 supplementation studies are ongoing, based on negative associations between IGF-1 levels and a series of morbidities. However, effects of IGF-1 on the developing neonatal immune system are largely unknown. We hypothesized that circulating IGF-1 levels would associate with plasma immune markers in preterm infants and that IGF-1 supplementation influences immune system development in preterm pigs, used as a model for preterm infants. Method(s): Plasma levels of IGF-1, cytokines and chemokines were measured in the first four weeks of life in very preterm infants (n=232, NCT03537365 randomized trial, mean gestational age 29 weeks). In preterm pigs (90% gestation, reared for 19 days), immune development was compared between IGF-1 supplemented (2.25 mg/kg/day, from day 1 of life) and control animals. To further assess immune function, whole blood was challenged in vitro with live Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (PMA), with or without further addition of IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) to evaluate cytokine production and leucocyte gene expression. Result(s): In preterm infants, plasma IGF-1 levels across the neonatal period were positively correlated with levels of macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 and negatively correlated with interleukin 6 (MCP-1, IL-6, both pro-inflammatory factors). Preterm pigs treated with IGF-1 showed slower increases in blood leucocyte counts, with increased spleen size, and higher levels of immature neutrophils, without effects on neutrophil phagocytic function. In the second week of life, IGF-1 treated pigs showed reduced plasma Interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels and reduced Interleukin 2 (IL-2 responses to PMA stimulation. By day 19 the reduced IL-2 responses remained, together with reduced plasma levels of interferon gamma (IFNgamma). In vitro, addition of IGF-1 further reduced the IL-2 and IFNgamma responses to PMA, but improved the IL-10 response to SE. Meanwhile, basal expression of several immune-related genes (IFNG, TNFA, IL10, IL17), as well as endogenous expression of IGF1, was reduced in blood leucocytes of IGF-1 treated animals. Conclusion(s): In preterm infants, only one pro-inflammatory marker, IL-6, inversely correlated with IGF-1 levels and some may show positive correlations (MCP-1), indicating that the relation between circulating IGF-1 and systemic immunity development is highly complex. Supplementation of IGF-1 to preterm pigs had marginal effects on leucocyte pools but tended to reduce Th1 and increase Th2 blood cytokine responses. Potentially this may mediate protective effects against common hyperinflammatory conditions in preterm infants (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis) but could reduce their immune responses against intracellular pathogens.

AB  - Gene Regulatory Networks are key to understanding the developmental processes with integrated details and mechanistic perspective. The disruption of any gene on the developmental GRN would impair the normal development and then cause disease. There are diseases with their causes as simple as single gene disorders while a lot of them as complex as multi-factorial such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants hallmarked with immature and reduced alveolarization. In recent clinical trials, therapy with recombinant human insulin growth factor 1 (rhIGF1) protein has shown initial promises and then limitations for BPD prevention and treatment. One impediment is that the function of IGF1 signaling for alveologenesis has not been systematically characterized. Here, we generate a transgenic mouse exhibiting mild severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling specifically in alveolar myofibroblast (AMF) cells at the onset of alveologenesis. With data collected from a list of integrated approaches including gene expression assay, in vivo and in vitro perturbation, and bioinformatics, we constructed the Igf1 signaling GRN behind this mouse model of BPD. The GRN constructed provides a bird view of all genes downstream of Igf1 signaling and a mechanistic view of how the effect of the IGF1 signaling is transduced from AMF cells to their neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with Wnt5a and Fgf10 signaling as the bridge. The block of Wnt5a signaling was confirmed to cause BPD lung as seen in Igf1r BPD mouse. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD. A new strategy for a better efficacy on BPD calls for the examination of all regulators involved and then the intervention on those impaired, which is now becoming feasible with our constructed GRN on hand.

AB  - Rationale: In premature infants, airway colonization with gram-negative bacteria is associated with development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease characterized by impaired alveolarization and dysmorphic vasculature. Inflammation precedes BPD development and persists later during disease progression. We have shown that in immature mice chronic airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases inflammation and results in hypoalveolarization. We also demonstrated LPS increased the population of IL-17a-producing gamma-delta (gammaDELTA) T cells (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2020;201:A2779). The natural-killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor mediates activation and IL-17a production in gammaDELTA T cells and other immune cells by binding to cell stress molecules. LPS induces DNA damage and increases the expression of NKG2D ligands, including retinoic acid early inducible-1 (Rae-1), murine ULBP-like transcript 1 (MULT-1), and others. We hypothesized that NKG2D mediates neonatal LPS exposureinduced pulmonary immunopathology. Method(s): Immature C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with 3ug/10ul of LPS from E. coli O26:B6 or 10ul of PBS intranasally on day of life 3, 5, 7, and 10. Selected mice were treated with neutralizing antibody against NKG2D or control IgG intraperitoneally. Lung immune cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. Alveolar growth was assessed by lung morphometry. Result(s): LPS induced whole lung mRNA expression of NKG2D and the expression of NKG2D ligands and downstream effectors, including Rae-1, MULT-1, beta2-microglobulin, p53, Granzyme B, as well as proinflammatory cytokines Il-17a, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta and Ccl2. NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T cells, NK cells, NKT cells and CD8+ T cells were present in the lung after LPS. LPS increased per cell NKG2D expression in gammaDELTA T cells, NK cells and NKT cells. After repeated LPS exposure, NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T cells were the most expanded NKG2D+ population (10 times more than control). LPS stimulated Granzyme B expression in NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T, NK and NKT cells. Anti-NKG2D treatment attenuated the effect of LPS on total gammaDELTA T cell and Granzyme B+ NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T cell numbers. Anti-NKG2D treatment also blocked the effect of LPS on beta2-microglobulin, NKG2D, Granzyme B, Il-17a, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta and Ccl2 mRNA expression. Finally, anti-NKG2D treatment reduced immune cell infiltration and attenuated hypoalveolarization induced by LPS. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate a central role for activated NKG2D signaling in neonatal LPS-induced lung injury. Future studies will determine the role of individual NKG2D+ cells, NKG2D ligands and effectors in early-life endotoxin-induced pulmonary immunopathology and in BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxygen supplementation is a life-saving treatment, but it can potentially induce long-term pulmonary injury by triggering inflammatory processes. Xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP enzymes play a critical role in hyperoxic lung injury. Murine studies have shown that CYP1B1 exacerbates, while CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 protect from hyperoxic lung injury. OBJECTIVE(S): In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to hyperoxia of Cyp1b1-null mice would revert the transcriptomic changes induced by hyperoxia in WT mice, both at the transcript and pathway level. DESIGN/METHODS: C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice, as well as Cyp1b1-/- knockout mice aged 8- 10 weeks were used in this study. WT and mutant mice were maintained in room air (21% O2), as a control group, or exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) into a sealed Plexiglas chamber for 48h. RNA profiling was conducted using Illumina Gene Expression MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip Kit. Significantly changed probes were determined using the limma R package, for fold change exceeding 1.5x and FDR<0.05. Enriched pathways were determined using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), with significance achieved at FDR<0.25. Human lung transcriptome data sets were scored using summed z-scores for each murine gene signature; association with phenotype was determined using Pearson correlation, with significance achieved at p<0.05. RESULT(S): Hyperoxia exposure leads to robust and correlated responses in WT mice, as well in the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 null mice. At the transcriptome level, all three CYP1 murine models mitigate the hyperoxia effects. Cdkn1a and Ccnd1 were induced by hyperoxia in both WT and Cyp1b1 null mice but reduced in Cyp1b1 null O2 mice compared to WT O2 mice. The GSEA results identified 69 pathways affected by hyperoxia and mitigated in Cyp1b1 null mice only, including lipid, glutamate, and amino acids metabolism. Hyperoxia gene signatures of all murine models associated positively with lung diseases including Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) and lung adenocarcinoma, but hyperoxia mitigation signature in Cyp1b1 null correlated negatively with BPD. CONCLUSION(S): Distinct phenotypes of Cyp1b1 null mice that were observed after hyperoxia exposure, compared to Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 null mice, are partially explained by mechanisms entailing protein and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of the premature infant following respiratory support, e.g., oxygen supplementation. Lungs of infants with BPD are characterized by impaired alveolar and microvascular formation and a higher risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prior studies from our group identified an inflammatory network with IL- 6 signaling being central in clinical and experimental BPD. Since inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular and bronchial disease, we now investigate the functional role of IL-6 in vascular and bronchial remodeling in experimental BPD. Method(s): (1) Neonatal wildtype (WT) and IL-6 knockout mice (IL-6-/-) were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2, HYX) or normoxia (21% O2, NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to 28 (P28). In addition, we pharmacologically inhibited IL-6 cisand trans-signaling in WT mice exposed to NOX or HYX from P1 to P28 using IL-6 monoclonal antibody (IL-6 mAb) or sgp130-Fc, respectively. Lungs were excised and either snap frozen for molecular biology studies or fixed with paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded for histomorphometric analysis. (2) Primary murine bronchial smooth muscle cells (pmBSMCs) were exposed to hyperoxia and IL-6/sIL-6 receptor (IL-6+R), followed by assessment of viability and proliferation. Result(s): (1) Histomorphometric analysis revealed a thickening of the vascular and bronchial wall of WTHYX when compared to WTNOX. Vascular and bronchial remodeling in WTHYX was associated with reduced microvascular formation and a higher number of partly and completely muscularized small vessels (20-100 micrometer). Moreover, we found a greater number of vascular KI-67+/aSMA+ cells per vessel as well as a higher total amount of aSMA+ cells per vessel, both indicators of proliferation, in the WTHYX than in WTNOX. In contrast, both genetically modified mice with IL-6 deficiency (IL-6-/-) and pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling were protected from hyperoxia-induced vascular and bronchial remodeling, but not from reduced microvascularisation. (2) Exposure of pmBSMCs to HYX decreased viability when compared to NOX. While IL-6+R decreased viability of pmBSMCs under NOX, we detected an increase under HYX. Finally, IL-6+R increased proliferation of pmBSMCs under both NOX and HYX. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a critical role of IL-6 signaling in vascular and bronchial remodeling via hyperproliferation of SMCs, a pathomechanism that was prevented by IL-6 deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling. The pharmacological amenability of IL-6 offers a new therapeutic strategy for severe BPD and early origins of PAH.

AB  - Background/Rationale: Recent work has highlighted the role of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) in driving Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis. Here, we use three complementary approaches to investigate how TGFb modulates secondary septation in both normal alveolar development and in the murine model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. 1) The TGFb-activating integrin ITGB6 has a critical role in acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, so we hypothesized that deletion of Itgb6 would protect against hyperoxia-induced BPD. 2) We characterized changes in the lung microenvironment of mice undergoing hyperoxia treatment to identify the cell types most impacted during disease progression. 3) Identify the critical TGFbresponding cell type in the lung mesenchyme in normal lung development and in hyperoxia. Method(s): We implemented the hyperoxia-induced murine model of BPD in which we treated newborn mice from P0-P10 with 75% oxygen and harvest lungs at P40 for morphometric analysis. We crossed Itgb6 floxed mice to Nkx2.1-cre and Shh-cre to delete Itgb6 in lung epithelium, and then analyzed lungs after room air vs hyperoxia treatment. In parallel, we analyzed wildtype mice undergoing hyperoxia treatment by flow cytometry to characterize changes in the lung microenvironment during hyperoxia treatment. Finally, we generated Nkx2.1-cre x Tgfbr2 floxed mice to determine the role of TGFb to the lung epithelium. Result(s): Surprisingly, we found that ITGB6 is not required in lung epithelium for either normal septation or for hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Using mice with conditional deletion of the critical TGFb receptor TGFBR2 in lung epithelial cells, we confirmed previous reports that TGFb signaling in epithelial cells is required for normal secondary septation. In contrast to published data, we found no role for TGFb signaling in the alveolar simplification induced by hyperoxia. In our flow cytometry experiments, we found profound and highly reproducible changes within the lung mesenchyme in response to hyperoxia. We are currently testing the hypothesis that TGFb signaling in the lung mesenchyme is the major driver of TGFb effects in hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Conclusion(s): ITGB6 is not required in the lung for normal septation or for hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Deletion of TGFBR2 in lung epithelium causes alveolar simplification, but in contrast to prior reports, does not appear to have a role in hyperoxia-induced simplification. Given the profound impact of hyperoxia on the lung mesenchyme, our further studies will test the role of TGFb signaling in specific lung mesenchymal populations.

AB  - RATIONALE: Preterm infants with oxygen supplementation frequently develop a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pathomechanistically, an inflammatory response with increased migration and activation of macrophages plays a major role. Elevated levels of CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), which has chemotactic and activating effects on proinflammatory inflammatory cells, were detected in lungs of infants evolving BPD as well as in prior studies from our group using an experimental model of BPD. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated whether CXCL10 deficiency protects newborn mice from hyperoxia-induced lung injury (as a model of BPD). METHOD(S): (1) Homozygous CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10-/-) mice as well as wild-type mice (WT, C57Bl/6J) were either exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2, HYX) or normoxia (21% O2, NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to 14 (P14) and studied at P14. (2) For recovery, some mice were transferred from HYX to NOX for two additional weeks and were then sacrificed at P28. Excised lungs were snap-frozen for molecular biology studies or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histomorphometric analyses. (3) J744A.1 macrophages were treated with CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist, and cell migration was checked. RESULT(S): (1). Lungs of HYX-exposed WT showed significantly increased macrophage invasion at P14 compared with the control group. This inflammatory response after HYX resulted in impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis as well as increased apoptosis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Deficiency of CXCL10 protected the newborn mice from the inflammation as well as partially from the HYX-induced structural changes. (2) After recovery at P28, CXCL10-/- mice exhibited improved lung structure and attenuated extracellular matrix remodeling when compared to WT. (3) Loss of CXCL10 drastically reduced macrophages influx in the lung of both P14 and P28 after HYX compared to WT. (3) Treatment with CXCL10 and CXCR3 antagonist significantly promoted and reduced the migration of macrophages respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Our data demonstrate that deficiency of CXCR3-CXCL10 axis blocks macrophage chemotaxis to the lung and partially enables lung growth and protects from extracellular matrix remodeling in experimental BPD, offering thereby a possible novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic target for BPD treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Lower airway injury and obstruction are clinically significant in severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). We previously showed that airway epithelial cells (AEC) from patients with evolving BPD have aberrant regulation of transcriptional pathways controlling cilia assembly; this may be due to abnormal epithelial differentiation and/or reconstitution of cilia after injury. Here, we modeled BPD-related airway injury in vivo with hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) and ex vivo with hyperoxia-exposed organotypic AEC cultures to investigate roles of IL-33 and the downstream growth factor amphiregulin (Areg) in AEC differentiation and response to injury. Method(s): IL-33-deficient, Areg-deficient, and WT control mice were exposed to 0.9 FiO2 for 3-7d prior to preparation of paraffin-embedded H&E-stained lung sections. A comparative pathologist performed semi-quantitative histopathology scoring of airway and alveolar changes, including using loss of cilia, degree of bronchiolitis, epithelial hyperplasia, and alveolar hemorrhage. AECs were isolated from tracheas of PN1-2 mice, grown in submerged conditions to confluence, differentiated at air-liquid interface, and exposed to normoxia or 0.8 FiO2 for 4d. Immunocytochemistry for AEC differentiation or QPCR was then performed. Human CD45-EPCAM+ epithelial cells were isolated from tracheal aspirates by FACS for RNASeq analyses. Samples were prospectively collected in the first month of life from intubated premature infants with evolving BPD. Data analysis was performed with R, using Limma and edgeR packages. Result(s): Compared with WT controls, IL-33-deficient, and Areg-deficient mice had more severe HILI at 3d. After 5d of hyperoxia, Areg-deficient mice had increased airway epithelial injury as well as alveolar epithelial injury/hemorrhage (Figure 1A). In our ex vivo model (Figure 1B), WT AEC had loss of cilia and 3.4-fold decreased mRNA expression of basal cell proliferation marker TP63 (p=0.0003, t-test) after 4d of hyperoxia exposure. At baseline, IL-33-deficient and Areg-deficient AEC cultures had abnormal differentiation with decreased apical cilia and disorganized actin staining, with further loss of cilia after hyperoxia exposure. Areg-deficient AECs had decreased TP63 mRNA expression compared with controls, and further reduction in TP63 after hyperoxia exposure. In human AEC, expression of TP73, a proliferation gene co-expressed with TP63, is 13.6-fold lower in the first two weeks of life (during significant oxygen exposure) compared with later timepoints. Conclusion(s): Absence of the IL- 33/Areg axis results in dysregulated AEC differentiation and increased hyperoxia-induced airway epithelial injury in vivo and ex vivo. Changes in cilia structure and/or epithelial proliferation may be important mechanisms contributing to the development of airway injury and obstruction in sBPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease observed in premature infants. Some BPD survivors show evidence of pulmonary dysfunction and vascular remodeling as adults. We have shown that hyperoxia reduced carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme of carnitine shuttle during fatty-acid oxidation (FAO), in lung endothelial cells (ECs) and that EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice are susceptible to developing hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Whether enhancing Cpt1a reduces hyperoxia-induced persistent lung injury is unclear. We hypothesized that upregulation of Cpt1a attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced persistent alveolar simplification and vascular remodeling. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL/6J mice (<12 h old) were exposed to room air or hyperoxia (50% and >95% O2) for 3 days followed by air recovery until postnatal day 14 (pnd14) and pnd60. They were intraperitoneally injected with the Cpt1a upregulators baicalin (50 or 100 mg/kg) or L-carnitine (150 or 300 mg/kg) daily between pnd9 and pnd13. Lung function was evaluated using the FlexiVent system (SCIREQ Inc). H&E staining was performed to measure mean linear intercept (Lm) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Immunohistochemical detection of alpha-SMA was carried out to measure pulmonary vascular wall thickness. Result(s): Hyperoxia caused persistent alveolar simplification and vascular remodeling in a concentration-dependent manner. Hyperoxia also increased lung compliance in adult mice. Both baicalin and L-carnitine increased Cpt1a levels and FAO in lung ECs. Baicalin and L-carnitine attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increase in lung compliance in adult mice. Baicalin and L-carnitine attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increase in Lm and decrease in RAC at both pnd14 and pnd60. These effects were diminished in mice with disrupted endothelial Cpt1a. The hyperoxia-induced increase in vascular wall thickness was inhibited by baicalin and L-carnitine. Conclusion(s): Increased Cpt1a via baicalin or L-carnitine attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced persistent lung injury. Upregulating Cpt1a could be a therapeutic approach to prevent persistent lung injury in BPD. doi: xxxxxCopyright © 2021

AB  - We examined the biological roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neonatal rats were randomly assigned to hyperoxia (85% O2) and normoxia (21% O2) groups, and each group had eight neonatal. Twenty differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by deep sequencing, of which 10 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated in the hyperoxia group. A total of 5,794 molecular related to gene ontology functions were enriched, including cell location and biological processes. rno-miR-29b-3p were up-regulated, and rno-miR-322-5p and rno-miR-335 were down-regulated in the hyperoxia sample based on quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, BPD appears to be caused by activation of extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, RNA transport, cell cycle, and cell adhesion molecule pathways. These miRNAs may play a role in the occurrence and development of BPD. Our study provides new insight into the biological processes of BPD.Copyright © FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.br.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in infants, but the ways to prevent and treat BPD are still very limited. We tried to find an effective method for treating BPD by studying the effect of fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) on hyperoxia-induced lung injury in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We placed newborn mice in high-oxygen environment (60-70%) and collected mouse lung tissue for histological examination at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after birth. The correlation between FGF18 and BPD was studied by analyzing the expression of FGF18 in mouse lung tissue. In addition, we used exogenous FGF18 to stimulate primary mouse type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs II), and detected changes in oxidative stress, inflammation and NF-kappaB signaling pathway activity of AECs II to analyze the effects of FGF18 on AECs II. RESULT(S): From the 7th day after the birth of the mouse, the lung tissue of the hyperoxia-induced mice suffered significant lung injury relative to the control group. The expression of FGF18 in lung tissue induced by hyperoxia was lower than that in the control group. Cell viability of AECs II stimulated by exogenous FGF18 increased, and FGF18 also reduced oxidative stress and inflammation levels of AECs II and inhibited the AECs II injury caused by hyperoxia. NF-kappaB signaling pathway activity in hyperoxia-induced lung increased, while exogenous FGF18 could reduce the expression and phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 in AECs II. CONCLUSION(S): Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was accompanied by a decrease in FGF18. FGF18 can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation levels of AECs II by inhibiting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, thereby reducing hyperoxia-induced cell injury.Copyright © 2021 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

AB  - Background: Endogenous pulmonary stem cells (PSCs) play an important role in lung development and repair; however, little is known about their role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesize that an endogenous PSC marker stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) and its enzyme, alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase IX (FUT9) play an important role in decreasing inflammation and restoring lung structure in experimental BPD. Method(s): We studied the expression of SSEA-1, and its enzyme FUT9, in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, in room air and hyperoxia. Effects of intraperitoneal administration of recombinant human FUT9 (rhFUT9) on lung airway and parenchymal inflammation, alveolarization, and apoptosis were evaluated. Result(s): On hyperoxia exposure, SSEA-1 significantly decreased at postnatal day 14 in hyperoxia-exposed BPD mice, accompanied by a decrease in FUT9. BPD and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in human lungs showed decreased expression of SSEA-1 as compared to their term controls. Importantly, intraperitoneal administration of FUT9 in the neonatal BPD mouse model resulted in significant decrease in pulmonary airway (but not lung parenchymal) inflammation, alveolar-capillary leakage, alveolar simplification, and cell death in the hyperoxia-exposed BPD mice. Conclusion(s): An important role of endogenous PSC marker SSEA-1 and its enzyme FUT9 is demonstrated, indicating early systemic intervention with FUT9 as a potential therapeutic option for BPD. Impact: Administration of rhFUT9, an enzyme of endogenous stem cell marker SSEA-1, reduces pulmonary airway (but not lung parenchymal) inflammation, alveolar-capillary leak and cell death in the BPD mouse model.SSEA-1 is reported for the first time in experimental BPD models, and in human RDS and BPD.rhFUT9 treatment ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a developmentally appropriate BPD mouse model.Our results have translational potential as a therapeutic modality for BPD in the developing lung.Copyright © 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Objective:To observe the therapeutic effects of sildenafil in the neonatal rats with bronchopulmonary dysplasiaBPD,and to explore its possible molecular mechanism. Method(s):Sixty full-term newborn SD rats within 12 h were randomly divided into control groupinjected with saline,indoor air exposure,model groupintraperitoneally injected with LPS,85% oxygen exposure,and treatment group after BPD modeling,100 mug.g-1sildenafil per day,intraperitoneal injection,and there were 20 rats in each group. The pathomorphology of lung tissue of the rats in various groups were observed by HE staining. The number of CD31 positive cells of the rats in various groups was detected by immunohistochemistrythe expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factorVEGF,CD31,hypoxia-inducible factor-1alphaHIF-1alphaand hypoxia-inducible factor-2alphaHIF-2alphaproteins in lung tissue of the rats in various groups were detected by Western blotting method. Result(s):The HE staining results showed that the alveoli of the rats in the control group was uniform in size and regular in structurethe number of alveoli of the rats in model group was significantly reduced,showing over-inflation,and alveolar capillaries were significantly reduced,which was consistent with the pathological changes of BPDthe alveolar development of the rats in treatment group was improved. The immunohistochemistry results showed that compared with model group,the number of CD31 positive cells in treatment group was increasedP< 0. 05. The results of immunofluorescence showed that the expression amounts of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins in lung tissue of the rats in model group were decreased compared with control group at 1 week and 2 weeks after oxygen exposure,while the expression amounts of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins in the lung tissue of the rats in treatment group were increased compared with model group. The Western blotting results showed that the expression amounts of VEGF,CD31 ,HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins in lungt issue of the rats in model group were lower than those in control group at 2 weeks after oxygen exposue,while the expression amounts of VEGF,CD31,HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in lung tissue of the rats in treatment group were increased compared with model group. Conclusion(s):Sildenafil can treat BPD and improve the development of alveoli and pulmonary microvascular development,and its mechanism may be related to the activation of HIF-1alpha/2alpha-VEGF pathway.Copyright © 2021 Jilin University Press.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth and postnatal insults alter normal lung development, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Preterm rabbit is being recognized as a relevant BPD model, but a deeper molecular characterization is needed. Aims and objectives: To characterize rabbit lung development in order to evaluate its translational potential as a BPD model. Method(s): Lung samples were collected at multiple gestational ages (GA) comprised between day 20 and day 42, and from preterm pups delivered at GA 28th, at birth, and postnatal days 3 and 7. Histological and transcriptomic analyses were performed. Radial alveolar count (RAC), tissue density (TD%), and arteries medial thickness (MT%) were assessed. A network-based analysis was performed to identify modules of co-expressed genes, and to monitor time-dependent gene expression (GE) modulation in correlation with histological data. Result(s): RAC values increased from 0.75+/-0.5 to 9+/-1.3 during lung development, while TD and MT decreased from 81.5+/-6.9% to 18.2+/-2.7% and from 61.9+/-7.9% to 35.8+/-17.2%, respectively. Foetal GE modules are enriched in pathways such as cell cycle, epithelium morphogenesis, and VEGF signalling, positively correlated with TD and MT (p-val<0.001). Surfactant metabolism was upregulated from late-foetal up to postnatal stages and positively correlated with RAC (p-val<0.001). Postnatally upregulated modules showed complement system and lymphocyte activation. Immune system activation and developmental patterns were delayed in preterm pups compared with agematched term ones. Conclusion(s): Our in-depth characterization of normal rabbit lung development highlights the specific impact of prematurity on such process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sphingosine- 1-Phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid and an intracellular as well as an extracellular signaling molecule. S1P ligand specifically binds to five related cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-5). S1P levels are tightly regulated by its synthesis catalyzed by sphingosine kinases (SphKs) 1 & 2 and catabolism by S1P phosphatases, lipid phosphate phosphatases and S1P lyase. We previously reported that knock down of SphK1 (Sphk1 -/- ) in a neonatal mouse BPD model conferred significant protection against hyperoxia induced lung injury. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed on mouse lung tissue using Affymetrix MoGene 2.0 array., RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA analysis was performed and differentially expressed genes under hyperoxia were identified using Sphk1 -/- mice and their wild type (WT) equivalents. Pathway (PW) enrichment analyses identified several signaling pathways that are likely to play a key role in hyperoxia induced lung injury in the neonates. These included signaling pathways that were anticipated such as those involved in lipid signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage/apoptosis, inflammation/immune response, and cell adhesion/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We noted hyperoxia induced downregulation of the expression of genes related to mitotic spindle formation in the WT which was not observed in Sphk1 -/- neonates. Our data clearly suggests a role for SphK1 in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury through elevated inflammation and apoptosis in lung tissue. Further, validation by RT-PCR on 24 differentially expressed genes showed 83% concordance both in terms of fold change and vectorial changes. Our findings are in agreement with previously reported human BPD microarray data and completely support our published in vivo findings. In addition, the data also revealed a significant role for additional unanticipitated signaling pathways involving Wnt and GADD45., CONCLUSION: Using SphK1 knockout mice and differential gene expression analysis, we have shown here that S1P/SphK1 signaling plays a key role in promoting hyperoxia induced DNA damage, inflammation, apoptosis and ECM remodeling in neonatal lungs. It also appears to suppress pro-survival cellular responses involved in normal lung development. We therefore propose SphK1 as a therapeutic target for the development drugs to combat BPD.

AB  - Introduction Extremely low birth weight infants have immature lungs at birth as well as low levels of antiinflammatory and antioxidative defences, placing them at high risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Adiponectin (APN) is produced by adipocytes and has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, and anti-proliferative effects; APN levels are quite low in premature infants. We showed that exogenous APN markedly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury (Ivanovska et al. 2020) in newborn rats. Recombinant APN is not available for human use; however, L-citrulline (L-CIT) increases APN gene expression in adult rats (Joffin et al., 2015) and upregulates expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator alpha (PGC-1alpha). PGC-1alpha is a master coactivator of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress. L-CIT levels are also low in premature infants. Thus, we sought to determine the effect of exogenous L-CIT on LPS-induced changes in protein expression of PGC-1alpha, APN, APN receptors (AdipoR1/2), cytokines, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in lung and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) homogenates, and on LPS-induced changes of intracellular ROS levels in PASMC. Methods in-vivo: Sprague Dawley rat pups were treated with L-CIT (2.5 g/kg) or saline intraperitoneally from postnatal day (PND) 1-5. On PND 5, intra-pharyngeal LPS (5mg/kg) or saline was given to L-CIT (n=4-6) or saline (n=4-6) treated animals; pups were euthanized 24 h after LPS treatment and lungs were removed and processed for western blot. In-vitro: PASMCisolated from PND 4 rats were treated with L-CIT (4 mM/ml), LPS (5mug/ml) and a combination of the two, for 3 h; cells were harvested and processed for protein expression (n=4 replicate experiments). PASMC were assayed for the level of LPS-induced intracellular ROS with fluorescence dye in the presence and absence of blocker for PGC-1alpha (SR 18292) Results In vivo, L-CIT, in the presence of LPS, increased lung protein expression of APN (1.36-fold), AdipoR1/2 (2-fold), PGC-1alpha (1.8-fold), phosphorylated AMP-kinase (2.1-fold), SOD1 (2.3-fold), SOD2 (1.7-fold), SOD3 (1.43-fold), and decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (1.2-fold), and interleukin-8 (1.28-fold) compared to saline and LPS treated animals (p<0.05 L-CIT+LPS vs saline+LPS for all proteins). In vitro, in the presence of LPS, L-CIT increased PASMC protein expression of PGC-1alpha (1.55-fold), SOD1 (2-fold), SOD2 (1.57-fold), and SOD3 (2.2-fold) compared to cells only exposed to LPS (p<0.05; L-CIT+LPS vs medium+LPS). L-CIT decreased LPS-induced ROS production in PASMC, an effect that was inhibited in the presence of PGC1alpha blocker. Conclusion L-CIT upregulates APN signaling in presence of LPS and decreases LPS-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress in newborn rats through activation of PGC1-alpha. The translational significance of these findings warrants further clinical studies of the L-CIT potential preventative/curative benefit in BPD.

AB  - Background Distinct airway microbial dysbiosis is seen in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition to dysbiosis, oxidative stress has been shown to exacerbate BPD, and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidants are protective. Previous studies revealed protected lung structure in germ free (GF) mice. In order to understand the protective mechanisms in GF mice, we analyzed Nrf2 dependent genes heme-oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) and NADPH quinone oxidoreducase-1 (Nqo1), which both neutralize reactive oxygen species and maintain redox balance. In addition, we analyzed pulmonary mechanics in an Nrf2 knockout murine model after colonization with E. coli, respiratory probiotic, or E. coli followed by respiratory probiotic. Methods 1. GF mice were intranasally inoculated with three separate doses of E. coli at P3, P6, and P9. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) treated GF mice as well as non-germ free mice (NGF) were used as controls. All groups were exposed to normoxia (21% FiO2 ) or hyperoxia (85% FiO2 ). The expression of Hmox1 and Nqo1 in lung tissue harvested at P14 was measured by qPCR. 2. C57BL/6 mice with an Nrf2 knockout were colonized through intranasal inoculation with PBS, E. coli, respiratory probiotic, or E. coli followed by respiratory probiotic on P3, P6, and P9. All groups were exposed to normoxia (21% FiO2 ) or hyperoxia (85% FiO2 ) from P3-P14. On P14, pulmonary function tests were performed. Results GF mice colonized with E. coli show a significant increase in Hmox1 and Nqo1 expression independent of hyperoxia exposure. In an Nrf2 knockout model, treatment with E. coli resulted in worsening pulmonary function in both normoxia and hyperoxia (high resistance P<0.001, low compliance). Treatment with a respiratory probiotic resulted in improvement in pulmonary function even in hyperoxic conditions (decreased resistance P<0.05, increased compliance). Conclusion Our results suggest the presence of an interaction between airway microbiome and Nrf2- dependent antioxidant responses in the lung. Through these studies, we hope to lay the foundation for microbiome related therapeutics development for BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) leads to worse outcomes in former preterm neonates. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor, smooth muscle mitogen, and is increased in the lungs of infants who died with severe BDP. Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, is increased in adult patients and animals with experimental PH. Serotonin signaling blockade decreases pulmonary vascular resistance and prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling in preclinical models. We hypothesized that TPH1 knock-out (KO) neonatal mice would be protected from hypoxia induced BPD associated with PH. Methods Used Neonatal wild-type (WT) and TPH1 KO offspring were placed in hypoxia or remained in normoxia at Denver altitude for 2 weeks. To assess alveolar development, inflation fixed lungs were analyzed for surface area (SA) and mean linear intercept (MLI). To identify total number of small vessels (<30 mm), lung sections were immunostained with Factor VIII. PH was assessed by Fulton's index and right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP). Platelet poor plasma (PPP), platelet, and lung homogenate 5-HT levels were measured by ELISA. Data were analyzed by Prism with unpaired t-test or 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. Significance level p<0.05. Summary of Results At baseline, WT mice have more platelet poor plasma, platelet, and lung 5-HT than KO mice (53+/-6 - 9+/-1, p<0.0001; 275+/-11 - 56+/-12, p<0.0001; 18+/-2 - 10+/-1, p<0.004; respectively, ng/mL). TPH1 KO mice were not protected from hypoxia-induced alveolar simplification, shown by no difference compared to WT mice MLI and SA, nor were they protected against hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular simplification, shown by no difference compared to WT mice vessel density. TPH1 KO mice were attenuated to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, shown by reduction in RVSP (32+/-0.66 - 29+/-0.55, p<0.006, mmHg). There was less PPP and platelet 5-HT in hypoxia-exposed WT mice compared to WT mice at baseline (20+/-2 - 53+/-6, p<0.0001 and 117+/-27 - 275+/-11, p<0.0001, respectively, ng/mL). There was less lung 5-HT in hypoxia-exposed KO mice than in KO mice at baseline (2+/-1 - 10+/-1, p<0.001, ng/mL). Conclusions Neonatal TPH1 KO mice are not protected against hypoxia-induced lung injury. Surprisingly, this study contradicts the current understanding of the role of 5-HT in adults with PH and in adult models of hypoxia-induced PH. We found decreased plasma and platelet 5-HT following hypoxia exposure. We speculate that decreased 5-HT observed in hypoxia may contribute to neonatal hypoxia-induced alveolar simplification and impaired vascular development. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of 5-HT in the developing lung.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal chronic lung disease characterized by impaired pulmonary alveolar development in preterm infants. Until now, little is known about the molecular and cellular basis of BPD. There is increasing evidence that lncRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis during lung organogenesis. The potential role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of BPD is unclear. This study aims to clarify the role of MALAT1 during the process of BPD in preterm infants and illustrate the protective effect of MALAT1 involved in preterm infants., METHODS: We assessed the expression of MALAT1 in BPD mice lung tissues by reanalyzing dataset GSE25286 (Mouse GEO Genome 4302 Array) from gene expression database gene expression omnibus (GEO), and verified MALAT1 expression in BPD patients by realtime q-PCR. Then the role of MALAT1 in regulating cell biology was examined by profiling dataset GSE43830. The expression of CDC6, a known antiapoptopic gene was verified in BPD patients and the alveolar epithelial cell line A549 cells in which MALAT1 was knocked down. Cell apoptosis was determined by FACS using PI/Annexin-V staining., RESULTS: The expression of MALAT1 was significantly evaluated in lung tissues of BPD mice at day 14 and day 29 compared to WT (P < 0.05). In consistent with mRNA array profiling analysis, MALAT1 expression level in blood samples from preterm infants with BPD was significantly increased. Bioinformative data analysis of MALAT1 knockdown in WI-38 cells showed various differentially expressed genes were found enriched in apoptosis related pathway. Down-regulation of antiapoptopic gene, CDC6 expression was further verified by q-PCR result. PI/Annexin-V apoptisis assay results showed that MALAT1 knocked down in the alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) promotes cell apoptosis., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that up-regulation of lncRNA MALAT1 could protect preterm infants with BPD by inhibiting cell apoptosis. These data provide novel insights into MALAT1 regulation which may be relevant to cell fate and shed light on BPD prevention and treatment.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is currently the most common severe complication in premature infants and is characterized by the arrest of alveolar and vascular growth. Alveolar type II cells play an important role in the pathological foundation of BPD. An association of BPD with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in type II cells exposed to hyperoxia was previously identified. SOX4, a transcription factor that is indispensable to embryogenesis, including lung development, participates in regulating EMT and cell survival, affecting tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of SOX4 in the occurrence of BPD, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously determined. For this purpose, newborn rats were randomly divided into two treatment groups: The model group was exposed to hyperoxia (80-85% O2), while the control group was kept under normoxic conditions (21% O2). Lung tissues were collected on postnatal days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 and morphological changes in the lungs were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The location of SOX4 in type II cells was detected by double immunofluorescence. The expression of SOX4 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in type II cells and lung tissues were detected by immunochemistry, western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results demonstrated that, compared with the control group, the radial alveolar count decreased rapidly in the model group, accompanied by increased mean alveolar diameter and alveolar septal thickness. SOX4 and EZH2 were highly expressed in type II cells exposed to hyperoxia. However, in total lung tissues, SOX4 and EZH2 expression was profoundly decreased in the early stages and increased in the late stages following exposure to hyperoxia. The expression of the EZH2 protein was positively correlated with that of the SOX4 protein. In conclusion, at the alveolar stage, which is a critical period after birth for lung development, hyperoxia induced dysregulation of SOX4 and EZH2 in rat lungs, indicating that SOX4 may contribute to the disruption of lung development in BPD by regulating EZH2 expression.

AB  - Rationale: Dysmorphic pulmonary vascular growth and abnormal endothelial cell (EC) proliferation are paradoxically observed in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) despite vascular pruning. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis, generates NADPH as a reducing equivalent and ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. It is unknown whether hyperoxia, a known mediator of BPD in rodent models, alters glycolysis and the PPP in lung ECs. We hypothesized that hyperoxia increases glycolysis and the PPP, resulting in abnormal EC proliferation and dysmorphic angiogenesis in neonatal mice. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL/6J mice (<12 h old) were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 3 days, which were allowed to recover in room air until postnatal day (pnd) 14. Mice were administered with 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN, 5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p) or dehydropiandrosterone (DHEA, 10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.), respective inhibitors of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), for 5 days between pnd9 and pnd13. Nanoparticles mixed with plasmid DNA expressing pgd under the control of the human CDH5 promoter, were administered into mice via retro-orbital injection at pnd9. Metabolomics, immunofluorescence and Western blot were performed to measure glycolysis and the PPP in mouse lungs. An EdU incorporation assay was carried out to assess lung EC proliferation. CD31(Pecam1) immunohistochemistry was performed to assess vascular distribution, while H&E staining was carried out to measure the mean linear intercept (Lm) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Result(s): Hyperoxia increased lung levels of glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, ribulose 5-phosphate, xylulose 5-phosphate, NADPH, and reduced glutathione, metabolites of the PPP and glycolysis pathways. Neonatal hyperoxia also increased lung endothelial expression of PGD, the second enzyme of the PPP. In addition to increased Lm and reduced RAC, hyperoxic exposure caused abnormal lung EC proliferation as indicated by increased EdU incorporation in the lung interstitium. Increased CD31 expression was observed within the lung interstitium and was not adjacent to distal airways in response to hyperoxic exposure. These morphological abnormalities were further augmented by nanoparticle-mediated endothelial overexpression of pgd. In contrast, blocking the PPP using both 6-AN and DHEA significantly attenuated hyperoxia-induced abnormal lung EC proliferation, dysmorphic angiogenesis and alveolar simplification in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion(s): Neonatal hyperoxia augments the PPP, causing abnormal lung EC proliferation, dysmorphic vascular development and alveolar simplification. These novel observations provide mechanisms and potential metabolic targets to prevent BPD-associated vascular dysgenesis.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants, but mechanisms causing abnormal alveolar development characterized by alveolar simplification are not well understood. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-17~92 expression is severely attenuated in human patients who died from BPD and confirmed this in a murine disease model. Global deletion of miR-17-92 results in fatal neonatal respiratory failure from alveolar epithelial hypoplasia; however, the cell specific effects of miR-17-92 deletion on alveolar development are not known. Rationale: We hypothesize that miR-17~92 deletion in Alveolar Type 2 (AT2) Epithelial Cells will cause alveolar simplification reminiscent of a BPD-like phenotype without oxygen exposure. Method(s): We used an inducible, fluorescent, lox-cre system (miR-17~92flox/flox x ERSPCCre x zsGreen) combined with flow cytometry, immunofluorescent microscopy and bulk RNA-seq to characterize the impact of miR-17-92 on AT2 epithelial cells during postnatal alveologenesis. By administering tamoxifen on the day of birth, we are able to target AT2 cells during the period of exponential alveolar growth when alveologenesis beings around day 4. Result(s): Using a tamoxifen-inducible AT2-specific, fate-mapping system, we achieved >98% of miR-17-92 in AT2 cells. Due to cell-specific deletion of miR-17-92, we demonstrated deficiencies in structural lung development evidenced by increased alveolar area in transgenic animals. Transcriptomic animals have decreased AT2 cell quantity within the population of lung cells determined by flow cytometry. Conclusion(s): Our data supported the hypothesis that miR-17~92 deletion specifically in AT2 cells would have a significant impact on alveolarization producing the alveolar simplification classically found in oxygen-induced BPD models. This could possibly be related to the decreased density of AT2 cells, which are the stem cells needed to transdifferentiate into the alveolar type 1 epithelial cells which comprise the walls of the alveoli. Pending transcriptomic data will provide insight regarding developmental pathways influenced by miR-17-92 that are vital for epithelial cell transdifferentiation. This inducible, cell-specific model provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the biologic impact of miR-17~92 on alveolar epithelial cell function without oxygen as a confounder.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung injury of premature infants. BPD is a multicompartmental lung disease including progressive lower airway obstruction. Airway epithelial cell (AEC) injury and extracellular remodeling occur during BPD pathogenesis. Amphiregulin (Areg), an EGFR ligand, regulates epithelial differentiation, homeostasis, and repair in other epithelial injuries. We hypothesized that Areg regulates neonatal epithelial cell differentiation and repair and is protective during BPD pathogenesis. Method(s): Hyperoxiainduced lung injury (HILI) was used to model BPD in Areg-deficient mice and littermate controls. In parallel experiments, AECs were isolated from tracheas of PN1-2 Areg-deficient and wild type mice, grown in submerged conditions to confluence, and then differentiated at an air liquid interface (ALI) for 3 weeks to form organotypic AEC cultures. Differentiation of AEC cultures was confirmed by visual inspection, TEER measurements, and staining with anti-tubA4B for apical cilia and phalloidin to delineate cytoskeletal processes. ALI cultures were kept in normoxia or injured with 0.85 FiO2 before IHC or lysis for qPCR. Finally, CD45-EPCAM+ AECs were isolated by FACS of tracheal aspirates from premature infants with evolving BPD for RNA Sequencing. Result(s): Areg mRNA was increased by 2-fold in lungs of wild type newborn mice exposed to 0.9 FiO2 for 5d. When exposed to 0.9 FiO2 for 7d, lungs from Areg-deficient mice had more severe HILI than controls with increased capillary leak, subepithelial and luminal airway inflammation, and alveolar simplification. Areg mRNA increased by 2-fold in neonatal AECs differentiated at ALI when compared with freshly dissected AECs, and was further increased by 4-fold in differentiated AEC cultures exposed to 5d of hyperoxia when compared to normoxia controls. AECs grown from Areg-deficient mice had impaired differentiation with scant apical cilia and disorganized cytoskeletal processes when compared with controls (Figure 1). Differentiated ALI cultures from Areg-deficient mice expressed 6-fold more Tgm1 mRNA than ALI from Areg+/-mice. Finally, tracheal AECs from infants with Severe Type 2 BPD expressed 2-fold less Areg mRNA than AECs from infants with milder BPD. Conclusion(s): Areg is expressed during AEC differentiation and during hyperoxia-induced epithelial injuries in vivo and ex vivo. AECs from mice lacking Areg have abnormal growth and differentiation, potentially through increased expression of Tgm1 and altered extracellular matrix deposition. Decreased AEC-derived Areg expression is associated with more severe BPD. The Areg-Tgm1 axis may be a future therapeutic target to mitigate epithelial injury and extracellular remodeling in BPD.

AB  - Background: Exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) predisposes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterized by abnormal alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development, in preterm neonates. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure is used to recapitulate the phenotype of human BPD in murine models. Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD, but the main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes at single-cell resolution are unknown. Objective(s): To investigate sex-specific and cell-type-specific transcriptional changes that drive injury in the neonatal lung exposed to hyperoxia at single-cell resolution. Method(s): We used single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) to generate transcriptional profiles of >40000 cells isolated from the lungs of C57BL/6 mice exposed to 95% oxygen between PND1-5 and their littermate controls. Viable single cells were isolated by FACS at PND7 (n=3/gp). Library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Sequencing data were mapped to mm10 and quantified using GENCODE. Data normalization, cell type clustering, and marker gene identification, and hyperoxia response gene signatures were performed using Seurat. Gene ontology analysis was done with Metascape. Result(s): scRNA-seq identified 27 clusters in both hyperoxia-exposed and control lungs consistent with distinct populations of endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. The proportion of AT1, monocytes, and neutrophils increased in hyperoxia-exposed mice. In contrast, AT2, ciliated epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells, and alveolar macrophages were decreased. Notably, proliferating endothelial and epithelial cells were most susceptible to hyperoxia and were dramatically decreased. Strikingly, males showed a greater decrease in AT2 cells, while females in pericytes, in response to hyperoxia exposure. Differential gene expression analysis identified the most pronounced hyperoxia-induced changes in Car4+ capillary endothelial cells and interstitial macrophages. Sexual dimorphism was noted in the enrichment of biological pathways in Car4+ capillary endothelial cells. Females showed activation of vessel morphogenesis, while males in oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Conclusion(s): These novel findings provide evidence that neonatal hyperoxia exposure results in significant changes in the cellular composition of the lung and induces cell-type-specific transcriptional changes in all major cellular compartments of the lung. The disproportional decrease of proliferating endothelial and epithelial cells provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the abnormal lung development observed after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. Furthermore, we highlight the sex-specific differences in cell distribution and cell-specific transcriptional profiles in the neonatal lung. The remarkable heterogeneity in cell-specific response to neonatal hyperoxia has important implications for the identification of novel targets for future disease modification or prevention.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease resulting from injury during postnatal lung development in premature infants. Supplemental oxygen exposure, as used in the NICU, may lead to alveolar simplification but also to loss of bronchial epithelial cilia. Mucociliary clearance can be perturbed by ciliary loss and/or dysfunction, which can lead to chronic infection and inflammation. Little is known about the mechanism of hyperoxic ciliary dysfunction in the respiratory tract and its impact in the pathogenesis of BPD. Method(s): Basal human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) were allowed to differentiate in cell culture at an air liquid interface. The HAEC were exposed to 95 % O2/5%CO2 or 5 % CO2 (controls) for up to 48 hours. Additionally, neonatal mice were exposed to 95 % O2 at <12 hours of life until pnd3 and recovered in air. Mice were sacrificed and tracheal samples were collected on pnd10 and pnd60. HAEC cilia length was measured from scanning electron microscopy images using a Matlab  program that measures curved cilia length. Maintenance of the cilia length is a function of intraflagellar transport (IFT) mechanics. IFT involves cilia regulatory proteins including Foxj1, motor proteins such as kinesin II and dynein II, and structural proteins including alpha tubulin. We therefore evaluated the levels of the IFT proteins via western blot in the mice and in HAEC. Additionally, we performed proteomics analysis to evaluate the global effect of hyperoxia exposure after 24 and 36 hours in HAEC. Result(s): In the HAEC, there was a significant time-dependent reduction (P<0.01) in cilia length after 24 hours of hyperoxia exposure. In addition, there was a significant decrease in kinesin II motor protein Kif3b and an increase in Foxj1 at 24 and 36 hours. In neonatal mice, there was a decrease in acetylated alpha tubulin expression up to pnd10 with recovery to normal expression levels at pnd60. In HAEC exposed to hyperoxia for 36 hours, proteomics analysis showed decrease in multiple proteins related to intraflagellar transport including tubulin, kinesin motor proteins, and dynein motor proteins. Additionally, the expression of multiple proteins that make up complex I of the electron transport chain were decreased suggesting a role for oxidative phosphorylation in ciliogenesis and/or maintenance. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that hyperoxic exposure leads to aberrant IFT protein expression and ATP synthesis with resultant decreased cilia length. This could result in dysfunctional mucociliary clearance, chronic infection and inflammation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major challenge for premature infants; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cells influences the normal alveolar development process. In this study, we wished to examine whether Runx3 is an important factor for BPD by regulating EMT in AT2 cells. In vivo, animal models of BPD were established by placing newborn rats in hyperoxia tanks. Lung tissue and isolated AT2 cells were collected on different days following exposure to oxygen. The pathological changes in lung tissue, alveolar development and Runx3 expression were then investigated. In vitro, RLE-6TN cells were divided into 5 groups as follows: the cont-rol, Runx3, siRunx3, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and Runx3 + TGF-beta1 groups, and the biomarkers of EMT were investigated. In the newborn rat model of BPD, Runx3 protein and mRNA levels in both lung tissue and BPD-derived AT2 cells were significantly lower than those in the control group. The correlation between Runx3 protein expression and pulmonary development indicators was analyzed; Runx3 expression positively correlated with the radial alveolar count (RAC) and the percentage of smooth muscle actin-positive secondary septa, but negatively correlated with alveolar wall thickness. EMT was observed in the RLE-6TN cells in which the Runx3 gene was knocked down and follwoing TGF-beta1-induced EMT stimulation; however, TGF-beta1 failed to induce EMT in the RLE-6TN cells overexpressing Runx3. On the whole, our data indicte that low Runx3 levels may promote EMT, while high Runx3 levels inhibit TGF-beta1-induced EMT. Therefore, we predict that low levels of Runx3 in BPD lung tissue may promote EMT in AT2 cells, thus affecting alveolar development.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the leading morbidity in survivors of preterm birth, with resulting impaired alveolarization and fibrosis. Infants with severe BPD have associated vascular changes and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The molecular mechanisms resulting in BPD and PH are poorly understood, and there are no curative therapies. Apelin is a peptide made by endothelial cells of the heart and lung that has been previously shown to be associated with endothelial repair, though its role in lung vascular development and injury is unclear. Methods To characterize expression of apelin and its receptor in lung development, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) across 7 time points from embryonic day 15 to postnatal (P) day 14. To study apelin expression during lung injury, we used a murine model combining hyperoxia (70% from P1-5) and inflammation (intratracheal lipopolysaccharide). For validation, we examined human lung tissue from preterm infants with and without lung injury. Apelin and apelin receptor expression were localized in lung tissue using RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), with quantification using Halo software. Results By scRNAseq, apelin and its receptor are expressed by distinct subpopulations of endothelial cells in the lung. Apelin expression increases before birth at embryonic day 18 and is relatively constant across the lifespan. In acute lung injury, we found decreased expression of apelin by RNA ISH in endothelial cells when compared with normoxia-exposed controls at P5 (p<0.001). This decrease in apelin expression persisted during recovery at P14 (p<0.01). There were no significant changes in apelin receptor expression with injury. Examination of human infant lungs in the saccular stage showed decreased apelin expression after 4 days of mechanical ventilation when compared with infants who were never mechanically ventilated (p<0.001). Conclusion Apelinergic signaling is a conserved pathway that emerges in the saccular stage of lung development. During acute neonatal injury and recovery, there is a significant decrease in apelin expression. Future work to target this pathway may identify novel therapies in infants with BPD and PH.Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation

AB  - Purpose: Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have increased risk of viral respiratory infections throughout their lifetime. Lung resident immune cells, specifically, T lymphocytes are required for host defense against viral pathogens. Since a growing body of literature implicates that inflammatory environmental exposures during pregnancy and early postnatal period result in life-long alteration in immune cell health, we hypothesized that BPD induced by combined prenatal chorioamnionitis and postnatal hyperoxia results in short-term and long-term dysregulation of T cell receptor signaling in pulmonary immune cells. Method(s): Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with intra-amniotic LPS (1ug) or normal saline (NS) at 20 days of gestation. Upon delivery, pups were placed in hyperoxia chamber (85% O2) or room air (RA) for 14 days. Lungs were harvested at two weeks of age for short -term analysis or at two months of age for longterm analysis. Harvested lungs were processed into single-cell suspension. CD45+ immune cells were isolated from the single cell suspension using fluorescent activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted from immune cells and genome-wide microarray was performed using Affymetrix WT-plus Rat Clariom S Gene chip. Gene ontology terms of biological processes of differentially expressed genes with FDR < 0.01 were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes associated with T cell receptor signaling pathway were validated using RT-PCR. Result(s): Lungs from animals treated with prenatal LPS and postnatal O2 had significantly greater mean linear intercept indicating alveolar simplification (32+/-2 vs. 25+/-0.8; LPS+O2 vs. NS+RA, p < 0.001, n=5 per group). Purity of sorted immune cells was verified using qPCR. Percentage of CD45+ immune cells as a fraction of all pulmonary cells was similar between the two groups (27% vs. 21%, p = 0.25). Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed downregulation of several key T cell related biological processes (Fig.1). Specifically, genes involved in T cell receptor signaling were significantly downregulated in LPS+O2 group, compared to NS+ RA group. qPCR validation of select T-cell receptor genes showed significant downregulation of Cd3d, Cd3e, Cd5, Trat1, CD8a at two weeks (p <0.05, n = 5 per group) in LPS+O2 group compared to NS+RA group. Despite recovery in room air for six weeks, Cd8a gene expression remained significantly lower in LPS+O2 group compared to NS+RA group at 2 months (log2 fold change: -0.49+/-0.3 vs. 0+/-0.3; LPS+O2 vs. NS+RA respectively; p=0.01). Conclusion(s): Our study has highlighted that perinatal lung inflammation in a double-hit model of BPD results in short-term and long-term dysregulated pulmonary T lymphocyte gene expression, which may contribute to increased viral respiratory morbidities seen in children and adults with BPD.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily members are key regulators for lung development and progress of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mechanisms by which lipoxin A4 (LXA4) attenuates development of BPD have not been clarified. Neonatal murine BPD models were inducted by hyperoxia treatment. Neonatal mice were exposed to room air or 85% O2 hyperoxia with or without treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 or anti-TGF-beta antibodies. Mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12 cells) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3 cells) were cultured in room air or 85% O2 followed by treatment of LXA4, anti-TGF-beta antibodies, and let-7c mimic/anti-microRNA transfections. Treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies both attenuated the mice alveolar simplification induced by hyperoxia. Hyperoxia treatment significantly altered pulmonary basal mRNA and protein expressions of several important extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM remodeling proteins including fibronectin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), elastin, tenascin C, collagen I, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies suppressed the mRNA and protein expressions of TGF-beta1 and TGF-betaR1 but not TGF-betaR2 in the lungs exposed to hyperoxia. Treatment with LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies alleviated hyperoxia-induced injury of the NIH/3T3 cells identified by morphologic observation and flow cytometry, and expressions of ECM, ECM remodeling proteins, and TGF-beta1 signaling pathway, but reversed by transfection with let-7c anti-miRNA. LXA4 upregulated the let-7c expression in MLE-12 cells, transfection with let-7c anti-miRNA, inhibited the LXA4-induced let-7c expression in MLE-12 cells exposed to hyperoxia and reduced the relative luciferase activity of let-7c binding with let-7c binding sites of the TGF-betaR1 3' UTR. Treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies significantly improved histology, ECM, and ECM remodeling proteins in the lungs isolated from the murine BPD model induced by hyperoxia. The LXA4-imparted protective effects on hyperoxia-induced lung injury are mediated by upregulation of let-7c and inhibition of TGF-beta1 and subsequent downregulation of TGF-beta1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common morbidities among surviving premature infants. BPD is characterized by abnormal alveolar septation and aberrant vascular development. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is a divergent member of TGF-b superfamily and its expression increases under various stress conditions including inflammation, hyperoxia, and senescence. Our prior studies showed that GDF15 expression is increased in neonatal mouse BPD models and that GDF15 loss exacerbates oxidative stress and decreases viability in human pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. Our overall hypothesis that loss of GDF15 will exacerbate hyperoxic lung injury in the neonatal lung in vivo. Methods Used We exposed neonatal Gdf15-/-mice, and wild type (WT) controls on a similar background to room air or hyperoxia (95% O2) for 5 days after birth (saccular stage of lung development). The mice were euthanized on PND 21 (alveolar stage of lung development). Lung morphometry was evaluated by the mean linear intercept (MLI). Pulmonary vessel density and macrophage count were quantified using immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism 8 software. Summary of Results Upon exposure to hyperoxia, the survival in Gdf15-/-mice was significantly decreased compared to WT mice (26% vs 57% respectively, p <0.01) (n=32-54/group). MLI was increased by hyperoxia exposure in both genotypes. Interestingly, alveolar simplification was higher in the Gdf15-/-females than WT females when exposed to hyperoxia (MLI = 30.0mm vs 26.2mum respectively; n=3-5/group, p <0.001), with no significant difference among WT and Gdf15-/-males. Interestingly, Gdf15-/-mice had lower macrophage count in the lung compared to WT mice (macrophage counts/HPF = 4.9 vs 12.4 respectively, n=8/group, p <0.001), with no sexspecific differences. The pulmonary vascular density was decreased in hyperoxia with no significant differences between both genotypes. Conclusions Our results suggest that in the neonatal mouse BPD models, loss of GDF15 exacerbates neonatal hyperoxic lung injury with respect to alveolar development. We are currently measuring the cell-specific expression of GDF15 in the neonatal lung at different developmental time points. GDF15, a stress responsive cytokine, may modulate alveolarization in the developing lung.

AB  - Purpose of Study BPD-associated PH is a common life-threatening sequela of preterm infants that lacks curative therapies. We showed that hyperoxia increases lung AMPKalpha activation in neonatal mice. Whether this alteration is a compensatory or contributory phenomenon in hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD is unclear. Thus,we hypothesized that endothelial AMPKalpha-deficient neonatal mice would be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wildtype littermates. Methods Used To determine the necessary role of endothelial AMPKalpha signaling in neonatal lung injury, we decreased endothelial AMPKalpha expression by breeding AMPKalpha-1flox/flox mice with Tie-Cre mice, and exposed endothelial AMPKalpha-1 sufficient or deficient mouse pups to air or hyperoxia (70% O2) from PND1-14. Lung morphometric and echocardiographic studies were done on PND28 to determine the effects of AMPKalpha-1 gene and hyperoxia on alveolarization, lung vascularization, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH. To determine the sufficient role of AMPK signaling in neonatal lung injury, C57BL6J mice were treated with daily i.p. injections of 1 mg/kg of the AMPK agonist, aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) while they were exposed to air or hyperoxia through PND1-14. Lung morphometric studies were done on PND14 to determine the effects of hyperoxia and AMPKalpha activation on alveolarization and lung vascularization. Summary of Results Hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification, as evidenced by decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts. Hyperoxia also decreased lung angiogenesis. Further, hyperoxia induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, as evidenced by increased medial wall thickness of resistance lung vessels, decreased pulmonary acceleration time/ejection time ratio, and increased right ventricular systolic pressure. However, these effects of hyperoxia were augmented in the presence of endothelial AMPKalpha-1 deficiency. By contrast, AICAR-mediated AMPKalpha activation attenuated hyperoxic lung injury. Conclusions Our findings indicate that AMPKalpha signaling mitigates hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice. We propose that AMPKalpha is a potential therapeutic target for BPD infants with PH.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of the overexpression of the placental growth factor (PGF) and hyperoxia on lung development and determines whether anti-PGF antibody ameliorates hyperoxia-mediated impairment of lung development in newborn rats. After exposure to normoxic conditions for seven days, newborn rats subjected to normoxia were intraperitoneally or intratracheally injected with physiological saline, adenovirus-negative control (Ad-NC), or adenovirus-PGF (Ad-PGF) to create the Normoxia, Normoxia+Ad-NC, and Normoxia+Ad-PGF groups, respectively. Newborn rats subjected to hyperoxia were intraperitoneally injected with physiological saline or anti-PGF antibodies to create the Hyperoxia and Hyperoxia+anti-PGF groups, respectively. Our results revealed significant augmentation in the levels of PGF and its receptor Flt-1 in the lung tissues of newborn rats belonging to the Normoxia+Ad-PGF or Hyperoxia groups. PGF overexpression in these groups caused lung injury in newborn rats, while anti-PGF antibody treatment significantly cured the hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Moreover, PGF overexpression significantly increased TNF-alpha and Il-6 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of the Normoxia+Ad-PGF and Hyperoxia groups. However, their levels were significantly reduced in the BAL fluid of the Hyperoxia+anti-PGF group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PGF overexpression and hyperoxia treatment significantly increased the expression of the angiogenesis marker, CD34. However, its expression was significantly decreased upon administration of anti-PGF antibodies (compared to the control group under hyperoxia). In conclusion, PGF overexpression impairs lung development in newborn rats while its inhibition using an anti-PGF antibody ameliorates the same. These results provided new insights for the clinical management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants.Copyright © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common pulmonary complication in preterm infants. Acetate is a metabolite produced by the gut microbiota, and its anti-inflammatory function is well known. The role of acetate in BPD has not been studied. Here, we investigate the effects of acetate on lung inflammation and damage in mice model of BPD. Objective(s): To investigate the role of acetate in the development of BPD. Method(s): C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups on the 3rd day after birth: room air group, hyperoxia group, and hyperoxia + acetate (250 mM, 0.02 ml/g) group. The expression of inflammatory factors was determined by ELISA and RT-PCR, and NLRP3 and caspase-1 were detected by Western blot. High-throughput sequencing was used to detect bacterial communities in the mice intestines. Result(s): After acetate treatment, the expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18, NLRP3, and caspase-1 were significantly reduced, while the expression of GPR43 was increased. In the BPD mice treated with acetate, the proportion of Escherichia-Shigella was lower than in placebo-treated BPD mice, while the abundance of Ruminococcus was increased. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that acetate may regulate intestinal flora and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in BPD. Therefore, acetate may be an effective drug to protect against neonatal BPD.© Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Ran, He, Ai and Shi.

AB  - Purpose: To study the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear transcription factor-kappaBp65 (NFkappaBp65) and TGF-1, and their correlation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonatal rats. Method(s): Twenty (20) pregnant rats were randomly divided into study and normal groups. Radial alveolar counts were carried out at 2, 8 and 15 days of age. The levels of ROS expression in the lung tissues of the two groups were assayed by ELISA while immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expressions of TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in neonatal lung tissues of the two groups. Pearson correlation test was used to analyze correlations amongst ROS, TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in the neonatal lung tissues. Result(s): At days 8 and 9 after birth, radial alveolar count was significantly lower in study rats than in control rats (p < 0.05). Expression levels of ROS, TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in study group were markedly raised at days 2, 4 and 8 after birth, relative to control (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The levels of ROS, TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonatal rats are significantly and positively correlated, and are higher than those in normal rats. This provides a scientific basis for development of drugs for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

AB  - PURPOSE: Oxygen therapy is often required to treat newborn infants with respiratory disorders. Prolonged exposure of neonatal rats to hyperoxia reduced alveolar septation, increased terminal air space size, and increased lung fibrosis; these conditions are very similar to those of human bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia development., METHOD: We reared Sprague-Dawley rat pups in either room air (RA, n = 24) or an atmosphere containing 85% O2 (n = 26) from Postnatal Days 1 to 14. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was used to analyze genome-wide DNA methylation in lung tissues of neonatal rats. Hyperoxia-exposed rats exhibited larger air spaces and thinner septa than RA-exposed rats did on Postnatal Day 14. The rats exposed to hyperoxia exhibited significantly higher mean linear intercepts than did the rats exposed to RA. We applied MeDIP next-generation sequencing for profiling changes in DNA methylation in the rat lungs exposed to hyperoxia and RA. We performed bioinformatics and pathway analyses on the raw sequencing data to identify differentially methylated candidate genes., RESULTS: Our in vivo model revealed that neonatal hyperoxia exposure arrested alveolarization on Postnatal Day 14. We found that the ErbB, actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion signaling pathways are epigenetically modulated by exposure to hyperoxia. We demonstrated that hyperoxia exposure contribute in delaying lung development through an epigenetic mechanism by disrupting the expression of genes in lungs that might be involved in alveolarization., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that aberrant DNA methylation and deregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion pathways of lung tissues may be involved in the pathophysiology of hyperoxia-induced arrested alveolarization.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting extreme preterm newborn survivors with serious long-term sequela of wheezing. Oxygen therapy, which is inevitable for the survival of such extremely premature infants, is partly responsible for the development of BPD and associated airway remodeling (AWRM). Altered Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) signaling have been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of lung diseases; however, the role of SPHK1/S1P signaling in BPD and AWRM is not well understood. The neonatal mice were subjected to hyperoxia (HO) at 95% oxygen (postnatal day 3 to 10) and allowed to grow as adults for 8 weeks. During exposure to room air (RA) or HO, the mice received 5mg/kg of PF543, a specific inhibitor of SPHK1, intraperitoneally on alternate days. Lungs were then collected and prepared for histology as well as morphometry of alveoli/airways. Lung function studies were performed using a ventilator and methacholine challenge was used to measure airway hyper reactivity (AHR). Levels of S1P and sphingoid bases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and lung tissues were measured by LC-MS/MS. In vitro mechanistic studies on HO-induced AWRM and the protective effect of PF543 were performed using small airway epithelial cells (SAEC). The exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia resulted in AWRM in adults, as evidenced by increased peribronchial fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy. These changes were significantly less in Sphk1 knock out (Sphk1/) mice exposed to HO indicating a potential role of SPHK1 in the pathogenesis of AWRM. Subsequent experiments using a specific SPHK1 inhibitor, PF543, during neonatal HO prevented alveolar simplification and, more significantly, ameliorated AWRM in adult mice. Lung function studies revealed AHR in adult mice that were exposed to neonatal HO. Interestingly, PF543 therapy reduced methacholine-induced AHR and airway constriction along with a reduction in AWRM. Exposure of neonatal mice to HO showed epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes, which was reduced by PF543 treatment. Inhibition of SPHK1 with PF543 in SAECs ameliorated HO-induced loss of E-cadherin and gain of N-cadherin and vimentin, markers of EMT. In conclusion, our data indicate a novel role for SPHK1/S1P signaling in HO-induced BPD and AWRM, and amelioration by PF543.

AB  - Rationale Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) promotes fetal lung development in mice and baboons. Postnatally, GRP levels in lung normally drop, but rise in newborns who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease of newborns, with interstital fibrosis and arrested alveolarization. In premature baboons, blocking anti-GRP mAb2A11 abrogated BPD. Rodent BPD models could help to clarify mechanisms by which GRP mediates BPD. Mice are born at the canalicular stage of lung development, ~24-28 wks human gestation, when BPD peaks. Methods Newborn (NB) timed-pregnant Swiss Webster mice were treated with continuous 75% O and twice weekly injections of mAb MOPC21 (negative control IgG1) or mAb2A11. On day 18, right lungs were inflation-fixed and paraffin embedded. Myofibroblasts were immunostained with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated mAb1A4 (Sigma-Aldrich), developed with Vector Red. Eight-ten random lung 20x images were captured per mouse. Using ImageJ, the area-percent of SMA+ alveolar tissue was determined as: (area of SMA+ alveolae)/(alveolar tissue) x100%. Mean linear intercept (MLI) was used to determine alveolar size with a fixed grid with lines totaling 1-mm: 1/(#air-tissue interfaces)x1000 = mean distance between two air-tissue interfaces in microns. Data are shown as mean +/-SEM, with significance at p < 0.05 (one-way t-test). Results Normoxic (NO) mice +/- MOPC or 2A11, had area-percent SMA+ alveoli unchanged (5.1-6.3 +/-0.5-1.4). Hyperoxia+MOPC led to 3-fold increased SMA (15.6+/-2%). Hyperoxia+2A11 reduced SMA to 10.3+/-1.2%; P<0.01 comparing hyperoxia+2A11 vs. hyperoxia+MOPC. 2A11 had no effect on MLI with either normoxia or hyperoxia, possibly due to insufficient time. We performed Affymetrix cDNA analysis of lung RNA from hyperoxic mice +2A11 or MOPC for 18d. HO+2A11 vs. HO+MOPC altered expression of >1000 genes (FC>10, P<0.05), many potentially protective vs. lung injury/fibrosis. Increased gene expression included: nucleoredoxin, an antioxidant related to thioredoxin (FC x78); surfactant protein A (FC x140); Tom20, mitochondrial transport protein that reduces lung injury (x74), and multiple other mitochondrial genes (>20x). Reduced gene expression included: Adam10, profibrotic; amphiregulin, elevated in BPD; amyloid beta A4, toxic fragment; laminin B1, which usually declines by birth; Tgfb1i4, profibrotic; and Stat1, profibrotic. Conclusions After 18d exposure to 75% O2 , newborn mice have >3-fold more interstitial myofibroblasts that are significantly reduced by mAb2A11. Many pulmonary genes are up- or downregulated by mAb2A11 consistent with a multigenic downstream effect on reducing interstitial fibrosis via interacting signaling pathways. Mice can provide a useful model for carrying out preclinical investigations.

AB  - Supplemental O is a primary mode of respiratory therapy for preterm infants. Numerous studies however have shown that supplemental O may contribute to the pathophysiology of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) associated with wheezing disorders such as asthma later in childhood. The calcium-sensitive receptor (CaSR) is a potent modulator of smooth muscle contractility and may be an underlying feature of childhood asthma. In the present study we investigated whether CaSR is involved in neonatal hyperoxia induced AHR in a mouse model of BPD. We hypothesize that inhibition (CaSR antagonism) downregulation of expression (siRNA) or deletion (CaSR KO mice) of CaSR will attenuate the AHR induced by hyperoxia in neonatal mice. Newborn C57BL/6 wild-type (background) or CaSR-/-(knockout) mice were randomized on the second day of life and assigned to room air (21% O ) or hyperoxic (40% O23) groups and exposed for seven days then recovered in room air for two additional weeks. At day P21 AHR was assessed in vitro using precision-cut living lung slice preparations in response to increasing doses of methacholine (MCh 0.25-8 muM). Wild-type lung slices were pre-incubated for 48 h in a CaSR siRNA sequence (40 nM) or scrambled RNA as a negative control. In another set of experiments slices were pre-incubated in a CaSR antagonist - NPS 2143 (10 nM) for 1 h. Airways were imaged and airway reactivity was expressed as percent change from baseline airway lumen area (+/- SEM). Neonatal hyperoxia significantly increased airway contractile responses to MCh in wild-type mice with a mean maximal effect (Emax) of 68.4+/-8.7% decrease in airway lumen area compared to room air controls (47.3+/-5.8% p<0.001) indicating AHR. Pre-incubation (48hrs) with siRNA targeting CaSR or pharmacologic inhibition (NPS 2143 1hr incubation) of CaSR reversed the hyperoxia-induced AHR and the contractile responses were normalized to control level with hyperoxic groups Emax of 44.0+/-5.2% and 41.3+/-3.1% respectively. AHR was not observed in CaSR knockout mice suggesting resistance to hyperoxia exposure. These data suggest that CaSR plays an important role in the long-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia on AHR. We speculate that CaSR may be a novel therapeutic target to reverse airway hyperreactivity in former preterm infants who had received prior supplemental O2 therapy.

AB  - Rationale Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of preterm birth. It is induced by oxidative stress caused by hyperoxia exposure during the vulnerable saccular or early alveolar stage of lung development resulting in alveolar growth arrest and initiation of cellular senescence. Senescence is characterized by inhibition of the cell cycle through 2 major tumor suppressor pathways: the proteins p53/p21 and the p16 /retinoblastoma protein leading to stringent growth arrest. Previous results suggest that p16 is highly expressed in hyperoxia male rats and p21 is highly expressed in the hyperoxia female rats at one year. We hypothesized that hyperoxia-induced senescence would lead to differences in inflammation in male or female rats as they age. Ink4a Methods Newborn Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to hyperoxic (HYP, 85%, n=13) or normoxic (NORM, 21%, n=9) conditions for 14 days and then remained in normoxic conditions until they were 1-year-old. At 1 year, the left lung was inflated and fixed (4% formaldehyde) and the right lobes were flash frozen. Pulmonary tissue was preserved at -80degreeC until analyzed for mRNA expression of proteins p16, p21, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) via TaqMan qPCR. Differences in expression were calculated by the ddCt method using the reference gene GAPDH. Two-way ANOVA was utilized for comparison of ddCt values between sexes in HYP and NORM rats for each target gene. Western blots were performed for quantification of p16 and p21 in the 1-year-old rats of both sexes and treatments. IL-6 expression in the 1-year-old rats was assessed via an ELISA. Results Expression of p16 in the lung tissue mRNA was significantly higher in the 1-year-old HYP male rats compared to NORM male rats; whereas, the 1-year-old female rats of both treatments did not present a difference in p16 mRNA expression. At 1 year, p21 expression in the mRNA of HYP females and HYP males was higher compared to NORM females and NORM males with no difference between the sexes. The same results were observed in the level of protein at 1 year. At day 21, HYP males and HYP females had a significant upregulation of p16 in their mRNA compared to NORM rats (p<0.01), while p21 was slightly upregulated in the mRNA of HYP males and HYP females. IL-17 was expressed in both NORM and HYP 1-year-old female mRNA. Contrarily, 1-year-old HYP male mRNA presented IL-17 expression while there was no detectable expression in the mRNA of the 1-year-old NORM males. At day 21, there was no detectable IL-17 expression in the mRNA of either sex of both treatment groups. The IL-6 expression at 1 year was detected in the plasma of the HYP male rats, but was not detectable in the NORM male rats. Alternatively, the 1-year-old female rats of both treatments expressed IL-6. Conclusion The significantly higher p16 expression in the 1-year HYP male rats suggests that senescence is more evident in the HYP males compared to HYP female rats. Detectable IL-6 as well as IL-17 expression in the 1-year-old HYP male rats also may support this development of a severely high expression of p16 in this particular treatment and sex. The measurement of mRNA expression at intermediate time points would allow for further analysis of the development of senescence in this BPD model.

AB  - Rationale: Supplementary oxygen leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, a disease characterized by lung growth arrest and matrix remodeling. We demonstrated that hyperoxia reduces Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a key transcription factor in cell biology. Since myofibroblasts are crucial in lung injury and remodeling, we investigated the functional role of Klf4 in the pathogenesis of BPD and in the homeostasis of lung fibroblasts. Method(s): (1) Newborn C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 85% 02 (HYX) or 21% 02 (NOX) until postnatal day 28 (P28). (2) Primary neonatal murine lung fibroblasts (pnF) were transfected with a Klf4 overexpressing plasmid or siRNA technique for overexpression (OE) and knockdown of Klf4 (del), respectively, and exposed to HYX or NOX. (3) BiolD (Proximity-dependent Biotin Identification) and CHIP-Seq were performed. Result(s): (1) Reduced Klf4 expression in lungs after HYX was associated with an activation of TGFs signaling and an increase of myofibroblasts, promoting thereby matrix remodeling. (2) TGFs inhibited Klf4 expression in cultured pnF Klf4del decreased migration, induced proliferation and increased mRNA expression of matrix markers (Ctgf, Collai & Col4a1) and Pdgfra (myofibroblasts). In contrast, Klf40E increased adhesion, but reduced proliferation, apoptosis, migration and expression of fibrotic genes in pnF (3) Finally, BiolD and CHIP-Seq identified a novel Klf4 interactome that regulates FoxOI transcriptionally and its activation via acetylation. Conclusion(s): Our data unveil a novel Klf4-Fox01 axis in lung fibroblasts that could promote matrix remodeling and lung growth arrest in lungs with BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects pre-term infants whose lungs are unable to support life outside of the womb. These babies receive therapeutic oxygen which compensates for poor lung function but also causes oxidative damage to lung epithelium, resulting in a simplified lung marked by larger and fewer alveoli. We identified thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) as a protein of interest in the pathogenesis of BPD since Trx1 is cytoprotective against hyperoxic cell death. Using a perinatal hyperoxic mouse model of BPD, pulmonary Trx1 activity inversely correlates with atmospheric oxygen tension following birth and hyperoxic treatment. Therefore, we tested if impairment of lung epithelial Trx1 promotes BPD pathogenesis. Trx1 floxed mice (Trx1fl) were bred to mice expressing cre recombinase driven by the surfactant protein C promoter (sftpc-cre) to generate a mouse with Trx1 deficient lung epithelial cells. Although expected genotypic ratios were detected at birth, lethality was noted in Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice as early as 14 days of age. The LD50 for Trx1 deficient mice was 20 days old, while Trx1 heterozygote littermates appeared normal (p<0.001, n=12-17). Upon necropsy, large air-filled pneumatoceles were noted across multiple lobes of Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice. Similar to BPD, Trx1 deficient mice had a simplified lung marked by an increase in mean linear intercept and airspace size with decreased airspace numbers. Similar to mice treated with perinatal hyperoxia, Trx1 deficient lungs had fewer alveolar type 2 cells detected by surfactant protein b and thyroid transcription factor 1 immunohistochemistry. This work demonstrates that impairment of Trx1 in lung epithelial cells causes respiratory pathologies consistent with BPD. Ongoing studies seek to define the temporal nature of lung pathogenesis and test the overarching hypothesis that Trx1 serves as a molecular sensor of atmospheric oxygen tension in lung epithelium during alveolar development and perinatal hyperoxic injury.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common chronic lung disease affecting prematurely-born infants is characterized by impaired alveolar growth with fewer and larger alveoli and interstitial fibrosis. Premature infant airway inflammatory mediator levels, including CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), are elevated both at birth and during the later stages of BPD progression. Also, we previously demonstrated that premature infant tracheal aspirate levels of the proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine IL-17A were higher in infants developing BPD (AJRCCM 199: A6033, 2019). Production of IL-17A by exudative macrophages and gammadelta T cells has been implicated in aberrant injury and fibrotic responses. Recruitment of exudative macrophages and gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells is mediated by CCR2. CCL2-CCR2 signaling is required for hyperoxia- and chronic LPS-induced hypoalveolarization in immature mice (AJRCCM 197: A7388, 2018). In this study, we hypothesize that hyperoxia and chronic LPS exposure of immature mice each induce IL-17A expression in CCR2-dependent manner and IL- 17A is required for hypoalveolarization in both models. Method(s): Two murine models of BPD were used in this study. Two day-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to normoxia or 75% oxygen for up to 14 days. Alternatively, immature C57BL/6J and CCR2 knockout mice were inoculated with 3ug/10ul of LPS from E. coli O26:B6 or 10ul PBS intranasally on DOL 3, 5, 7, and 10 Selected mice were treated with neutralizing antibody against IL-17A intraperitoneally. Lung alveolar growth was assessed by morphometry. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR and ELISA. Lung immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Result(s): In immature mice, exposure to hyperoxia and chronic LPS each induced whole lung mRNA and protein expression of IL-17A and its upstream regulator IL-23. Chronic LPS exposure increased the percent of IL-17A-producing gammadelta T and exudative macrophages. Similar effects were observed in immature mice exposed to hyperoxia. CCR2 knockout mice showed an attenuated increase in IL- 17A-producing gammadelta T cells in response to LPS. Finally, treatment of immature mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody attenuated hyperoxia- and chronic LPS-induced hypoalveolarization preventing increases in alveolar chord length. Furthermore, premature infant tracheal aspirate levels of IL-17A positively correlated with CCL2 levels. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that in immature mice, CCR2-dependent increase in IL-17A is required for hyperoxia and chronic LPS-induced hypoalveolarization, linking a common inflammatory pathway and alveolar development. Future studies will examine the mechanisms by which IL-17A affects alveolar growth. Blocking IL-17A holds promise as a potential new therapy to prevent BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infants and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening sequelae of this disease. Disrupted lung angiogenesis is a hallmark of BPD-associated PH. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2 is shown to modulate angiogenesis. Further, we observed that: hyperoxia exposure increases the expression of ERK 1 and 2 in neonatal mice; and pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 in primary fetal human pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cells decreases in vitro angiogenesis. We also observed that endothelial ERK2 deficiency in mice disrupts angiogenesis and augments hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Whether ERK1 contributes to or mitigates experimental BPD is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that global ERK1- knockout neonatal mice will be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wild-type (WT) littermates. Method(s): One-day-old global ERK1-knockout (ERK1-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates (ERK2 -/-) mice were exposed to normoxia (FiO2 21%) or hyperoxia (FiO2 70%) for up to 14 d, following which the lungs were harvested to determine angiogenesis and the expression of ERK1, ERK2, and several markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. In addition, we performed echocardiography studies on PND14 to determine the independent and interactive effects of ERK1 gene and hyperoxia exposure on the following indices of PH: pulmonary acceleration time (PAT), RV ejection time (ET), PAT/ET, and RV systolic pressure (RVSP). Result(s): Lung ERK1 mRNA and protein levels were undetectable in ERK1-/- mice at basal conditions and upon exposure to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia exposure for 14 d decreased PAT and PAT/ET ratio and increased RVSP, indicating that hyperoxia induces PH Further, hyperoxia increased inflammation and oxidative stress and decreased angiogenesis in the lungs. However, the extent of these effects of hyperoxia was similar in both ERK1-/- and ERK1+/+ mice, indicating that ERK1 gene does not modulate neonatal hyperoxic lung injury Conclusion(s): Contrary to our hypothesis, ERK1 signaling is not necessary to mitigate hyperoxiainduced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen is administered to premature infants having pulmonary insufficiency However, hyperoxia contributes to the development of BPD in these infants. The molecular mechanisms of abnormal lung development are not completely understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure of newborn rats to hyperoxia for 7 days, followed by normoxia for another 15 days, will lead to differential time-dependent alterations in gene expression in pathways that are relevant to oxidative stress and abnormal lung development. We also assessed the effect of vitamin A treatment in addition to hyperoxic exposure. Newborn Fisher 344 rats were exposed to hyperoxia (95%) or room air from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 8 and animals were either sacrificed on PND 8, or were returned to normoxia and were sacrificed at PND 22. Within each rearing condition, half of the pups were assigned to receive daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections from P1-P5 of either 2mg/kg vitamin A dissolved in corn-oil or vehicle (corn-oil, 33mL/kg) alone. Total RNA was isolated from individual animals (n=3), and gene expression profiling was studied using RNA-seq on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform Gene expression data was quantile normalized and analyzed using the DESeq2 software significance was achieved for q<0.2 and linear fold change exceeding 1.25x. We identified genes significantly changed and in opposite direction on PND 22, comparing hyperoxia to normoxia group, and hyperoxia plus vitamin A compared to the hyperoxia group, and then determined enriched pathways (hypergeometric test, q<0.2). Nitric oxide (NO) pathways were enriched in the hyperoxia exposed rats at both PND7 and PND22. In particular, Gene Ontology (GO) NO-mediated transduction was enriched with fdr=0.025, including suppressed genes such as Nos1 (0.17 fold), Neurod1 (0.21 fold), Kcnc2(0.10 fold), and increased genes such as Ddah2(1.42 fold). Gucy1a3 (1.26 fold). Another pathway was GO nitric oxide synthase, with fdr=0.002, including induced genes such as Npr3 (1.37 fold), Gsk3b (1.33 fold), and suppressed genes such as Il1b (0.51 fold) and Fcer2 (0.39 fold). Finally, VEGFA pathway was modulated in hyperoxia at both PND 7 and PND22, including genes such as Ppp3r2 (0.13 fold), Rac2 (0.64 fold), and Rac1 (1.27 fold). Genes that promote nitric oxide signaling and VEGF were modulated differentially at PND7 and PND22 by hyperoxia. Npr3, a gene involved in NO synthase activity was induced by hyperoxia at PND22 but suppressed by vitamin A. Therefore, we hypothesize that these genes could be potential targets for intervention in BPD patients.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in infants disrupting the development of the lung secondary to preterm birth. Treating infants with BPD in the US is estimated to cost $2.4 billion. This amount is second only to the costs for treating asthma, and far exceeds the costs for treating cystic fibrosis. Despite many advances in neonatal ventilation techniques, widespread use of surfactant and antenatal corticosteroids, the incidence of BPD has remained the same or slightly increased. AyuVis is developing AVR-48, a small molecule immunomodulator for the prevention of BPD in at-risk preterm infants via intravenous (IV) dosing. AVR-48 is efficacious in preventing BPD in a hyperoxia-induced mouse model at 5mg/kg Intraperitoneal (IP) dose. The preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicokinetic studies will be discussed here. Methodology: To determine the genetic toxicity of AVR-48, Ames bacterial mutation (TA 98 and TA 100, 700 mug/well) and invitro micronucleus (IMN, 1.0 mM) assays were conducted. As part of safety pharmacology, hERG assay was conducted at 300 muM. AVR-48 was screened against a panel of 87 GPCR, ion channels and enzymes (Eurofins SafetyScreen87, 100 muM) and for its affinity for toll-like receptor (TLR) subtypes in human peripheral blood monocytes (hPBMC) at 0.1, 1.0 and 10 muM. We did four pharmacokinetic studies: IP, 10 mg/kg, intranasal (IN), 0.22 mg/kg in mouse pups (postnatal day or P14) and two studies at 100mg/kg, IV dosing in rat pups (P3 and P14). Toxicokinetics was studied in rat pups and adult rats. Result(s): Ames and IMN assays on AVR-48 indicated no genetic toxicity and IC50 for the hERG channel was >300muM. AVR-48 had no affinity for any offtargets in Eurofins SafetyScreen87 panel or for TLR6. AVR-48 inhibited the activation of TLR2 TLR4, TLR5, TLR7/8, and TLR9 in hPBMC at 0.1 muM. In the PK studies, significant Cmax levels of AVR-48 were seen in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at 10 mg/kg (IP) dose in juvenile mice. This dose had previously demonstrated efficacy in the BPD mouse model with good pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) correlation. Conclusion(s): AVR-48 is a promising therapeutic against BPD and exhibits an acceptable safety profile with good PK/PD correlation in rodent plasma and BALF. Further toxicokinetic and efficacy studies are in progress in dog and pre-term lamb models respectively.

AB  - Background: The pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial including the use of oxygen that causes inflammation and disrupts alveolar development, including depletion of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells Adenosine is generated extra-cellularly by CD73 in response to injury and can act through adenosine receptors to alter pulmonary response to injury. Although elevated adenosine levels are protective in acute lung injury, sustained elevations activate pro-inflammatory pathways and can contribute to abnormal lung development. The role of adenosine signaling in the neonatal lung on the AT2 cell populations remains unknown. Objective(s): Evaluate the effect of preventing extracellular adenosine production on AT2 cell populations in lung recovery following hyperoxic lung injury after birth in a murine model of BPD. Design/Methods: Newborn C57Bl6 (WT) and CD73-/- mice were exposed to room air (RA) or 95% oxygen (hyperoxia) for 4 days followed by recovery in room air. Mice were sacrificed at time points up to 8 weeks of age. Samples were collected for analysis including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue for determination of inflammation, lung development and assessment of AT2 cell populations. AT2 cell populations were quantified with immunohistochemistry using Surfactant Protein C (SPC) antibody. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure induces an acute lung injury and leads to abnormal pulmonary development characterized by alveolar simplification. At 8 weeks of age, AT2 cell populations are decreased in wild-type hyperoxia exposed mice compared to room air. Loss of CD73 attenuated this hyperoxia effect with AT2 cell populations comparable to room air controls. Conclusion(s): Loss of CD73, resulting in lower extracellular adenosine levels, leads to a quicker resolution of inflammation following hyperoxic lung injury, including increased KGF protein during recovery in room air This study additionally demonstrates long term preservation of AT2 cell populations remote from the initial hyperoxic injury These findings suggest that adenosine signaling is detrimental in the repair processes following hyperoxic lung injury, and offer the potential for therapies that decrease adenosine signaling in premature neonates to hasten recovery following lung injury.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants and hyperoxia is a major risk factor for this disease. Histopathologically, BPD is characterized by alveolar simplification (fewer and larger alveoli). Our studies showed that hyperoxia exposure increases lung adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha) activation in neonatal mice. Whether this alteration is a compensatory or contributory phenomenon in hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that lung AMPKalpha activation protects against hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD in neonatal mice. Methods used C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) male and female mice pups were housed in air (21% FiO2, normoxia) or 70% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 d while they are injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the AMPKalpha agonist, aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), or the vehicle daily through postnatal days (PND) 1 to 14. Lung tissues were harvested on PND7 or PND14 to determine lung AMPKalpha activation and development, respectively. AMPKalpha activation was determined by immunoblotting, whereas alveolar development was evaluated by radial alveolar counts (RAC) and mean linear intercepts (MLI). Summary of results At PND7, AICAR administration increased phosphorylated AMPKalpha protein levels, indicating that the compound activated AMPKalpha in our experimental conditions. Hyperoxia-exposed mice had a decrease in RAC and increases in MLI indicating that their alveoli were fewer in number and larger in diameter, respectively, when compared with normoxia- exposed mice. Interestingly, AICAR treated mice had increased alveolar development at basal conditions (normoxia exposure). Further, AICAR treatment decreased hyperoxiainduced alveolar simplification. Conclusions These findings support our hypothesis that AMPKalpha signaling mitigates hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD in neonatal mice. We propose that AMPKalpha is a potential target for the development of new therapies for BPD.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease most commonly seen in preterm infants as a result of long-term mechanical ventilation and oxygen exposure. The pathogenesis resulting in BPD is not completely understood. Studies using postmortem BPD lung tissue have shown that there is altered expression of a number of devel-opmentally important genes. Methods used We generated three independent genetic models of BPD-like phenotype by disrupting the signaling pathways of TGFb, PDGFa, and IGF-1 in neonatal lung in mice. The mutations to disrupt the pathways were induced in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) whose role is critical for normal alveologenesis. RNAseq analysis was performed which identified a cluster of differentially expressed genes that were common amongst the three BPD-like phenotypes. To assess the physiologic relevance of a specific subset of the identified genes, we examined their expression in a well-established hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolization mouse model. We analyzed gene expression using a total of ten mice exposed to hyperoxia compared to eight combined controls at three different points during neonatal life. mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Summary of results Expression of Foxq1, Foxd1, Foxc2 were decreased in the mouse BPD lungs suggesting a role for the selected genes in the pathogenesis of BPD. We further demonstrate that Foxd1 is expressed in SCMF and ablation of SCMF during alveologenesis via Foxd1-cre arrests alveolar formation leading to a BPD-like phenotype. To validate our findings in the mouse model, we show that Foxd1 is also reduced in human BPD lung tissue. Conclusions Collectively, these observations support the notion that disruption of Foxd1 and FOX family transcription factors may play a major role in the pathogenesis of BPD in preterm infants. This study was supported by NHLBI and The Hastings Foundation.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of preterm neonates with a few therapeutic options. Our previous studies suggested that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) therapy is effective in the treatment of BPD in mouse models. Furthermore, microRNA-206 (miR-206) suggested having a correlation with BPD by regulating the expression of fibronectin 1 (FN1). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to characterize the role of BMSCs with the up-regulation of miR-206 in the treatment of BPD in newborn mice. Method(s): The BPD mouse model was induced by 60% oxygen. BMSCs transfected with miR-206 or negative control (NC) plasmid were administered on postnatal day 7 (P7) and every following week through an intraperitoneal injection (105 cells/animal) until P35. The mice were weighed and their lungs were weighed and prepared for histology. The expression levels of miR-206, FN1, and pulmonary surfactant-associated protein-C (SP-C) were determined through the quantitative polymerase chain reaction and under the immunofluorescence. The protein expression levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by ELISA. Result(s): BMSCs with up-regulation of miR-206 reduced the degrees of pulmonary edema, improved pulmonary architecture, and attenuated inflammation in BPD mice compared to the NC plasmid group. Furthermore, the up-regulation of miR-206 in BMSCs down-regulated the expression levels of TGF-beta and IL-6 in plasma samples and of SP-C and FN1 in the lung tissue of BPD mice. Conclusion(s): BMSCs with up-regulation of miR-206 are effective in the treatment of BPD in newborn mice, and the study introduced a novel idea for the treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2019, Author(s).

AB  - Objective: There is an increasing incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP) in preterm infants in China, which is the key issue affecting their survival rate and life quality. This study was performed to better understand the mechanism of protective effect of celecoxib on hyperoxia induced injury. Method(s): Hyperoxia BPD model was established using newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats exposed to high O2 level (85%). Celecoxib treatment was also conducted. Histology of lung tissue samples were analyzed. Functional studies were systematically performed using the lung tissues and A549 cells. Result(s): Hyperoxia disrupted lung development in SD rats. Celecoxib alleviated the damaged lung development. NF-kappaB and Aquaporin (AQP) 1 were identified as the pathways in the hyperoxia-induced lung injury. We have shown that hyperoxia activated NF-kappaB pathway through increased nucleus translocation and repressed AQP1 expression. On the contrary, celecoxib inhibited NF-kappaB phosphorylation and nucleus translocation and increased AQP1 expression through inhibiting COX2 activity. Additionally, celecoxib also rescued apoptosis induced by hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): Our study identified NF-kappaB and AQP1 as the pathways in the hyperoxia-induced lung injury in the hyperoxia BPD model SD rats and it provided a better understanding of the protective effect of celecoxib. It suggests NF-kappaB and AQP1 may be as potential targets for treating newborns with BPD.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Wang, Li, Zhao, Li, Liu, Jiang, Li and Zhang.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether batyl alcohol (BTA) can improve the pathology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in newborn rats induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the mechanism. Method(s): Pregnant SD rats (16.5 d) were randomly assigned into Saline group, LPS group, and LPS+BTA group. Amniocentesis injection of LPS was performed to establish neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rat model. In LPS+BTA group, LPS and BTA were injected at the same time. After birth, LPS+BTA group was injected with BTA continuously everyday for 7 days. The other two groups were injected with normal saline of equal volume. Lung tissues of neonatal rats on the first, third and seventh day after birth were stained by hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and resorcin-fuchsin respectively, to observe alveolarization arrest. The mRNA and protein levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in newborn rats lungs were detected by real-time PCR and ELISA. In vitro, mouse macrophages RAW264.7 were cultured to detect IL-1beta mRNA levels and protein levels after treatment with LPS and BTA. SD rat bone marrow macrophages were isolated and treated with LPS and BTA. RNA-sequence was taken to screen for possible targets of BTA inhibition of inflammation. Result(s): The results of H-E staining showed that LPS+BTA group had a milder pathology of BPD, with more secondary septa counts, more alveolar counts, and smaller mean linear intercept (all P<0.05); after BTA intervention the expression levels of IL-1beta mRNA and protein in lung tissues of neonatal rats were significantly lower than those in LPS group (both P<0.05). In vitro, IL-1beta mRNA and protein increased after LPS stimulation (both P=0.000), but decreased in the LPS+BTA group (both P<0.05). RNA-sequence results showed that BTA inhibited the expressions of some inflammatory factors, such as thrombospondin1 (Thbs1), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (Trem1), and cluster of differentiation 274 (Cd274), and promoted the expressions of some anti-inflammatory factors, such as complement C1q C chain (C1qc), RT1 class II, locus Da (RT1-Da), and RT1 class II, locus Db1 (RT1-Db1). Conclusion(s): BTA can improve lung pathology of neonatal rats with BPD by downregulating the expression of IL-1beta and reducing inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most devastating conditions in premature babies; meanwhile, keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) plays a key role in lung development. The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic effects of recombinant human KGF-2 (rhKGF-2) in a hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model and explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Method(s): A total of 75 newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were assigned to 5 groups, including normoxia control, normoxia+rhKGF2, BPD (no treatment), BPD+saline (NS) and BPD+rhKGF2 groups (n=15/group). For treatment, rats were intratracheally administered rhKGF2 (5 mg/ kg) or equal volume of saline, and sacrificed 2 weeks later. Weights and wet-to-dry weight ratio ((W/D), an indicator of lung edema) values of lung specimens were measured. Then, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) levels were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) samples. Next, lung tissue specimens were assessed by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry (VEGFa and NF-kappaB p65), quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR; surfactant protein C or SPC) and immunoblotting (VEGFa, NF-kappaB p65 and p-p65). Result(s): In the hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model, rhKGF-2 promoted lung growth and development, and reduced pulmonary edema. Treatment with rhKGF-2 resulted in reduced BALF levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased SPC mRNA levels and VEGF protein expression in the lung, and slightly decreased lung NF-kappaB p65 nuclear expression and phosphorylation. Conclusion(s): rhKGF-2 alleviates hyperoxia-induced BPD, likely through reduced inflammation and induction of SPC.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a significant pulmonary complication for preterm infants, but the mechanisms associated with altered lung development remain poorly understood. Our mouse model of perinatal inflammation mimics the pathophysiology observed in infants with severe BPD. We have previously reported decreased pulmonary miR-29b and miR~17-92 cluster expression and increased global DNA methylation. These studies tested the hypothesis that histone methylation may also be responsible for the lung pathophysiology observed in this model. First, we investigated protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)-mediated changes in H4R3me2 (symmetrical and asymmetrical). Second, we explored lysine methylation, specifically H3K4me3, H3K9me2, and H3K27me3. Methods Pregnant C3H/HeN mice received an intraperitoneal LPS injection on E16 and newborn pups were exposed in 85% oxygen from birth to 14 days of life. On postnatal day 14 or 28, mouse lung tissues were harvested. Tissue homogenates were analyzed by western blot for PRMT-1, PRMT-5, and H4R3me2 symmetrical and asymmetrical and by ELISA for H3K4me3 , H3K9me2, and H3K27me3 (Epigentek). Results Perinatal inflammation resulted in decreased expression of PRMT-1 (1.0 v 0.45 arbitrary units, p<0.0001) and PRMT-5 (1.0 v 0.48 arbitrary units, p=0.02) which corresponded to decreases in H4R3me2 symmetrical methylation (1.3 v 0.39 arbitrary units, p=0.04). H3K9me2 (39.8 vs 25.0 ug/mL, p=0.03) and H3K4me3 (41.1 vs 30.3 ug/mL, p<0.05) were also decreased in the exposed group while H3K27me3 was not significant. Conclusion Our data suggest that maternal inflammation combined with neonatal hyperoxia influences expression of proteins involved in histone methylation and alters specific histone methylation marks. Further investigations will explore expression of histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases. Overall the changes observed suggest a disruption in chromatin structure which may be responsible for altered gene expression in this model.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common co-morbidity following preterm birth and is due to neonatal exposure to mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen. Neonatal mice placed in hyperoxia (85% oxygen) on post-natal day 1 (P1) develop histological evidence of lung injury and abnormal lung development manifest by fewer and larger alveoli, otherwise termed alveolar simplification, that is reminiscent of BPD in humans. We have found in adult models of lung injury that arginase 2 induction is involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury. We tested the hypothesis that neonatal mice deficient in the Arginase 2 gene (Arg2) would have attenuated alveolar simplification. Time-dated pregnant Arg2 deficient mice (Arg2-/-) on a C57BL/6 background and C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice were used in these studies. Neonatal mice were placed in either room air (normoxia) or 85% oxygen (hyperoxia) by placing their cages in a Plexiglas chamber and flowing either room air or 85% oxygen through the chamber at 10 lpm. Dams were rotated daily between a normoxic litter and a hyperoxic litter to prevent oxygen toxicity in the dam. There were 4 experimental groups, wild-type normoxia, wild-type hyperoxia, Arg2-/-normoxia, and Arg2-/-hyperoxia. After 1, 7 or 14 days the neonatal animals were euthanized and the lungs were inflation-fixed for H&E staining and determination of alveolar area, perimeter and number using automated software. After 1 day in hyperoxia, there were no differences between any of the four groups in terms of alveolar area (size) or alveolar number. After 7 days in hyperoxia, wild-type mice had a substantially greater mean alveolar area than did normoxic wild-type mice (1135+/-41 mum vs 465+/-17 mum, p<0.001). While there was no difference in normoxic wild-type or normoxic Arg2-/-mice, hyperoxic Arg2-/-mice had significantly lower mean alveolar area (856+/-45 Mm) than did hyperoxic wild-type mice (p<0.001). Similar differences in alveolar perimeter were seen between the groups, i.e. hyperoxic wild-type mice had the greatest perimeter, hyperoxic Arg2-/- were significantly lower than hyperoxic wild-type but not as low as normoxic-exposed animals. Furthermore, hyperoxic wild-type mice had substantially lower mean alveolar numbers than did normoxic wild-type mice (35+/-2 vs 89+/-3, p<0.001). There was no difference between normoxic wild-type mice and normoxic Arg2-/-mice in mean alveolar number. Hyperoxic Arg2-/- mice had significantly more alveoli (50+/-2) than did hyperoxic wild-type mice (p<0.001). These differences in alveolar area, perimeter, and number seen at 7 days remained at 14 days. Taken together these data demonstrate that deficiency of Arg2 attenuates the alveolar simplification caused by exposing neonatal mice to hyperoxia.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity suffered by surviving preterm infants and is associated with adverse pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of BPD. An influx of inflammatory cells and neutrophil-derived chemokines has been implicated in the development of BPD. A competitive CXCR2 receptor antagonist reduces neutrophil activation and influx into tissues. Objective(s): To evaluate the effects of a CXCR2 antagonist on reducing postnatal systemic inflammation and consequently developing BPD in rat model. Method(s): Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) was administered to the amniotic fluid on E20, which corresponds to the late canalicular stage of rat lung development. LPS and a CXCR2 receptor antagonist were administered intraperitoneally on P1, P3, and P5, which correspond to the saccular and early alveolar stages. On P7 and P14, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from the rat pups. To assess alveolar development, four random, non-overlapping fields per animal in two distal lung sections were studied at 100X magnification. Result(s): Early postnatal LPS administration significantly increased neutrophil counts in BALF and PB and disrupted alveolar development, whereas prenatal LPS alone did not. The CXCR2 antagonist significantly attenuated neutrophil increases in BALF and PB and restored alveolar development in the rat pups exposed to early ponstnatal LPS. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that a CXCR2 receptor antagonist restores alveolar development by alleviating pulmonary and systemic inflammation induced by early postnatal LPS.

AB  - Introduction: Clusterin (CLU) is a highly conserved glycoprotein whose gene expression is ubiquitous and attribute to many cellular physiologic functions, including cell to cell interactions, complement inhibition, lipid transportation, cell survival, and apoptosis. We hypothesized that CLU might be important in hyperoxic acute lung injury. Method(s): CLU expression and signaling were determined in airway epithelial cells after in vitro hyperoxia challenge. Using a murine model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, the role of CLU was determined by CLU-deficient mice. CLU and cell death were detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, ELISA and western blotting. Result(s): Increased CLU expression was observed in tracheal aspirates from babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death. After hyperoxic exposure, CLU-/- mice exhibited more acute lung injury and activation of apoptotic cascades compared with wild-type mice. Further, hyperoxic conditions were a major stimulus for increased CLU expression and apoptosis in cultured human airway epithelial cells. We also observed that CLU overexpression attenuated hyperoxia-induced apoptosis in human airway epithelial cells. Conclusion(s): CLU has a significant protective role against pulmonary hyperoxic injury and their expression is related to the cell survival or protection of oxidant injury and cell death.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by impaired alveolarization and regeneration. Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor regulating cell homeostasis and pluripotency, is highly expressed in human and mice during lung development and linked to lung growth arrest. Aim(s): To study (1) if hyperoxia-induced lung injury reduces Klf4 in ATII cells in mice; (2) if ATII-specific loss of Klf4 depletes number of ATII cells; (3) the function of Klf4 in ATII cells in vitro. Method(s): (1) Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 (HYX) or room air (NOX). (2) Cell-specific deletion of Klf4 was induced in mice during late lung development. (3) Overexpression (Klf4OE) and ablation of Klf4 (Klf4del; CRISPR/Cas9) in murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12). Result(s): (1) Dual immunofluorescent staining determined Klf4 in ATII cells during late murine lung development and in epithelial cells in the human fetal lung. Reduced ATII markers after HYX were linked to reduced Klf4 expression and lung growth. (2) ATII-specific Klf4 ablation during late lung development reduced ATII cells in mice. (3) In MLE-12, HYX decreased Klf4 expression and cell survival. Klf4OE and Klf4del in MLE-12 induced apoptosis and decreased epithelial cell markers. Klf4OE aggravated HYX-related decreased proliferation, activated Smad2 and blocked Stat3 signaling. Inhibition of Smad2, using an inhibitor, activated Stat3. Klf4del activated Stat3 and inhibited Smad2. Conclusion(s): We identified a novel Klf4-Smad2-Stat3 axis cell homeostasis that HYX disrupts in ATII cells and in lungs of newborn mice, suggesting Klf4 as potential target regulating lung regeneration.

AB  - PURPOSE/AIM: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is associated with poor survival in preterm infants. Intrauterine infection can aggravate the degree of obstruction of alveolar development in premature infants; however, the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we sought to determine whether pyroptosis could be inhibited by downregulating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and inducing autophagy in BPD-affected lung tissue., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a neonatal rat model of BPD induced by intrauterine infection via intraperitoneally injecting pregnant rats with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subsequently, mTOR levels and pyroptosis were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, TUNEL staining, and western blotting. The Shapiro-Wilk test was employed to assess the normality of the experimental data. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare the means between two groups, and comparisons between multiple groups were performed using analysis of variance., RESULTS: Pyroptosis of lung epithelial cells increased in BPD lung tissues. After administering an mTOR phosphorylation inhibitor (rapamycin) to neonatal rats with BPD, the level of autophagy increased, while the expression of autophagy cargo adaptors, LC3 and p62, did not differ. Following rapamycin treatment, NLRP3, Pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, pro-IL-1beta, IL-1beta, IL-18/Pro-IL-18, N-GSDMD/GSDMD, Pro-caspase-11, and caspase-11 were negatively regulated in BPD lung tissues. The opposite results were observed after treatment with the autophagy inhibitor MHY1485, showing an increase in pyroptosis and a significant decrease in the number of alveoli in BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin reduces pyroptosis in neonatal rats with LPS-induced BPD by inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation and inducing autophagy; hence, it may represent a potential therapeutic for treating BPD.

AB  - Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease due to prematurity are significant sources of morbidity and mortality in former pre-term infants. Central to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the presence of chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress which lead to pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesized that a novel therapeutic directed at reducing inflammation and oxidative stress may also reduce fibrosis and the long-term sequela these infants face. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene activity. MicroRNA-146a is a key regulatory molecule in the NFkB mediated inflammatory response, with downstream effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6. MicroRNA-146a was conjugated to cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP146a), which are scavengers of reactive oxygen species and rapidly taken up by epithelial cells. The aim of this project was to evaluate intratracheal delivery of CNP146a at the time of bleomycin injury and examine its effects on decreasing pulmonary inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. Methods Using an established murine model, 29 juvenile (10 week) male and female C57BL/6 mice, underwent intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (3units/kg), PBS (as a control), or bleomycin and a single dose of CNP146a (10uM). Animals were euthanized either 7 days post-injury for bronchial alveolar lavage and tissue harvest or 14 days post-injury for lung inflation and tissue harvest. Results Histologic analysis 14 days post-injury (Figure 1) shows significant lung injury with bleomycin, including the presence of alveolar hemorrhage, increased collagen deposition, and an abundance of CD45+ cells when compared to PBS treated controls. The study group treated with CNP146a at the time of bleomycin injury showed less mucosal sloughing/hemorrhage, decreased CD45+inflammatory cells, and markedly decreased lung fibrosis. Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were processed for cell viability. There were no viable cells observed in the BAL obtained from the bleomycin treated group at 7 days (0.0% cell viability compared to 32.04% cell viability in the PBS controls). The CNP146a treated group had improved cell viability, equivalent to the control animals (35.92% cell viability). Conclusions CNP-146a is a new therapeutic that may possess applications for the prevention and treatment of chronic pulmonary disease in former pre-term infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease. Histology 14 days post-injury demonstrates decreased inflammation, hemorrhage, and fibrosis the CNP146a treated group. Further, the BAL samples show improved cell viability in the CNP-146a treated group. These results indicate that CNP146a decreases the inflammation and fibrosis associated with the bleomycin induced model of pulmonary fibrosis and may be an effective therapy in the mitigation of chronic pulmonary disease.

AB  - Rationale:Supplemental oxygen is frequently administered to newborns with pulmonary insufficiency. However, prolonged hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm human infants. Hypothesis:Prenatal treatment of newborn mice with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), followed by exposure to hyperoxia, would alleviate lung injury by mechanisms involving cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A or 1B1 enzymes. Method(s):Timed pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) were treated orally with the vehicle corn oil (CO) or BNF (80 mgkg) on gestational days (18-20), and pups born to these mothers were maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (> 95% O2) for 48, 96 or 120 h. The mice were sacrificed on day 5 of life. Expression of the CYP1A1/2 and 1B1 was measured by RT-PCR and Western blots. Lung injury was assessed by determining lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios and histopathology. Result(s):Mice born to CO-treated mothers showed significant lung injury and alveolar simplification at all three time points of hyperoxia. However, newborn mice born to BNFtreated mothers showed attenuation of lung injury and increased alveolarization, as determined by measuring lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios and histology respectively. The most striking observation was that both pulmonary and hepatic CYP1B1 (not CYP1A1/2) were markedly induced in newborns born to BNF exposed mothers after 48 h of hyperoxia, and that correlated with less lung injury. After 5 days of hyperoxia, the pattern of expression was reversed. Conclusion(s): Our observations support the hypothesis that maternal BNF protects newborn mice against hyperoxic lung injury by induction of the CYP1B1 and CYP1A1/2 in a temporal fashion. Future studies on the role of CYP1A/1B1 enzymes in oxygen-mediated lung injury could lead to the development of rational strategies in the prevention/treatment of BPD in premature infants.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a devastating sequela of preterm birth, is associated with inflammation, decreased vascularization and arrested alveolarization. Neonatal oxygen-induced lung injury is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular superoxide. This is counteracted by EC-SOD, an antioxidant enzyme found in the extracellular matrix of the lung that scavenges superoxide and protects the developing premature lung against the damaging effects of hyperoxia. We hypothesized that, compared to wild type (WT), EC-SOD KO mice in neonatal hyperoxia exposure would have worse outcomes, with exaggerated inflammation and decreased alveolarization. METHOD(S): WT and EC-SOD KO mice were exposed to either normoxia (21%O2) or hyperoxia (95%O2) during the saccular phase of lung development from postnatal day (PN) 1 to PN 5, and then maintained in normoxia until PN14. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cells from BAL and lung tissue were obtained on PN7 and PN14. Alveolarization was measured using radial alveolar count (RAC) in inflation-fixed lungs. ELISAs were used for BAL and qRT-PCR was used for lung tissue mRNA expression of key molecules such as IL-1s and TGFs1. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-Acetyl Glucosaminidase (NAG) activities were used to quantify neutrophils and macrophages respectively. RESULT(S): In normoxia, compared to WT, EC-SOD KO mice had decreased alveolarization (PN14), increased MPO (PN7, P<0.001) and NAG activities (PN14, P<0.0001), as well as increased IL-1s mRNA (PN7, P<0.05) and TGFs1 mRNA (PN7, P<0.05). Compared to normoxia controls, WT mice exposed to hyperoxia had increased MPO and NAG activities, increased IL-1s and TGFs1 mRNA on PN7, and decreased alveolarization on PN14. In hyperoxia, compared to WT mice, EC-SOD KO mice had worse alveolarization, increased macrophage influx (PN14, P<0.005), increased IL-1s1 mRNA (PN7, P<0.01, PN14, P<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The lack of EC-SOD in neonatal mice is associated with inflammation and decreased alveolarization in room air (21%O2). With hyperoxia exposure (95%O2), the inflammatory response and decreased alveolarization are further exaggerated in EC-SOD KO mice compared to WT mice. We conclude that EC-SOD is critical for targeting ROS during neonatal lung development and could be a potential therapeutic target for neonatal oxygen-induced lung injury.

AB  - Rationale: The pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is complex with multiple regulatory pathways contributing to the disrupted alveolar development in BPD. DNA methylation at the 5-carbon position of cytosine (5mC) constitutes a major epigenetic mark that often signals for transcriptional repression. The reversal of DNA methylation is catalyzed by the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET1, TET2 and TET3) family of dioxygenases, which are capable of oxidizing 5mC into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and lead to active DNA demethylation. Recent studies suggest aberrant DNA methylation plays an important role in the arrested alveolar development after hyperoxic exposure. However, the role of TET proteins and hydroxymethylation in the pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains unknown. Method(s): Newborn C57Bl6 (WT) mice were exposed to room air or 95% oxygen for 4 days after birth (P1 to P5), and then allowed to recover in room air to P15. Mice were sacrificed for collection of lung tissue for analysis of lung development and epigenetic modifications. Analysis included immunohistochemistry of lung sections using anti-Tet1, anti-Tet2 and anti-5hmc antibodies. Dot-blot assay was performed using anti-5hmc antibody and dilutions of denatured DNA samples isolated from whole lung lysates and spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. Transcript levels from whole lung lysates were quantitated using real-time quantitative PCR. Results were compared with data from the LungMap project. Result(s): Hyperoxic exposure for 4 days after birth disrupted normal pulmonary development with enlarged and simplified alveoli. TET1 transcript levels were higher on DOL 0 compared to DOL 15, but no change in room air and hyperoxia groups at P15. This is consistent with decreased expression of TET1 in LungMap mouse RNA sequence data from E16.5 to P28. IHC results were more inconsistent for hyperoxia exposed animals but suggested 4 days of hyperoxia exposure may cause decreased 5hmC in some animals (Figure). After room air recovery, whole lung 5hmC levels are not different at DOL 15. Conclusion(s): TET1 gene expression shows developmental changes based on postnatal age suggesting that hydroxymethylation may play an important role in the transition to the extrauterine environment. Altered DNA hydroxymethylation may be affected by hyperoxia exposure and along with evidence of aberrant DNA methylation in arrested alveolar development, could contribute to the pathophysiology of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal chronic lung disease, characterized by reduced alveolarization and loss of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-II). Since neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are associated with lung diseases, we hypothesized (1) that the BDNF system is dysregulated in lungs of newborn mice exposed to prolonged hyperoxia; and (2) that BDNF-receptor TrkB regulates homeostasis of AEC-II. Method(s): (1) Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 or 21% O2 for 28 days; lungs were harvested at postnatal day 3 (P3), P7, P21, P28 and P70. (2) Cultured murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were treated with BDNF-receptor inhibitor (K252a), followed by assessment of cell survival and gene expression. Result(s): (1) Gene and protein expression as well as phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB) were increased in lungs during the alveolar phase; TrkB was localized in the bronchial epithelium and in the alveolar septa using immunohistochemistry. Hyperoxia increased serum BDNF and lung BDNF expression, whereas active TrkB was inhibited in lungs of newborn mice. Blocked lung TrkB signaling was linked to reduced surfactant protein C expression and increased alphaSMA and cyclin D1 (cell cycle regulator). (2) TrkBblockade using K252a inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis and the expression of mesenchymal markers in MLE-12. Conclusion(s): Here we demonstrate a blockade of the BDNFTrkB pathway in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury and identify TrkB as a novel regulator of AEC-II homeostasis. Thus, our findings indicate an important role of BDNF signaling in the pathogenesis of BPD, offering a new target to enable lung regeneration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Defective vascular development is a hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. The mechanisms underlying molecular regulation of normal and abnormal vascularization in the saccular/alveolar lung remain incompletely understood. To investigate the role of the endothelial cell (EC) in lung vascular arborization and alveolarization (vascular hypothesis), we targeted delta like 4 (DLL4), an EC Notch ligand that regulates embryonic angiogenesis. We hypothesized that DLL4-dependent angiogenesis is critical for pulmonary vascular arborization and alveolarization. We combined DLL4 mapping in mice and human samples with functional studies in DLL4 haploinsufficient (Dll4+/LacZ) and EC-specific Dll4-deletion mice to test this hypothesis. METHOD(S): Immunofluorescence (IF) was performed on mouse and human lung (autopsy) sections obtained from the canalicular to alveolar phase. DLL4 (EC tip cell marker), JAG1 (EC stalk cell marker), and PECAM expression were captured by confocal microscopy. X-gal staining on frozen sections from Dll4+/LacZ mice investigated temporal and spatial DLL4 expression in relation to vascular and acinar development. PECAM distribution, radial alveolar counts and mean linear intercepts were assessed to quantify vascular development and alveolarization in Dll4+/LacZ mice. Tamoxifen inducible-, EC specific knockout mice Dll4Loxp/Loxp; Cdh5-CreERT2 were used to examine the contribution of DLL4 to alveolarization. RESULT(S): DLL4 was expressed in the mouse lung from E17 to P28, and the human lung between 23-43wk gestation, with peak expression in the alveolar phase. DLL4 was expressed in small arteries and lung capillaries in a PECAM-restricted manner. Markers of stalk cell EC specification (Jag1), and EC Notch activation (NICD) mirrored and proximated EC DLL4 expression during mouse and human lung development. Lung dll4 (X-gal) expression was confirmed from E17 to P28 using Dll4+/LacZ mice with prominent expression in the saccular/early alveolar phase and in secondary septae. Haploinsufficiency of Dll4 (Dll4+/LacZ) resulted in hypersprouting of lung blood vessels at E17.5, disorganized capillaries at P6, and narrowed-lumen capillaries and smaller intermediate blood vessels (10-150muM) at P14. Dll4+/LacZ mice had defective alveolarization as evident by decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts (Fig. 1). Inducible-deletion of EC Dll4 at the onset of alveolar phase (P4) disrupted alveolar development in mid-alveolar phase (Fig. 1). CONCLUSION(S): We propose that DLL4-dependent angiogenesis regulates lung vascular development and loss of Dll4 impairs angiogenesis, disrupting lung vascularization and alveolarization. Our data evince a direct role for EC-Dll4 signaling in regulating alveolarization. These data inform investigation of Dll4 as a prime candidate mediating defective vascularization and alveolarization reported in BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a devastating pulmonary complication of respiratory failure in preterm infants, is the most common chronic inflammatory lung disease of prematurity. Exposure to mechanical ventilation and oxygen results in inflammation, a key pathogenic contributor to the development of BPD. The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), a key component of the extracellular matrix and the Receptor for HA-Mediated Motility (RHAMM, CD168) contribute to the inflammatory and fibrotic responses to acute lung injury, but the role of RHAMM in BPD has not been studied to date. We hypothesized that, compared to wild type (WT) mice, RHAMM knockout (KO) mice would be protected in a neonatal hyperoxia model of BPD. METHOD(S): WT and RHAMM KO mice were exposed to either normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) during the saccular phase of lung development from postnatal day (PN) 1 to PN5, and then maintained in normoxia until PN14. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cells from BAL, and lung tissue were obtained on PN7 and PN14. Lung morphometric evaluation included Radial Alveolar Count (RAC) in inflation-fixed lungs. Expression of IL1s in BAL was analyzed by ELISA and in lung tissue by qPCR. Neutrophils and macrophages in BAL cell pellets were quantified by myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-Acetyl Glucosaminidase (NAG) activities, respectively. RESULT(S):WT and RHAMM KO mice were similar at baseline. Compared to WT mice maintained in normoxia, WT mice exposed to hyperoxia had increased IL1s mRNA and protein(PN7, P <0.05), MPO (PN7, P <0.05) and NAG activities (PN14, P <0.05). Compared to WT mice in hyperoxia, RHAMM KO mice exposed to hyperoxia had less affected alveolarization (PN14), decreased MPO (PN7, P <0.05) and NAG activities (PN14, P <0.05), as well as decreased IL1s protein (PN7 and PN14, P <0.05). CONCLUSION(S): RHAMM KO mice are protected from the decreased alveolarization and increased inflammatory responses to neonatal hyperoxia. These data suggest that RHAMM is a potential therapeutic target to decrease the incidence and/or severity of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects pre-term infants whose lungs are unable to support life outside of the womb. These babies receive therapeutic oxygen which compensates for poor lung function but also causes oxidative damage to lung epithelium, resulting in a simplified lung marked by larger and fewer alveoli. We identified thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) as a protein of interest in the pathogenesis of BPD since Trx1 is cytoprotective against hyperoxic cell death. Using a perinatal hyperoxic mouse model of BPD, pulmonary Trx1 activity inversely correlates with atmospheric oxygen tension following birth and hyperoxic treatment. Therefore, we tested if impairment of lung epithelial Trx1 promotes BPD pathogenesis. Trx1 floxed mice (Trx1fl) were bred to mice expressing cre recombinase driven by the surfactant protein C promoter (sftpc-cre) to generate a mouse with Trx1 deficient lung epithelial cells. Although expected genotypic ratios were detected at birth, lethality was noted in Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice as early as 14 days of age. The LD50 for Trx1 deficient mice was 20 days old, while Trx1 heterozygote littermates appeared normal (p<0.001, n=12-17). Upon autopsy, large air-filled pneumatoceles were noted across multiple lobes of Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice. Similar to BPD, Trx1 deficient mice had a simplified lung marked by an increase in mean linear intercept and airspace size with decreased airspace numbers and radial alveolar count. Similar to mice treated with perinatal hyperoxia, Trx1 deficient lungs had fewer alveolar type 2 cells detected by surfactant protein B and thyroid transcription factor 1 immunohistochemistry. This work demonstrates that impairment of Trx1 in lung epithelial cells causes respiratory pathologies consistent with BPD. Ongoing studies seek to define the temporal nature of lung pathogenesis and test the overarching hypothesis that Trx1 serves as a molecular sensor of atmospheric oxygen tension in lung epithelium during alveolar development and perinatal hyperoxic injury.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a devastating pulmonary complication of respiratory failure in preterm infants. We have established that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of BPD. Endogenous danger signals activate TLRs to increase the expression of pro-ILs and the NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase 1 to cleave pro-IL1s to mature IL1s. We have also shown that oligomeric hyaluronan fragments (oHA) are endogenous danger signals that activate the inflammasome and promote the production of mature IL1s. We have developed HA binding peptides (HABP) that block inflammation and fibrosis after acute lung injury with bleomycin. We hypothesized that HABP treatment of neonatal mice given hyperoxia during the saccular stage of lung development would be prevent the activation of TLRs and NLRP3 and therefore block inflammation in the mouse BPD model. METHOD(S): Neonatal mice (n=6-12) were exposed to 95% oxygen (O2) from postnatal day (PN) 1 to PN5 and then kept in 21% O2 until PN14. Mice were given HABP subcutaneously on PN1, 3, and 5. Mice were examined on PN7 and PN14. Cells obtained by lavage were studied by MPO activity for neutrophils and N-Acetyl Glucosaminidase activity for macrophages. Lung pro- IL1s was determined using IL1s mRNA and BAL mature IL1s was determined by ELISA. RESULT(S): Exposure to 95% O2 was associated with a 3-fold increase in MPO activity at PN7 (P<0.001) and a 2-fold increase in NAG activity at PN14 (P<0.001). IL1s mRNA and IL1s protein were both increased 3-fold at PN7. Treatment with HABP resulted in complete abrogation of the increased MPO activity, IL1s mRNA and protein at PN7 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Neonatal hyperoxia exposure during the saccular phase of lung development is associated with an activation of the TLR-NLRP3 inflammasome with increased IL1s and inflammation. Treatment with a peptide that blocks HA completely prevents the activation of this pathway. We speculate that HABP is a potential novel preventative therapy for BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infants and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening sequelae of this disease. Disrupted lung angiogenesis is a hallmark of BPD-associated PH. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2 is shown to modulate angiogenesis. Further, we observed that: hyperoxia exposure increases the expression of ERK 1 and 2 in neonatal mice; and pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 in primary fetal human pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) decreases in vitro angiogenesis. Whether ERK1 and/or ERK2 contributes to or mitigates experimental BPD and PH is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that endothelial ERK2-deficient neonatal mice will be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wild-type (WT) littermates. Method(s): In vivo studies: To disrupt endothelial ERK2 signaling, we decreased the expression of ERK2 in the mouse lung endothelial cells by breeding ERK2flox/flox mice with Tie-Cre mice. One-day-old endothelial ERK2-sufficient (eERK2+/+) or -deficient (eERK2+/-) mice were exposed to air (FiO2 21%) or hyperoxia (FiO2 70%) for up to 14 d, following which the lungs were harvested to determine angiogenesis and the expression of ERK1, ERK2, and several cytokines/chemokines. In addition, we performed echocardiography studies on PND14 to determine the independent and interactive effects of ERK2 gene and hyperoxia exposure on the following indices of PH: pulmonary acceleration time (PAT), RV ejection time (ET), PAT/ET, and RV systolic pressure (RVSP). In vitro studies: For translational studies, we used fetal HPMECs and determined the effects of ERK2 knockdown on angiogenesis and expression of ERK-1/2. Result(s): Lung ERK2 protein levels were lower in eERK2+/- mice than eERK2+/+ mice at basal conditions and upon exposure to hyperoxia. Importantly, the ERK1 protein levels were similar in eERK2+/- and eERK2+/+ mice. Hyperoxia exposure for 14 d independently decreased PAT and PAT/ET ratio and increased RVSP, indicating that hyperoxia induces PH. Further, hyperoxia independently increased lung inflammation and decreased lung angiogenesis. However, these effects of hyperoxia were augmented in the presence of endothelial ERK2 deficiency, indicating that endothelial ERK2 gene interacts with hyperoxia to potentiate the lung injury. Additionally, knockdown of ERK2 in HPMECs decreased in vitro angiogenesis signifying the importance of ERK2 for human lungs. Conclusion(s): Endothelial ERK2 signaling is necessary to mitigate hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice. Our results indicate that endothelial ERK2 is a potential therapeutic target for the management of BPD and PH in infants.

AB  - Introduction: Inflammation is the common pathway leading to Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. We previously demonstrated that depletion of CD11b+monocytes/macrophages in PN0 CD11b-DTR depleter mice resulted in severe hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) with capillary leak and mortality by 40h of hyperoxia exposure. We hypothesized that monocyte/macrophage responses to pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the severity of HILI. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to identify novel and targetable inflammatory pathways in neonatal pulmonary monocytes/macrophages in early HILI. Method(s): HILI was used to model BPD in neonatal mice. Ly6Chi(N=6) and Ly6Clo(N=5) interstitial monocytes/macrophages (IM) were isolated by FACS from lungs of PN1 C57BL/6 mice exposed to RA or O2 for 24h. RNASeq was performed, and data analysis used R with the DESeq2 package to generate normalized gene counts and differential expression analysis. Gene enrichment analyses were performed with Enrichr. DT-treated CD11b-DTR+and DTR- littermate controls were exposed to HILI for 24h before histological analyses and sorting of Ly6Chiand Ly6CloIM for qPCR. Rescue experiments were performed with intranasal administration of 50ng recombinant IFN-gamma at PN0. Cellular sources of IFN-gamma were identified in Great mice (Jax 017581) using flow cytometry and the endogenous YFP reporter. Result(s): Depletion of 50% Ly6ChiIM but not Ly6CloIM was seen in DT-treated CD11b-DTR+mice treated with hyperoxia for 24h. Comparison of hyperoxia-induced changes in expression with known patterns of ligand-induced gene expression (LINCS) revealed significant upregulation of the IFN- gamma pathway in Ly6Chicells (Ccl5 gene) and downregulation of the IFN-gamma pathway in Ly6Clocells (NfatC and Add3 genes). When compared to Ly6Chicells, GOBP analysis of O2-exposed Ly6Clocells showed downregulation the IFN-gamma-mediated signaling pathway. Administration of intranasal IFN-gamma rescued DT-treated CD11b-DTR+depleter mice (with fewer Ly6ChiIM) from severe pulmonary hemorrhage and morbidity at 24h. Ifn-gammaalso decreased MMP9 mRNA in Ly6CloIM isolated from CD11b-DTR+mice. We identified endogenous sources of Ifn-gamma in the neonatal lung to be alveolar macrophages (AM, 5% of CD45+ cells), NK cells (0.5%), CD4+T cells (0.1%) Eosinophils (0.5%), dendritic cells (0.1%), Ly6ChiIM (1.3%), and Ly6CloIM (1.3%) with 3-fold hyperoxia-induced increases in AM and CD4+ Ifn-gamma. Conclusion(s): Through gene enrichment studies of RNASeq data and rescue of lung injury in DT-treated CD11b-DTR+mice, we found an unexpected protective role for IFN-gamma 24h after hyperoxia exposure. AM and/or CD4+-derived IFN-gamma may limit HILI through downregulation of IM-derived matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Rationale: Bronhocpulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by an arrest in lung development with severe impairment of alveolar septation and vascular development, increased fibroblast proliferation and pathological fibrosis. Premature male neonates are at a greater risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes are not known. Our preliminary results show that neonatal female mice have decreased expression of pro-fibrotic markers and improved alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development compared to male littermates in a murine model of BPD. Analysis of the pulmonary transcriptome suggests that the anti-fibrotic miRNA, miR-30a, may confer some of these sexspecific differences. The anti-fibrotic role of miR-30a has been reported previously in many disease states and organs. miR30a inhibits both the transcriptional regulator Snai1, which promotes fibrosis. We hypothesized that miR-30a decreases Snai1 expression in females and thus may attenuate pathological fibrosis in the developing lung. Method(s): Male and female neonatal WT and mir30-/- mice were exposed to hyperoxia (P1-P5; saccular stage of lung development) and euthanized on P7 or P21 after recovery in normoxia. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs; from 18-24 weeks gestation donors; 3 male and 3 female) were cultured in endothelial cell media per protocol. Cells from passage from 3 to 6 were used for experiments. For hyperoxic exposure, cells were incubated in 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 degreeC for upto 72 hours. Cells in normoxia were maintained in air and 5% CO2. miR-30a and Snai1 expression was measured. Snai1 expression was measured in HPMECs after miR-30a overexpression and inhibition. Result(s): miR-30a expression was markedly increase in expression in female neonatal mice at PND21, the same time point when expression of profibrotic mediators was significantly decreased in female mice. Compellingly, the female advantage in alveolarization and vascular development is lost, and expression of pro-fibrotic markers is increased, in miR30a-/- mice. Female WT neonatal mice showed significantly lower expression of Snai1 (mRNA and protein) in the lung after hyperoxia exposure at P7 and P21 compared to hyperoxia-exposed male mice. Upon hyperoxia exposure Snai1 expression was greater in HPMECs compared to normoxic controls and the male cells showed higher expression than female cells. Treatment with mir-30a mimic decreased, while treatment with miR-30a inhibitor increased Snai1 expression in HPMECs. Conclusion(s): miR-30a mediated down regulation of Snai1 may contribute to protection from hyperoxic lung injury in female neonatal mice and contribute to the sex-specific differences seen in BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Premature infants exposed to supplemental oxygen are at risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with long-term consequences including airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). BPD models have used neonatal hyperoxia to induce AHR, alveolar simplification, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous smooth muscle relaxant degraded in neonatal hyperoxia by elevated GSNO reductase (GSNOR) catabolism in the mouse lung (Molecular Pharmacology 2016). We have reported that global GSNOR knock-out mice were protected from hyperoxia-induced AHR and PH changes. We thus hypothesized that smooth muscle GSNOR is of functional importance to the AHR and PH outcomes, and that GSNOR[Flox] / alpha-smooth muscle actin[Cre] knock-out mice (GSM-/-) will be protected from AHR and PH. Method(s): Newborn C57BL/6 wild-types (background) or GSM-/- (conditional smooth muscle knockouts) were randomized on the first day of life to be raised in 21% or 60% oxygen for 3 weeks, then recovered in room air to 6 weeks of age. Using a rodent ventilator (flexiVent, SCIREQ), respiratory system resistance (Rrs) was measured in response to aerosolized methacholine challenge (MCh 0-200 mg/mL). Alveolar simplification (radial alveolar counts of hematoxylin and eosin staining) and pulmonary vessel muscularization (alpha-smooth muscle actin staining) were compared in inflation-fixed 5 mum lung sections by a masked technician. In separate animals, ventricular walls were dissected and weighed to assess for right ventricular hypertrophy (Fulton's Index = right ventricle / (left ventricle + intraventricular septum)). Result(s): Neonatal hyperoxia resulted in AHR and PH changes in wild-type adult mice: Rrs responses to MCh, alveolar counts, pulmonary vessel hypertrophy, and right ventricular hypertrophy were significantly different compared to room air controls (p<0.05). Hyperoxia-exposed GSM-/- mice were protected from pulmonary vessel and right ventricular hypertrophy, but unlike global GSNOR knockout mice, they were not protected from alveolar simplification or AHR (p<0.05 vs room air controls). Conclusion(s): These studies show that hyperoxia-exposed GSM-/- mice are protected from end-organ PH changes but not BPD alveolar simplification or AHR. We speculate that despite BPD lung changes, augmented GSNO vaso-relaxation from absent enzymatic catabolism in arterial smooth muscle prevented the development of pulmonary vessel and right ventricular hypertrophy. Conversely, GSNOR deletion in airway smooth muscle did not protect against AHR, indicating airway tethering and/or continued GSNO catabolism in the airway epithelium contributes to hyperoxic AHR - where GSNO possibly represents an epithelial derived relaxing factor. GSNO-based therapies may serve as novel treatments for patients with BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease that affects infants when normal lung development and function is interrupted due to hyperoxiainduced endothelial dysfunction, vascular injury and impaired alveolarization in lungs. Adiponectin, an adipokine secreted by the adipose tissue, has been recognized as a key regulator of lung endothelial cell function and inflammation in several lung diseases, however, the role of adiponectin in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) and BPD is largely unknown. In this study, we explored the role of adiponectin in hyperoxia-induced endothelial dysfunction, lung injury and BPD. Method(s): We used bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues collected from room air (21% oxygen) and hyperoxia (60% oxygen) exposed to wildtype (WT) and adiponectin (APN)-/- newborn mice. In addition, we used human lung tissues collected at various stage of BPD development. Lung inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vascular injury and lung morphometric analyses (mean chord length, radial alveolar count, septal thickness and branches) were performed on these specimens. Result(s): We detected reduced adiponectin protein level in lungs of neonatal mice (**P<0.01) as well as in lung endothelial cells (***P<0.001) exposed to hyperoxia as compared to room air. We also confirmed decreased adiponectin level in lung tissues from human neonatal lungs at various stage of BPD. Hyperoxia exposure to adiponectin-deficient (APN-/-) mice showed severe BPD phenotype, as demonstrated by decreased angiogenesis (**P<0.01), impaired pulmonary vasculature, and alveolar simplification as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. We showed that WT hyperoxia mice treated with adiponectin attenuated endothelial dysfunction, improve alveolarization as manifested by decreased mean linear intercept (**P<0.01) and increased angiogenesis as demonstrated by the enhanced level of angiopoietin-1 (*P<0.05) in lungs. Conclusion(s): These results show that reduced adiponectin levels in lungs during hyperoxia exposure increases endothelial dysfunction, vascular injury and impairs normal alveolarization in developing lungs. Further, we show that hyperoxia exposed neonatal mice treated with exogenous adiponectin attenuates endothelial dysfunction, lung injury and improve alveolarization in the developing lung by promoting angiogenesis.
