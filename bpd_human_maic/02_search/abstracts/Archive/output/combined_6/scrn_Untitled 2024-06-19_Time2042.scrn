Our primary aim in this study was to investigate if differences in free radical generation in HUVECs obtained from extremely preterm infants could be associated with varying risk for death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) Methods Used: In vitro cultures of HUVECs isolated from cord segments of 32 infants between 23-32 weeks gestation were grown to confluence in P100 petri dishes and incubated with Krebs's ringer phosphate Solution containing Amplex Red reagent and horseradish peroxidase for 30 min at 37degreeC. Extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) released by these cells was quantified using resorufin arbitrary fluorescence units measured in their supernatants at excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 and 590 nm respectively. Summary of Results: HUVECs of infants who developed BPD or died released higher concentrations of H2O2 into their supernatants compared to HUVECs obtained from infants who survived without BPD (resorufin arbitrary fluorescence units/30000 cells; Median [25-75th centiles]: 2529.4 [1388.9-4481.3] vs. 402.6 [356.5-650.6], p<0.001 (Figure 1). HbFe3+ Increased production of free radicals such as H2O2 from vascular endothelial cells of infants at risk for BPD could lead to mtDNA damage and reduced mitochondrial function. Measurements of generation of other free radicals such as the superoxide anion and mtDNA damage in these HUVECs are ongoing, and will be useful to further investigate these hypotheses.","group":"g1","id":"5661d41d-82f7-447c-a2f6-92e2142f0a3a","_showDetails":true},"60ac04b7-5993-40d2-a164-cdffed3fbd76":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72146749","title":"Protective effects of aurothioglucose on hyperoxia-dependent cellular toxicity in murine airway clara cells","authors":["Wall S.B.","Locy M.L.","Moore M.","Hill C.L.","Ricart K.C.","Li Q.","Tipple T.E."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*toxicity","*airway","*Clara cell","*society","cell count","lung injury","lung","exposure","mouse","lung development","mouse model","lung dysplasia","newborn","human","epithelium cell","intraperitoneal drug administration","ambient air","infant","prematurity","cell viability","density","morbidity","hypothesis","*free radical","*aurothioglucose","thioredoxin reductase 1","transcription factor","nuclear factor","selenocysteine","sodium selenite","oxygen","trypan blue"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"87","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"S.B.

The present study examined cellular responses to ATG using murine airway Club cells (mtCCs). We tested the hypothesis that ATG would attenuate the effect of hyperoxia on viable cell numbers of mtCCs. Cells were seeded at equal densities in media supplemented with 25 nM sodium selenite to optimize selenocysteine incorporation and TrxR1 activity, as previously described and were exposed to hyperoxia (85% oxygen) or room air (RA) in the presence or absence of 5 muM ATG for 24 h. Viable cell numbers were determined using trypan blue exclusion. ATG inhibited TrxR1 activity and induced Nrf2 nuclear accumulation in mtCCs. Hyperoxia exposure decreased viable cell numbers by 54% compared to RA controls (n = 6, P = 0.0001). Importantly, ATG-treated hyperoxia exposed cells showed an increase of 23% when compared to control hyperoxia exposed cells (n = 6, p = 0.001). In RA-exposed cells, ATG treatment also significantly increased viable cell numbers by 24% from control (n = 6, p = 0.01). The present study demonstrates that ATG treatment enhances cell viability upon exposure to hyperoxia in airway epithelial cells. The fact that ATG enhanced viable cell numbers in RA suggests that ATG may stimulate proliferation. Collectively, these data provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which ATG attenuates lung injury in the neonatal lung in vivo.

Mechanisms of injury attenuation are likely mediated by activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as ATG activates the antioxidant response element (ARE) via activation of Nrf2. We hypothesized that ATG would inhibit TrxR1 in cultured lung epithelial cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Murine alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12) were cultured in the presence or absence of ATG (0.1 to 10 muM) and cell viability (trypan blue exclusion), TrxR1 activity (insulin disulfide reductase assay), and ARE activation (Nrf2 nuclear accumulation). Our data indicated that viable cell number in MLE-12 cells cultured in ATG concentrations of up to 10 muM were not different than control-treated cells. Concentrations of >=1 muM ATG inhibited TrxR significantly at 1 h post-treatment when compared to control; while increasing the exposure time to 24 h resulted in significant inhibition at 0.5 muM ATG. These data reflect a time-dependent inhibition of TrxR1 in MLE-12 cells which is similar to inhibition of TrxR1 and Nrf2 activation observed in neonatal lung tissues from 1 d and 3 d old neonatal mice treated with ATG. Future studies in MLE-12 cells will assess direct ARE activation and Nrf2 accumulation and will provide additional insights into the mechanisms by which ATG attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits in vivo.

Recent studies relate the presence of perinatal risk factors with the future development of disabilities. Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), a consequence of perinatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and ventilation extended beyond 28 days, is a frequent pathology in preterm infants and a risk factor affecting the child's development. One of the objectives of physiotherapy in neonatology is to prevent respiratory disorders from developing in preterm infants and to reduce risk factors concerning the development of disabilities. Purpose(s): To ascertain whether physiotherapy, following the Vojta method applied in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), can reduce both the number of days that preterm infants with RDS need ventilation and hospitalization and the neonatal risk of future abnormalities. Method(s): 45 children with a gestational age of<=32 weeks diagnosed with RDS were randomly allocated to two groups: (i) the experimental group (EG), which, besides the normal standard care provided by the NICU, also received physiotherapy for 30 days in two daily 10-minute sessions, and (ii) a control group (CG) that only received standard NICU care. Both groups were homogeneous regarding size (EG: 25 and CG: 20), sex (EG: 13 males and CG: 8 males), gestational age (EG: 199.32 days and CG: 200.70 days), and birth weight (EG: 1132.92 g and CG: 1139.00 g). The number of days that the members of each group needed ventilation support and remained in the NICU was recorded and also the preterm infants were assessed using the Perinatal Risk Inventory (PERI) at discharge. Result(s): Differences among means were assessed with a Student t test for independent samples and Cohen's d statistic was also calculated to determine the effect size. The results identified significant differences in favor of the experimental group in the number of days that preterm infants needed hospitalization (EG: Mean 71.32, SD 28.49; CG: Mean 120.70, SD 64.56; p = 0.004) and ventilation (EG: Mean 38.72; SD 34.31; CG: Mean 83.50, SD 67.10; p = 0.011), and also had lower risk scores upon discharge (EG: Mean 8.44, SD 3.20; CG: Mean 11.40, SD 3.40; p = 0.005). For all three variables the physiotherapy treatment had a high clinical relevance: ventilation: d = 0.81; hospitalization: d = 0.95 and perinatal risk: d = 0.89. Conclusion(s): Votja-based physiotherapy treatment was effective in reducing the need for ventilation and hospitalization, and also perinatal risk factors upon discharge from the NICU in preterm infants suffering RDS and BPD. Implications: Physiotherapy treatment in the NICU was effective in improving BPD in prematurely born children with RDS, reducing the number of days that ventilation and hospitalization were needed, while favouring the prevention of future disabilities. This will contribute to reducing future health costs, and the short, medium and long term educational and social costs that these childrenwould otherwise generate.","group":"g1","id":"141ceea0-eaf0-419d-a5b4-6c697a580ac9","_showDetails":true},"f09ed15e-2aca-45f4-829a-c8033dd7bc6a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72107952","title":"Deficiency or inhibition of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 protects against hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats","authors":["Chen X.","Walther F.","Van Boxtel R.","Laghmani E.H.","Sengers R.","Folkerts G.","Cuppen E.","Wagenaar G."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung injury","*rat","*European","*society","pneumonia","rat mutant","mortality","thickness","neutrophil","fibrosis","lung","adverse drug reaction","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","fibrin deposition","survival","lung dysplasia","heart","parameters","Wistar rat","macrophage","pulmonary hypertension","pathogenesis","gene","arteriole","histopathology","*lysophosphatidic acid receptor","collagen","messenger RNA","fibrin","ligand","collagen type 3"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"46","number":"SUPPL. 59\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"X.

In neonatal Wistar rats with hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD we determined the beneficial effects of LPAR1 deficiency and of LPAR1 and -3 blocking with Ki16425. Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, fibrin and collagen deposition, vascular leakage, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in LPA signalling and BPD pathogenesis. LPAR1 mutant rats were protected against experimental BPD and mortality with reduced alveolar septal thickness, lung inflammation (reduced influx of macrophages and neutrophils, and CINC1 expression), and collagen III deposition. However, LPAR1 mutant rats were not protected against alveolar enlargement, increased medial wall thickness of small arterioles, fibrin deposition, and vascular alveolar leakage. Treatment of experimental BPD with Ki16425 confirmed the data observed in LPAR1 mutant rats, but did not reduce the pulmonary influx of neutrophils, CINC1 expression, and mortality in rats with experimental BPD. In addition, Ki16425 treatment protected against PAH and right ventricular hypertrophy. In conclusion, LPAR1 deficiency attenuates pulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, thereby reducing mortality, but does not affect alveolar and vascular development and, unlike Ki16425 treatment, does not prevent PAH in neonatal rats with experimental BPD.","group":"g3","id":"f09ed15e-2aca-45f4-829a-c8033dd7bc6a","_showDetails":true},"97f92775-b45f-44ae-96fe-bead6abde5ff":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72107771","title":"Polymorphisms of ADRB2 gene and airway resistance in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Zhdanovich E.","Furman E.","Ponomareva M.","Koryukina I."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*airway resistance","*child","*human","*lung dysplasia","*European","*society","*gene","DNA polymorphism","incidence","patient","air conditioning","bronchus","adrenergic receptor stimulating agent","bronchodilating agent"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"46","number":"SUPPL. 59\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"E.

Objective(s): To study the incidence rate of two ADRB2 gene polymorphisms and ventilation status in BPD. Method(s): Polymorphism variants in the ADRB2 gene were determined in 20 BPD children aged 8-23 months (the age at birth was 24-25 to 34 weeks) and healthy children. The patients with BPD were divided into 2 groups: group I (n=10) - with heterozygous polymorphism variant (Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu) in the ADRB2 gene or variants of their norm; group II (n=10) - with homozygous variant of one (Arg16Gly) or both polymorphisms (Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu) in the ADRB2 gene. Airway resistance was investigated with the interrupt technique (Rint) with broncholytic test. Result(s): In BPD, homozygous variant of one or both polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene was revealed in 50% of children (n=10) and in 28% of healthy children, respectively. In both groups, increased Rint index was registered in 37,5% of children and was 1,3+/-0,13 kPa/l/s (145,1+/-9,8% of the standard) in group I, and 1,7+/-0,47 kPa/l/s (185,8+/-49,8%) in group II.

Mutations have been reported as a cause of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neurologic disorders. There is scarce literature regarding associations with pulmonary disease. We report on a pediatric patient with diffuse lung disease and a later diagnosis of FLNA mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9 year old girl presented for routine follow-up to the pulmonology clinic. She had a complex past medical history including interstitial lung disease (ILD) and failure to thrive as an infant. She was born at term with a ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, and developed respiratory symptoms considered to be out of proportion to her cardiac lesions. Sweat chloride testing, upper GI series, and modified barium swallow were negative. High resolution chest CT showed ground glass opacification with areas of atelectasis and hyperinflation, resulting in diagnosis of ILD. A bronchoscopy and open lung biopsy were not performed due to parental preference, and later improvement on systemic corticosteroids. At 19 months of age, she experienced a moderate sized pneumothorax associated with an acute illness. She was later diagnosed with asthma which was well controlled. At age eight, she developed seizures described as visual hallucinations and abnormal eye movements. A CT and MRI of the brain showed magna cisterna, nonspecific gliosis in the corpus callosum, and periventricular heterotopia. Genetic workup resulted in the diagnosis of FLNA mutation (c.988-1 G>C). A chest CT scan was performed which showed new bronchiectasis without clear etiology. Complete pulmonary function testing demonstrated airflow obstruction (FEV1 75%, FEV1/FVC 0.71) with significant air trapping (RV/TLC 0.41) and diminished diffusion capacity (DLCO 52%). DISCUSSION: FLNA mutation causes a wide array of phenotypes including otopalatodigital syndromes, frontometaphyseal dysplasia, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and periventricular heterotopia. Rare case reports have described lung disease similar to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital lobar emphysema, and bronchomalacia. Our case builds upon these prior reports as our patient presented with lung disease very early in life which evolved with time and later presented with a more well-recognized FLNA mutation phenotype. CONCLUSION(S): These findings highlight the importance of considering genetic abnormalities in young patients with otherwise unexplained diffuse lung disease, especially in those with co-existing musculoskeletal, cardiac, or neurologic abnormalities. Our case also demonstrates that FLNA mutation lung phenotypes may evolve with age.","group":"g1","id":"5d72680c-c1bd-4b09-95d7-40201a7b276f","_showDetails":true},"0fa8bc4c-1266-4c44-bb5e-5a270fe40ee5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023 to 2024>","title":"MALAT1 binds to miR-188-3p to regulate ALOX5 activity in the lung inflammatory response of neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2023.06.008","authors":["Feng, Dan-Dan","Chen, Jia-He","Chen, Yu-Fei","Cao, Qian","Li, Bing-Jie","Chen, Xiao-Qing","Jin, Rui","Zhou, Guo-Ping"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230627//","keywords":["Animals","Rats","Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Cell Line, Tumor","*Hyperoxia","Leukocytes, Mononuclear/me [Metabolism]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","MicroRNAs/me [Metabolism]","*MicroRNAs","RNA, Long Noncoding/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Long Noncoding/me [Metabolism]","*RNA, Long Noncoding"],"journal":"Molecular immunology","volume":"160","isbn":"0161-5890","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med24&NEWS=N&AN=37385102"],"address":"England","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) causes high morbidity and mortality in infants, but no effective preventive or therapeutic agents have been developed to combat BPD. In this study, we assessed the expression of MALAT1 and ALOX5 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BPD neonates, hyperoxia-induced rat models and lung epithelial cell lines. Interestingly, we found upregulated expression of MALAT1 and ALOX5 in the experimental groups, along with upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines. According to bioinformatics prediction, MALAT1 and ALOX5 simultaneously bind to miR-188-3p, which was downregulated in the experimental groups above. Silencing MALAT1 or ALOX5 and overexpressing miR-188-3p inhibited apoptosis and promoted the proliferation of hyperoxia-treated A549 cells. Suppressing MALAT1 or overexpressing miR-188-3p increased the expression levels of miR-188-3p but decreased the expression levels of ALOX5. Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase assays showed that MALAT1 directly targeted miR-188-3p to regulate ALOX5 expression in BPD neonates.

The, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme detoxifies genotoxic products of oxidative stress. The corresponding gene is subject to an inactivating single-nucleotide polymorphism (C(609)T), which reduces detoxifying ability. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the C(609)T NQO1 inborn gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of BPD. Study Design Peripheral blood samples from 119 premature neonates <= 32 weeks of gestational age (42 BPD and 77 non-BPD) were used for DNA extraction. NQO1 genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Results A significantly higher frequency of the NQO1 polymorphism was observed in BPD neonates compared with neonates without BPD. All neonates with <= 1,000 g birth weight who carried the mutant allele in heterozygous or homozygous state developed BPD. None of the BPD nonaffected group neonates with <= 1,000 g birth weight carried the NQO1 polymorphism. Conclusion The higher incidence of NQO1 mutants among BPD neonates as well as the presence of the mutant allele in all neonates with <= 1,000 g who developed BPD provided the first evidence for a possible pathogenetic role of the C(609)T polymorphism in BPD susceptibility due to the reduction or loss of NQO1 enzymatic activity.

For this reason treatments for congenital malformations such as pulmonary hypoplasia or prematurity related bronchopulmonary dysplasia are limited and insufficient. Rac1 is a small Rho GTPase that orchestrates a number of diverse cellular responses including cell proliferation and differentiation, cell alignment, polarization, and cytoskeletal rearrangements, all of which are primary events for lung branching. Furthermore, Rac1 has been shown to play a role in both non-canonical and canonical Wnt signaling, both of which are necessary in lung organogenesis. Using a Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) on embryonic mouse lung explants (E12.5), we now can report that Rac1/canonical Wnt signaling is critical in lung development. Rac1 inhibition resulted in impaired branching following 48 hours in culture. Branching defects were accompanied with impaired vascular development seen in Flk1-LacZ reporter explants and increased mesenchymal cell death. A decrease in the expression of key genes in lung branching such as Fgf10, Fgfr2b, Sprouty2 and Vegfa was also observed. In order to determine whether this inhibitory effect of Rac1 is mediated through canonical Wnt signaling, we then used the Axin2-LacZ reporter line, and demonstrated a strong inhibition in canonical Wnt signaling in the explants treated with the Rac1 inhibitor. Moreover, we observed a strong increase in the Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif-1). Canonical Wnt ligands (Wnt3a and Wnt7b) in presence of the Rac1 inhibitor were able to rescue the branching defects. In conclusion, we provide functional evidence that Rac1 regulates lung branching morphogenesis and vasculogenesis likely through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.","group":"g1","id":"436ac540-b8cd-4e7c-8ecd-f0d275bff93a","_showDetails":true},"57fb7d8a-7b28-48e7-a8f4-372904fec4a3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72053389","title":"Cytokine airway responses to acute rhinovirus infection and respiratory morbidity in severe premature children","authors":["Perez G.F.","Pancham K.","Huseni S.","Jain A.","Rodriguez-Martinez C.E.","Preciado D.","Rose M.","Nino G."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*human","*airway","*morbidity","*prematurity","*child","*Rhinovirus infection","*American","*society","infection","secretion (process)","asthma","electronic medical record","immunoassay","pathogenesis","Rhinovirus","infant","hospitalization","pregnancy","virus","lung dysplasia","cytokine response","intensive care unit","risk factor","medical record review","*cytokine","interleukin 4","protein","thymic stromal lymphopoietin"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"G.F.

The pathomechanisms at play that underlie this arrested lung development are largely unknown. In the present study, a potential role for microRNA (miR) species - which are emerging as key regulators or organogenesis and tissue differentiation - in arrested alveolarization in an experimental animal model of BPD was assessed. A microarray screen identified miR-135b as being highly upregulated (2-fold, 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, at 2, 3, 5, and 14 days post-natal, respectively) by exposure of newborn mouse lungs to hyperoxic (85% O2) conditions, in a well-characterized mouse model of BPD. A comparison of primary mouse lung fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial (alveolar type II) and smooth muscle cells revealed miR-135b to be expressed primarily in lung epithelial cells, placing miR-135b in an ideal cell-type to influence epithelial cell plasticity and septal development. Application of antagomiR-135b consistently suppressed lung miR-135b expression, as well as that of miR-135a, which together constitute the miR-135 family of microRNA. This suppression was seen under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. The total septal volume in lungs from 14-day old mice was reduced from 0.11 cm3 (normoxia, scrambled antagomiRs) to 0.06 cm3 (hyperoxia, scrambled antagomiRs). Application of antagomiR-135b largely restored lung septal volume, to 0.10 cm3 (hyperoxia, antagomirs-135b), as assessed by state-of-the-art stereomorphological analysis. The miR-135 family was also demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of septal wall thickness, where the septal thickness in lungs from 14-day old mice was increased from 10.2 mum (normoxia, scrambled antagomiRs) to 15.7 mum (hyperoxia, scrambled antagomiRs). Application of antagomiR-135b tended to further increase septal wall thickness in hyperoxia-exposed mouse pups, to 18.4 mum (hyperoxia, antagomirs-135b). In silico analysis identified Smad5 as a candidate miR-135b target, which is a key signalling molecule in the developmentally important transforming growth factor-beta and bone morphogenetic protein signalling systems. Consistent with this idea, Smad5 levels in the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed newborn mouse pups were reduced compared with normoxia-exposed mouse pups. Furthermore, application of antagomir-135b to hyperoxia-exposed mouse largely restored normal Smad5 expression. These data suggest that the impact of miR-135b - levels of which are elevated during perturbed late lung development associated with hyperoxia exposure - on Smad5 expression may play a role in aberrant alveolarization of the developing mouse lung.","group":"g3","id":"a7592df4-84ec-4139-93ba-f9fcfa30caea","_showDetails":true},"0bdfc881-c9e3-4d69-97e7-f3c4d7a881d5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72053386","title":"Antagonizing lysyl oxidase activity in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Mizikova I.","Ruiz-Camp J.","Brinckmann J.","Seeger W.","Morty R.E."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","mouse","lung","hyperoxia","model","exposure","lung structure","architecture","lung development","thickness","turnover time","mouse model","cross linking","in vitro study","extracellular matrix","processing","ultrastructure","fiber","lung homogenate","pathology","premature labor","assay","intraperitoneal drug administration","*protein lysine 6 oxidase","3 aminopropionitrile","collagen","pyridinoline","elastin"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"I.

Perturbations to the production and processing of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are believed to play a pivotal role in this aberrant lung development. The expression of lysyl oxidases, which include five family members, is known to be upregulated in both clinical and experimental BPD. The aim of the current study was to assess a causal role for lysyl oxidases in a mouse model of BPD. In this study, the lysyl oxidase inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN; 15 mg/kg/day) was applied (intraperitoneal) to newborn mouse pups, exposed to 85% O2, in a well-characterised BPD model. Hyperoxic exposure led to an increase in lysyl oxidase activity from 152 AFU.min-1 (under normoxic conditions) to 356 AFU.min-1 (under hyperoxic conditions), which was reduced to 53 AFU.min-1 (under hyperoxic conditions with BAPN application) in lung homogenates, assessed in vitro in an Amplex Red-based assay. Additionally, application of BAPN led to a reduction in lysyl oxidase activity on endogenous collagen substrates in vivo, evident from a decrease in hydroxylysylpyridinoline collagen cross-links, and also led to a decrease in total collagen abundance in the lung, normalizing lung total collagen levels, possibly reflecting increased collagen turnover. These data indicated that BAPN administration did antagonize lysyl oxidase activity in vivo, in the BPD model. However, antagonism of lysyl oxidase activity did not lead to normalised lung structure. Exposure of newborn mouse pups to hyperoxia for 20 days decreased the total alveoli number from 7.05 million (under normoxic conditions) to 2.33 million (under hyperoxic conditions). Concomitant administration of BAPN had no impact on alveoli number. Similarly, exposure of newborn mouse pups to hyperoxia for 20 days increased septal wall thickness from 8.8 mum (under normoxic conditions) to 13.2 mum (under hyperoxic conditions). Septal thickness was further increased to 15.2 mum under hyperoxic conditions with concomitant BAPN administration, thus worsening lung architecture. Thus, BAPN administration, although successful in antagonizing lysyl oxidase activity, could not improve lung architecture in the mouse BPD model. Noteworthy, however, was an apparent improvement in the septal elastin fiber ultrastructure upon BAPN administration, perhaps indicating that BAPN administration could partially reverse lung pathology, but antagonisms of lysyl oxidase activity alone was not sufficient to restore proper lung structure to the hyperoxia-exposed developing mouse lung.","group":"g1","id":"0bdfc881-c9e3-4d69-97e7-f3c4d7a881d5","_showDetails":true},"deefecf1-83b7-4b6e-bd56-40371d5bbfc0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72053379","title":"Serum neurotrophin levels may help predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia diagnosis in premature neonates","authors":["Schneeberger D.","Grayson S.","Worley S.","Tang A.","Piedimonte G."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*serum","*lung dysplasia","*diagnosis","*prematurity","*newborn","*human","*American","*society","receiver operating characteristic","patient","baby","airway","birth weight","mother","innervation","physician","gestational age","clinical study","female","infant","mortality","immunoassay","morbidity","prospective study","hospital","school","university","United States","prediction","pathology","inflammation","age","risk","area under the curve","oxygen consumption","*neurotrophin","brain derived neurotrophic factor","antibiotic agent","protein","nerve growth factor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"D.

While the development of BPD is strongly related to gestational age (GA), this factor alone does not allow physicians to predict which babies will develop BPD. Because of their role in airway innervation and inflammation, two processes that define BPD pathology, we hypothesized that serum neurotrophin levels at birth may help predict which premature babies will develop BPD. Method(s): Premature neonates (GA < 37 weeks) admitted to the NICU at West Virginia University School of Medicine and Cleveland Clinic were enrolled as part of an ongoing prospective study of serum neurotrophin levels and BPD. Serum samples were collected within 48 hours of birth, and a highly sensitive immunoassay was used to measure nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein concentrations. Subjects were followed until discharge, and both maternal and patient clinical data were collected. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare subject characteristics on prediction of BPD as measured by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Result(s): Of the 57 subjects who had both NGF and BDNF concentrations measured, 23 (40%) developed BPD. These subjects had significantly younger mothers, lower rates of antenatal antibiotic administration, and had significantly lower GA (median 27 vs. 34 weeks), birthweight (median 965 vs. 2,270 grams), and serum NGF concentrations (median 2,052 vs. 5,835 pg/mL) compared to subjects without BPD (p<0.05). Additionally, BDNF concentrations were lower in subjects with BPD compared to subjects without BPD (p=0.13). ROC analysis showed that GA is the best predictor of BPD in our cohort (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00). Serum NGF and BDNF levels on their own were not able to predict BPD diagnosis as well as GA (NGF AUC = 0.69; BDNF AUC = 0.62), but the addition of serum neurotrophins to GA improves the ability to predict BPD diagnosis by a small amount (GA + NGF + BDNF AUC = 0.94, 95% CI 0.87-1.00; p=0.25 versus GA alone). Conclusion(s): In this interim analysis, serum neurotrophin levels at birth were associated with the development of BPD in preterm neonates and may increase the ability to predict a baby's risk of developing BPD at 28 days of life. Further analysis and adjustment for other patient characteristics is needed as more data is collected.","group":"g1","id":"deefecf1-83b7-4b6e-bd56-40371d5bbfc0","_showDetails":true},"06bcc259-6e0b-47f5-9284-784f058ab418":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72053002","title":"Omeprazole potentiates hyperoxia-induced developmental lung injury in newborn mice via aryl hydrocarbon receptor dependent mechanism(S)","authors":["Shivanna B.","Zhang S.","Patel A.","Zhang W.","Wang L.","Moorthy B."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung injury","*mouse","*American","*society","oxidative stress","pneumonia","exposure","newborn","hypothesis","wild type","therapy","lung","inflammation","lung dysplasia","neutrophil","membrane","lung alveolus macrophage","adult","human","oxygen toxicity","angiogenesis","model","infant","lung lavage","prematurity","dose response","lung blood vessel","*omeprazole","*aromatic hydrocarbon receptor","3 nitrotyrosine","malonaldehyde","macrogol","hyalin","enzyme","protein","antioxidant","vasculotropin","protein A","receptor","marker","quinone derivative","oxidoreductase","nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"B.

We showed that omeprazole (OM) protects adult mice against hyperoxic lung injury via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent mechanisms. Additionally, we observed that newborn AhR dysfunctional mice are more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and alveolar simplification than wild type controls. Whether OM protects newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced developmental lung injury is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that omeprazole will decrease hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification in newborn mice via AhR activation. METHOD(S): One day-old wild type C57BL/6J (WT) pups while exposed to either air (normoxia) or 85 % O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 d, were administered 10 or 25 mg/kg of OM or an equivalent volume of the vehicle, polyethylene glycol (PEG), i.p. once daily from birth for 14 d. The dosing regimen was based on our dose-response studies that suggested at least 25 mg/kg/d of i.p. OM for 3-6 d is required to activate the AhR. Additionally, we used OM at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d to determine its AhR independent effects. Following experiments, the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the mice were harvested to determine AhR activation, inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and alveolarization. RESULT(S): OM treatment (10 to 25 mg/kg) increased oxygen toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. OM treated mice were significantly growth restricted upon exposure to hyperoxia. Furthermore, OM increased hyperoxia induced lung macrophage influx. Interestingly, mice treated with the 25 mg/kg dose of OM had persistent acute lung inflammation upon exposure to hyperoxia as evident by the presence of hyaline membranes, neutrophil infiltrates, and proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space. Additionally, higher dose OM: i. Increased BALF protein concentration, lung malondialdehyde and nitrotyrosine levels, and alveolar simplification; and ii. Decreased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor, and vonWillibrand factor positive lung blood vessels, compared to the vehicle-treated mice exposed to hyperoxia. Surprisingly, CYP1A1 protein, a marker of AhR-activation, was degraded with prolonged treatment (14 d) with OM. Furthermore, OM decreased the expression of NADP(H) quinone oxidoreductase, an antioxidant enzyme, which is also regulated by the AhR. CONCLUSION(S): Contrary to our hypothesis, prolonged OM therapy decreases functional AhR activation and potentiates inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar simplification in a model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn mouse. These findings suggest the need to be cautious before instituting OM therapy in neonates.","group":"g3","id":"06bcc259-6e0b-47f5-9284-784f058ab418","_showDetails":true},"7fc48653-c001-4762-9f50-19445550767b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72052998","title":"Lung epithelial cell-specific knockout of GRP78 perturbs the unfolded protein response and affects lung maturation","authors":["Flodby P.","Li C.","Liu Y.","Wang H.","Marconett C.N.","Lee A.S.","Minoo P.","Crandall E.D.","Borok Z.","Zhou B."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*epithelium cell","*unfolded protein response","*fetus lung maturation","*American","*society","*lung","mouse","apoptosis","endoplasmic reticulum stress","lung development","immunohistochemistry","gene","TUNEL assay","pathogenesis","fetus lung","cell differentiation","lung alveolus cell","oxidative stress","airway","respiratory distress","cell cycle arrest","lethality","lung alveolus epithelium","morphogenesis","electron microscopy","lung dysplasia","microarray analysis","protection","cell population","knockout mouse","chronic lung disease","messenger RNA","marker","reactive oxygen metabolite","antioxidant","caspase 3","protein disulfide isomerase","protein","initiation factor 2","heat shock protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.

Signaling associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is implicated in pathogenesis of the neonatal chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, little is known about the effects of ER stress on lung maturation, especially alveolar epithelial development/differentiation. In this study, we generated mice with lung epithelial cell-specific knockout of Grp78, a master regulator of ER stress responses/homeostasis by crossing floxed Grp78 mice to Sftpc-cre mice. Loss of Grp78 in lung epithelium caused early perinatal lethality. The proportion of knockouts was 17.2% at embryonic day 18 (E18), lower than the expected 25%. At postnatal day 1 (PN1) the proportion of knockouts decreased to 5.6% and all knockout pups died within a few hours from respiratory distress. Histological analysis of embryonic lungs revealed dilated airways at E14 and enlarged, irregular airspaces filled with cellular debris at E18. At PN1, lungs appeared severely dilated or simplified with thin alveolar septae compared to control animals. Western analysis and immunostaining of lung sections showed that expression of markers for both alveolar epithelial type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells was significantly decreased in E18 knockouts. Analysis of UPR signaling/ER stress protein markers showed increased levels of GRP94, p-eIF-2alpha, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) in E18 knockout lungs. Microarray analysis revealed that UPR signaling was the most affected pathway in E18 knockout lungs and qRT-PCR confirmed increased mRNA expression of GRP94, CHOP and PDI and several other major UPR components. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal ER expansion in AT2 cells, which were more loosely arranged and appeared to be detaching from the epithelial sheet. TUNEL assays and immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 demonstrated increased levels of apoptosis in knockouts at E18. While mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (e.g. Nrf2) was reduced, expression of genes involved in generation of reactive oxygen species was elevated. Additionally, increased levels of p21, a key downstream target of TGF-beta signaling involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and p-Smad3 were detected. Collectively, these results suggest that GRP78 plays a key role in protection of AT2 cells, a major stem/progenitor lung cell population, from apoptosis via regulation of UPR signaling during lung development, and implicate oxidative stress and TGF-beta/Smad signaling as mediators of AT2 cell apoptosis in Grp78 knockout mice.","group":"g3","id":"7fc48653-c001-4762-9f50-19445550767b","_showDetails":false},"74837ef4-a3c9-484b-bd42-31ed8f91db8e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72052823","title":"In vivo hyperoxia alters the repair potential and gene expression profile of a CD146+ endogenous lung mesenchymal stromal cells","authors":["Collins J.J.P.","Lithopoulos M.A.","Dos Santos C.C.","Mobius M.A.","Vadivel A.","Zhong S.","Thebaud B."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*gene expression","*lung","*mesenchymal stroma cell","*American","*society","exposure","gene","rat","lung injury","angiogenesis","assay","adverse outcome","digestion","lung dysplasia","endothelium cell","rat model","wound healing","purification","colony forming unit","computer program","animal model","microarray analysis","premature labor","cell therapy","lung development","transducer","growth, development and aging","mesenchyme","immunoregulation","therapy","oxygen","fibroblast growth factor","ficoll","marker","plastic","Janus kinase"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"J.J.P.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) prevent and rescue lung injury when administered exogenously in animal models of BPD. Given the regenerative potential of MSCs, it is unclear why resident lung MSCs (L-MSCs) do not support lung repair and growth in BPD. We hypothesized that in vivo hyperoxia exposure perturbs the repair potential and gene expression in CD146+ endogenous lung MSCs in an oxygen-induced rat model of BPD. Method(s): Rat pups were exposed to 21% or 95% oxygen from postnatal day 0 to 10 and sacrificed on day 12. L-MSCs were isolated by enzymatic digestion, Ficoll-purification and plastic adherence. CD146+ L-MSCs were isolated through magnetic bead selection and characterized according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy criteria. Epithelial repair potential was tested by scratch assay, angiogenesis potential by network formation assay. Microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.1 ST array, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure decreased CD73 expression in CD146+ L-MSCs 2-fold, but not colony forming capacity and other surface marker expression. CD146+ L-MSCs promoted epithelial wound healing over baseline by 25% over 24 hours, regardless of in vivo hyperoxia exposure. Network formation was decreased by ~25% in endothelial cells exposed to conditioned media from hyperoxia CD146+ L-MSCs. GSEA analysis revealed that gene expression of the axonal guidance cue and CDC42 pathways were most strongly increased after in vivo hyperoxia. Among the decreased gene sets, most notably fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway were decreased. Conclusion(s): Exposure to hyperoxia in vivo lowered CD73 and JAK/STAT expression, indicating decreased immune-regulatory function and repair capacity. Increased axonal guidance cue signaling and decreased FGF signaling would indicate a halt in alveolar growth and development signaling from the mesenchyme. This is further supported by a decrease in angiogenesis potential. These changes in endogenous L-MSCs likely reflect both their role in normal lung development, immune regulation and repair, and possibly their dysfunction in BPD. A better understanding of endogenous MSCs may lead to improved effectiveness of exogenous MSC therapy.","group":"g3","id":"74837ef4-a3c9-484b-bd42-31ed8f91db8e","_showDetails":true},"6a624cc9-4b13-4422-8b4d-50544e88959c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72052770","title":"Bronchopulmonary anastomotic pathways (BAP): Possible etiology of isolated idiopathic hypoxemia (IIH) in 11 year old girl","authors":["Galambos C.","Dishop M.K.","Sims-Lucas S.","Ivy D.","Deterding R.R."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*hypoxemia","*girl","*female","*human","*American","*society","*etiology","exercise","vein","microcirculation","blood","lung biopsy","capillary","pulmonary vein","vein blood flow","lung capillary","newborn","heart right left shunt","computer assisted tomography","congenital diaphragm hernia","liver","heart catheterization","hemodynamics","lung dysplasia","environmental exposure","noise","histology","physical examination","ambient air","lung","examination","thorax","genetic screening","lung perfusion","air conditioning","hemoglobinopathy","obstruction","lip","lung function","lung volume","spirometry","cyanosis","fatty acid desaturation","Rendu Osler Weber disease","gene","pathology","dysplasia","tissue section","accuracy","image reconstruction"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.

Blood via BAP bypass the pulmonary capillary bed that contributes to lethal hypoxemia. One of the major histologic features of BAP is the presence of dilated and congested bronchial veins that drain massive amount of shunted blood from the bronchial microcirculation to the pulmonary veins. We describe a case of IIH with BAP and propose that BAP contribute to the underlying pathology. CASE SUMMARY An 11 year old previously healthy female presented with signs of cyanosis (blue lips) with activity documented by formal exercise evaluation in the absence of pulmonary symptoms that had been ongoing for an unknown period of time. She had a negative history for noise bleeds, environmental exposures or other chronic issues. Her physical examination was only remarkable for a room air saturation at 1600 meters of 92-91% with clear lung fields, normal cardiac examination and no clubbing. She underwent the following evaluation which was unremarkable: Bubble ECHO, Chest CT scan high resolution and with contrast, CT liver, Lung perfusion and ventilation scan, ABG, Hemoglobin abnormalities, and cardiac catheterization that demonstrated normal hemodynamics and no notable obstruction to pulmonary venous flow. Pulmonary function testing showed normal spirometry, lung volumes and DLCO. The only evaluation abnormality was a 6 minute walk that documented desaturation to 86% in 2 minutes and then rebounding back to mid-90 % post exercise. Genetic testing for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) noted one variant of uncertain significance in the RASA1 gene. A lung biopsy was completed to evaluate subtle findings to explain her hypoxemia. Histologic sections showed unremarkable pulmonary histology except for the presence of large, dilated and congested thin walled veins that bridged the systemic microcirculation with pulmonary veins. High precision 3-dimensional image reconstruction studies confirmed that these vessels were pathologically dilated bronchial veins. DISCUSSION IIH with and without exercise may be associated with BAP that require lung biopsy and special histologic evaluation to identify.

Many infants continue to experience BPD sequelae well into adolescence and adulthood, however there are no biomarkers available to diagnose BPD prior to 28 days of life. Studies indicate a multi-factorial etiology including prematurity, mechanical ventilation, oxygen exposure, and cytokine imbalance. Previous studies from our group have shown increased levels of neurotrophins (NT) in the lungs of premature babies with BPD, however neurotrophin expression in the blood has not been explored. We hypothesized that serum levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may also be associated with BPD in premature babies. Method(s): Newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Cleveland Clinic were enrolled as part of an ongoing prospective study of serum NT levels and BPD. Serum samples were collected within 48 hours of birth, and a highly sensitive immunoassay was used to measure NGF and BDNF protein concentrations. Subjects were classified as term, preterm without BPD, and preterm with BPD; groups were compared on serum NT concentrations using Kruskal-Wallis tests with Steel-Dwass multiple comparison procedure. Result(s): Nine term, 24 preterm without BPD, and 16 preterm with BPD subjects have been enrolled. Median gestational ages in weeks were 39 in the term group (range 37-41), 34 in the preterm without BPD group (range 29-36), and 26 in the preterm group (range 22-36). Groups differ significantly on serum NGF (overall p=0.035) and serum BDNF (overall p=0.008). Preterm subjects with BPD have significantly lower NGF than preterm subjects without BPD (p=0.030). Both groups of preterm subjects (with and without BPD) have significantly lower BDNF than term subjects (p=0.029 for both). Conclusion(s): We conclude that protein levels of both NGF and BDNF are markedly decreased in the serum of premature infants and may be associated with an increased risk in the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"b6a9752e-a681-4841-8d0a-90a3056fa79f","_showDetails":true},"90c57ad4-249c-4a7e-a98f-c0da99bd706c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"A three-dimensional study of alveologenesis in mouse lung.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.11.017","authors":["Branchfield, Kelsey","Li, Rongbo","Lungova, Vlasta","Verheyden, Jamie M","McCulley, David","Sun, Xin"],"date":"2016//","accessDate":"20151126//","keywords":["Actins/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Artifacts","Elastin/me [Metabolism]","Green Fluorescent Proteins/me [Metabolism]","*Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Lipids/ch [Chemistry]","Mice","Models, Animal","Models, Biological","Myofibroblasts/cy [Cytology]","Myofibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","Pericytes/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/cy [Cytology]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/me [Metabolism]","Stress, Physiological"],"journal":"Developmental biology","volume":"409","number":"2","isbn":"0012-1606","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=26632490"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Alveologenesis is the final step of lung maturation, which subdivides the alveolar region of the lung into smaller units called alveoli. Each of the nascent dividers serves as a new gas-exchange surface, and collectively they drastically increase the surface area for breathing. Disruption of alveologenesis results in simplification of alveoli, as is seen in premature infants diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a prevalent lung disease that is often associated with lifelong breathing deficiencies. To date, a majority of studies of alveologenesis rely on two-dimensional (2D) analysis of tissue sections. Given that an overarching theme of alveologenesis is thinning and extension of the epithelium and mesenchyme to facilitate gas exchange, often only a small portion of a cell or a cellular structure is represented in a single 2D plane. Here, we use a three-dimensional (3D) approach to examine the structural architecture and cellular composition of myofibroblasts, alveolar type 2 cells, elastin and lipid droplets in normal as well as BPD-like mouse lung. We found that 2D finger-like septal crests, commonly used to depict growing alveolar septae, are often artifacts of sectioning through fully established alveolar walls. Instead, a more accurate representation of growing septae are 3D ridges that are lined by platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)-expressing myofibroblasts, as well as the elastin fibers that they produce. Accordingly in 3D, both alpha-SMA and elastin were each found in connected networks underlying the 3D septal ridges rather than as isolated dots at the tip of 2D septal crests. Analysis through representative stages of alveologenesis revealed unappreciated dynamic changes in these patterns. PDGFRA-expressing cells are only alpha-SMA-positive during the first phase of alveologenesis, but not in the second phase, suggesting that the two phases of septae formation may be driven by distinct mechanisms. Thin elastin fibers are already present in the alveolar region prior to alveologenesis, suggesting that during alveologenesis, there is not only new elastin deposition, but also extensive remodeling to transform thin and uniformly distributed fibers into thick cables that rim the nascent septae. Analysis of several genetic as well as hyperoxia-induced models of BPD revealed that the myofibroblast organization is perturbed in all, regardless of whether the origin of defect is epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial or environmental. Finally, analysis of relative position of PDGFRA-positive cells and alveolar type 2 cells reveal that during alveologenesis, these two cell types are not always adjacent to one another. This result suggests that the niche and progenitor relationship afforded by their close juxtaposition in the adult lung may be a later acquired property. These insights revealed by 3D reconstruction of the septae set the foundation for future investigations of the mechanisms driving normal alveologenesis, as well as causes of alveolar simplification in BPD.

Each year over 10,000 premature infants in the US develop BPD. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) occurs in roughly one-third (17%- 43%) of preterm infants with BPD and results in significant mortality and morbidity. The diagnosis of PH in BPD is challenging with overlapping signs and symptoms with the BPD related respiratory problems. Cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosis; however, because of its invasive nature and complications, echocardiogram and serum levels of brain natriuretic protein (BNP) are frequently used with questionable accuracy. We hypothesize that by analyzing the proteomic profile of tracheal-aspirate protein samples we will identify noninvasive biomarkers that will differ in those with BPD with and without PH. Method(s): With IRB approval we obtained tracheal-aspirate samples from 3 preterm babies with BPD and PH and 3 preterm babies with BPD but with no signs and symptoms of PH. These samples were digested, iTRAQ labeled and analyzed via mass spectrometry using the ABSciex 5600 TripleTOF. Protein identification was accomplished using the Paragon Algorithm as implemented in ProteinPilotTM 4.5beta software (ABSciex) and the results were filtered through stringent Local FDR estimation calculated fromProteomics System Performance Evaluation Pipeline (PSPEP). A comprehensive biological network analysis was evaluated with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Result(s): We Identified 285 proteins with unused score of > 1.3 (95% of confidence) and 14 proteins were significantly unregulated or down regulated in the two groups (p<0.05). On analyzing these proteins via the IPA software we found significant correlation of these proteins with the cardiovascular, hematological system development and function along with immune cell trafficking all of which have been implicated to be affected in the pathogenesis of development of PH in BPD. Of these 14 proteins, 3 proteins namely BPIFB1, IGLL1/IGLL5 and MUC5B showed highly significant different expression in the two study population (FDR q=<0.05). Conclusion(s): Preliminary study showed significant up regulation of at-least 3 proteins: BPIFB1, IGLL1/IGLL5, MUC5B in the tracheal aspirate of preterm babies with BPD+PH when compared to those with BPD. The IPA data analysis has demonstrated these proteins to be closely associated with the cardiovascular-systems development and function and immune cell trafficking which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PH in BPD. We aim to pursue a larger study with powered population to demonstrate if these results are reproducible and aid in developing putative biomarkers.

Developmental programs are further aggravated by concurrent immature antioxidant systems in these individuals. Thioredoxins, part of a major antioxidant system, regulate the reduction-oxidation (redox) state of protein thiols through oxidoreductase activities of a highly conserved catalytic site capable of undergoing reversible oxidation. Redox regulation of dithiol/disulfide status is critical for numerous signaling processes as an endogenous thiol oxidoreductase, thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is necessary for normal cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and antioxidant induction. Little is known about its signaling role in distal lung epithelium during hyperoxic exposure and how deficiencies in this redox node may lead to BPD. Mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells cultured in 95% oxygen for up to three days had significantly reduced oxidoreductase activity of Trx1 and its corresponding reductase, TrxR1. Reduction of these activities did not correlate with changes in protein expression and we speculate this is due to oxidation of cysteines in the catalytic sites of these two molecules. Inhibition of TrxR with auranofin, thereby impairing Trx1 activity, augmented hyperoxic cell death. MLE-12 cells transduced with retrovirus expressing the BioID transgene fused to the carboxy-terminus of redox-active (hTrx1-BirA-HA) and -inactive (hTrx1C32/35S-BirA-HA) human Trx1 were cultured in room air or hyperoxia for subsequent proteomic analysis. This proximity-based labeling method, BioID, was used to identify protein substrates targeted by Trx1 and pinpoint molecular events, regulated via dithiol/disulfide interactions, underlying hyperoxia-induced injury. Ongoing studies are focused on prioritizing novel Trx1 substrates identified via BioID based on pathway analysis, known functional relevance within alveolar type II cells, and secondary validation through in vitro and in vivo approaches. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that maintenance of Trx1 activity attenuates hyperoxia-mediated cell death of alveolar epithelial cells and novel redox-sensitive Trx1 substrates were identified that may serve as molecular targets in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"5edce23b-4058-4ff0-8ac2-06c9bb99ab35","_showDetails":true},"52b9b479-a61d-4f06-bf2b-c01df0af6d69":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72052608","title":"Role of NF-E2 related factor (NRF2) and nadph quinone reductase (NQO1) in oxygen mediated lung injury and implications for bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD)","authors":["Kalikkot-Thekkeveedu R.","Chu C.","Basu S.","Moorthy B."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*lung injury","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","hyperoxia","human","gene","protein expression","ambient air","promoter region","adult respiratory distress syndrome","air quality control","protection","luciferase assay","Western blotting","acute lung injury","oxygen toxicity","transcription initiation","reporter gene","single nucleotide polymorphism","wild type","plasmid","genetic variability","lung alveolus cell","exposure","hypothesis","*oxygen","*reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone)","transcription factor Nrf2","oxidizing agent","reactive oxygen metabolite","antioxidant","Renilla luciferin 2 monooxygenase","firefly luciferase","luciferase","reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"R.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the molecular mechanism of oxygen mediated lung injury. Innate anti-oxidant mechanisms in the cells play an important role in the protection against oxygen toxicity and recent studies have suggested that genetic variants (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of antioxidant genes such as NADPH quinone reductase (NQO1) and NF-E2 related factor (Nrf2)contribute to the development of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans. Objective(s): Our objective was to test the hypothesis that hyperoxia will augment the transcriptional activity of NrF2 and NQO1 genes in human pulmonary cells. Design/Methods: Plasmids containing the whole wild type human Nrf2/NQO1 promoter, the firefly luciferase reporter genes (pGL4- NQO1, PGL4-Nrf2) with internal control renilla luciferase reporter (pGL4-Rluc) were transiently transfected into human H441 cells, were grown in room air or hyperoxia (85% O2), 5% CO2 for 0-48 hours to study transcriptional activation of NQO1 and NrF2 genes by hyperoxia. Activation of NQO1 and NrF2 protein expression by hyperoxia(70% O2, 5%CO2 at 24 and 48 hours was measured by Western Blot analysis. Dual luciferase assay indicated NQO 1/Nrf2 promoter induction in the pGL4-luciferase constructs. Result(s): Hyperoxia transcriptionally activated NQO1 gene (~2.4 fold at 48 hours) and Nrf2 gene (~1.7 fold at 48 hrs) in H441 cells, compared to room air controls. While the NrF2 protein expression was enhanced by hyperoxia at 48 hours, there was no significant alteration in NQO1 protein expression at 48 hours on exposure to hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): Our experiments indicate that NQO1 and NrF2 genes are activated by hyperoxia. Further studies may help to develop innovative strategies against hyperoxic lung injury.

Hyperoxia contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness associated with these diseases, however, the mechanisms by which hyperoxia induces these changes are still being explored. In previous studies, expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, was found to be increased in rat lungs following exposure to hyperoxia. In neonatal mice, we tested the hypothesis that BDNF/TrkB signaling is important to mediating hyperoxia effects, and that inhibition of TrkB activation blunts the effects of hyperoxia on airway function. Methods and Results: Mice expressing a mutated TrkB receptor with inhibitable tyrosine kinase activity via a cell permeable and reversible compound (1NMPP1; knockin model) were used. Subsequent to birth, the drinking water of nursing dams was supplemented with vehicle (0.003% DMSO) or 25 muM 1NMPP1, during exposure to room air (21% O2) or hyperoxia (40-50% O2) for 7 days. Pups were then placed back in room air with continued 1NMPP1 supplementation until day 21, when lung function and methacholine challenge (0 - 50 mg/ml in PBS) was performed using a SciReq flexivent system. Compared to room air controls, hyperoxia-exposed pups showed increased airway resistance and higher responses to methacholine, while 1NMPP1 supplementation substantially blunted the effects of hyperoxia on airway resistance and responses to methacholine. Structural changes to the airways such as remodeling, matched these functional changes. Conclusion(s): These novel data highlight the importance of BDNF-TrkB signaling in hyperoxia-induced airway dysfunction during early postnatal development. Sustained effects at 21 days in spite of only 7 days hyperoxia suggest ongoing airway changes that also involve BDNF-TrkB signaling. Overall, these data point to a novel mechanism that is potentially targetable.","group":"g1","id":"36541368-3543-4f6e-ac56-5efc6a882018","_showDetails":true},"8c6b2a5d-7e09-41d0-9504-a536fffa45ea":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72051962","title":"Hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice is associated with dendritic cell activation and increased expression of damp receptors","authors":["Popova A.P.","Cui T.X.","Maheshwer B.","Bentley J.K."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*mouse","*dendritic cell","*cell activation","*American","*society","*exposure","lung","hyperoxia","human","plasma","gene expression","infant","respiratory tract inflammation","prematurity","model","viral respiratory tract infection","chronic lung disease","innate immunity","hospitalization","lung dysplasia","risk","child","lung lavage","myofibroblast","mass spectrometry","respiratory tract allergy","flow cytometry","Rhinovirus","infection","*receptor","adenosine","adenosine phosphate","adenosine triphosphate","oxygen","adenosine diphosphate","ligand","messenger RNA","ecto 5' nucleotidase"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"A.P.

Infants and children with BPD have an increased incidence and higher risk for hospitalization with respiratory viral infections. We previously showed that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice (a model of BPD) leads to increased airway inflammation and responsiveness following treatment with polyI:C or infection with rhinovirus (RV) (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 189: A2317, 2014). Hyperoxic exposure also increased the number and activation of CD103+ lung dendritic cells (DCs). Objective(s): We hypothesize that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice induces activation of lung dendritic cells via increased extracellular release of danger signaling molecules, as evidenced by increased expression of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptors. Method(s): Two or three day-old mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for up to 14 days. Mice were harvested on day 3, 7 and 14 of exposure. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. Subsets of lung DCs were sorted by flow cytometry and DC gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. Mass spectroscopy was used to measure plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) adenosine, AMP, ADP and ATP levels. Result(s): Compared to lungs from air-exposed neonatal mice, lungs of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice show increased expression of CD73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase, which converts AMP to adenosine) and Adora1 (adenosine A1 receptor) at 7 and 14 days after exposure, consistent with conversion of AMP to adenosine and engagement of Adora1. Hyperoxic exposure had no effect on mRNA expression of CD39 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1), which hydrolyzes ATP and ADP to AMP). Expression of the DC DAMP receptor Clec9a was also increased after 7 and 14 days of hyperoxia. Analysis of the sorted lung DCs showed that Clec9a expression was specific for CD103+ lung DCs. Finally, we found significantly elevated AMP levels and increased AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP ratios in plasma after 14 days of hyperoxic exposure, and these measures tended to be elevated in BALF as well. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that neonatal hyperoxia exposure is associated with increased expression of different DAMP receptors and their ligands. We hypothesize that these danger signals induce DC activation and promote pro-inflammatory alterations in the innate immune response.","group":"g3","id":"8c6b2a5d-7e09-41d0-9504-a536fffa45ea","_showDetails":true},"791c2fc8-d9c5-4cc2-956c-a2322dc233ba":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72051957","title":"Moderate prenatal cigarette smoke increases the risk for ventilation induced injury in the developing lung","authors":["Kamgari N.","Oak P.S.","Gimm T.","John-Schuster G.","Yildirim A.O.","Hilgendorff A."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*risk","*air conditioning","*injury","*lung","*American","*society","female","pregnancy","mouse","human","lung development","smoke","patient","density","low birth weight","lung dysplasia","prematurity","vascularization","extracellular matrix","gas","artificial ventilation","chronic lung disease","clinical study","fetus growth","filter","ambient air","control group","elastic fiber","lung alveolus wall","tracheal aspiration procedure","newborn","wild type mouse","*cigarette smoke","elastin","growth factor","oxygen","protein","messenger RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.S.

This patient cohort is known for its increased probability to develop neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD), i.e. bronchopulmonary dysplasia. CLD in this patient cohort is characterized by impaired lung growth exemplified by perturbed alveolarization and vascularization as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and dysregulation of growth factor signaling. Whether the impact of CS in doses, which do not induce fetal growth restriction during pregnancy, affects pulmonary development is largely unknown. We therefore studied the role of prenatal smoke on pulmonary development in newborn mice with and without the additional impact of postnatal mechanical ventilation with oxygen-rich gas (MV-O2). Method(s): Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were exposed to moderate PCS (500 mg/m3- 50min/day) or filter air (FA) from day 7 to 18 of pregnancy. Following delivery, 5-7 days old pups from both groups were either assigned to receive MV-O2 (MV with 40% O2) or breathe room air (control groups) for eight hours. Lungs were collected for histological (alveolar area, radial alveolar count (RAC), septal density) analysis, assessment of ECM structure and micro-vessel number. Frozen specimen served for protein and mRNA analysis. Result(s): Unventilated neonatal mice exposed to PCS exhibited no significant differences with respect to alveolar area, RAC and septal density when compared to pups exposed to FA during pregnancy. MV-O2 led to the development of larger and fewer alveoli in the lungs from pups of both groups (PCS, FA). The underlying structure of the ECM showed a similar abundance of elastin in the lungs obtained from unventilated mice following PCS and FA. However, the lungs from pups exposed to PCS were characterized by the pathologic distribution of elastic fibers in the alveolar walls in contrast to pups following FA, similar to the changes observed with MV-O2. With respect to micro-vessels, MV-O2 led to a significant decrease (2,3 -fold) in vessel number (20-100 mum) in the lungs from pups after PCS when compared to pups exposed FA during pregnancy. Conclusion(s): Moderate PCS leads to decreased micro-vessel formation and altered elastin deposition in the developing lung, which is aggravated upon MV-O2. These findings provide an insight into the role of PCS and MV-O2 on lung development and nCLD. Further studies in tracheal aspirates from neonates after moderate prenatal smoke will translate these findings further into the clinical setting.","group":"g1","id":"791c2fc8-d9c5-4cc2-956c-a2322dc233ba","_showDetails":true},"ef4e8334-33dc-4dc2-a718-3c1751d659d9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72051956","title":"Copy number variation associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Ahmad A.","Bhattacharya S.","Lopez A.M.","Sridhar A.","Pryhuber G.S.","Iqbal A.M.","Mariani T.J."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*copy number variation","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","gene","prematurity","DNA microarray","infant","control group","human","heredity","lung parenchyma","genome","technology","computer program","risk factor","extraction","gestational age","lung","pathogenesis","genetic susceptibility","chronic lung disease","risk","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"A.

Variability in the incidence and severity of BPD among premature infants with similar risk factors suggests that genetic susceptibility plays a significant role in its pathogenesis. The goal of this study is to leverage existing clinical DNA microarray data repositories to identify CNVs that are either predictive of, or associated with, BPD. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical DNA microarray data (n=2800) from our institution. We identified 19 subjects diagnosed with BPD, and two controls groups with no lung-related disease; full term (n=43) and pre-term (n=23). DNA microarray experiments were previously performed on the high resolution 4 x44K Agilent platform, and data were re-analyzed using Feature Extraction v10.10 and Genomic Workbench v7.0 software (Agilent Technologies, USA). To test for disease-associated changes in expression for genes residing in the CNV regions, we used a previously published dataset describing genome-wide expression in lung tissue from subjects with BPD. For those genes within recurrent CNV regions, and demonstrating evidence for differential expression in existing datasets, we attempted expression validation by qPCR. RESULT(S): Mean CNV burden in BPD subject was 2-fold higher than either control group (p=0.056). We identified six recurrent CNV loci in BPD subjects. The frequency of two of these recurrent loci (chr2q31.1 and chr10q11.22) were significantly higher (p<0.05) in BPD subjects as compared with at least one control group. Using our previously published data sets, we interrogated 32 genes within the recurrent CNVs regions for differential expression. Five genes within recurrent CNV loci (15.6%) demonstrated significant changes (p<0.05) in expression in BPD. Differential expression was confirmed for two of these genes (ANXA8 and GPRIN2) by qPCR. CONCLUSION(S): Our data should be useful to aid in the identification of genetic factors associated with increased risk for chronic lung disease in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"ef4e8334-33dc-4dc2-a718-3c1751d659d9","_showDetails":false},"7340000e-f3bf-42e2-bdfc-b94aa5c9f0c3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72051955","title":"Lymphocyte-specific biomarkers associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Bhattacharya S.","Misra R.","Mereness J.","Hyuck H.","Slaunwhite C.","Chu C.-Y.","Lunger V.","Lopez A.","Baran A.","Peterson D.","Reynolds A.M.","Ryan R.M.","Pryhuber G.S.","Mariani T.J."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*lymphocyte","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","gene","gene expression","human","prematurity","infant","blood","gestational age","diagnosis","gender","university","pregnancy","blood sampling","peripheral lymphocyte","lymphocyte proliferation","hospital discharge","maturation","workshop","risk","flow cytometry","computer program","buffalo","analysis of variance","*biological marker","CD8 antigen","calpain","oncostatin M","RNA","molecular marker","transcriptome","ciliary neurotrophic factor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.

Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of fractionated peripheral lymphocytes obtained from preterm infants could identify predictors of BPD, both in terms of biomarkers and pathways, and also uncover disease-related mechanisms. Method(s): Sorted CD8+ lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood samples collected at the time of hospital discharge from 143 preterm infants enrolled with consent in the NHLBI Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) at the University of Rochester and the University at Buffalo. RNA isolated from sorted lymphocytes was interrogated by RNA-Seq analysis. We identified age-, gender- and outcome-related gene expression patterns following standard methods (SAM-Seq, ANOVA, etc.). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used for gene set interpretation. Cell purity and gene expression estimates were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Result(s): Infant peripheral blood CD8+ lymphocytes were consistently isolated at discharge from preterm infants, ranging from 23-37 weeks gestational age at birth, with a high degree of purity as defined by flow cytometry and qPCR-based gene expression analysis. RNA-Seq analysis was completed for CD8+ cells from 79 subjects, generating an average of 9+4 million reads/sample with detection of 64+5% of the transcriptome. Gene expression patterns significantly associated with gestational age at birth, and days of life at sample collection, were identified. Gene expression was only modestly associated (6 genes) with being born at a gestational age with high risk for BPD (<29 weeks). Similarly, few genes were significantly associated with race (7 genes) or gender (14 genes). Consistent gene expression patterns associated with a diagnosis of BPD were identified. However, the magnitude of gene expression differences were highly dependent upon the criteria used to define BPD; 190 genes identified by Shennan definition, 64 genes identified by clinical diagnosis, 7 genes identified by NIH workshop definition. Regardless of BPD definition, dysregulation of Calpain-, Oncostatin M-, and CNTF-associated pathways were implicated. Summary: We have generated transcriptomic data from sort-purified peripheral blood CD8+ lymphocytes from 143 preterm infants. Our analyses have identified sets of molecular markers putatively associated with age-related lymphocyte maturation and with BPD outcome. The implication of Calpain- and Oncostatin M-related pathways with BPD suggests disease-associated differences in lymphocyte proliferation.","group":"g2","id":"7340000e-f3bf-42e2-bdfc-b94aa5c9f0c3","_showDetails":true},"075e7215-3d4e-4dca-b2ad-a3a3460c97c2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72051953","title":"Balancing anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant responses in murine bone marrow derived macrophages","authors":["Nitkin C.R.","Bonfield T.L."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*bone marrow derived macrophage","*American","*society","inflammation","oxidative stress","macrophage","lung injury","lung dysplasia","human","oxygen therapy","pathogenesis","stimulus","chorioamnionitis","newborn sepsis","hyperoxia","Student t test","newborn","prism","morbidity","oxygen concentration","therapy","mouse","*oxidizing agent","oxygen","lipopolysaccharide","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor","complementary DNA","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.R.

Lung injury results from a combination of inflammation and oxidative stress, the cellular responses to which are orchestrated by PPARgamma and Nrf2, respectively. Macrophages produce many signaling molecules implicated in BPD pathogenesis and lie at the intersection of inflammation and oxidative stress. This study sought to determine the combined effect of a pro-inflammatory stimulus and oxidative stress on PPARgamma and Nrf2 in murine macrophages. METHOD(S): Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6J mice were exposed to two oxygen concentrations (21% or 95%), with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1mug/mL), for 24 hours, after which RNA was isolated and cDNA generated, followed by PCR analysis using primers against PPARgamma, TNFalpha, and Nrf2. Data represents fold-change in expression from four independent experiments and was analyzed with Prism using two-sided t tests for significance. RESULT(S): At 21% oxygen, LPS decreased anti-inflammatory PPARgamma (0.07+/-0.02, p<.0001), increased pro-inflammatory TNFalpha (18.60+/-7.94, p=.0686), and decreased anti-oxidant Nrf2 (0.32+/-0.11, p=.0008) expression compared to unstimulated cells. Similarly, at 95% oxygen, LPS decreased PPARgamma (0.16+/-0.07, p<.0001), increased TNFalpha (12.06+/-2.72, p=.0066), and decreased Nrf2 (0.25+/-0.08, p=.0001) expression compared to unstimulated cells. In the absence of LPS, 95% oxygen alone did not significantly affect PPARgamma (0.92+/-0.21, p=.7176), TNFalpha (1.53+/-0.36, p=.1880), or Nrf2 (1.16+/-0.23, p=.5103) expression, compared to 21% oxygen. However, in the presence of LPS, 95% oxygen did not significantly affect PPARgamma (2.4+/-0.94, p=.1787) or TNFalpha (1.03+/-0.39, p=.9494), but did significantly increase Nrf2 (1.39+/-0.11, p=.0139) expression, compared to 21% oxygen. CONCLUSION(S): This study re-demonstrates the pro-inflammatory effect of LPS on PPARgamma and TNFalpha, but is the first to demonstrate LPS-induced suppression of the anti-oxidant response, as suggested by decreased Nrf2 expression. Although 95% hyperoxia alone did not impact expression of PPARgamma, TNFalpha, or Nrf2, combination treatment with LPS resulted in increased Nrf2 expression. Clinically, lung injury from inflammation due to neonatal sepsis or antenatal maternal chorioamnionitis may be exacerbated by postnatal oxygen therapy. Therapies that decrease the pro-inflammatory response or augment the anti-oxidant response may represent beneficial interventions for BPD.

Blocking of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor (LPAR) 1 may be a novel therapeutic option for premature infants at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) by preventing the LPAR1 mediated adverse effects of its ligand LPA, consisting of pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and fibrosis. METHODS. To advance our knowledge on LPAR1 signaling in neonatal cardiopulmonary disease in vivo, we studied the beneficial effects of LPAR1 blocking in neonatal Wistar rats with experimental BPD, induced by exposure to hyperoxia for 10 days, using two different models: (I) LPAR1 mutant rats with a loss of function phenotype, and (II) pharmacological treatment with the LPAR1 and -3 inhibitor Ki16425 (5 mg/kg/day). Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, fibrin and collagen deposition, vascular leakage, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in LPA signaling and BPD pathogenesis. LPAR1 mutant rats have a substitution of methionine 318 by arginine in helix 8 of the receptor. To test the effect of LPAR1M318R on the LPA-induced MAP kinase-signaling cascade, which is the main mediator of the stimulatory effect of LPA on cell proliferation, we isolated primary rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) that endogenously express LPAR1 and tested activation of the MAP kinase-signaling cascade in these cells. RESULTS. Homozygous LPAR1M318R mutant REFs showed a strongly reduced LPA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation response compared to wild type REFs, demonstrating that the M318R mutation in LPAR1 diminishes LPA signaling in primary REFs. The lack of function phenotype that was predicted by computational analyses is further supported by a similar craniofacial malformation in mutant rats as observed in LPAR1 knockout mice. LPAR1 mutant rats were protected against experimental BPD and mortality with reduced alveolar septal thickness, lung inflammation (a reduced influx of macrophages and neutrophils), and hyperoxia-induced collagen III deposition. However, LPAR1 mutant rats were not protected against alveolar enlargement, increased medial wall thickness of small arterioles, fibrin deposition, and vascular alveolar leakage. Treatment of experimental BPD with Ki16425 confirmed the data observed in LPAR1 mutant rats, but did not reduce the influx of neutrophils to the lung and mortality in rats with experimental BPD. In addition, Ki16425 treatment protected against hyperoxia-induced PAH and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). CONCLUSION. LPAR1 deficiency attenuates pulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, thereby reducing mortality, but does not affect alveolar and vascular development and, unlike Ki16425 treatment, does not prevent PAH-induced RVH in neonatal rats with experimental BPD.","group":"g3","id":"2f5d8822-10f4-404d-8c21-f8b291cab3ce","_showDetails":false},"0a7fed06-90ce-4968-ab9b-9ff82a0ca841":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"Age, Sexual Dimorphism, and Disease Associations in the Developing Human Fetal Lung Transcriptome.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2015-0326OC","authors":["Kho, Alvin T","Chhabra, Divya","Sharma, Sunita","Qiu, Weiliang","Carey, Vincent J","Gaedigk, Roger","Vyhlidal, Carrie A","Leeder, J Steven","Tantisira, Kelan G","Weiss, Scott T"],"date":"2016//","keywords":["Age Factors","Databases, Genetic","Female","*Fetus/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Humans","*Lung/em [Embryology]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Diseases/ge [Genetics]","Male","Principal Component Analysis","*Sex Characteristics","Statistics as Topic","*Transcriptome/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"54","number":"6","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=26584061"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The fetal origins of disease hypothesis suggests that variations in the course of prenatal lung development may affect life-long pulmonary function growth, decline, and pathobiology.

We identified dominant transcriptomic correlates for postconception age and sex with corresponding gene sets that were enriched for developing lung structural and functional ontologies. We observed that the transcriptomic sex difference was not a uniform global time shift/lag, rather, lungs of males appear to be more mature than those of females before 96 dpc, and females appear to be more mature than males after 96 dpc. The age correlate gene set was consistently enriched for asthma and bronchopulmonary dysplasia genes, but the sex correlate gene sets were not.

A recent large multicenter integrated genomics analysis comprising of 751 preterm infants identified Micro RNA 219-5p (Mir219) as one of the most critical molecules in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). Prominent targets of Mir219 are platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRalpha), which is a regulator of alveolar septation and ELMO domain containing 2 (ELMOD2), which is genetically implicated in pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesized that the dysregulation of Mir219 and its target genes ELMOD 2 and PDGFRalpha contribute to hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification in mouse models and human BPD. Methods -1) In vivo: C57BL/6 normoxic mice were evaluated at postnatal day 1(P1), P14, and P42 for Mir219 expression. In addition newborn mice were exposed to normoxia (21% oxygen) or hyperoxia (85% oxygen) from P4 to P14. 2) In vitro: Different mouse lung cell lines including mouse lung epithelial cell (MLE), primary mice fibroblast (FB) and macrophage (RAW 264.7) were exposed to either 21% or 85% oxygen for 24 hours. 3) Human: Autopsy lung samples from human preterm infants, term stillborn infants, and preterm infants who died of BPD at term corrected age were evaluated for Mir219 expression. Results - 1a) Under normal conditions, the expression of Mir219 decreased during lung development from P1 to P14. 1b) Compared to animals in normoxia, pups exposed to hyperoxia developed alveolar simplification consistent with BPD (RAC: p<0.001, t test) and had significantly increased expression of Mir219 at P14. 2) In in vitro experiments, Mir219 expression was significantly increased in hyperoxia exposed MLE, FB, and RAW 264.7 cells. A corresponding decrease in PDGFRalpha expression was seen in hyperoxic MLE cells. An increase in ELMOD2 expression was seen in hyperoxic MLE, FB, and RAW cells. 3) Mir219 expression was significantly increased in lung samples of human infants who died of BPD compared to preterm or term stillbith controls. Conclusion - The expression of Mir219 decreases on completion of normal alveolar septation (PN14) but is significantly increased by hyperoxia exposure both in vivo and in vitro experiments and in human BPD lungs. We speculate that Mir219 and its targets are critical to the pathogenesis of hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification and BPD.","group":"g1","id":"03fc9862-a652-4920-8cb5-525fce28f3fd","_showDetails":true},"55ac7b05-536a-41bd-b29c-56b3704b35c7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72051307","title":"Expression profiling of miRNAs in pediatric bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Howrylak J.A.","Pham M.","Oji-Mmuo C.","DiAngelo S.","Spear D.","Group K.","Siddaiah R.","Thomas N.","Silveyra P."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","human","infant","lung","artificial ventilation","prematurity","pathogenesis","tracheal aspiration procedure","child","early diagnosis","morbidity","mortality","ventilator","United States","newborn","gene","statistical model","synthetic bone graft","newborn care","RNA purification","oxygen therapy","lung development","gene expression","respiratory tract disease","health","comprehension","chronic lung disease","pediatric hospital","*microRNA","biological marker","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"J.A.

Oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation in neonatal care are necessary to assist infants with inadequately-developed lungs but also contribute to the development of BPD. Despite improvements of clinical treatments and new ventilator strategies, BPD has remained the most serious pulmonary morbidity in preterm newborns over the past decade. Therefore, it is essential to identify novel non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of BPD to prevent its progression and later implications of impaired lifelong lung health. In this project, we aimed to identify changes of lung miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of BPD, as miRNAs- regulators of gene expression- have been shown to control essential mechanisms of lung development. Method(s): Following IRB approval, we collected tracheal aspirates (n=20) from infants diagnosed with mild and severe BPD receiving mechanical ventilation at the Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital NICU and PICU, and controls (Table 1). We purified miRNAs using the miRNA circulating RNA purification mini kit (Norgen Biotek). We reverse transcribed these with the the miScript II RT kit (Qiagen) for subsequent quantitation of 1,066 human miRNAs utilizing the human miRNome miScript miRNA PCR array v.16 (Qiagen). We used the limma package in Bioconductor to develop linear models to detect miRNAs differentially expressed between BPD and control infants. Result(s): Preliminary results demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.05) differential expression of 16 miRNAs among infants with BPD compared to control infants (with no signs of respiratory disease). These included 13 miRNAs up-regulated and 5 miRNAs down-regulated in infants with BPD vs. control. The most significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were miR-628-5p (p=0.0001), miR-541 (p=0.002), and miR-497 (p=0.01). Conclusion(s): This is the first study to identify miRNAs associated with BPD in pediatric tracheal aspirates. The miRNA biomarkers identified may reveal specific candidate gene networks that are affected in BPD, contributing towards the comprehension of BPD pathogenesis and potential preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) metabolizes oxygen radicals and attenuates lung injury in mice models and is a potential endogenous protective pathway against hyperoxic lung injury. Hyperoxia induces CYP1A1 by arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. We hypothesize that AhR interacts with hyperoxia responsive element (HRE) in the promoter region to induce CYP1A1 on exposure to hyperoxia. Our study aims to identify this HRE location and understand the molecular regulation of CYP1A1 by hyperoxia. Methods Transformed human bronchoalveolar cells (H441) were grown in room air or hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2 for 0-72 hrs) to study CYP1A1 induction by hyperoxia and the known inducer 3-methylchloranthrene (MC). Endogenous CYP1A1 induction was measured by ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD) assay, Western Blot and RT-PCR. CYP1A1 promoter was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis at proposed sites of HRE (for e.g. -974, -1373). Wild type (WT) or mutated CYP1A1 promoter was inserted in pGL4 vector with firefly luciferase reporter gene (pGL4-WT, pGL4-DELTA974, pGL4-DELTA1373) and co-transfected with internal control renilla luciferase reporter (pGL4-Rluc) in the H441 cells. Dual luciferase assay indicated CYP1A1 promoter induction in the respective pGL4-luciferase (WT or deletion constructs of CYP1A1). Binding of AHR to the CYP1A1 promoter was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay. Results Hyperoxia induced endogenous CYP1A1 in H441 cells, as evidenced by increased expression of EROD activities, apoprotein, and mRNA levels. Hyperoxia induced pGL4-WT luciferase, compared to room air controls (0.33 vs 0.5, p value 0.03) (Fig 1). Induction of luciferase by hyperoxia was decreased by the mutated pGL4-DELTA974 CYP1A1 promoter (0.19 vs 0.22, p value 0.25) (Fig 1). The pGL4-DELTA974 also diminished luciferase induction by MC (fold of increase 7.7 vs 2.8, p value <0.01). EMSA and CHIP assay demonstrated diminished AhR/HRE band with DELTA974 which indicated altered DNA-AhR protein interaction at the mutated -974 promoter region. Conclusion We conclude that CYP1A1 induction in response to hyperoxia is mediated by the AHR pathway and the -974 region of CYP1A1 promoter is the proposed HRE regulation site. Further studies targeting CYP1A1 regulation may lead to innovative strategies for hyperoxia mediated ALI and BPD.

Disruption of alveologenesis is associated with the neonatal chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFRalpha) is expressed throughout lung development, with dynamic changes in expression pattern and cell type specificity. Recent studies indicate that PDGFRalpha is required for alveologenesis. However little is known about the precise role, timing and cell-type specificity of PDGFRalpha in alveogenesis. To address these questions we used Pdgfralpha floxed mice in two genetic models to target Pdgfralpha in lung mesodermal cells at different stages of lung development. Targeted inactivation of Pdgfralpha in early embryonic mesoderm via Dermo1-cre resulted in neonatal death coinciding in time with the onset of alveologenesis. PdgfralphaDermo lungs showed severely dilated distal airspaces, disrupted septation, decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Realtime PCR analyses revealed that Dermo1cre-mediated Pdgfralpha inactivation altered expression of multiple cell-type specific markers including those for interstitial myofibroblasts (ATCA2), lipofibroblasts (ADRP, WISP2, and FABP4), endothelial cells (Flk-1) and alveolar type 1 (AQP5) cells. Therefore Pdgfralpha appears essential for differentiation of, or interaction amongst multiple mesenchymal cell progenitors. To understand a cell type-specific functional role of PDGFRalpha in alveologenesis, we targeted Pdgfralpha specifically in myofibroblast progenitors by using a regulable cre model, Gli1creER, which can be activated by time-specific administration of Tamoxifen. Our previous study demonstrated that Gli1creER targets the differentiating myofibroblast progenitors in neonatal lungs. We found that deletion of Pdgfralpha in Gli1creER targeted cells during early neonatal stages lead to disruption of alveologenesis. The mutant lungs show dilated alveoli with a reduced number of secondary crests at postnatal day 11. Importantly, lack of PDGFRalpha on secondary crest myofibroblasts reduced their number (identified by ACTA2positive) in the mutant lungs. To determine whether the reduction of ACTA2 positive cells was caused by alteration of cell fate or cell proliferation, we used GFP to label and trace the Gli1creER targeted cells in both PDGFRalpha deficient and control lungs and found that the number of GFP positive cells was reduced in the mutant lungs. These results indicate that PDGFRalpha is required specifically for the expansion of secondary crest myofibroblast progenitors during alveologenesis.","group":"g1","id":"580fe7c5-9396-49d1-ae1b-be5fdda8bae0","_showDetails":true},"41329a1e-ffcf-4fc0-8420-8b465ac99182":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72049698","title":"Serum neurotrophin levels are associated with clinical outcomes in premature neonates","authors":["Worley S.","Schneeberger D.","Tang A.","Piedimonte G."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*serum","*prematurity","*newborn","*human","*American","*society","ventilator","gestational age","newborn intensive care","blood level","blood","hazard","lung dysplasia","logistic regression analysis","lung","immunoassay","prospective study","hospital","risk","length of stay","survival","patient","intensive care unit","infant","*neurotrophin","surfactant","oxygen","brain derived neurotrophic factor","nerve growth factor","protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"191","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.

Previous studies from our group have shown increased levels of neurotrophins (NT) measured within 48 hours of birth in the lungs of premature babies who go on to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia; however, NT expression in the blood or its association with other outcomes has not been explored. We hypothesized that serum levels of the NTs nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or the ratio of these, may be associated with short-term outcomes and length of NICU stay (LOS) in premature babies. Method(s): Premature neonates (gestational age < 37 weeks) admitted to the NICU at Cleveland Clinic were enrolled as part of an ongoing prospective study of serum neurotrophin levels and postnatal outcomes. Serum samples were collected within 48 hours of birth and a highly sensitive immunoassay was used to measure NGF and BDNF protein concentrations. The associations between log-scale NT levels and the ratio of serum NGF to BDNF, and the outcomes treatment with surfactant, use of ventilator, use of supplementary oxygen, and LOS were assessed using logistic regression and competing risks proportional hazards survival analysis. Result(s): Of the 40 enrolled subjects, 18 (45%) had at least one dose of surfactant, 16 (40%) required use of ventilator, and 27 (68%) had supplementary oxygen. Median LOS was 13 days (range 2-133 days). Lower serum NGF was significantly associated with greater use of ventilator (P=0.032) and longer LOS (P=0.013), but not with treatment with surfactant or use of supplementary oxygen. Lower serum BDNF was significantly associated with great likelihood of treatment with surfactant (P=0.018), use of ventilator (P=0.027) and supplementary oxygen (P=0.042), and longer LOS (P=0.028). NGF to BDNF ratio was not significantly associated with surfactant, ventilator, or oxygen use or LOS. Conclusion(s): In this interim analysis, serum NT levels within 48 hours of birth were associated with need for treatment with surfactant, use of ventilator and supplementary oxygen, and longer LOS.

Decannulation failure places the patient at significant risk of morbidity and mortality. A recent retrospective analysis noted a shorter time to decannulation in children with laryngotracheal/maxillofacial trauma compared to children who received tracheotomy for cardiopulmonary or neurological reasons. This implies that decannulation outcome may be related to underlying etiologic factors. This retrospective study sought to identify the clinical characteristics of patients who failed decannulation, so as to develop an appropriate diagnostic algorithm for successful decannulation. AIM: Determine the demographics, indication for tracheotomy and comorbidities most associated with patients who had decannulation failure. METHOD(S): After IRB approval, a retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with failed decannulation from June 2006 to October 2013 in a tertiary care center. Failed decannulation was defined as reinsertion of tracheostomy tube within six months. Clinical characteristics on each patient who failed decannulation were collected. RESULT(S): 189 patients had attempted decannulation. At first attempt, 40 (21%) failed decannulation. The median age at initiation tracheotomy was 3 months (IQR 1.25-6) and at attempted decannulation was 3 years (IQR 2-4) , with median duration of tracheostomy use being 29 months (IQR 15.5-40). 35 (87.5%) patients failed immediately. 21 patients had a second decannulation attempt of which 10 were successful (48%), mostly after airway corrective surgeries. Dynamic airway collapse was the most frequent primary diagnosis leading to tracheotomy (50%) in subjects who failed decannulation. Feeding dysfunction was the most frequently associated comorbidity occurring in 37 patients (92.5%) followed by neurological abnormalities in 21 patients (52.5%), genetic abnormalities in 19 patients (47.5%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 15 patients (37.5%), cardiac defects in 9 patients (23.1%) and pulmonary hypertension in 6 patients (15.4%).11 (28%) patients had 2 comorbidities while 18 (45%) had 3 comorbidities. CONCLUSION(S): Patients who had dynamic airway obstruction at the time of initiation tracheotomy were most prone to decannulation failure. Feeding dysfunction was the most common comorbidity and the presence of underlying neurologic abnormality and/or genetic abnormality was associated with a higher risk of decannulation failure. A more detailed evaluation of these patients may be required when considering tracheostomy decannulation.

Specific considerations are required for preterm vs term neonates and should attend to the underlying cause of anaemia or thrombocytopenia. Objective(s): To evaluate the risk of transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis (TANEC), retinopathy (ROP), and other disorders causing long-term sequelae in preterm and term neonates. Result(s): The current meta-analysis on liberal vs restrictive haemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusions in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants exhibiting anaemia of prematurity does not indicate significant differences in the combined outcomes of death or serious morbidity at 18-21 months corrected age. Any trial eligible for this meta-analysis did not support an association between RBC transfusion strategies and NEC [RR 1.62 (0.083, 3.13), Cochrane 2011]. However, in almost all retrospective case-control or cohort studies a recent transfusion (>48 h) is significantly associated with NEC. The risk for TANEC increases as younger and lighter the neonate is, and if the baby is ventilated or exhibiting patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The risk of TANEC seems to be inversely related to pre-transfusion haematocrit levels. The risk for severe ROP (33degree) is as higher as earlier RBC are transfused. It also increases with the total number and cumulative volume of RBC transfusions. There is no evidence that RBC transfusion affect the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). Single studies link the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to the volume and frequency of RBC transfusion, while others do not show this association. Uncertainty exists regarding the incidence of RBC transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) in neonates, and whether it putatively contributes to severe BPD. Besides the general risks for transmission of infectious diseases and errors in administration as in RBC transfusions, PLT transfusions to sick neonates could be associated with other specific complications such as microembolisms, which are repetitively considered causing TANEC, IVH or TRALI. However, such associations have not been proven in randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) yet. Noteably, repeated PLT transfusions seem to be associated with hepatic dysfunction following NEC. Likely, the experimental observation is very important that transfusion of adult platelets results in a dysbalance of the neonatal haemostatic system with shortened epinephrine closure times, eventually explaining a specific risk for microembolisms. Normally, hyporeactivity of neonatal platelets is part of a delicately balanced haemostatic system, which is counteracted by high haematocrit levels, higher von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations, and predominance of longer vWF polymers. Conclusion(s): Currently, no international consensus exists on transfusion guidelines for RBC or PLT to preterm and term neonates. However, transfusion-associated complications, such as TANEC, ROP among others per se affecting long-term outcomes of sick neonates, deserve more attention in clinical practice and justify careful evaluation of RBC and PLT transfusion thresholds by performing RCTs.","group":"g1","id":"698e9818-771b-4906-980d-985a047317f0","_showDetails":true},"3d7f49bb-30b4-4925-807f-d11ebc2b1413":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71930473","title":"Individualised care rooms: The future of neonatal care","authors":["Liew E.","Cane C."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*newborn care","*college","*pediatrics","*child health","parent","human","baby","education","health practitioner","satisfaction","nurse","model","prematurity","gestational age","physician","monitoring","kangaroo care","feedback system","bay","incubator","birth weight","weight","health care quality","environment","newborn intensive care","bath","television","general hospital","child","air conditioning","illumination","adult","brain function","lung dysplasia","nursing station","privacy","policy","study design","planning","length of stay","hope","community","pulse oximetry","consultation"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"100","number":"SUPPL. 3","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"E.

This was a result of consultation between the medical health professionals, members of the allied health professionals and parent groups. Problem In a traditional Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU) setting, the majority of care is undertaken by neonatal nurses and incubators are set out in an 'open bay' layout. Assessment of problem and analysis of its causes As a result of this traditional setting, parents often report feeling disempowered. The lack of privacy also limits opportunities for kangaroo care and this can affect parent-child bonding. In the Individualised Care Rooms (ICR) model, parents are encouraged to be resident alongside their premature baby from an early stage and become integral to their daily care in a developmental care environment. They are supported by doctors and nurses, and the babies are monitored by cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry. Research has shown that there is greater parents' satisfaction with the ICR model and premature babies benefit from a shorter length of stay and lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Evidence also supports the provision of regular kangaroo care to improve cerebral function. Intervention There are three broad phases: First phase: Design and building of the ICR. We converted an area within our neonatal unit that was not in clinical use into 10 fully equipped individual rooms. Each room is designed specifically to allow adequate natural lighting, ventilation and space for an adult bed and an incubator. The rooms are also equipped with monitoring equipment and amenities including washbasin and television. Parents share bathrooms and dayroom facilities. A nursing station with central monitor is manned by trained neontal nurses to support parents and babies. Second phase: Education and training. We formulated an admission policy and expected standard of care for the ICR. We set off to promote the ICR in a launch event. There is an ongoing programme of education and training sessions for health professionals and parent groups. Third phase: Admission of babies to the ICR since December 2013. Study design We are in the process of designing a pilot cohort analytical study comparing outcomes of premature babies in the ICR with matched controls of babies nursed in the open bay in our neonatal unit. Our primary outcome targets will include duration of stay, gestational age at discharge and weight at discharge. The secondary outcome target will be a formal neurodevelopmental assessment at various corrected gestation age timepoints. Strategy for change The implementation of the ICR was carried out in a phased manner. This allows adequate time for specific consideration in the design and build of the rooms, education and training sessions, troubleshooting and lastly, implementation. Measurement of improvement Alongside with the planned pilot cohot analytical study, we also plan to conduct a parent satisfaction survey to obtain formal feedback about the ICR. Effects of changes Observation from health professionals are that babies are being discharged at a younger gestational age and lower birth weight with no significant unintended consequence in the community. Verbal feedback from the parent groups regarding ICR has been overwhelmingly positive so far. However we hope to produce a more formal and measurable outcome with the planned study and parents' satisfaction survey. Lessons learnt With the change of junior doctors every six months, education and training sessions need to be ongoing to promote awareness of the purpose and benefits of ICR. Ongoing troubleshooting sessions also help fine tune the running of ICR. Message for others Based on current evidence, we believe that the ICR model should be taken into consideration in the future design and planning of any neonatal unit.","group":"g1","id":"3d7f49bb-30b4-4925-807f-d11ebc2b1413","_showDetails":true},"8a252ce2-b5d4-4671-8b56-e37e5ece4f78":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71915067","title":"The study of oxidative stress in preterm neonates: Lipid and protein peroxidation","authors":["Matyas M.","Blaga L.D.","Hasmasanu M.","Zaharie G."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*oxidative stress","*prematurity","*newborn","*human","*peroxidation","*European","*society","asphyxia","brain hemorrhage","respiratory distress","pathology","lung dysplasia","necrotizing enterocolitis","cell membrane","retrolental fibroplasia","statistical analysis","patient","control group","leukomalacia","data analysis software","*lipid","*protein","free radical","antioxidant","polyunsaturated fatty acid","nucleic acid"],"journal":"European Journal of Clinical Investigation","language":"English","volume":"45","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","isbn":"0014-2972","address":"M.

Several neonatal conditions are correlated with oxidative stress : bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leucomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis. The harmful effect of free radicals are linked to their capacity to react with polyunsaturated fatty acids of cell membranes, proteins and nucleic acids. Material(s) and Method(s): We conducted a prospective, non-randomized study. In the study group were included 14 preterm neonates with different pathologies: respiratory distress, asphyxia, cerebral hemorrhage. The control group consist in 13 healthy, late preterm neonates. For all patients family's consent was obtained. For the study of the oxidative stress we measured the malonildyaldehide (MDA) by Satoh's method and the protein peroxidation was determined spectrophotometrically as described by Reznick and Packer . For neonates from the study group we performed two determination on the first and third day of life. For control we performed one measurement on first day of life. The statistical analysis was done with SPSS program . Result(s): Five neonates of the study group presented sever asphyxia and ten neonates respiratory distress. The median value of MDA in the study group was higher on the third day of life than on the first day (5.12 vs. 4.87 nmol mL-1). The protein peroxidation process presented the same behaviour (5.57 vs. 4.91 nmol mL-1). The protein peroxidation was significantly higher in the study group than at the control ( P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The oxidative stress at preterm neonates is more severe when different pathologies are associated which are leading to overproduction of free radicals than in healthy condition. The knowledge of oxidative stress could be useful to implement antioxidant defenses strategies for preterm neonates.","group":"g1","id":"8a252ce2-b5d4-4671-8b56-e37e5ece4f78","_showDetails":true},"cce1dcea-4f72-4241-881a-a64c28c3b8b2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71874055","title":"Investigating the early mechanisms leading from ventilation-induced lung injury to bronchopulmonary dysplasia using in vitro lung cell over-distension","authors":["Li A.","McDougall A.R.A.","Zahra V.A.","Chandrasena J.","Hooper S.B.","Wallace M.J."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*ventilator induced lung injury","*lung dysplasia","*in vitro study","*lung alveolus cell","*society","*Australia and New Zealand","lung injury","apoptosis","lung fibroblast","lung","fibroblast","cells by body anatomy","injury","model","human","infant","rat","imaging software","cell proliferation","prematurity","fetus lung","lung development","assisted ventilation","caspase 3","marker","protein","messenger RNA"],"journal":"Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","language":"English","volume":"51","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing","isbn":"1034-4810","address":"A.

The initial lung cell types affected by injury and the molecular mechanisms leading from lung injury to BPD are not fully understood. Therefore our aim is to mimic ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) in vitro to investigate the cell types and mechanisms leading to BPD. Method(s): Fetal rat lung fibroblasts were isolated at embryonic day (E)19 and exposed to 0 or 20% phasic over-distension. Cells were collected after 15 minutes, 1, 3, 6 or 24 hours to measure cell proliferation (ki67), apoptosis (caspase-3) and early lung injury markers (CTGF, CYR61 and EGR1). Result(s): Fibroblasts exposed to 20% over-distension had a 3-fold increase in EGR1 mRNA and protein levels within 1 hour of over-distension (p < 0.05). There was a 2-3 fold increase in caspase-3 positive cells after 6 hours of over-distension (p < 0.05). At 24 hours, very few over-distended cells were caspase-3 positive, yet there was a 6% increase in the proportion of cells proliferating (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): This in vitro model of over-distension injury successfully replicates many of the features associated with VILI including increased fibroblast apoptosis, proliferation and markers of lung injury, suggesting that fetal lung fibroblasts are involved in the initial response to VILI. This in vitro model of VILI will allow future studies to identify the early cellular mechanisms that mediate the response of the lung to VILI and that may initiate the cascade of events leading to BPD.","group":"g1","id":"cce1dcea-4f72-4241-881a-a64c28c3b8b2","_showDetails":true},"ed3365cc-a444-4c6a-9e3d-25185271f5ed":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"Protective effect of chorioamnionitis on the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia triggered by postnatal systemic inflammation in neonatal rats.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2015.224","authors":["Choi, Chang Won","Lee, Juyoung","Oh, Joo Youn","Lee, Seung Hyun","Lee, Hyun Ju","Kim, Beyong Il"],"date":"2016//","accessDate":"20151109//","keywords":["Angiogenic Proteins/ge [Genetics]","Angiogenic Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Chorioamnionitis/ci [Chemically Induced]","Chorioamnionitis/ge [Genetics]","Chorioamnionitis/im [Immunology]","Chorioamnionitis/me [Metabolism]","Cytokines/ge [Genetics]","Cytokines/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Gene Expression Regulation","Gestational Age","Inflammation Mediators/me [Metabolism]","Leukocyte Count","*Lipopolysaccharides","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","*Lung/im [Immunology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Neovascularization, Physiologic","Neutrophil Infiltration","Pregnancy","Protective Factors","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","*Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/co [Complications]","Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/ge [Genetics]","Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/im [Immunology]","Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/me [Metabolism]","Time Factors"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"79","number":"2","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=26551413"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Prenatal or postnatal systemic inflammation can contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We investigated whether prenatal intra-amniotic (i.a.) inflammation or early postnatal systemic inflammation can induce BPD in a rat model., METHODS: One microgram of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle was injected into the amniotic sacs 2 d before delivery (E20). After birth, 0.25 mg/kg of LPS or vehicle was injected into the peritoneum of pups on postnatal day (P)1, P3, and P5. On P7 and P14, peripheral blood (PB), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung tissue were obtained and analyzed., RESULTS: Postnatal i.p. injections of LPS significantly increased neutrophil counts in PB and BALF on P7 and P14. Similarly, proinflammatory cytokine and angiogenic factor transcript levels were increased in the lung by i.p. LPS on P7. Alveolar and pulmonary vascular development was markedly disrupted by i.p. LPS on P14. However, pretreatment with i.a. LPS significantly negated the detrimental effects of postnatal i.p. LPS on PB and BALF neutrophil counts and on lung proinflammatory cytokine expression and histopathological changes., CONCLUSION: Exposure to early postnatal systemic LPS induces BPD, an arrest in alveolarization, in neonatal rats. Preceding exposure to i.a.

We investigated whether protein C (PC) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) prevent murine BPD. Method(s): We induced BPD by perinatal inflammation (lipopolysaccharide injection to pregnant dams) and rearing pups in hyperoxia (65% O2). Pups received daily injections of PC, IL-1Ra or vehicle. After 3 or 28 days, lung histology was assessed and pulmonary cytokines and immune cells analyzed by ELISA, protein profiler and flow cytometry. Result(s): Control animals developed a severe BPD-like lung disease, with a 44% decrease in alveolar number and surface area, and a 2.3-fold increase in alveolar size. PC and IL-1Ra almost completely prevented this structural disintegration. At day 3, a distinct pulmonary immune response revealed pivotal roles for IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, MIP-1alpha and TREM-1 in murine BPD. PC and IL-1Ra reduced the levels of these and other proinflammatory mediators by 73% and 94%. At day 28, hyperoxia depleted the pulmonary immune cells by 67%; however, the remaining cells were hyperactivated. Unlike PC, which did not affect the loss of cells or cell activation, IL-1Ra partially rescued the immune cell population and reduced the percentage of activated cells by 63%. Conclusion(s): Because they shield newborn mice from BPD, PC and IL-1Ra emerge as promising treatments for a currently irremediable disease and may potentially brighten the prognosis of preterm patients.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a known risk factor. In the modern era, many neonates are surviving PH and RDS and receive frequent chest radiography (CXR), enabling close radiography- clinical correlation during PH and at long-term follow-up. Methods & Materials: Premature neonates with RDS and PH were included. Clinical notes were reviewed for gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), surfactant dose, PD duration, PDA, oxygen use at discharge, comorbidities, and mortality. CXRs were interpreted for laterality of new alveolar opacities before, during, and after the episode of PH, within 1 week of discharge, and at furthest follow-up. Result(s): Sixteen premature neonates born between 2005 and 2014 were included with mean GA 26.3 weeks and mean BW 838 g. 75% had antenatal steroid therapy. PH onset was 1.75 days of life and lasted 1.53 days. 88% had PDA and 56% developed ICH. All 3/16 (19%) who died from overwhelming PH had ICH and were born before 2010. At discharge, 50% required oxygen and 17% had tracheostomies. All were on room air at mean furthest follow-up of 18.4 months. One patient is still hospitalized. Immediately before PH, CXR showed findings of RDS in all 16 patients. At time of PH, CXR showed bilateral opacification in 44%, left lung opacities in 31%, right lung opacities in 13%, and no significant change in 13%. All three mortalities showed bilateral opacification at time of PH persisting until death. All survivors reverted to an RDS pattern after PH resolution, out of which 31% developed barotrauma (pulmonary interstitial emphysema or pneumothorax). Follow-up CXR showed fine diffuse hazy and reticular opacities suggesting CLD in 92% of patients, air-trapping in 43%, and normal CXR in 9%. No classic pattern of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was seen. Conclusion(s): PH is predominantly seen in extremely low birth weight premature neonates with a mortality of 19%. During PH, CXR shows bilateral opacification (44%) and left predominant unilateral opacification (31%), which generally resolves within 2 days. Interestingly, all mortalities had ICH and were born before 2010. Patients born after 2010 had no ICH, which may reflect changes in RDS management. All survivors were on room air with CXR showing CLD (92%) and air trapping (43%) at 18.4 months follow-up. None developed traditional patterns of cystic changes with architectural distortion as in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"894f6c55-3363-4ae4-be20-ed1d7b2ca550","_showDetails":false},"af89e1ff-73fd-4327-8c05-bcbf8a05d5df":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71867659","title":"Mice deficient in the SRC family tyrosine kinase yes are protected from hyperoxia-induced lung injury","authors":["Nelin L.","Jin Y.","Liu Y.","Chicoine L.","Chen B."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung injury","*mouse","lung","apoptosis","endothelium cell","pneumonia","dry weight","lung parenchyma","ambient air","hypothesis","mouse model","wild type","cell culture","adult respiratory distress syndrome","lung dysplasia","body weight","Western blotting","exposure","*protein kinase Yes","caspase 3","arginase","protein p21","cyclooxygenase 2","inducible nitric oxide synthase","amino acid transporter","protein","messenger RNA"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"29","number":"Meeting Abstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"0892-6638","address":"L.

Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in pulmonary endothelial cells and is a potent vasodilator. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of eNOS. Our group has recently published that ADMA levels are elevated in patients with BPD-associated PH. ADMA is degraded by the enzyme NG, NG- dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). We tested the hypothesis that there are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DDAH1 associated with PH in BPD. Neonates diagnosed with BPD were enrolled at Nationwide Children's Hospital. DNA was assayed for 34 SNPs in DDAH1. Calculated minor allele frequency (MAF) for cases and controls were compared using chi-square. Assuming recessive inheritance, logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio. Among 157 patients with BPD, 53 (34%) also had echocardiographic evidence of PH. Gestational age, birth weight, gender, and ethnicity were not different between groups. DDAH1 rs11161637 SNP had a significantly (p=0.04) lower MAF in cases than in controls (0.25 vs. 0.34). DDAH1 rs11161637 was associated with a decreased risk (OR=0.27) of PH in this BPD cohort, although this did not reach statistical significance (p-value=0.06). These results indicate that rs11161637 SNP of DDAH1 may be protective against the development of PH in patients with BPD.

The disease results in disrupted alveolar and pulmonary vascular growth, and may lead to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) during infancy. Although recent studies have shed light on the pathophysiology of BPD, much remains unknown about the long-lasting effects of the disease into adulthood. Previous studies on heart failure, PH and RVH have shown that there are alterations in Ca2+ signaling proteins in the right heart myocardium. The objective of this study is to identify whether there are alterations in Ca2+ signaling protein expression in right ventricular (RV) myocytes in rats with BPD. We hypothesize that there is decreased expression of Ryanodine Receptor (RyR2), SERCA2A and L-type Calcium Channel (LTCC), and an increased expression of protein kinase A (PKA), Na-Ca exchanger (NCX) and phospholamban (PLN). A previously established rat model of BPD was used, where BPD rats were exposed to 85% O2 for 14 days and controls were exposed to 21% O2 for 14 days. 78 rat hearts in total were harvested during the study at p0, p7, p14, p21, p28, p56, p90, p180.

Patients with mosaic forms displayed significant variability of phenotype's expression, longer survival and need for medical management. In Belarus 98 % of pregnant women undergoing to conventional screening 1-2-st trimesters. T18 was detected in 159 fetuses during 2009-2014, 95 % pregnancies were terminated. Eight children with T18 were born because the pregnant refused from invasive procedure or decided to continue the pregnancy with affected fetus. We presented the 1,5 years old boy with mosaic T18: phenotype, cytogenetics, genetic counseling, management. Case report. 41 years old pregnant, counseled due to age-related genetic risk, refused from invasive diagnostics. Results of combined screening (US and biochemical markers) were normal (risk < 1:360). Pregnancy complicated by intrauterine growth retardation; labor was at 33 weeks by cesarean section. Newborn male underwent for genetic examinations due to prenatal hypoplasia (weight 915 g, length 37 cm, OFC 26 cm), dysmorphisms, neurological disturbances, HD (perimembranouse ventricular septal defect, trikuspid valve's insufficiency, foramen ovale, pulmonary vein dilatation, pulmonary hypertension). Renal, brain abnormalities were not found by US, MRI studies. The infant suffered from bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, feeding difficulties, anemia. Severe growth, motor, mental retardation was detected by follow-up. Karyotype: 47,XY, + 18[9]/46,XY[10]. Patient's management: symptomatic treatment; cardiac surgery at 10 months old, regular cardiovascular evaluations; nutrition; growth, mental development follow-up. Conclusion. Prenatal screening plays the main role for prevention outcome with chromosomal disorders. But, children with mosaic 18T may present a longer lifespan and need for complex medical care. So, information collection concerning phenotype of survival patients may be important for management strategies improving at each life stage.","group":"g1","id":"93312727-008f-4d33-a7a1-685ac316d11e","_showDetails":false},"aac88bbb-a099-4a53-a71a-162a930587c1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71820567","title":"Cytokine airway responses to acute rhinovirus infection and respiratory morbidity in severe premature children","authors":["Perez G.F.","Nino G.","Pancham K.","Huseni S.","Jain A.","Rodriguez-Martinez C.","Preciado D.","Rose M."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*human","*airway","*morbidity","*prematurity","*child","*Rhinovirus infection","*American","*medical research","infection","secretion (process)","asthma","electronic medical record","immunoassay","pathogenesis","Rhinovirus","pregnancy","intensive care unit","hospitalization","virus","lung dysplasia","infant","cytokine response","risk factor","medical record review","*cytokine","interleukin 4","protein","thymic stromal lymphopoietin"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"63","number":"3","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"G.F.

Prematurity is a risk factor for severe RVinfection in early life, but is unknown if RV elicits pro-asthmatic airway cytokine responses in premature infants. This study investigated if young children born severely premature (<32 weeks gestation) exhibit airway secretion of Th2/Th17 cytokines during natural RV infections and if RV-induced Th2/Th17 responses are linked to more respiratory morbidity in premature children during the first two years of life. Methods Used: We measured Th2/Th17 nasal airway cytokines in a retrospective cohort of young children aged 0-2 years with PCR-confirmed RV infection or non-detectable virus. Protein levels of IL-4, IL- 13, TSLP and IL-17 were determined with multiplex magnetic bead immunoassays. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained by electronic medical record (EMR) review. Summary of Results: The study comprised 214 children born full term (n=108), pre-term (n=44) or severely premature (n=62). Natural RV infection in severely premature children was associated with elevated airway secretion of Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines, particularly in subjects with history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Severely premature children with high RV-induced airway IL-4 had recurrent respiratory hospitalizations (median 3.65 hosp/year; IQR 2.8-4.8) and were more likely to have at least one pediatric intensive care unit admission during the first two years of life (OR 8.72; 95% CI 1.3-58.7; p=0.02).

While there is an increasing use of allogeneic BMT in infants and young children with metabolic and immune deficiency disorders, lung function has not been systematically studied in this age group.We describe use of forced deflation PFT (dPFT), a novel technique for assessment of lung function in a series of infants and young children and those unable to perform cooperative testing. Forced dPFT studies were coordinated with other procedures requiring general anesthesia and performed according to previously published techniques1. Briefly, a specially constructed forced deflation device was inserted between the endotracheal tube and anesthesia breathing circuit via a 3- way slide valve (Figure). The lungs were inflated three times to 40 cm H2O (total lung capacity) and then rapidly deflated to -40 cmH2O via a pneumotachograph (to residual volume). Raw flow or volume measurements were normalized and converted to %predicted and standard deviation scores using data obtained in healthy children. Between October 2008 and April 2014, 52 dPFT studies were performed in 26 transplant recipients. Indications for BMT were inherited metabolic disease (42%), malignancy (31%), primary immune deficiency (15%) and bone marrow failure (12%). Median age of 21 patients who had pretransplant studies was 0.9+/-1.3 y (0.1 - 4.9 y); nine of them (43%) had one or more prior lung diseases (respiratory failure [n=7]; pneumonia [n=7]; ARDS [n=3]; bronchopulmonary dysplasia [n=1]; and bronchitis [n=1]). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory flow (FEF75) were normal in all but respiratory system compliance (Crs) was reduced in 5/21 cases. Six out of nine (66.7%) patients with clinical resp. issues pre-BMT also had respiratory complications post-BMT compared with 3/12 (25%) that had no pre-transplant respiratory issues. There were no significant differences in pretransplant FVC, FEF75 and Crs between those patients who did and who did not have post-transplant pulmonary complications with median follow-up of 1.7+/-1.5 y (p=0.435, p=0.305, and p=0.301 respectively). There were no complications during the procedures and dPFT studies could be safely done in coordination with other procedures requiring anesthesia. In this pilot study, pre-transplant PFTs were not predictive of post-transplant pulmonary complications, and most patients had normal volume and flows. A larger study would be required to determine prevalence and significance of lung function abnormalities in infants and toddlers undergoing transplantation.

The contribution of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to preterm RDS differs between ethnicities and remains unclear in Chinese infants. This study evaluated whether common SNPs and consequent haplotypes increase susceptibility to RDS in a population of preterm infants from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China., METHODS: Using a tagging SNP (tSNP) strategy and real-time polymerase chain reaction, we genotyped four tSNPs (i.e., rs150929, rs4787273, rs11867129, and rs17135889) and one coding SNP (p.F353F) of the ABCA3 gene in preterm infants with RDS (n = 83) and without RDS (n = 83). We predicted the haplotypes. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) and haplotype distributions were compared between the two groups. We analyzed correlations between the clinical data and the genotypes., RESULTS: Seven haplotypes existed at a frequency of 0.01 or greater. The haplotype TGGAG was significantly more frequent in RDS infants than in non-RDS infants (p = 0.026; odds ratio 3.41; 95% confidence interval 1.088-10.685). The MAF of rs17135889 SNP, a crucial SNP of the haplotype TGGAG located in the transcription factor binding site of ABCA3, was significantly higher in RDS infants (p < 0.05); however, the Bonferroni correction test showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). No significant correlation existed between the rs17135889 genotypes (AG/GG) and any clinical characteristic (e.g., oxygen supplementation duration and hospitalization, requirement for ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia complications, and mortality rate)., CONCLUSION: The TGGAG haplotype may be a risk factor for RDS in preterm infants in this Chinese population. Further study is needed with a larger sample size to verify the association between the rs17135889 SNP and increased risk of RDS in preterm infants, and to determine whether rs17135889 can be a reference in further population-based studies of ABCA3.

MV is necessary to keep many preterm babies with RF alive. Therefore, MV is life-saving. But MV has collateral consequences. An important collateral consequence is neurodevelopmental impairment that often is life-long. The mechanisms by which impairment occurs are not known. We recently showed that MV of preterm lambs is associated with shifts in apoptosis and proliferation in the brain. Another possible mechanism may be disrupted formation of capillaries in the brain. We hypothesized that MV disrupts abundance of vascular growth factor proteins in the brain of preterm lambs. Methods Used: Preterm (PT) lambs, treated with antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant and caffeine citrate, were managed by invasive MV or non-invasive HFNV for 3d or 21d. Other PT lambs were managed by MV for 3d and recovered from ventilation support (former preterm lambs). Former preterm term lambs lived to 11 wk or 20 wk corrected postnatal age (equivalent to ~2 yr and ~6 yr, respectively, corrected postnatal age in humans). Reference groups were gestation and postnatal age-matched lambs that were not ventilated. Brain white and gray matter in the temporal lobe was isolated and analyzed by immunoblot. Summary of Results: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein abundance was significantly lower in gray matter of preterm lambs managed for 3d by MV, and in white matter at 21d of MVas well as at 11 wk in former preterm lambs, compared to HFNV. VEGF receptor 2 also was consistently significantly lower in gray matter in all of the preterm and former preterm groups compared to preterm HFNV and term postnatal age-matched lambs. Conclusion(s): We conclude that invasive MV decreases VEGF and VEGFR2 in the brain, especially in gray matter, compared to non-invasive HFNV. We speculate that reduced abundance of vascular growth factors in the brain during invasive MV may disrupt subsequent, appropriate development of the immature brain of preterm neonates.","group":"g1","id":"d7b355df-a254-4cef-833e-751da9db109a","_showDetails":true},"2b1c605e-a891-4bae-823b-3e422a730d89":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71770266","title":"Transfusion of washed packed red blood cells and necrotizing enterocolitis in extremely preterm infants","authors":["Joshi A.","Ramanathan R.","Cayabyab R."],"date":"2015//","keywords":["*erythrocyte","*necrotizing enterocolitis","*prematurity","*infant","*human","*American","*medical research","*transfusion","newborn morbidity","donor","gestational age","birth weight","inflammation","pathogenesis","newborn","lung dysplasia","brain hemorrhage","death","data base","injury","intestine","clinical study","hospital","intensive care unit","newborn intensive care","cohort analysis","adverse outcome","retrolental fibroplasia","plasma","air conditioning","mortality","length of stay","patient","noninvasive ventilation","adverse drug reaction","risk","antibody","potassium","plasma protein","oxygen"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"63","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"A.

Transfusion-related acute gut injury in the form of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been reported in premature neonates within 48 hours after a pRBC transfusion. The pathogenesis may be secondary to an inflammatory reaction to donor antibodies. The objective of this study is to examine the differences in neonatal morbidities of extremely preterm infants who received washed pRBCs compared to unwashed pRBCs. Methods Used: This is a retrospective, cohort study examining infants less than 28 weeks gestational age admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Good Samaritan Hospital who received pRBC transfusion with washed pRBCs during January 2005 to September 2009 and unwashed pRBCs during December 2009 to March 2014. Neonatal demographics and clinical data were extracted from the neonatal database and paper charts. Neonatal morbidities evaluated were NEC, death, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Summary of Results: One hundred sixteen infants were studied. There were no significant differences in birth weight and gestational age between the two groups. In addition, no patient developed NEC and there was no significant difference in the rate of severe IVH, ROP, length of stay and mortality. However, there was a trend towards lower incidence of BPD, significantly shorter duration of invasive ventilation, and lower use of home oxygen in the unwashed group compared to the washed group. Conclusion(s): Use of unwashed pRBCs was not associated with NEC or any other adverse outcomes. The trend towards a lower incidence of BPD in preterm infants exposed to unwashed pRBC may be secondary to use of more non-invasive ventilation during the latter period.

To evaluate alveolar development, inflation fixed lungs were analyzed for radial alveolar counts (RAC), and mean linear intercept (MLI). To identify total and muscularized small vessels (<30 microns), lung sections were immunostained with Factor VIII or alpha-SMA. Total or % muscularized vessels were expressed per high-powered field under 20x magnification. Lung protein from 3 week old mice was analyzed by Western blot for Tph1, 5-HT2A and 5- HT2B R and the serotonin transporter (SERT). Datawere analyzed by unpaired t-test or 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis using Prism. Significance defined as p<0.05. Summary of Results: Treatment of neonatal mice with bleomycin disrupted alveolar development, shown by a decrease in RAC (17+/-0.6 - 11.72+/-0.63, p <0.0001) and increased MLI (45.36+/-1.86 - 58+/-2.8, pG 0.0013). Bleomycin also decreased vessel density (7.3+/-0.35 - 4.6 +/-0.62, P<0.0056) and increased the ratio of muscularized vessels/total number of vessels (0.19+/-0.03 - 0.62+/-0.03, P<0.0001).

We showed that omeprazole (OM) protects adultmice against hyperoxic lung injury via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent mechanisms. Whether OM protects newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced developmental lung injury is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that omeprazole-treated newborn mice will have decreased inflammation and alveolar simplification upon exposure to hyperoxia. Methods Used: Within 12 h of birth, wild type C57BL/6J (WT) pups were immediately exposed to either air (normoxia) or 85 % O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 d. WT newborn pups while exposed to either air or hyperoxia, were administered 10 or 25 mg/kg of OM or an equivalent volume of the vehicle, polyethylene glycol (PEG), i.p. once daily from birth for 14 d. The dosing regimen was based on our finding that at least 25 mg/kg/d of i.p. OM is required to activate the AhR. Additionally, we used OM at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d to determine its AhR independent effects. Following exposure, the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the mice were harvested to determine inflammation, angiogenesis, and alveolarization. Lung inflammation was determined by immunohistochemistry (neutrophils and macrophages) and BALF protein concentration, alveolarization was determined by lung morphometry (radial alveolar counts), and angiogenesis was determined by vonWillibrand factor immunostaing. Summary of Results: OM treatment (10 to 25 mg/kg) increased oxygen toxicity in a dose-depenedent manner. OM-treated mice were significantly growth restricted upon exposure to hyperoxia. Furthermore, OM increased hyperoxia-induced lung macrophage influx. Interestingly, mice treated with high-dose OM had persistent acute lung inflammation as evident by the presence of hyaline membranes, neutrophil infiltrates, and proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space. Additionally, high-dose OM increased alveolar simplification (radial alveolar counts) and BALF protein concentration. However, OM at either dose did not decrease lung angiogenesis. Conclusion(s): Contrary to our hypothesis, OM potentiates alveolar simplification and inflammation in a model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn mouse. These findings suggest the need to be cautious before instituting OM therapy in neonates.","group":"g3","id":"3b5571a2-d363-4295-a3f7-90d2a7bb9248","_showDetails":true},"518559d0-e2f7-460f-a820-06b061f7f510":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"613748470","title":"B-type natriuretic peptide levels in preterm neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: A marker of severity?","authors":["Kalra V.K.","Aggarwal S.","Arora P.","Natarajan G."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["case control study","*chronic lung disease","controlled study","*disease course","*gene expression","human","human tissue","infant","*lung dysplasia","major clinical study","molecularly targeted therapy","plasma","*prematurity","receiver operating characteristic","stratification","*brain natriuretic peptide","endogenous compound"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"49","number":"11","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.

The role of BNP as a biomarker of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been clarified. Objective(s): To determine if plasma BNP concentrations correlate with the severity of BPD. Method(s): This prospective observational case control study included 60 preterm infants (<=32 weeks); 27 infants had no/mild BPD, 19 had moderate and 14 had severe BPD. BNP levels were measured at 36 +/- 2 weeks PMA or within a week of discharge home. Groups were compared using Mann-Whitney's U-test, Kruskal-Wallis, and bivariate regression. Result(s): Median (IQR) plasma levels of BNP in infants with moderate/severe BPD infants (n = 33) were higher as compared to those with no/mild BPD (n = 27); 27.1 (12.1-43.5) pg/ml versus 9.3 (6-18.5) pg/ml; P < 0.05 (Mann Whitney U). Median (IQR) BNP levels in infants with severe BPD (n = 14), 43.5 (28.4-189) pg/ml differed significantly from levels in those with moderate (n = 19), 22.8 (10.3-27.7) pg/ml; mild (n = 16), 11.5 (6.6-44.5 pg/ml); or no (n = 11), 8.1 (5-12.6 pg/ml) BPD (P < 0.001 Kruskal-Wallis). Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, BNP > 24.4 pg/ml at 36 +/- 2 weeks PMA or discharge home was 85.7% sensitive and 76.1% specific for severe BPD. Conclusion(s): An elevation in plasma BNP was significantly associated with severe BPD. We speculate that plasma BNP measurement in infants with BPD may aid in risk-stratification and further targeted therapies.

Erythropoietin (EPO) has been suggested as a therapy for BPD. The aim of this study was to determine whether prophylactic administration of EPO reduces VILI in preterm newborn lambs. Lambs at 126 days of gestation (term is 147 days) were delivered and ventilated with a high tidal volume strategy for 15 min to cause lung injury, then received gentle ventilation until 2 h of age. Lambs were randomized to receive intravenous EPO (5000 IU kg-1: Vent+EPO; n = 6) or phosphate-buffered saline (Vent; n = 7) soon after birth: unventilated controls (UVC; n = 8) did not receive ventilation or any treatment. Physiological parameters were recorded throughout the experimental procedure. Samples of lung were collected for histological and molecular assessment of inflammation and injury. Samples of liver were collected to assess the systemic acute phase response. Vent+EPO lambs received higher F IO 2, P aO 2 and oxygenation during the first 10 min than Vent lambs. There were no differences in physiological indices beyond this time. Total lung injury score, airway wall thickness, inflammation and haemorrhage were higher in Vent+EPO lambs than in Vent lambs. Lung inflammation and early markers of lung and systemic injury were elevated in ventilated lambs relative to unventilated lambs; EPO administration further increased lung inflammation and markers of lung and systemic injury. Prophylactic EPO exacerbates VILI, which may increase the incidence and severity of long-term respiratory disease.

Inflammation and oxidative injury play an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD. Resveratrol is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In this study, the histopathological and biochemical effects of resveratrol on a hyperoxia-induced lung injury model in newborn rats were investigated., Methods: The experiment was performed on newborn rat pups from the 3rd to 13th postnatal day and they were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1 (air-exposed + saline, n Z 10), Group 2 (air-exposed + resveratrol, n Z 11), Group 3 (hyperoxia-exposed + saline, n Z 6) and Group 4 (hyperoxia-exposed + resveratrol, n Z 7). Resveratrol was administered (30 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally. The histopathological effects of resveratrol on lung tissue were assessed by alveolar surface area, fibrosis, and smooth muscle actin (SMA) score, and the biochemical effects on lung tissue were assessed by glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) levels., Results: The alveolar surface area, fibrosis, SMA score, and NO levels were found to be significantly higher in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (p < 0.05). In addition, it was found that resveratrol treatment significantly reduced the SMA score and the NO and TNF-alpha levels, and increased the GSH and SOD levels in the hyperoxia group (p < 0.05)., Conclusion: This experimental study showed that oxidative stress and NO contributed to the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, and that resveratrol had a preventive effect on hyperoxic lung injury through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2014, Taiwan Pediatric Association.

Similar to human infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Rho-kinase (ROCK) is known to mediate lung injury in adult animals via stimulatory effects on inflammation. We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of ROCK may ameliorate bleomycin-induced lung injury in the neonatal rat. Pups received daily intraperitoneal bleomycin or saline from Postnatal Days 1 through 14 with or without Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor. Treatment with Y-27632 prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary hypertension, as evidenced by normalized pulmonary vascular resistance, decreased right-ventricular hypertrophy, and attenuated remodeling of pulmonary resistance arteries. Bleomycininduced changes in distal lung architecture, including septal thinning, inhibited alveolarization, and decreased numbers of peripheral arteries and capillaries, were partially or completely normalized by Y-27632. Treatment with Y-27632 or a CXCR2 antagonist, SB265610, also abrogated tissue neutrophil influx, while having no effect on macrophages. However, treatment with SB265610 did not prevent bleomycin-induced lung injury. Lung content of angiostatic thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) was increased significantly in the lungs of bleomycin-exposed animals, and was completely attenuated by treatment with Y-27632. Thrombinstimulated TSP1 production by primary cultured rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells was also attenuated by Y-27632. Taken together, our findings suggest a preventive effect of Y-27632 on bleomycin-mediated injury by a mechanism unrelated to inflammatory cells. Our data suggest that improvements in lung morphology may have been related to indirect stimulatory effects on angiogenesis via down-regulation of TSP1.

Hp proteins associated with the three major phenotypes differ in their proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory action. Inflammation and oxidative stress are both involved in most pathophysiological processes in premature infants. The objective of this study was to determine whether Hp phenotype influences clinical manifestations and sepsis incidence in the premature infants., OBJECTIVE: Infants born before 35 weeks gestational age were prospectively evaluated for Hp phenotype and clinical events, including sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity. The participants were observed until discharge., METHODS: A total of 122 preterm infants were enrolled in the study. Clinical events were not affected by the Hp phenotype. The expression of Hp protein was extremely low in the study population. More septic episodes were found in infants with a birth weight greater than 1,500 g, although, the difference was not statistically significant., RESULTS: Extremely low expression of Hp may explain the lack of a correlation between Hp phenotype and sepsis in preterm infants. Further research involving a larger neonatal population is required to better understand the role of the Hp phenotype in morbidity of premature infants.

We sought to assess the relationship between BNP levels and all-cause mortality in a cohort of ELBW infants with BPD and PH. Method(s):We retrospectively identified ELBW infants with BPD and PH who had serum BNP levels measured as part of routine clinical care in the neonatal intensive care unit. Peak serum BNP levels were correlated with survival to discharge or death. Result(s):Thirty-six ELBW infants (mean gestational age 26.0 +/- 1.9 weeks and mean birth weight 740 +/- 290 grams) with BPD and PH had available survival data and had serum BNP levels measured. Peak BNP level was significantly lower among infants who survived than among those who died (128 pg/ml, [IQR 23 to 463] vs. 997 pg/ml, [IQR 278 to 1770], P < 0.004). On multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, BNP predicted survival independent of age, gender, and BPD severity. Area under receiver operator characteristic analysis identified a BNP value of 220 pg/ml to have 90% sensitivity and 65% specificity in predicting mortality. Conclusion(s):BNP estimation may be useful as a prognostic marker of all-cause mortality in ELBW infants with BPD associated PH. © 2014 Cuna et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","group":"g1","id":"5aa87e4a-f130-47a8-ac7e-7e55ac50f5e4","_showDetails":true},"80d0ee31-0aab-4a32-afa0-08cf1be4bacd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"53005638","title":"Anti-inflammatory actions of endogenous and exogenous interleukin-10 versus glucocorticoids on macrophage functions of the newly born","authors":["Kasat K.","Patel H.","Predtechenska O.","Vancurova I.","Davidson D."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*antiinflammatory activity","article","cell differentiation","controlled study","cytokine release","*cytokine response","human","human cell","in vitro study","lung dysplasia","*macrophage function","monocyte","*newborn","phagocytosis","protein synthesis inhibition","respiratory burst","umbilical cord blood","*betamethasone/cm [Drug Comparison]","*betamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","*dexamethasone/cm [Drug Comparison]","*dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","*interleukin 10/cm [Drug Comparison]","*interleukin 10/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*interleukin 10/pd [Pharmacology]","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound]","monoclonal antibody/ec [Endogenous Compound]","tumor necrosis factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatology","language":"English","volume":"34","number":"5","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group (Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 6XS, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1476-5543","address":"D.

A serial dose-response (around 10-8 M), in vitro study was used to examine the effect of DEX, BETA and IL-10, on proinflammatory (PI) cytokine release, phagocytosis and respiratory burst. Result(s):Exogenous IL-10 (10-8 M) significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the endotoxin-stimulated release of IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor by 63 to 82% with no significant effect by DEX and BETA. There was no inhibition by these three agents at 10-8 M on phagocytosis and respiratory burst. Inhibition of endogenous IL-10 with a monoclonal antibody significantly increased endotoxin-stimulated cytokine release by at least fourfold.

A total of 145 premature newborn, with birthweight <1500 g and/or <32 weeks gestational age, were enrolled. 26.9% of them showed some form of retinopathy. A significant association was found between the development of retinopathy and each of the following variables: early gestational age, low birthweight, requiring mechanical ventilation, oxygen treatment, intracranial haemorrhage, sepsis during the first three weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the need for erythrocyte transfusion, erythropoietin treatment, and low levels of serum IGF1 in the third week. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to obtain curves for the probability of developing ROP, based on the main factors linked with ROP, namely serum levels of IGF1 and presence of sepsis. Such preclinical screening has the ability to identify patients with high-risk of developing retinopathy and should lead to better prediction for ROP, while at the same time optimising the use of clinical resources, both human and material. © 2014 Perez-Munuzuri et al.","group":"g1","id":"68f4d3b1-de3f-4bc1-b8d5-4965a3e0e50b","_showDetails":true},"8c9d04fe-a817-4f16-8601-7c2951e51f9a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"53238582","title":"Anti-inflammatory effect of caffeine is associated with improved lung function after lipopolysaccharide-induced amnionitis","authors":["Korotlu O.A.","MacFarlane P.M.","Balan K.V.","Zenebe W.J.","Martin A.J.R.J.","Prabha Kc."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*amnionitis","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","*antiinflammatory activity","article","cell count","controlled study","drug blood level","lung alveolus cell","lung compliance","lung dysplasia","*lung function","lung homogenate","lung parenchyma","lung resistance","lung volume","newborn","nonhuman","postnatal care","prenatal exposure","protein expression","rat","survival rate","tidal volume","*antiinflammatory agent/cr [Drug Concentration]","*antiinflammatory agent/po [Oral Drug Administration]","*antiinflammatory agent/pd [Pharmacology]","*caffeine/cr [Drug Concentration]","*caffeine/po [Oral Drug Administration]","*caffeine/pd [Pharmacology]","CD68 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 1beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","lipopolysaccharide/to [Drug Toxicity]","sodium chloride","tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Neonatology","language":"English","volume":"106","number":"3","publisher":"S.

Expression of IL-1beta was assessed in lung homogenates at p8 and p14, and respiratory system resistance (Rrs ) and compliance (Crs ) as well as CD68 cell counts and radial alveolar counts were assessed at p8., Results: In LPS-exposed rats, IL-1beta and CD68 cell counts both increased at p8 compared to normal saline controls. These increases in pro-inflammatory markers were no longer present in caffeine-treated LPS-exposed pups. R rs was higher in LPS-exposed pups (4.7 +/- 0.9 cm H2O/ml . s) at p8 versus controls (1.6 +/- 0.3 cm H2O/ml . s, p < 0.01). LPS-exposed pups no longer exhibited a significant increase in Rrs (2.8 +/- 0.5 cm H2O/ml . s) after caffeine. Crs did not differ significantly between groups, although radial alveolar counts were lower in both groups of LPS-exposed pups., Conclusions: Caffeine promotes anti-inflammatory effects in the immature lung of prenatal LPS-exposed rat pups associated with improvement of Rrs , suggesting a protective effect of caffeine on respiratory function via an anti-inflammatory mechanism.Copyright © 2014 S.

At gestational age 28 weeks and 3 days the pregnancy was urgently terminated via caesarean section and an extremely hypotrophic immature newborn with a birth weight of 580 g was born. The high disease activity in the mother at the time of conception and the histologically proven chronic placental insufficiency due to APS are presumably the causes for the extensive hypotrophy of the neonate. The significant comorbidity of the newborn, including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, osteopathy of prematurity, transient hypothyroidism and hypocortisolism, vesicoureteral reflux, and hypertonic-hyperexcitation syndrome complicated his three-month stay in NICU. A positive titre of transplacentally transferred anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein antibody was detected in the child and persisted through the following 30 months. During the three-year follow-up, significantly delayed neuropsychological development with microcephaly (-4 SD) and short stature of the child was observed. Finally, the authors discuss possible causes of neuropsychological consequences in children of mothers with SLE and APS and emphasize the need for long-term monitoring and specialized care to improve development of these children. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","group":"g1","id":"14ec491f-02c3-4974-896b-7f1745bd5f61","_showDetails":true},"a1cc4949-b7af-41cc-9942-24aa2453d431":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"373796017","title":"Expression of TGF-beta1 and PAI-1 in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Zhang J.-F.","Hunag R.-Z.","Huang G.-F.","Ou W.-M.","Li J.-F.","Chen J.-J."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["article","birth","clinical study","controlled study","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","gestational age","human","infant","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","major clinical study","newborn intensive care","predictive value","*prematurity","protein expression","retrospective study","very low birth weight","*plasminogen activator inhibitor 1","*transforming growth factor beta1"],"journal":"Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics","language":"Chinese","volume":"16","number":"8","publisher":"Xiangya Hospital of CSU (141 Xiangya Road, Changsha Hunan 410008, China)","isbn":"1008-8830","urls":["http://www.cjcp.org/EN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=13432","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed15&NEWS=N&AN=373796017"],"doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2014.08.008","address":"China","abstract":"Objective: To study the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and its significance in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

We first investigated the role of AT2 inhibition with PD123319 (0.5 and 2 mg.kg-1.day-1) on the beneficial effect of AT2 agonist LP2-3 (5 mug/kg twice a day) on RVH in newborn rats with hyperoxia-induced BPD. Next we determined the cardiopulmonary effects of PD123319 (0.1 mg.kg-1.day-1) in two models: early treatment during continuous exposure to hyperoxia for 10 days and late treatment starting on day 6 in rat pups exposed postnatally to hyperoxia for 9 days, followed by a 9-day recovery period in room air. Parameters investigated included lung and heart histopathology, fibrin deposition, vascular leakage, and differential mRNA expression. Ten days of coadministration of LP2-3 and PD123319 abolished the beneficial effects of LP2-3 on RVH in experimental BPD. In the early treatment model PD123319 attenuated cardiopulmonary injury by reducing alveolar septal thickness, pulmonary influx of inflammatory cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, medial wall thickness of small arterioles, and extravascular collagen III deposition, and by preventing RVH. In the late treatment model PD123319 diminished PAH and RVH, demonstrating that PAH is reversible in the neonatal period. At high concentrations PD123319 blocks the beneficial effects of the AT2-agonist LP2-3 on RVH. At low concentrations PD123319 attenuates cardiopulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis and preventing PAH-induced RVH but does not affect alveolar and vascular development in newborn rats with experimental BPD. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.","group":"g3","id":"cf507bdb-5fa5-41a6-a36b-27932bb1a31e","_showDetails":false},"3c3aabb2-2290-4714-847e-b8460df637bd":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"Neonatal Biomarkers of Inflammation: Correlates of Early Neurodevelopment and Gait in Very-Low-Birth-Weight Preterm Children.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1557106","authors":["Rose, Jessica","Vassar, Rachel","Cahill-Rowley, Katelyn","Hintz, Susan R","Stevenson, David K"],"date":"2016//","accessDate":"20150724//","keywords":["*Biomarkers/bl [Blood]","Birth Weight","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","C-Reactive Protein/an [Analysis]","Child Development","Cognition","Enterocolitis, Necrotizing/ep [Epidemiology]","Female","*Gait","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/gd [Growth & Development]","*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight/gd [Growth & Development]","Inflammation/bl [Blood]","*Inflammation/di [Diagnosis]","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal","Linear Models","Male","Motor Activity","Multivariate Analysis","Psychiatric Status Rating Scales","Risk Factors","Sepsis/ep [Epidemiology]","Speech"],"journal":"American journal of perinatology","volume":"33","number":"1","isbn":"0735-1631","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=26212060"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Neonatal biomarkers of inflammation were examined in relation to early neurodevelopment and gait in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm children.

Although it is unclear how neonatal oxygen affects development of the respiratory epithelium, alveolar simplification and depletion of type II cells has been observed in adult mice exposed to hyperoxia between postnatal Days 0 and 4. Because hyperoxia inhibits cell proliferation, we hypothesized that it depleted the adult lung of type II cells by inhibiting their proliferation at birth. Newborn mice were exposed to room air (RA) or hyperoxia, and the oxygen-exposed mice were recovered in RA. Hyperoxia stimulated mRNA expressed by type II (Sftpc, Abca3) and type I (T1alpha, Aquaporin 5) cells and inhibited Pecam expressed by endothelial cells. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling and fate mapping with enhanced green fluorescence protein controlled statically by the Sftpc promoter or conditionally by the Scgb1a1 promoter revealed increased Sftpc and Abca3 mRNAseen on Day 4 reflected an increase in expansion of type II cells shortly after birth. When mice were returned to RA, this expanded population of type II cells was slowly depleted until few were detected by 8 weeks. These findings reveal that hyperoxia stimulates alveolar epithelial cell expansion when it disrupts angiogenesis. The loss of type II cells during recovery in RA may contribute to persistent pulmonary diseases such as those reported in children born preterm who were exposed to supplemental oxygen.

The contents of IL-6, IL-6R, Sgp130, and MMP-9 were determined. Infants' clinical data, as well as their mothers' placental pathological data were also collected.

Failure to vasodilate causes persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia-related hypoxia, often with dire consequences. The mechanism of pulmonary vasodilatation at birth is poorly understood. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) isolated from 4th and 5th order resistance vessels of ovine near-term fetus exhibited resting membrane potentials 8 mV more depolarized than adult (P<0.05). Although whole-cell Kv current densities for voltage-clamped fetal and adult PASMCs were similar, large-conductance, calcium-activated K+ (BK) current densities for fetal cells were significantly lower than adult at moderate potentials (i.e. +20 to +60 mV), but equaled those of adult at higher potentials. Fetal PASMCs expressed twice the pore-forming BKalpha subunit protein as adult, but only half as much accessary BKbeta-1 subunit on Western immunoblots. Cell surface beta-l expression was also significantly lower in fetal PASMCs by flow cytometry. Since optimal BK channel activity occurs at 1:1 beta-to-alpha stoichiometry, our results suggested the near-term fetus expressed BK beta:alpha ratios about 1/4 that of adult. In contrast to measured current densities and protein levels, both BKalpha and BKbeta-1 RNA transcripts were two-fold higher in near-term fetus than adult by qRT-PCR. These findings suggest that near-term fetal PASMCs are more depolarized and exhibit lower BK activity due to lower BKbeta-1 subunit expression, but may be poised to express higher levels of BKbeta-1 to enhance BK activity and promote pulmonary vasodilatation at birth.","group":"g1","id":"b83f3bd3-a893-48c8-844d-d2ae80a0b790","_showDetails":true},"f062c516-ad55-41f8-866a-34c48f31a611":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72047750","title":"Bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPRII) expression is decreased in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECS) exposed to hyperoxia","authors":["Arawiran J.","Olson S.","Calo J.M.","Parton L."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*human","*hyperoxia","*endothelium cell","*American","*society","pulmonary hypertension","incubator","exposure","lung development","lung dysplasia","apoptosis","gas","cells by body anatomy","signal transduction","statistical significance","cell culture","culture medium","primary culture","nutrition","ambient air","morbidity","Western blotting","assay","protein expression","patient","*bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2","receptor","bone morphogenetic protein","antibody","cytokine","trypsin","transforming growth factor beta","trypan blue"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"J.

Dysregulated BMP signal transduction may influence pathological processes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD remains to be a common morbidity in the NICU despite advances in gentle ventilatory strategies, limitation of hyperoxia exposure, and nutrition. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal expression of BMP and its receptor, BMPRII, in human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPAEcs) exposed to hyperoxia. We also seek to determine if hyperoxia affects viablity of HPAECs. Method(s): HPAECs were cultured in endothelial cell culture medium and maintained in a sterile humidified cell culture incubator at 37C with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged at 70-80% confluence with trypsin. Primary cultures of passage 5 were used in the experiments. HPAECs were plated in 30mm well plates and exposed to hyperoxic gas with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for up to 72 hours and cell lysates were collected at 24, 48 and 72h. For control studies, HPAEC at passage 5 were placed at room air in an incubator and harvested at 0h, 24h, 48h and 72h. Antibodies to BMP4 and BMPRII were used in Western blot assays to determine protein expression. Cells were counted using the Neubauer hemocytometer stained with trypan blue. Results Results showed that BMPRII expression is decreased in HPAECs exposed to hyperoxia, however this did not reach statistical significance. Expression of BMP4 did not change with hyperoxia exposure. Cells exposed to hyperoxia showed a decrease in number as the duration of hyperoxia increased compared to the control wherein the cells proliferated. Discussion(s): BMPs are significant for lung development. With this preliminary results, we have shown that hyperoxia may disrupt lung development by downregulation of the receptor BMPRII. In idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, this is also the defective receptor. Probably with the downregulation of the receptor, the BMP signaling pathway is interrupted resulting in hypoalveolarization and pulmonary hypertension. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia may decrease the BMPRII expression in HPAECs. Though these are very preliminary data, this is a possible explanation for pulmonary hypertension seen in patients with BPD.

Due to the complexity of risk factors and limited availability of clinical samples, an understanding of this disease, its potential biomarkers and causal mechanisms are limited. The application of discovery approaches to samples derived from minimally-invasive procedures may provide biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic management of BPD. Method(s): We analyzed a dataset (GSE32472) describing gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), obtained near the time of birth (5+/-2 days of life) or near the time of diagnosis (25+/-3 days of life), from premature infants at risk for BPD. The dataset consists of 298 Affymetrix HuGene ST 1.0 arrays from 111 subjects. Raw data files were normalized by PLIER or RMA. Multiple statistical tests were used to identify gene expression changes that discriminate between BPD cases and controls. Expression validation was performed using RNA from BPD or control lung tissue. LASSO-penalized logistic regression was applied to form a classifier of BPD using 9-fold cross-validation. Result(s): Near birth, 15 genes were consistently identified as differentially expressed in PBMC from subjects with BPD. Near diagnosis, 19 genes were identified as differentially expressed in PBMC from subjects with BPD. Three genes were consistently different at both time-points: Arginase-1 (ARG1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), and Olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4). Members of the CEACAM family, whose expression has been previously associated with BPD in lung tissue, were also identified as differentially expressed in PBMC. We validated significant changes in expression for three genes; ARG1, CEACAM1 and CEACAM6. Pathway analysis of BPD-associated genes implicated melatonin and arginine metabolism, citruline biosynthesis and the urea cycle. Importantly, we developed a classifier model from PBMC gene expression near birth, consisting of 16 genes, which predicted a future diagnosis of BPD with 76% accuracy. Summary: These results contribute to our understanding of gene expression changes in the peripheral blood of infants with BPD, and may provide insight into disease mechanism. These data also suggest that gene expression from blood samples of newborn premature infants, collected just following birth, may provide potential to predict those infants who may develop BPD.","group":"g2","id":"1ea2fba8-5cc4-4192-9261-5a41f9a144f6","_showDetails":true},"cb579b1b-cead-4936-b58c-49a6682bcfb2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72047067","title":"Thioredoxin reductase inhibition attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits in newborn mice","authors":["Tipple T.E.","Hill C.L.","Pierce D.L.","Velten M.","Rogers L.K."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung","*mouse","*American","*society","lung development","body weight","hypothesis","human","gene","lung injury","prematurity","newborn","infant","protection","oxygen toxicity","fetus lung maturation","lung dysplasia","adult","toxicity","endothelium cell","in vitro study","injection","attenuation","model","safety","morbidity","ambient air","murine model","*thioredoxin reductase","sodium chloride","antioxidant","mitogenic agent","vasculotropin","nuclear factor","auranofin","aurothioglucose"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"T.E.

Aurothioglucose (ATG) and auranofin (AFN) potently inhibit thioredoxin (Trx) reductase (TrxR), while TrxR inhibition activates nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). We have previously shown that ATG safely and effectively prevents hyperoxic lung injury in adult mice, likely via Nrf2-dependent mechanisms. In newborn mice, Nrf2 regulates lung maturation and protection from O2 toxicity suggesting that TrxR inhibition might prevent BPD. The present studies tested the hypothesis that ATG would attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits in a newborn murine model of BPD. To test this hypothesis, newborn C3H/HeN mice were treated with a single i.p. dose of 25 mg/kg ATG or saline within 12 h of birth and were exposed in either room air (RA) or 85% hyperoxia (O2) for 14 d. Morphometric analyses revealed arrested lung development in hyperoxia-exposed mice. ATG treatment significantly attenuated O2 -induced increases in alveolar area and decreases in alveolar number. Lung development was not different between ATG-treated and saline-treated mice raised in RA. Body weights in saline-treated O2-exposed mice were significantly lower at 7 d and 14 d than in RA controls. ATG treatment significantly attenuated O2-induced decreases in body weight. To determine the impact of TrxR inhibition on Nrf2 activation in vitro, murine alveolar epithelial (MLE-12) cells were treated with 1 muM AFN for 1 h. AFN treatment decreased TrxR1 activities by 90% compared to saline-treated controls. qRT-PCR analyses of AFN-treated cells revealed that transcription of Nrf2-driven genes GCLM, HO-1, NQ01, and TrxR1 was significantly increased as was transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen that is significantly decreased in BPD. Our novel data indicate that a single ATG injection at birth attenuates O2-induced alterations in alveolar development in newborn mice. Furthermore, ATG treatment appears to be well tolerated as evidenced by normal lung growth in RA-exposed controls and attenuation of O2-induced decreases body weight in saline-treated mice. Induction of Nrf2 target genes by AFN treatment in MLE-12 cells supports a working model in which the protective effects of TrxR inhibition are Nrf2-dependent.

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia could result in developmental diseases embodied as hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Rationale: The role of autophagy in development is clearly important; however, its role in relation to HALI and BPD is currently unknown. So, we sought to investigate the role of autophagy in hyperoxia-induced alveolar cell death in developing lungs of mice models. Method(s): Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a negative regulator of autophagy. Raptor (RPTOR) is a major subunit, found in mTORC1 but not in mTORC2. So, using RPTOR+/- mice, RPTOR siRNA intranasal delivery and wild-type (WT) mice treated with Torin2 (mTOR inhibitor), we evaluated the apoptotic cell death markers and lung morphometry in HALI and BPD mice models. Result(s): We noted significantly increased protein expression of autophagy markers: Atg5, Beclin-1, P62, LC3-II in concomitant with increased protein expression of acetyl p53 (K382), phospho p53 (S392), phospho mTOR (S2448), phospho S6K1 (S424) and phospho S6 (S235/236) in a model of HALI (100% O2 exposed WT postnatal (PN) day 7 mice lungs). We demonstrated increased co-localization of LC3 with SP-C in Type II alveolar epithelial cells of hyperoxia-exposed WT PN7 mice lungs. We confirmed increased LC3 II in hyperoxia-exposed freshly isolated Type II alveolar cells from E19 - PN2 mice lungs using western blotting. Torin2 treatment showed decreased Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and increased Bcl2 expression, among apoptotic markers. This was accompanied by improved alveolar size as measured by chord length in hyperoxia-exposed WT PN7 mice lungs. Conversely, Chloroquine (an autophagy inhibitor) treatment showed increased Bax and cleaved caspase 3 expression and increased chord length in hyperoxia-exposed WT PN7 mice lungs. Exposure of hyperoxia to RPTOR+/- mice till PN7 resulted in increased LC3 II, but decreased cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP and chord length in lungs. Furthermore, temporal inhibition of mTORC1 using intranasal delivery of RPTOR siRNA demonstrated improved chord length in a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model. Conclusion(s): We have demonstrated a novel autophagy signaling pathway in developing lungs using a HALI mouse model. Taken together, our data suggest that decreasing mTORC1 increases hyperoxia-induced autophagy, limits lung injury by decreasing apoptotic cell death markers, reduces mortality in HALI and improves lung architecture in BPD mice models.","group":"g3","id":"e96615da-8f46-4fea-bf87-524f36349ffa","_showDetails":true},"278ffdaf-d736-47b4-9f59-57cb7abb722a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72046876","title":"The role of hydrogen sulfide in normal and aberrant late lung development","authors":["Madurga Hernandez A.","Mizikova I.","Ruiz Camp J.","Fehrenbach H.","Seeger W.","Morty R.E."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*lung development","*American","*society","hyperoxia","mouse","control group","therapy","in vitro study","lung dysplasia","human","newborn","prematurity","leukocyte count","wound healing","gas","donor","gene","model","lung structure","thickness","chronic lung disease","lung lavage","lung","transgenic mouse","biological activity","experimental model","stereology","*hydrogen sulfide","cystathionine","enzyme","sulfurtransferase","lyase","synthetase","gasotransmitter","interleukin 1","messenger RNA","nonoxinol 9","antioxidant","interleukin 6","adenosine triphosphate"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"A.

Little is known about the mechanisms of BPD, and no specific treatment for this disease exists. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), belongs to a class of endogenously synthesized gaseous molecules referred to as gasotransmitters. Recent evidence suggests that endogenous H2S exerts beneficial biological effects, including cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Three enzymes are known to synthetize H2S, cystathionine-beta synthase (Cbs), cystathionine-gamma lyase (Cth) and mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (Mpst). H2S may play a role in the development of the alveolar airspaces during normal late lung development, and if used as a therapy could be beneficial for BPD. To assess the potential therapeutic benefit of H2S, the slow-releasing gas donor GYY4137 (morpholin-4-ium-4-methoxyphenyl(morpholino) phosphinodithioate) was tested in the mouse BPD model at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally. Neonatal mouse pups were randomly exposed from birth to either: Normoxia (21% O22), normoxia + GYY4137, to hyperoxia (85% O22) and hyperoxia+ GYY4137. H2S preserved alveolar growth in hyperoxic mice as assessed by lung stereology. The treatment under hyperoxia conditions resulted in a decrease in mean linear intercept from 83.3 to 65.7 cm, a decrease in septal wall thickness from 0.11 to 0.08 mum and an increase in alveolar number, from 5.5 to 8.5x105/cm3 compared to the hyperoxia control group. The improvement in the pulmonary structure could be partially explained by the anti-inflammatory role of H2S. In hyperoxia conditions, the mRNA expression (DELTACt) of IL-1beta decreased from -0.03 to -0.4, for IL-6 from -0.8 to -1.4 and for TNF-alpha from -10.6 to -11.1 in the therapy group, compared to control group. Under hyperoxic conditions, the bronchoalveolar lavage leukocyte count decreased from 56,2 (untreated) to 25,5x105 (H2S-treated) cells/ml. H2S activated cytoprotective Akt in vitro, and the action prevailed in vivo under hyperoxia conditions. We could also demonstrate in vitro, that H2S promoted wound healing in primary alveolar type two cells through K+ATP channels. Two transgenic mice, where the genes encoding Cth and Cbs have been deleted respectively, were tested to study the course of normal late lung development. The Cbs knockout exhibited air space enlargement. H2S helped to prevent arrested alveolar development in the experimental model of BPD. H2S thus plays a role normal late lung development mostly through the generating H2S enzyme, Cbs.","group":"g1","id":"278ffdaf-d736-47b4-9f59-57cb7abb722a","_showDetails":true},"d567152b-326b-4b94-a010-4052cacb7773":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72044762","title":"Improved early nutrition increases lung function in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Filbrun A.G.","Vasileff A.S.","Huang S.","Wang W.","Varela V.","McIntosh N.","Peterson K.E.","Song P.X.","Hershenson M.B."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*lung function","*infant","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","*nutrition","lung function test","gestational age","weight","human","prematurity","newborn","statistical model","feeding","caloric intake","dietary intake","lung","risk","forced expiratory volume","bronchodilating agent","protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.B.

We hypothesized that improved early nutrition increases lung function in BPD. Method(s): Infants with a history of BPD were retrospectively studied. Cohort 1 included 18 infants who underwent two lung function tests from 2003-7. Cohort 2 included 29 infants who underwent one or two tests from 2009-11. Institutional increases in early nutritional intake were instituted beginning 2007. We examined whether adjusted subject-specific weight and length growth trajectories before the first lung function test correlated with lung function at the time of the first lung function test or changes in lung function between the two tests. Result(s): Protein and caloric intake during the first week of life were significantly increased in cohort 2 compared to cohort 1. When we compared the growth trajectories of infants born at <= 27 weeks gestational age, infants from cohort 2 had a significantly higher length growth trajectory than infants from cohort 1, demonstrating that the new feeding regimen successfully enhanced length growth in infants born at <= 27 weeks gestational age. There were no differences in lung function at the time of the first test, or change in lung function between the first and second tests, between cohort 1 and cohort 2. However, for infants <= 27 weeks gestational age at birth, changes in percent predicted post-bronchodilator FEV0.5, percent predicted FEF75 and standardized FEF75 were greater in cohort 2 than cohort 1. When we treated individual trajectory deviations as predictors for change in lung function using a linear model for longitudinal analysis, length trajectory before the first lung function test was positively associated with changes in percent predicted post-bronchodilator FEV 0.5, FEF25-75 and FEF75 between the first and second tests. When we considered cohort 1 separately, weight and length trajectories before the first lung test were positively associated with four measures of lung function change between the first and second tests. When we considered cohort 2 separately, weight and length trajectories were positively correlated with 15 measures of lung function change. Conclusion(s): Changes in early nutritional practice resulted in improved length growth trajectory and pulmonary function in neonates born <= 27 weeks gestational age. We conclude that early aggressive nutritional management promotes lung function in premature infants with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"d567152b-326b-4b94-a010-4052cacb7773","_showDetails":true},"13fa2363-c9e3-404e-9edd-a95bcf496427":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"CD11b(+) Mononuclear Cells Mitigate Hyperoxia-Induced Lung Injury in Neonatal Mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2014-0395OC","authors":["Eldredge, Laurie C","Treuting, Piper M","Manicone, Anne M","Ziegler, Steven F","Parks, William C","McGuire, John K"],"date":"2016//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","CD11b Antigen/ge [Genetics]","*CD11b Antigen/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor/ge [Genetics]","Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Inflammation Mediators/me [Metabolism]","Lung/im [Immunology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","Lung Injury/im [Immunology]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Injury/pc [Prevention & Control]","Macrophage Activation","Macrophages/im [Immunology]","*Macrophages/me [Metabolism]","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Phenotype","Pulmonary Edema/et [Etiology]","Pulmonary Edema/im [Immunology]","Pulmonary Edema/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Edema/pc [Prevention & Control]","Severity of Illness Index","Time Factors"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"54","number":"2","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=26192732"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common consequence of life-saving interventions for infants born with immature lungs.

Little attention has been given to lymphocytes and the chronic inflammatory phase of BPD. Ryan et al (AJRCCM 2009:179:A5976) using IHC analysis reported that CD3+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes were found more frequently in the lung parenchyma of infants who died with BPD compared to those of similar corrected gestational age without lung disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate lymphocyte subpopulations, chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4, and various cytotoxic Th1 and Th2 cytokines in tracheal aspirates (TA) of mechanically ventilated preterm neonates to test our hypothesis that clinical outcomes are correlated to the levels of these inflammatory mediators. Methods Preterm infants <34wks who remained mechanically ventilated at 7-14 days after birth were enrolled (n=13, mean GA 26wks). TAs were collected from routine suctioning of the endotracheal tube. Immune cell phenotyping was conducted by immunostaining with flow cytometric analysis with exclusion of dead cells. Supernatant cytokine levels were determined by cytometric bead array (CBA) and corrected for total protein by BCA. Clinical parameters examined included surfactant doses, ventilator days, respiratory support days (vent or CPAP), BPD as defined by the NIH Consensus Conference, death, and length of hospitalization. Results Higher numbers of CD8+ cells and CXCR3+ cells in TA collected between 7-14d of age were associated with a higher number of ventilator days. Tracheal cell intracellular levels of the cytotoxic factors granzyme B (GrB) and perforin correlated with the number of days of respiratory support (data shown for GrB in Figure), and ventilator days (p=0.0007, r=0.87 for GrB, p=0.0173 and r=0.6390 for perforin). Both CD8+ and natural killer cells stained positive for GrB and perforin. Infants at 7-14d of age who later develop severe BPD had a significantly higher percentage of TA lymphocytes with intracellular GrB and perforin compared with infants who developed mild-moderate BPD (p=0.0286 for both GrB and perforin). Mann-Whitney U test with data sorted by median days on the ventilator revealed a trend towards reduced levels of anti-inflammatory factors (IL10) and increase in pro-inflammatory factors (IL-2 and IFN-g).

BPD is caused by multiple factors including supplemental oxygen that cause cellular injury, inflammation and disrupted alveolar development. There are no effective treatments to prevent BPD, and understanding of the pathways leading to BPD are needed to develop novel pharmacologic therapies. Adenosine is a signaling molecule that is generated extra-cellularly by CD39 and CD73 in response to injury. Extracellular adenosine levels are modulated by equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) that transport adenosine into the cell. Elevated adenosine levels have been found to be protective in acute lung injury, but sustained elevations have been shown to mediate pro-inflammatory pathways and lead to tissue destruction and abnormal alveolar development. The role of adenosine signaling in the development of BPD has not been evaluated. Our hypotheses are: Exposure to hyperoxia in newborn mice leads to increased extracellular adenosine. Altering the generation or intracellular transport of extracellular adenosine will impact survival and histopathology of newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia. Method(s): Newborn C57Bl6 mice, CD73 -/-, and ENT2 -/- mice were exposed to 95% oxygen or room air starting between 12 and 48 hours after birth. After 14 days exposure, surviving mice were sacrificed for collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs for biochemical and histologic analysis. BALF was analyzed for adenosine concentrations and markers of inflammation. Lung sections were processed for histologic examination. Result(s): Exposure of C57Bl6 mice to hyperoxia increased BALF cell counts and protein concentrations, disrupted alveolar development and increased BALF adenosine concentrations. C57Bl6 mice had 56% survival in hyperoxia at 14 days. CD73 -/- mice in hyperoxia all died by day 11. ENT -/- mice in hyperoxia all died by day 6. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia exposure causes lung injury and disrupted alveolar development in newborn mice that is associated with increased extracellular adenosine concentrations. Loss of CD73, which will decrease extracellular adenosine production, leads to decreased survival of newborn mice in hyperoxia. Loss of ENT, which will increase extracellular adenosine levels, also leads to decreased survival of newborn mice in hyperoxia. These results suggest that adenosine plays an important and regulated role in newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia. Additional work using agents that alter adenosine levels and interact with specific adenosine receptors in combination with genetically modified mice will help delineate the role of adenosine in oxygen exposure in newborn mice and the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"a5486862-5ac3-4163-aa55-ed92d96842f6","_showDetails":true},"cee49172-6cf9-479a-bed2-d88970e7c86f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72044751","title":"Neonatal monocyte/macrophage depletion accelerates hyperoxia-induced lung injury","authors":["Eldredge L.C.","Treuting P.M.","Manicone A.M.","Duffield J.S.","Parks W.C.","McGuire J.K."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung injury","*American","*society","mouse","macrophage","lung","monocyte","neutrophil","flow cytometry","population","pathogenesis","infant","human","inflammation","pathologist","innate immunity","lung dysplasia","genetic model","FVB/N mouse","adult","stimulus","prematurity","pneumonia","wild type","phagocyte","blood vessel injury","model","lung edema","Leydig cell","edema","mononuclear phagocyte","transgenic mouse","atelectasis","fibrin deposition","lung hemorrhage","apoptosis","dying","exposure","mortality","pulmonary vein","respiratory epithelium","eukaryotic flagellum","paraffin","cell surface marker","receptor","toxin","diphtheria toxin"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"L.C.

BPD pathogenesis is multifactorial, including pro-inflammatory stimuli such as hyperoxia. The role of the innate immune system in this process is not well understood. We previously identified a population of M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages present in lungs of neonatal mice and largely absent in adult mice. We hypothesize that this macrophage population is protective in acute inflammatory lung injury in the developing lung. Method(s): We used a genetic model for conditional depletion of macrophages and monocytes. Administration of diphtheria toxin to CD11b-Diptheria Toxin Receptor (DTR) transgenic mice results in selective in vivo depletion of CD11b-positive mononuclear phagocytes. CD11b-positive neutrophils are preserved in this model. Postnatal (PN) day 0 wild type FVB/N or CD11bDTR mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500ng of DT then placed in 95% FiO2. Pulmonary macrophages were analyzed via flow cytometry utilizing validated cell surface markers. Whole mouse pups from parallel experiments were embedded in paraffin and analyzed by a certified veterinary pathologist. Result(s): DT treated CD11bDTR-negative controls were clinically well but had the expected histologic evidence of hyperoxia-induced lung injury including inflammation, perivascular edema, and loss of cilia on respiratory epithelia. DT treatment resulted in the ablation of approximately 50% CD11b-positive macrophages and monocytes in CD11bDTR-positive mice and led to 60% mortality by 40 hours of hyperoxia exposure; the surviving DTR-positive mice were profoundly moribund. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated a significant increase in the number of pulmonary neutrophils with a more than 60% increase above control mice (p < 0.05). Histologic analysis of lungs from DT treated CD11bDTR-positive mice revealed more severe, diffuse inflammatory lung injury than DTR-negative controls with fulminant pulmonary hemorrhage, intraalveolar fibrin deposition, focal areas of atelectasis, abundant apoptosis of interstitial cells, and pulmonary edema. In addition, cardiomyocytes within medium to large pulmonary veins of DT treated CD11bDTR mice were hypertrophied, suggesting associated pulmonary vascular injury. Conclusion(s): Depletion of CD11b-positive monocytes and macrophages results in severe pulmonary injury when newborn mice are exposed to hyperoxia. These features resemble aspects of inflammatory lung disease observed in premature infants. We conclude that CD11b-positive macrophages and monocytes play a protective role in the setting of hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. This may confirm a profound role for interstitial myeloid-derived phagocytic cells in the pathogenesis of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"cee49172-6cf9-479a-bed2-d88970e7c86f","_showDetails":true},"947daea8-a78e-431a-a4f3-c7c2f60bb657":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72044750","title":"Dysfunctional NRF2 signaling in myeloid cells causes heightened levels of lung inflammation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia","authors":["Tamatam C.","Reddy N.M.","Syed M.","Harijith A.","Natarajan V.","Raj J.U.","Pothireddy S."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*bone marrow cell","*pneumonia","*lung dysplasia","*mouse","*hyperoxia","*American","*society","lung","mortality","cell stress","inflammation","lung injury","immune response","injury","lung development","histopathology","liquid","leukocyte differential count","morbidity","hypothesis","lung disease","leukocyte","risk","ambient air","permeability","oxygen therapy","gene","newborn","prematurity","transcription factor","antioxidant","oxygen","protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.

An antioxidant/oxidant imbalance can lead to lung injury, inflammation and immune responses in experimental BPD. The Nrf2 transcription factor, by inducing several antioxidant and cytoprotective genes, mitigates cellular stress caused by hyperoxia. We found significant mortality and over-simplification of alveoli in Nrf2-/- compared to Nrf2+/+ mice during recovery from hyperoxic insult; however, the contribution of cellular stress produced by the resident versus recruited lung leukocytes to BPD is largely undefined. We tested the hypothesis that dysfunctional myeloid-specific Nrf2 signaling contributes to heightened inflammation and alveolar simplification in immature lungs during recovery from hyperoxia. Method(s): We generated mice lacking Nrf2 specifically in myeloid cells (Nrf2-/-DELTAmc) by crossing Nrf2 floxed (Nrf2f/f) mice with LyzM-Cre mice. 1-day-old pups were exposed to 95% oxygen for 72 h and then allowed to recover in room air for 3 weeks, and lung injury and alveolar simplification was evaluated. Result(s): Nrf2 deficiency in myeloid cells resulted in increased neutrophilic infiltration and alveolar permeability as indicated by differential cell counts and total protein levels in the BAL fluid, respectively. Histopathology revealed greater alveolar simplification in lungs of Nrf2-/- DELTAmc compared to Nrf2f/f mice after 3 weeks of recovery from hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): Nrf2 signaling in myeloid cells is critical for dampening of lung inflammation and for promotion of lung development in neonates during recovery from hyperoxic injury.","group":"g1","id":"947daea8-a78e-431a-a4f3-c7c2f60bb657","_showDetails":true},"7ab30b3c-899f-4155-9a8b-b40c0090c96a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72044748","title":"The TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) induces sustained type 1 inflammatory responses in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Popova A.P.","Cui T.X.","Richardson M.N.","Bentley J.K.","Goldsmith A.M.","Hershenson M.B."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*inflammation","*mouse","*mouse model","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","*agonist","hyperoxia","lung","human","viral respiratory tract infection","infant","Influenza A virus (H1N1)","Influenza A virus (H7N7)","Influenza A virus (H9N2)","Influenza A virus (H10N8)","Influenza A virus (H7N3)","Influenza A virus (H3N2)","Influenza A virus (H1N2)","Influenza A virus (H7N2)","Influenza A virus (H10N7)","Influenza A virus (H7N1)","Influenza A virus (H5N2)","Influenza A virus (H3N8)","Influenza A virus (H2N2)","Influenza A virus (H5N1)","Influenza A virus (H5N3)","gene expression","exposure","adult","gene","hospital readmission","prematurity","risk","lung disease","myofibroblast","child","virus infection","intranasal drug administration","cytokine production","disease course","immunocompetent cell","airway","assay","Influenza A virus","messenger RNA","interferon","polyinosinic polycytidylic acid","oxygen","double stranded RNA","cytokine","protein","interleukin 25","interleukin 4","interleukin 10","interleukin 12","toll like receptor 3","thymic stromal lymphopoietin","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.B.

Infants who develop BPD often have elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in their airway both at birth and during the later stages of disease progression. Children born prematurely have an increased incidence of respiratory viral infection and risk of rehospitalization in the first year of life. Neonatal hyperoxia has been shown to enhance the inflammatory response in adult mice infected with Influenza A virus. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a molecular pattern associated with respiratory viral infection. Poly(I:C) is recognized by Toll-Like receptor (TLR)-3, engagement of which leads to the expression of cytokines, interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. We hypothesized that poly(I:C) treatment, mimicking a viral infection, would induce sustained proinflammatory responses in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice. Method(s): Two to three day-old mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 days, as a mouse model of BPD. On day 14, hyperoxic exposure was discontinued and the mice were treated with intranasal poly(I:C) or PBS. The mice were harvested 5 days after poly(I:C) treatment to assess their subacute response. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR and multiplex assay. Result(s): Compared to poly(I:C)-treated, normoxia-exposed mice, poly(I:C) treatment of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice increased lung mRNA expression of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, MCP-1, IL-12, KC, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and IL-10. No difference in lung mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-13, IL-25 or TSLP was observed. There were no significant differences in the mRNA expression in PBS-treated mice. Whole lung TNFalpha, MCP-1, KC, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta protein levels were also increased by poly(I:C) treatment in hyperoxia- but not normoxia-exposed neonatal mice. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that compared to normoxia-exposed neonatal mice, neonatal mice exposed to prolonged moderate hyperoxia and subsequently treated with poly(I:C) show sustained type 1 inflammatory responses. Future studies will examine the innate immune cells responsible for type 1 cytokine production.","group":"g3","id":"7ab30b3c-899f-4155-9a8b-b40c0090c96a","_showDetails":true},"051936e0-eb33-4a2e-837b-defc4ae36184":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72044746","title":"Angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist PD123319 attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung and heart injury at low doses in Newborn rats","authors":["Wagenaar G.T.M.","Sengers R.M.A.","Laghmani E.","Lindeboom M.H.A.","Walther F.J."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung","*heart injury","*low drug dose","*newborn","*rat","*American","*society","model","human","prematurity","infant","thickness","pneumonia","fibrin deposition","agonist","injury","macrophage","inflammatory cell","lung alveolus wall","inflammation","gene","chronic lung disease","lung dysplasia","heart","exposure","rat model","ambient air","parameters","histopathology","renin angiotensin aldosterone system","adult","morbidity","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","mortality","respiratory failure","hypertension","newborn period","arteriole","neutrophil","*angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist","*1 (4 dimethylamino 3 methylbenzyl) 5 diphenylacetyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 1h imidazo[4,5 c]pyridine 6 carboxylic acid","angiotensin 2 receptor","messenger RNA","oxygen"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"G.T.M.

Intervening in angiotensin (Ang) II type 2 receptor (AT2) signaling may have therapeutic potential for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease in preterm infants, by attenuating lung inflammation and preventing arterial hypertension (PAH)-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). The newborn rat is an excellent model to study AT2-dependent signaling in cardiopulmonary disease because of the 100-fold higher level of expression of AT2 in neonatal lung compared to adults. METHODS. To advance our knowledge on AT2 receptor signaling in neonatal cardiopulmonary disease, we first investigated the effect of AT2 inhibition with PD123319 (0.5 and 2 mg/kg/day) on the beneficial effect of the AT2 agonist LP2-3 (5 mug/kg twice a day) on RVH in newborn rats exposed to 100% oxygen during the first 10 days after birth. Next, we determined the cardiopulmonary effects of daily treatment with the AT2 antagonist PD123319 (0.1 mg/kg/day) in 2 newborn rat models: early treatment during continuous exposure to hyperoxia for 10 days and late treatment starting on day 6 in rat pups exposed postnatally to hyperoxia for 9 days, followed by a 9 day recovery period in room air. Parameters investigated included lung and heart histopathology, fibrin deposition, vascular leakage and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, coagulation and alveolar development. RESULTS. Ten days of co-administration of LP2-3 and PD123319 (0.5 and 2 mg/kg/day) abolished the beneficial effects of LP2-3 on RVH in experimental BPD. Treatment with a low dose of PD123319 (0.1 mg/kg/day) in the early treatment model attenuated cardiopulmonary injury by reducing alveolar septum thickness, pulmonary influx of inflammatory cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, medial wall thickness of small arterioles, and preventing RVH. In the late treatment model PD123319 diminished PAH and RVH, demonstrating that RVH is reversible in the neonatal period. PD123319 did not reduce alveolar enlargement, fibrin deposition and vascular alveolar leakage. CONCLUSION. High concentrations of the AT2 antagonist PD123319 block the beneficial effects of the AT2-agonist LP2-3 on RVH. Low concentrations of PD123319 attenuate cardiopulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation and preventing PAH-induced RVH, but do not affect alveolar and vascular development in newborn rats with experimental BPD. Extrapolation of these findings to preterm infants with respiratory failure, suggests a potential beneficial effect of LP2-3 and PD123319 on PAH and RVH, which are the major causes of mortality and severe morbidity in preterm infants with severe BPD.","group":"g3","id":"051936e0-eb33-4a2e-837b-defc4ae36184","_showDetails":true},"fea9bd17-afc0-428e-802b-6f63774142dc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72044745","title":"Single nucleotide polymorphisms of matrix metalloproteinase proteinase-9 gene are associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low birth weight infants","authors":["Paudel U.","Telliard J.","Patel N.","Parton L.A.","Chhabra D.","Calo J.M."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*single nucleotide polymorphism","*gene","*lung dysplasia","*extremely low birth weight","*American","*society","human","genotype","infant","gestational age","birth weight","prematurity","tracheal aspiration procedure","chronic obstructive lung disease","child","asthma","pilot study","allele","statistical significance","Student t test","adult","connective tissue","chi square test","protein degradation","real time polymerase chain reaction","chromosome aberration","extracellular matrix","cohort analysis","maturation","lung development","newborn","risk","lung parenchyma","hypothesis","analysis of variance","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","*matrix metalloproteinase","*proteinase","gelatinase B","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"U.

Alveolarization requires coordinated extracellular matrix remodeling, a process in which matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) has proteolytic activity against connective tissue and its polymorphism (C-1562T, Q279R) play an important role in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults and asthma in children. We therefore considered the polymorphisms of MMP-9 rs3918242 and rs17576 as the candidate genes in the susceptibility to BPD. Objective(s): We tested the hypothesis that rs3918242 and rs17576 are associated with susceptibility to BPD in ELBW infants. Method(s): This is an ongoing cohort study that enrolls infants weighing <1 kg at birth, without congenital or chromosomal anomalies. BPD is defined as need for O2 at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. DNA was isolated from buccal mucosal swabs (N=110) and subjected to allelic discrimination using Taqman probes for MMP 9 SNP C-1562T (rs3918242) and Q279R (rs17576) during real-time PCR. Tracheal aspirates were collected (N=21) and MMP 9 levels measured by ELISA. ANOVA, Chi square analyses and t-test for independent samples were performed with P<0.05 denoting statistical significance. Results Birth weights and gestational ages were significantly smaller in the BPD group. Association analysis carried out using PLINK showed that SNPs were associated with BPD after adjusting for gestational age (p=0.006) and birth weight (p=0.007). Genotype distributions for both MMP 9 SNPs tested were significantly high for BPD (P=0.04). MMP-9 expression in tracheal aspirate (in figures) was significantly higher among tt genotype and rr genotypes. Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, ELBW preterm infants who progressed to BPD were more likely to contain the minor allele for the MMP-9 rs3918242 and rs17475. We speculate that the increased expression of MMP-9 proteolytic enzyme in lung parenchyma increases the risk of BPD in preterm neonates.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), common in very premature infants, is characterized by premature arrest of alveogenesis. Increasing evidence has suggested that disrupted temporal or spatial levels of the mesenchymal protein late gestational lung 1 (LGL1/CRISPLD2) impairs alveogenesis. Dramatically reduced Lgl1 levels in oxygen toxicity rat models of BPD normalized with recovery. Absence of Lgl1 in knockout mice was embryonic lethal. Heterozygous Lgl1+/- mice exhibited features resembling human BPD, including distal airspace enlargement, disruption of elastin, and mucus cell hyperplasia. Secreted Lgl1 concentrated at the tips of budding alveoli. Yet, the mechanism of LGL1 action in lung development and neonatal lung disease remain incompletely understood. METHOD(S): To elucidate the mechanism of LGL1 function we developed a doxycycline (DOX) inducible RNA-mediated LGL1 knockdown model in human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC5LGL1KD). We used over and under expression of LGL1 in both human fetal lung fibroblasts and adult lung epithelial cells to evaluate the role of LGL1 in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration and wound healing. We used immunofluorescence to investigate LGL1 expression in lung tissue sections from human BPD patients and control. RESULT(S): DOX induction of MRC5LGL1KD suppressed cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of annexin V+ staining cells and caspase3/7 activity. Secreted LGL1 increased migration of post-natal rat primary lung cells and human alveolar epithelial cells. Impaired wound healing of MRC5LGL1KD cells was attenuated by addition of LGL1-enriched medium. Suppression of LGL1 was associated with dysregulation of ECM genes (upregulated TGFbeta, downregulated MMP1, ColXValpha1, ELASTIN) and proapoptosis genes (upregulated BAD, BAK, CASP2, TNFRSF1B and inhibition of 44/42MAPK phosphorylation). Lung tissue sections from human BPD had reduced LGL1 levels. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings define a role for LGL1 in fibroblast expansion and migration, epithelial migration and mesenchymal-epithelial signaling, key processes in fetal lung development. Our combined results point to the potential of LGL1 as a mediator of BPD therapy.","group":"g2","id":"8e8896f1-39b7-43be-a237-2225605c5dc0","_showDetails":false},"e6d0a5ec-94e8-4b8b-a140-7e9afdcfaaad":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72043327","title":"Genetic determinants of oxidant-induced nuclear and mitochondrial DNA lesions in a neonatal inbred mouse model of acute lung injury","authors":["Verhein K.C.","Nichols J.L.","Panduri V.","Gladwell W.","Marzec J.","McCaw Z.","Reeves N.","Malphurs J.","Solomon G.","Wiltshire T.","Burkholder A.","Fargo D.","Bell D.","Van Houten B.","Kleeberger S.R."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*mouse","*mouse model","*inbred mouse strain","*acute lung injury","*American","*society","gene","hyperoxia","DNA damage","ambient air","exposure","phenotype","lung","lung injury","infant","chromosome","lung development","lung dysplasia","oxidative stress","adverse drug reaction","blood vessel injury","lung disease","inflammatory cell","assisted ventilation","pathogenesis","human","genome","prematurity","inbred strain","injury","genetics","histopathology","lung homogenate","genetic polymorphism","mitochondrion","DNA replication","haplotype","*oxidizing agent","*mitochondrial DNA","*DNA","oxygen","cell nucleus DNA","reactive oxygen metabolite","ribosome protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"K.C.

In BPD, treatment often involves respiratory support with high oxygen, and oxidative stress is an adverse effect that is associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Genetic polymorphisms in a few candidate genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood. Understanding the role of genetics is critical to improving treatment strategies and reducing oxidant injury in developing lungs. The objective of this investigation was to utilize genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of quantitative phenotypes to identify genes important to susceptibility to neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): One day after birth, neonatal mice from 29 inbred strains were exposed for 72 hr to room air (20% oxygen) or >95% clinical grade oxygen (hyperoxia). Hyperoxia induced phenotypes (including inflammatory cells and histopathology) that are similar to BPD when compared to normal postnatal lung development in ambient air. We also measured hyperoxia-induced lesions in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondrial copy number from lung homogenates. Results/Conclusions: Significant inter-strain variation was found for all three DNA damage phenotypes after room air and hyperoxia exposure. GWA mapping identified significant QTLs on chromosomes 6, 8, 12, and 18 for DNA lesions and mitochondrial copy number after room air exposure. QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2, 8, 18, and X were found for DNA lesions induced by hyperoxia. Gene candidates include genes involved in DNA replication and repair or mitochondria function: polymerase (DNA directed), beta and iota (Polb, Poli), mitochondrial ribosomal protein S31 (Mrps31). Ingenuity pathway analyses of gene candidates identified gene networks and gene candidates for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage. We have also performed ultra-deep sequencing of lung mitochondrial DNA from these mice to provide additional genetic insight to susceptibility to oxidant-induced DNA lesions, and to generate a SNP map for haplotype association mapping. We conclude that exposure to low (20%) and high (>95%) concentrations of oxygen early in life cause lesions in mouse lung mitochondrial and nuclear DNA that are strain dependent. Through these combined approaches, we have identified novel candidate susceptibility genes that may improve our understanding of neonatal lung injury and development.","group":"g3","id":"e6d0a5ec-94e8-4b8b-a140-7e9afdcfaaad","_showDetails":true},"6ab772b1-4aeb-4512-b2ba-942576836d19":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72042925","title":"Effect of altered TNF-a signaling on early pulmonary changes in newborn mice undergoing mechanical ventilation","authors":["Gimm T.","Kossert M.","Alvira C.M.","Koschlig M.","Hilgendorff A.","Ehrhardt H."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*artificial ventilation","*American","*society","*mouse","lung","apoptosis","pneumonia","in vitro study","wild type mouse","inflammation","lung dysplasia","infant","prematurity","chronic lung disease","lung lavage","monocyte","air conditioning","gas","myofibroblast","protein analysis","wild type","mouse model","newborn","human","exposure","cytokine","chemokine","tumor necrosis factor","interleukin 1","oxygen","messenger RNA","monocyte chemotactic protein 1","caspase 3","factor A"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"T.

The disease mainly occurs after mechanical ventilation with oxygen rich gas (MV-O2). Here, the pro-inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a has been found to be increased in the lung lavage from preterms that later develope BPD. We thus hypothesized, that the absence of TNF-a would significantly reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response following MV-O2 and thus ameliorate apoptosis and histologic changes induced by ventilation in the developing lung in a mouse model of the disease. Objective and Methods: 5-6 days old TNF-a knock-out (TNF-a-/-) and wild type (WT, TNF-a+/+) mice received MV with 40%O2 at 180 breaths/min; controls spontaneously breathed 40%O2. After 8h, lungs (n=10-12/group) were harvested for histologic, mRNA and protein analysis. To further confirm obtained effects in vitro, primary pulmonary myofibroblasts (MFB), critically involved in alveolar septation, were isolated from unventilated newborn TNF-a-/- and WT mice and subjected to mechanical stretch (Flexcell) as well as cytokine exposure. Result(s): Contrary to our expectations, pulmonary chemokine (MCP-1, CXCL-1) and cytokine (IL-1b) expression was significantly elevated in ventilated TNF-a-/- as compared to WT mice accompanied by an increased influx of monocytes into the ventilated lung. Furthermore, apoptosis (TUNEL, caspase 3, 8 and 9) was significantly increased in the lungs of mechanically ventilated TNF-a-/- mice. These differences potentially resulted from a significant increase in pulmonary TGF-b signaling in TNF-a-/- mice following MV-O2 . These results were confirmed in vitro by an elevated apoptotic response to TGF-beta in pulmonary MFB from TNF-a-/- mice in contrast to WT pups. Histological changes were similar in both groups. Conclusion(s): These results point towards a critical balance of pulmonary TNF-a and TGF-b signaling and underline the importance of both pathways in the induction of early changes in the developing lung undergoing MV-O2, i.e. pulmonary inflammation and consecutive apoptosis.","group":"g3","id":"6ab772b1-4aeb-4512-b2ba-942576836d19","_showDetails":true},"dc9f4f79-65f3-4da0-a2e8-8b14e96d3b9b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Effects of intermittent hypoxia and hyperoxia on angiogenesis and lung development in newborn mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/NPM-15814134","authors":["Elberson, V D","Nielsen, L C","Wang, H","Kumar, H S V"],"date":"2015//","keywords":["Angiopoietin-1/ge [Genetics]","Animals","Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator/ge [Genetics]","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/ge [Genetics]","Cell Proliferation","Down-Regulation","*Gene Expression","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Hypoxia/co [Complications]","*Hypoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/an [Analysis]","Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/ge [Genetics]","Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases/an [Analysis]","Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases/ge [Genetics]","Ki-67 Antigen/an [Analysis]","Lung/ch [Chemistry]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Neovascularization, Physiologic/ge [Genetics]","*RNA, Messenger/an [Analysis]","Random Allocation","Receptor, TIE-2/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/an [Analysis]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine","volume":"8","number":"4","isbn":"1878-4429","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26836820"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Premature birth disrupts hypoxia driven microvascular development that directs alveolar and lung growth.

Lung morphology was assessed by H&E sections and radial alveolar counts; cell proliferation by Ki67 immunostaining., RESULTS: HIF-1alpha mRNA and VEGF protein were significantly downregulated in the 50% O2 group; VEGF mRNA and protein were significantly downregulated in the 12% O2-50% O2 group; Ang-1 and its receptor mRNA expression were downregulated in 12% O2 and 12% O2-50% O2 groups. 50% O2 (hyperoxia) and 12% O2-50% O2 (hypoxia-hyperoxia) groups demonstrated alveolar simplification by RAC and the same groups had decreased cell proliferation by Ki67 staining compared to RA and hypoxia (12% O2) groups., CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of HIF and angiogenic gene expression with associated changes in lung histology following intermittent hypoxia-hyperoxia is likely an important contributing factor in the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"dc9f4f79-65f3-4da0-a2e8-8b14e96d3b9b","_showDetails":true},"7f1ff3e9-8b35-42e9-970b-65904e38bfaa":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72042196","title":"Evaluation of lysyl oxidases as therapeutic targets in an experimental model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Mizikova I.","Madurga Hernandez A.","Seeger W.","Morty R.E."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*experimental model","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","mouse","protein expression","surface area","density","gene","human","upregulation","phenotype","lung structure","thickness","lung","survival","mortality","patient","total lung capacity","infant","drug megadose","prematurity","cross linking","artificial ventilation","computer program","mouse model","connective tissue","locomotion","newborn","diseases","metabolism","hyperoxia","lung development","extracellular matrix","*protein lysine 6 oxidase","3 aminopropionitrile","messenger RNA","collagen","elastin","nonoxinol 9","enzyme","copper","oxygen"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"189","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"I.

Evidence suggests that an impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism contributes to this disorder. Lysyl oxidases are copper-dependent enzymes catalizing the formation of covalent cross-linkages in elastin and collagen molecules. Activity of lysyl oxidases is dysregulated in BPD patients. beta-Aminopropionitrile (BAPN) is a specific inhibitor of lysyl oxidases. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the changes in gene and protein expression and overall improvement of lung structure of hyperoxia-exposed animals upon BAPN treatment. METHOD(S): The newborn mouse model of BPD was used in this study. Newborn mice were exposed to normoxic (21% O2; NOX) or hyperoxic (85% O2; HXY) conditions and treated (1x daily; iintraperitoneal) with PBS or BAPN. Animals were sacrificed on day 9.5 after birth. Gene and protein expression levels, as well as the lung structure were investigated. Surface density, surface area, mean linear intercept (MLI) and total alveolar numbers were assessed by stereological evaluation using newCast visiopharm software. RESULT(S): 15 animals per group were investigated. High doses (150 mg/kg) of BAPN caused severe damage to connective tissues, locomotion problems and increased mortality (56% in NOX, resp. 61.2% in HYX) of newborn pups, demonstrating an importance of lysyl oxidase family in early development. A lower dose (15 mg/kg) was well tolerated and did not affect survival. No change in total lung volume was observed upon BAPN treatment in the HXY group (0.13 cm3 vs. 0.125 cm3). Gene and protein expression, and activity of members of lysyl oxidase family were dysregulated in injured developing mouse lungs [LOX: significant upregulation in mRNA expression (DELTACt) -0.80 vs. 0.58; p=0.002, LOXL4: significant upregulation -2.08 vs. -2.33; p=0.0008], contributing to a BPD-like phenotype. Surface density (60.78 mm-1 vs. 47.24 mm-11 ; p=0.0002), as well as surface area (86.39 cm2 vs. 53.03 cm2; p=0.033) were significantly decreased in the HYX group, while increases in MLI, septal thickness, as well as total airspace volume was observed. Surface density (47.24 mm-1 vs. 38.33 mm-1), surface area (53.03 cm2 vs. 53.71 cm2) and septal thickness were partially restored upon treatment (11.37 mum vs. 10.59 mum), while no marked changes were observed in MLI, total airspace volume or total alveolar number. CONCLUSION(S): Optimal regulation of lysyl oxidases is crutial during the period of late lung development. BAPN treatment has a potential to partially improve disease phenotype.","group":"g3","id":"7f1ff3e9-8b35-42e9-970b-65904e38bfaa","_showDetails":true},"8b1891ac-21fa-4d51-a043-1ae5760b0984":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71881994","title":"Biomarkers in the arginine metabolome predict pulmonary hypertension in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Trittmann J.K.","Zmuda E.J.","Gastier-Foster J.M.","Vieland V.J.","Klebanoff M.A.","Rogers L.K.","Vaynshtok P.M.","Peterson E.E.","Nelin L.D."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*metabolome","*pulmonary hypertension","*patient","*human","*lung dysplasia","*society","pH","blood level","gene","population","allele","single nucleotide polymorphism","data base","leukocyte","mortality","blood","morbidity","pediatrics","chronic lung disease","metabolite","prematurity","plasma","newborn","high performance liquid chromatography","pediatric hospital","*arginine","*nitric oxide","*biological marker","n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine","citrulline","ornithine","proline","urea","arginase","nitric oxide synthase","ornithine carbamoyltransferase","carbamoyl phosphate synthase","argininosuccinate synthase","DNA"],"journal":"Nitric Oxide - Biology and Chemistry","language":"English","volume":"42","publisher":"Academic Press Inc.","isbn":"1089-8603","address":"J.K.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH), a common complication of BPD is associated with significantly more morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no tests for predicting which BPD patients will develop PH. Objective(s): To identify potential biomarkers for the development of PH in patients with BPD by examining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of the urea cycle/NOS as well as plasma levels of metabolites of the L-arginine/NO pathway and the endogenous inhibitor of NOS, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Design/methods: Neonatal patients with BPD admitted to Nationwide Children's Hospital after September 1, 2009 were enrolled. DNA from140 patients was isolated from whole blood leukocytes and assayed for 17 SNPs in genes of the L-arginine/ NO pathway by Sequenom Mass ARRAY. Genes included carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), and arginase (ARG1 and ARG2). SNPs were selected from the NCBI/SNP database for their putative functionality. Plasma levels of citrulline, arginine, ornithine, and proline, as well as ADMA were analyzed by HPLC in 118 patients. Result(s): Of the 140 patients with BPD, 35 (26%) had echocardiographic evidence of PH. Of the 17 SNPs examined, rs2781666 in ARG1 was less common in cases (MAF = 0.23) than controls (MAF = 0.37, p = 0.04). The odds of PH were decreased by 43% (p = 0.047) for each copy of the ARG1 SNP minor allele in patients with BPD. We found no difference in plasma levels of citrulline, arginine, ornithine, or proline between cases and controls. Cases of BPD and PH had higher levels of ADMA (5.0 +/- 4.0 vs. 2.2 +/- 2.8, p = 0.04) and a lower arginine-to-ADMA ratio (131 +/- 152 vs. 330 +/- 562, p = 0.03) than did controls with BPD alone. Conclusion(s): In this neonatal population with BPD, we found that the ARG1 SNP rs2781666 may be protective against the development of PH in preterm neonates with BPD and that plasma ADMA levels are elevated in patients with BPD and PH. These findings suggest that the arginine metabolome may be an important therapeutic target in preventing the development of PH in patients with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"8b1891ac-21fa-4d51-a043-1ae5760b0984","_showDetails":true},"0e933e30-199e-40f8-aec4-a5e65ba9a1f0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71851177","title":"A novel association between YKL-40, a marker for structural lung disease, and short telomere length in 10-year old children with BPD","authors":["Henckel E.","James A.","Konradsson J.","Nordlund B.","Ebersjo C.","Brostrom E.B.","Hedlin G.","Bohlin K."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*lung disease","*telomere","*child","*human","*European","*society","lung function","spirometry","oxidative stress","serum","lung dysplasia","cohort analysis","school","vascular smooth muscle","gestational age","airway remodeling","blood","morbidity","asthma","real time polymerase chain reaction","blood level","fibrosis","lung","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","*marker","biological marker","protein","chitinase"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"44","number":"SUPPL. 58\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"E.

Relative telomere length (RTL) is a biomarker for oxidative stress and the chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is a novel biomarker associated with airway remodeling and vascular smooth muscle proliferation, all of which may contribute to impaired lung function following BPD Aim To investigate the relationship between RTL, YKL-40 and lung function in school age children with a history of BPD Methods A cohort study of 10 year old children born preterm with BPD (n=29, mean gestational age 27 weeks) and control children (CON) born at term (n=28) with a history of asthma. All children performed lung function testing (dynamic and static spirometry). RTL was determined in whole blood by real-time PCR. Serum levels of YKL-40 was analyzed by ELISA Results Serum YKL-40 was higher in BPD compared to CON, p=0.002. RTL was similar between groups, but in children with BPD there was a correlation between shorter RTL and higher levels of serum YKL-40 (r=0,47, p=0,01). Dynamic spirometry showed significantly lower values in BPD children, but lung function did not correlate to YKL-40 or RTL Conclusions Short telomeres correlated to higher levels of YKL-40 suggesting a more severe structural lung disease may be associated with genetic alterations in children growing up with BPD. High levels of YKL-40 suggests an involvement of fibrosis in BPD and the correlation to RTL indicate that oxidative stress may play a part.

We carried out a retrospective study to evaluate allele frequency and genotype distribution of VEGFA, eNOS, AGT, AGTR1, ACE, and HMOX1 polymorphisms in a population of preterm neonates with a gestational age <=28 weeks according to the presence or absence of RDS, BPD, IVH, and ROP. Moreover, we evaluated through the haplotype reconstruction analysis whether combinations of the selected polymorphisms are related to RDS, BPD, IVH and ROP. We found that TC+CC rs2070744 eNOS (41.7 vs. 25.4%, p=0.01) and GT+TT rs1799983 eNOS (51.8 vs. 35.2%, p=0.01) polymorphisms are independent risk factor for BPD.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between early brain development and physiological risk factors in very-low-birthweight (VLBW) preterm infants at near-term age, based on structural brain MRI and semi-automated, atlas-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis. Design(s): This ongoing prospective cohort study examines relations between neonatal physiological risk factors and white matter (WM) microstructure on DTI at near-term age. Participants and Setting: A cross-sectional sample of 102 VLBW preterm infants (BW<=1500g, GA<=32wks) were admitted to the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital NICU and recruited to participate prior to standard-of-care MRI conducted at 36.6 (1.8) weeks postmenstrual age from 2010 to 2011; 66/102 also received DTI. Method(s): Brain abnormalities were assessed on structural MRI, and WM microstructure was analyzed in six subcortical regions defined by DiffeoMap neonatal brain atlas. Regions of interest included the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, the thalamus, and the globus pallidus, using a threshold value of fractional anisotropy (FA)>0.15 to select WM. Regional FA and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated and examined in relation to early physiological risk factors including: bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) during the hospital stay, as well as serum glucose, albumin, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels during the first two weeks of life. Result(s): Of 38/102 infants had brain abnormalities observed on MRI. These infants had significantly higher mean serum CRP levels (0.64 vs 0.34 mg/dl, p=0.008) and peak CRP levels (1.57 vs 0.67mg/dl, p=0.006) compared to those with no observed brain abnormalities. Number of signal abnormalities observed on MRI correlated to serum CRP levels (r=0.302, p=0.003). Mean genu MD was higher in males than females (p=0.004). Higher thalamus MD on the left and right, respectively, was associated with lower GA-at-birth (r=-0.322, p=0.009; r=-0.381, p=0.002), lower BW (r=-0.287, p=0.021; r=-281, p=0.024). Higher thalamus MD on the left and right was also associated with lower mean serum albumin (r=-0.276 p=0.029; r=--0.385, p=0.002) and with lower total bilirubin (r=-0.293, p=0.020; r=-0.337 p=0.007). Conclusion(s): At near-term age, the thalamus WM microstructure may be particularly vulnerable to neonatal risk factors. Interactions between albumin, bilirubin, phototherapy, and brain development warrant further investigation. Identification of physiological risk factors associated with selective vulnerability of certain brain regions at near-term age may clarify the etiology of neurodevelopmental impairment and inform neuroprotective treatment for neonates.","group":"g1","id":"06404442-55d4-49e3-bb7c-a3e1cd46d15c","_showDetails":true},"cb758766-b966-4e39-b8bb-e83282eba9b8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71745953","title":"Early losartan treatment prevents the developmental programming of cardiac dysfunction caused by neonatal high oxygen exposure in rats","authors":["Bertagnolli M.","Beland-Bonenfant S.","Dios A.","Dartora D.R.","Lukaszewski M.-A.","Cloutier A.","Sutherland M.","DeBlois D.","Paradis P.","Schiffrin E.L.","Nuyt A.M."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*exposure","*rat","*medical society","*hypertension","human","oxidative stress","implantable cardiac monitor","newborn","short course therapy","prematurity","hypertrophy","adult","renin angiotensin aldosterone system","male","weight","female","heart ventricle hypertrophy","infant","lung dysplasia","echocardiography","feeding","ambient air","mother","model","retinopathy","heart","oncogene ras","*losartan","*oxygen","receptor","water"],"journal":"Hypertension","language":"English","volume":"64","number":"SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"0194-911X","address":"M.

Our group has previously shown that rats transiently exposed to high O2 as newborns (mimicking human preterms oxidative stress conditions) develop high blood pressure (BP), cardiac remodeling and dysfunction later in life, in part mediated by the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Cardiac RAS activation is characterized by AT1/AT2 receptors imbalance, with increased AT1R at adult age. In order to study the role of RAS at early stages of the developmental programming of cardiac dysfunction caused by high O2 exposure, we assessed whether an early and short-term treatment with AT1R blocker Losartan, prevents cardiac alterations at young male 4 wks-old rats (prior to the elevation of BP in this model). Sprague-Dawley newborns rats were kept with their mother in 80% O2 (O2 group, n=9) or room air (Ctrl, n=9) from days 3-10 of life (P3-P10). Losartan (LOS, n=10, 20 mg/Kg) or water was administered by gavage in O2 rats from P8-P10 (last 2 days of O2 to avoid impact on nephrogenesis). At 4 wks, echocardiography reveals that O2 rats have decreased fraction of shortening compared to Ctrl (FS: 37+/-2 vs 42+/-2 %), suggesting impaired systolic function in O2. Cardiac hypertrophy evaluated by heart/body weight and cardiomyocyte surface area (CSA) is also increased in O2 vs Ctrl (141+/-13 vs 118+/-4 [mu]m2). LOS treatment prevented the impairment of systolic function in O2 by ameliorating FS (43+/-2 %) and reducing CSA (121+/-11 [mu]m2). LOS treatment also modulated RAS genes expression (RT-PCR): LOS restored AT1/AT2 balance in O2 hearts by decreasing AT1b subunit (0.8+/-0.2 O2 vs 1.3+/-0.3 O2+LOS vs 0.9+/-0.2 Ctrl) as well as increasing ACE2 (1.5+/-0.4 O2 vs 0.8+/-0.1 O2+LOS vs 1.1+/-0.4 Ctrl) expressions. In conclusion, a short-term treatment with LOS during neonatal O2 exposure prevents the impairment of cardiac systolic function and hypertrophy at young age. This data reinforces the key role of RAS in the developmental programming of cardiac dysfunction and reveals LOS as an effective strategy to prevent early cardiac alterations caused by neonatal high O2 exposure.","group":"g1","id":"cb758766-b966-4e39-b8bb-e83282eba9b8","_showDetails":true},"cfacb6c1-baf0-44e4-9436-809a4469a237":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71713250","title":"Protein kinase g mediates hyperoxia-induced vascular changes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary hypertension","authors":["Lee K.J.","Kim G.A.","Taylor J.M.","Hofmann F.","Farrow K.N."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung dysplasia","*pulmonary hypertension","*medical society","*resuscitation","mouse","pH","vascularization","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","oxidative stress","pulmonary artery","lung injury","knockout mouse","blood vessel tone","blood vessel injury","wild type","mouse strain","smooth muscle fiber","artery muscle","staining","prematurity","thickness","lung","ambient air","mouse model","hypothesis","modulation","*cyclic GMP dependent protein kinase","cyclic GMP","von Willebrand factor","cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase","formaldehyde"],"journal":"Circulation","language":"English","volume":"130","number":"SUPPL. 2\nSP  -","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"0009-7322","address":"K.J.

Protein Kinase G (PKG) is a kinase that phosphorylates multiple cellular targets leading to alterations in the perinatal vascular tone. Little is known about the role of PKG in BPD-associated PH. Hypothesis: To elucidate the role of PKG in the context of BPD-associated PH Methods: PKG has two possible modes of activation - cGMP or oxidative stress. We utilized global PKG knockout mice (PKG KO) and redox-dead PKG mice (C42S) which cannot be activated by oxidative stress, but maintain cGMP activation. For our hyperoxia-induced lung injury mouse model, age-matched litters of PKG KO or C42S mice were placed in room air (control) or 75% O2 (chronic hyperoxia, CH) within 24h of birth. After 14d, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was measured by Fulton's index (right ventricle/left ventricle+septum). Lungs were inflation fixed with 4% formalin and stained to measure alveolar area, pulmonary artery medial wall thickness (MWT) and vascularization by von Willebrand factor staining. Additionally, primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) were isolated from both mouse strains, placed in 21% or 95% O2 for 24h, and analyzed for phosphodiesterase5 (PDE5) activity. Result(s): Isogenic wild-type (WT) control mice developed significant RVH in CH, whereas CH PKG KO and C42S mice did not develop RVH. Isogenic WT mice developed significantly increased MWT and decreased vascularization, but PKG KO and C42S mice were protected from vascular injury. However, all CH mice had significantly increased alveolar area. Isogenic WT PASMC had significantly increased PDE5 activity after 24h of 95% O2, but PKG KO and C42S PASMC did not. Conclusion(s): Global loss of PKG and loss of redox-activated PKG protected from hyperoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy, vascular remodeling and decreased vascularization that were observed with CH WT mice as well as hyperoxia-induced PDE5 activity in PASMC. However, PKG does not appear to play a role in hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Thus, modulation of redox-activated PKG activity may represent a novel new therapeutic target for BPD-associated PH.","group":"g1","id":"cfacb6c1-baf0-44e4-9436-809a4469a237","_showDetails":true},"2721ef00-b3a7-4b09-8f82-f2122910e42e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71689685","title":"Improving the in vivo glutathione level prevents toxic effects of ascorbylperoxide on lung development","authors":["Lavoie J.-C.","Elremaly W.","Mohamed I.","Rouleau T."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*toxicity","*lung development","*society","oxidation reduction potential","infant","parenteral nutrition","protection","catheter","apoptosis","human","lung dysplasia","jugular vein","newborn","plasma","animal experiment","guinea pig","Western blotting","capillary electrophoresis","pregnancy","lung","continuous infusion","prematurity","analysis of variance","*free radical","*glutathione","glucose","glutathione peroxidase","nonoxinol 9","caspase 3","vitamin","lipid","amino acid"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"76","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"J.-C.

Animal studies report that ascorbylperoxide (AscOOH) generated in parenteral nutrition (PN) devoid of light protection induces oxidized redox potential and loss of alveoli following an exaggerated apoptosis. Because AscOOH is a substrate of glutathione peroxidase, we hypothesized that improving of the in vivo glutathione level can limit BPD development. The aim was to assess in newborn animals that addition of glutathione in PN prevents the deleterious effects of AscOOH.

Sham: animals fed regular chow, catheter was closed; PN(-L): animals fed exclusively with parenteral nutrition (dextrose, amino acids, lipids, vitamins), PN was light-protected by opaque materials; PN(+L): PN without photo-protection (containing about 35 muM ascorbylperoxyde); PN(+L)+GSSG: + 10 muM GSSG; AscOOH: dextrose + 180 muM ascorbylperoxyde; AscOOH+GSSG: + 10 muM GSSG. after 4 days of continuous infusion, lungs were collected and prepared for determinations of redox potential (mV) calculated from GSH and GSSG concentrations (capillary electrophoresis), activated caspase-3 (apoptosis) (Western blot) and alveolarization (average number of intercepts between a 1 mm line and histological structures from 4 fields / animal). ANOVA, p<0.05. Result(s): Plasma glutathione in PN(+L)+GSSG was higher than in PN(+L) group (0.5+/-0.2 vs. 14.2+/-0.4 muM, p<0.01). Results from PN(-L) were not different than those from Sham. The presence of GSSG has corrected (p<0.05) the modifications induced by PN(+L) or AscOOH (see Table). (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Addition of GSSG in PN could prevent deleterious effect of ascorbylperoxide on lung development of preterm infants by correcting their well-known low glutathione level.","group":"g1","id":"2721ef00-b3a7-4b09-8f82-f2122910e42e","_showDetails":true},"d6b75a3d-b78f-4abd-a47a-96d938324b0d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71689626","title":"Genetic determinants of oxidant-induced nuclear and mitochondrial DNA lesions in a neonatal inbred mouse model of acute lung injury","authors":["Verhein K.C.","Nichols J.L.","Panduri V.","Gladwell W.","Marzec J.","McCaw Z.","Reeves N.","Malphurs J.","Solomon G.","Wiltshire T.","Burkholder A.","Fargo D.","Bell D.","Van Houten B.","Kleeberger S.R."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*mouse","*mouse model","*inbred mouse strain","*acute lung injury","*society","hyperoxia","lung","gene","phenotype","infant","lung injury","inbred strain","DNA damage","lung development","lung dysplasia","lung disease","exposure","lung homogenate","oxidative stress","adverse drug reaction","blood vessel injury","assisted ventilation","pathogenesis","prematurity","human","genome","injury","genetics","genetic polymorphism","mitochondrial genome","*oxidizing agent","*mitochondrial DNA","*free radical","*DNA","oxygen","reactive oxygen metabolite","cell nucleus DNA"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"76","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"K.C.

BPD treatment often involves respiratory support with high oxygen, and oxidative stress is an adverse effect associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Genetic polymorphisms in a few candidate genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood. Understanding the role of genetics is critical to improving treatment strategies and reducing oxidant injury in developing lungs. The objective of this study was to utilize genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of quantitative phenotypes to identify susceptibility genes for neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. One day after birth, neonatal mice from 29 inbred strains were exposed for 72 hr to normoxia (20% oxygen) or hyperoxia (>95% oxygen). Hyperoxia induced phenotypes (inflammatory cells/histopathology) that are similar to BPD when compared to postnatal lung development in normoxia. We also found significant inter-strain variation in hyperoxia-induced nuclear and mitochondrial DNA lesions and mitochondrial copy number from lung homogenates after normoxia and hyperoxia. GWA mapping identified significant QTLs for normoxia-induced DNA lesions and mitochondrial copy number and for hyperoxia-induced DNA lesions. We also ultra-deep sequenced lung mitochondrial DNA from these mice and found strain-dependent sequence variations. We found 385 variants in the wild-derived inbred strain PWD/PhJ compared to C57BL/6J mice, including 1 found only with hyperoxia. We found higher variation frequency (1/32 bases) in the D-loop region compared to the rest of the mitochondrial genome (1/42 bases). We conclude that exposures to normoxia and hyperoxia early in life cause lesions in mouse lung mitochondrial and nuclear DNA that are strain dependent. through these combined approaches, we have identified novel candidate susceptibility genes that improve our understanding of neonatal lung injury and development.","group":"g3","id":"d6b75a3d-b78f-4abd-a47a-96d938324b0d","_showDetails":false},"0660ae51-9a79-456b-9037-5835a4a8f846":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71677068","title":"Association between cumulative iron exposure and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very low birth weight infants","authors":["Patel R.M.","Knezevic A.","Hinkes M.T.","Roback J.D.","Easley K.A.","Josephson C."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*exposure","*lung dysplasia","*very low birth weight","supplementation","infant","transfusion","risk","erythrocyte","birth weight","consensus","cohort analysis","statistical model","gestational age","therapy","air conditioning","disease severity","hypothesis","oxidative stress","enteric feeding","risk factor","iron overload","erythrocyte transfusion","*iron","caffeine"],"journal":"Transfusion","language":"English","volume":"54","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc.","isbn":"0041-1132","address":"R.M.

Unbound iron may lead to oxidative stress and contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The risk to BPD from greater amounts of cumulative supplemental iron exposure is unknown. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that VLBW infants exposed to a greater quantity of iron in the form of RBC transfusions and enteral supplementation will have a higher risk of BPD. Study Design/ Methods: A secondary, multicenter, observational cohort study used prospectively collected data from VLBW infants (<1500 g at birth). Elemental iron exposure was estimated based on total volume of RBCs transfused, assuming 1 mg of elemental iron per ml of RBC transfused, and from cumulative doses of enteral iron supplementation. BPD was defined according to the NIH consensus definition. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the association between iron exposure and BPD, after adjustment for potential confounding from type of enteral feeding, birth weight, illness severity, ventilation on the day of birth, caffeine therapy, days to regain birth weight, and medical center. Results/Findings: A total of 589 VLBW infants were evaluated. The median gestational age and birth weight of the cohort was 28 wk (interquartile range [IQR] 26-30 wk) and 1020 g (IQR 787- 1230 g), respectively. Eighty-four percent (492/589) of infants received enteral iron supplementation, and 55.3% (326/589) received at least one RBC transfusion. Cumulative iron exposure per infant was a median of 243 mg (IQR 99-477 mg), with 171 mg (IQR 43-452 mg) from enteral supplementation and 18 mg (IQR 0-57 mg) from RBC transfusion. The overall incidence of BPD was 40.1% (236/589). In multivariable analysis, the risk of BPD increased by 6% for every 100-mg increase in total iron exposure from enteral supplementation (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10; P = 0.003) and by 7% for every 20-mg increase in total iron exposure from RBC transfusion (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.09; P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this study, higher amounts of iron exposure from enteral supplementation and RBC transfusion were both independently associated with an increased risk of BPD in VLBW infants. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether limiting the dose of enteral iron supplementation, particularly among infants with high RBC transfusion burden, may lower the risk of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"0660ae51-9a79-456b-9037-5835a4a8f846","_showDetails":true},"81b7d0ae-c8c7-4b7b-ac9e-ddcbb12e6ad2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Trajectories of general movements from birth to term-equivalent age in infants born <30 weeks' gestation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2015.09.009","authors":["Olsen, Joy E","Brown, Nisha C","Eeles, Abbey L","Lee, Katherine J","Anderson, Peter J","Cheong, Jeanie L Y","Doyle, Lex W","Spittle, Alicia J"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20151027//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Intracranial Hemorrhages/di [Diagnosis]","Intracranial Hemorrhages/pp [Physiopathology]","Male","*Movement/ph [Physiology]","Pregnancy","Prospective Studies"],"journal":"Early human development","volume":"91","number":"12","isbn":"0378-3782","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26513629"],"address":"Ireland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: General movements (GMs) is an assessment with good predictive validity for neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. However, there is limited information describing the early GMs of very preterm infants, particularly prior to term., AIMS: To describe the early GMs trajectory of very preterm infants (born <30weeks' gestation) from birth to term-equivalent age, and to assess the influence of known perinatal risk factors on GMs., STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study., SUBJECTS: 149 very preterm infants born <30weeks' gestation., OUTCOME MEASURES: GMs were recorded weekly from birth until 32weeks' postmenstrual age, and then fortnightly until 38weeks' postmenstrual age. GMs were also assessed at term-equivalent age. Detailed perinatal data were collected., RESULTS: Of 669 GMs assessed, 551 were preterm and 118 were at term-equivalent age. Prior to term, 15% (n=82) of GMs were normal and 85% (n=469) were abnormal, with the proportion of abnormal GMs decreasing with increasing postmenstrual age (p for trend <0.001). By term-equivalent 30% (n=35) of GMs were normal. On univariable analysis, lower gestational age (p<0.001), postnatal infection (p<0.001) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p=0.001) were associated with abnormal GMs. Postnatal infection was the only independent perinatal association with abnormal GMs on multivariable analysis. All four infants with grade III/IV intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) had persistently abnormal GMs., CONCLUSIONS: GMs were predominantly abnormal in very preterm infants, with a higher proportion of normal GMs at term-equivalent age than prior to term.

Methods The study populations included preterm infants (gestational age <31 weeks) born during 1997-2013 in Oulu University Hospital and during 2010-2013 in other Finnish University Hospitals (Helsinki, K uopio, Tampere, Turku). DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome BeadChip consisting of approximately 550,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); after quality control, 60 cases (moderate-severe BPD) and 114 controls (no or mild BPD) remained for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In the next step, approximately 200 SNPs showing suggestive signals are genotyped in additional infants (n = 116/232) to determine which associations are replicated. Results In GWAS, we detected suggestive association signals (p < 1-4) for several SNPs; many of these SNPs were located within or near genes that can be considered as plausible candidate genes for BPD (e.g. the CRP and PTPN6 genes encoding C-reactive protein and protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, respectively). Some of the SNPs showing suggestive associations in two previous GWASs of BPD showed weak associations (e.g. those within the PALM2 and CTNNA3 genes).

Results Incidence of ROP was 24.8% among all screened VLBW. By univariate analysis, maternal risk factors for severe ROP were prolonged rupture of membrane (PROM), pyrexia, multiple births, tocolysis, fetal disress and vaginal delivery. Neonatal risk factors for ROP were, infant with lower gestational age than 25+/- 2 weeks (mean + SD), birth weight lesser than 689 +/- 147 gm (mean + SD), low Apgar scores, hyaline membrane disease (HMD) requiring surfactant, hypothermia, sepsis, hypotension, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), air-leak, hypoglycaemia, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) increased days on assisted ventilation, CPAP, Oxygen and high mean FiO2 and Chronic lung disease (CLD), are significant risk factors for ROP (p < 0.05).

NO (Nitric Oxide) which is produced along with L-Citrulline by the oxidation of L-Arginine and catalysed by three different isoforms of NOS (NOSynthase), is a short-lived free radical involved indiverse physiological and pathological processes. It consists of 3 types such as neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS and inducible NOS. All the NOS genes are expressed in airway epithelial cells and they are important for physiological functions in the airways. The aim of this study was to investigate possible association between eNOS gene polymorphism and development of BPD in preterm infants. Methods One hundred and twenty two blood samples DNA isolation was carried out using the PureLinkTM Genomic DNA Mini Kit and the concentration of the DNA samples was measured by nanophotometerImplen P 300. For the SNP analysis of eNOS (rs1799983) optimised primers were used. Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (QRT-PCR) was carried out in a CFX96 thermocycler. Chi-square chi2 test, Fisher's exact test, the odds ratio and confidence intervals were calculated for the comparisons of allelic and genotype frequencies. Results Comparison of the allele frequency distribution revealed the presence of G allele as a highly significant risk factor for development of BPD (p = 0.000*; OR 4.07, 95% CI 2.066-8.009) compared to the T allele. The distribution of the T allele in eNOS was found to be similarly distributed amongst BPD (51.9%) and healthy control groups (48.1%). This study demonstrated that the frequency of the GG genotype (25.37%) of the eNOSgene was higher in babies with BPD rather than TT (53.6%) and TG (59.4)genotype, when these genotypes were compared with the healthy control groups. No healthy infants were seen to carry the GG genotype (p = 0.000*; OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.514-2.148). The TT genotype (p = 0.019*, OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.180-0.870) also displayed a susceptibility fordeveloping BPD. Heterozygous TG genotype (p = 0.631; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.527-2.873) was not associated with the development of BPD. Conclusion To our best of knowledge, noinvestigation of the eNOS gene polymorphism has previously been documented in BPD. Thefindings of this study demonstrated that the GG genotype in eNOS gene was highly significant for BPD.","group":"g1","id":"d69f7e5e-7f4f-4374-bfb4-537b31108239","_showDetails":true},"86f493be-d300-4f35-8476-1e019f10acb1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71666438","title":"Mesenchymal stem-or stromal cells from the developing human lung are perturbed by hyperoxia","authors":["Mobius M.A.","Kos S.","Ohls R.K.","Rudiger M.","Thebaud B."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*human","*hyperoxia","*lung","*organization","*stroma cell","female","lung development","umbilical cord","atmosphere","fetus lung","lung dysplasia","stroma","pregnancy","risk factor","physiology","ambient air","extracellular matrix","mesenchyme","prematurity","oxygen concentration","stem cell","infant","colony forming unit","cytokine release","phenotype","exposure","oxygen","protein","hypocalcin","prostaglandin E2","gadolinium"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"99","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"M.A. Mobius, Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research Ottawa/Ontario/Canada, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany","urls":["http://adc.bmj.com/content/99/Suppl_2/A73.1.abstract?sid=b2e839b7-2889-46c7-890f-936a0d0147af","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed15&NEWS=N&AN=71666438"],"doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2014-307384.192","abstract":"Exposure of the immature lung to oxygen concentrations higher that the ones in utero - relative (room air) or absolute hyperoxia - represents a major risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Here, we isolated resident CD146pos./GD-2neg. mesenchymal stem- or stromal cells (MSCs) from human fetal lungs at the canalicular stage of development (16th-18th week of gestation) to obtain new insights into their behaviour in conditions reflecting normal (5% O2) and oxygen disrupted (21% and 60% O2) lung development. We compared them to potentially therapeutic MSCs isolated from the umbilical cord stroma. First, we were able to show that the mesenchyme of the fetal lung is abundant in MSCs, suggesting an important role of these cells in lung development. Single-cell plating of lung MSCs in physiological hypoxic and ambient oxygen atmospheres revealed profound reductions of colony-forming ability and colony size in normoxic conditions. Furthermore, when exposed to absolute hyperoxic (60% O2) atmospheres, MSCs lost ability to form colonies, reduced expression of stem cell-restricted proteins like Oct-4 and Sox2, proliferated and switched cytokine secretion profiles towards a pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory phenotype. Alterations in the composition of the extracellular matrix were observed. Conversely, MSCs from the umbilical cord secreted high amounts of anti-fibrotic and lung-protecting proteins like PGE2 and stanniocalcin-1. We conclude that the physiological function of resident lung MSCs is affected by relative and absolute hyperoxia, suggesting a key role of these cells in the immature lung responding to extrauterine oxygen conditions.","group":"g2","id":"86f493be-d300-4f35-8476-1e019f10acb1","_showDetails":true},"c5c66871-18e7-4020-8fa0-6a3c8682d186":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71666322","title":"Longitudinal developmental effects of the infant behavioural assessment and intervention program in very low birth weight infants","authors":["Van Hus J.","Jeukens-Visser M.","Koldewijn K.","Holman R.","Kok J.H.","Nollet F.","Van Wassenaer-Leemhuis A."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*very low birth weight","*organization","*infant","human","motor development","cognitive development","child","risk","lung dysplasia","Bayley Scales of Infant Development","follow up","model","Movement Assessment Battery for Children","Wechsler intelligence scale","education","child development"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"99","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"J.

Longitudinal effects were not analysed yet. AIM To investigate the longitudinal effects of the IBAIP in VLBW infants on cognitive and motor development. Methods In a RCT, 86 VLBW infants received the IBAIP until 6 months CA, 90 VLBW infants received standard care. At 6, 12, and 24 months CA, cognitive and motor development were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. At 5.5 years CA the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children were used. Longitudinal data were analysed with linear mixed models in total group and three subgroups, using Z-scores generated from raw cognitive and motor scores. Results A significant intervention effect (0.4SD) on motor development was found (p = 0.006). On cognitive development, a non-significant intervention effect over time was found (p = 0.063). In children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) significant intervention effects were found for both cognitive (effect=0.7SD; p = 0.019) and motor (effect=0.9SD; p = 0.026) outcome. Maternal education hardly influenced intervention effects over time, but in children with combined biological and social risks a longitudinal intervention effect of 0.8SD was found on cognitive development (p = 0.044).

Dosage, because clearance is lower in neonates, but also because there is extensive between-individual variability in clearance in the first months of life. Pharmaceutical forms, because formulations need to account for dosage variability, but also to the clinical characteristics of neonates. The need for an appropriate balance between dose, volume, drug manipulations and dose flexibility in neonates calls for dedicated, tailored formulations. Besides the active compound (s), drug formulations contain solvents and additives, usually referred as 'excipients', needed as co-solvents, surfactants (general term for compounds that improve absorption, unrelated to the lung surfactant administered for hyaline membrane disease), preservatives, colourants and/or sweeteners. These excipients are added e.g. to ensure stability over a given shelf life, to improve palatability or to facilitate solubility or to bulk up formulations that otherwise contain highly potent active ingredients and are referred to as preservatives, sweeteners, fillers and solvents, coating materials or colouring agents. Consequently, during the development of these formulations, there is a need to quantify and limit excipient exposure based on the currently available knowledge on their safety or toxicity. Furthermore, focused studies on the clinical pharmacology of excipients in neonates should be conducted, and its feasibility will be illustrated by the propylene glycol research project. Finally, until tailored vials and formulations become available, compounding practices for drug formulations in neonates should be evaluated to guarantee the correct dosing, product stability and safety.","group":"g1","id":"eb3af3f8-6e01-4893-9105-6c5105e23b56","_showDetails":true},"e875181e-60ae-4205-9637-dd38b4fe6645":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71666264","title":"New therapies for pulmonary hypertension and BPD-from bench to bedside","authors":["Kourembanas S.","Sdrimas K.","Lee C.J.","Hansmann G.","Fernandez-Gonzalez A.","Mitsialis S.A."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*pulmonary hypertension","*organization","*therapy","exosome","pH","model","mesenchymal stem cell","murine model","hyperoxia","lung dysplasia","survival","inflammation","injury","hypoxia","membrane component","macrophage","diseases","lung","nucleic acid","protein"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"99","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"S.

The active moieties that confer the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs remain elusive but likely include secreted proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane components, all potentially packaged in MSC-released microvesicles. We have shown that such particles, a class of which is represented by exosomes, convey the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in the murine hypoxic model of PH. Exosome treatment was also able to abrogate early hypoxic macrophage influx and downregulate hypoxia-activated inflammatory pathways, thus recapitulating the well-characterised, anti-inflammatory properties of MSCs. The clinical use of MSCs in several on-going trials or the MSC secretome (e.g. exosomes) is a budding new field that represents an exciting and promising approach to therapeutic interventions for diseases of the lung.","group":"g1","id":"e875181e-60ae-4205-9637-dd38b4fe6645","_showDetails":true},"02b7ad69-2361-4e57-90df-1187e3e73142":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023 to 2024>","title":"Development of a blood proteins-based model for bronchopulmonary dysplasia prediction in premature infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12887-023-04065-3","authors":["Ou, Wanting","Lei, KeJing","Wang, Huanhuan","Ma, Hongmei","Deng, Xiaojuan","He, Pengcheng","Zhao, Liping","Lv, Youdao","Tang, Guohong","Zhang, Benjin","Li, Jie"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230617//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Infant","Humans","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Gestational Age","Infant, Premature","Blood Proteins/ge [Genetics]","ROC Curve"],"journal":"BMC pediatrics","volume":"23","number":"1","isbn":"1471-2431","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med24&NEWS=N&AN=37330491"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic pulmonary disease in premature infants.

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential protein analysis were carried out for variable dimensionality reduction and feature selection. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were conducted for BPD prediction model development. The performance of the model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve., RESULTS: The results showed that black module, magenta module and turquoise module, which included 270 proteins, were significantly correlated with the occurrence of BPD. 59 proteins overlapped between differential analysis results and above three modules. These proteins were significantly enriched in 253 GO terms and 11 KEGG signaling pathways. Then, 59 proteins were reduced to 8 proteins by LASSO analysis in the training cohort. The proteins model showed good BPD predictive performance, with an AUC of 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.00) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-1.00) in training cohort and test cohort, respectively., CONCLUSION: Our study established a reliable blood-protein based model for early prediction of BPD in premature infants.

The two major sources of oxidants during intensive care stay are oxygen and parenteral nutrition (PN) which is contaminated with peroxides.

FiO2 >=25 on day 7 and 28 of life and PN duration >14 days resulted in higher GSSG concentration and more oxidized redox potential at 36 weeks CA indicating prolonged oxidative stress. FiO2 >=25 early on life and PN duration >14 days increased the incidence of BPD, significant ROP and NEC (Table 1). Conclusion(s): Early life exposure to oxidants is associated with prolonged oxidative stress and higher incidence of oxidative stress-related diseases. These results suggest that strategies targeting judicious O2 use and either decreasing the duration or using safer formulation PN will help decreasing the incidence of BPD, ROP and NEC.

We recently approached exome sequencing for identification of genetic variants predisposing to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is the most common chronic lung disease in infancy affecting preterm children with a very low birth weight. BPD has a multifactorial aetiology and until now the genetic bases are mostly unknown. Several association studies were previously performed but they had a limited statistical power and few of these data have been replicated. In this study we planned a pilot exome sequencing analysis aimed to the identification of genetic factors underlying BPD in Italian preterm newborns, collected with the collaborative efforts of 12 Italian centres of Neonatal Intensive Care. METHOD(S): As a pilot study, we performed the exome analysis of 26 severely-affected BPD cases and of 5 individuals, previously analysed for certain genes in our lab using Sanger sequencing. The sequencing was performed on Illumina Hi-Seq2000. To manage the sequencing data, we used an automated bioinformatics pipeline, mapping reads versus the hg19 reference and filtering them on Broad Institute's latest algorithms. Polyphen 2 and Sift were used for the pathogenic prediction analysis and the prioritization study was performed with ToppGene Suite. RESULT(S): At first, data obtained using NGS have been validated with a quality analysis and with a comparison to known Sanger results. Only samples with a mean coverage15X were taken into account. We identified 3369 novel variants, with a median of 400 variations per sample, and 1524 were predicted probably damaging using the two principal pathogenic prediction tools. Moreover, looking for potentially candidate genes, we highlighted especially APOE and NOS2 using ToppGene for pathway analysis. These variants are being confirmed with Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSION(S): Today a further validation of these data is needed, with functional studies and with study segregation in families. Moreover, since the good results obtained from this pilot study, we are encourage to go on with the exome sequencing of all severe BPD cases collected.","group":"g2","id":"4ee2c846-bf8e-48ad-99f6-49577b1cb7f8","_showDetails":true},"b6f10308-d868-4309-b219-84dbed1b86ba":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71531055","title":"Next generation sequence analysis of the transcriptional response to neonatal hyperoxia","authors":["Bhattacharya S.","Zhou Z.","Yee M.","Lopez A.","Lunger V.","Buczynski B.","Pryhuber G.","Mariani T.","OReilly M."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*human genetics","*human","*hyperoxia","*Indian","*society","*sequence analysis","gene","mouse","lung","lung parenchyma","exposure","pathology","algorithm","lung development","rodent model","lung dysplasia","extracellular matrix","implantable cardioverter defibrillator","inflammation","newborn","morbidity","liver fibrosis","oxidative stress","polymerase chain reaction","oxygen concentration","premature labor","shrimp","ambient air","transcriptome","oxygen","sildenafil","protein p53","RNA"],"journal":"Molecular Cytogenetics","language":"English","volume":"7","number":"SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd.","isbn":"1755-8166","address":"S.

BPD is a debilitating condition characterized by inflammation, enlarged airspaces, vascular dysmorphia and aberrant extracellular matrix accumulation that is typically described as arrested lung development. Rodent models involving neonatal exposure to excessive oxygen concentrations (hyperoxia) have been used to study the mechanisms contributing to BPD pathology. Transcriptomic assessment of the effects of hyperoxia in neonatal mouse lungs using RNASeq will help to identify genes and pathways associated with BPD. Material(s) and Method(s): Whole lung tissue from newborn C57BL/6 mice exposed to 100% oxygen for 10 days (n=8) and room air-exposed age matched controls (n=6) were compared. Total RNA was isolated from individual whole lung tissues (n=14) and pooled in duplicates to perform transcriptome Sequencing (RNA-seq). Alignments were generated using multiple algorithms (CASAVA; TopHat; and SHRiMP). Raw counts obtained from each alignment algorithm (using HT-Seq) were further and filtered to remove undetected genes. Differentially expressed genes were detected using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and CuffDiff2, on each version of mapped and normalized data. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for pathway and network analyses. Expression patterns for selected genes were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Result(s): 248 genes were identified as differentially expressed between hyperoxia and control samples by both SAM (median FDR = 0) and CuffDiff2 (p<0.05) and had a fold-change <= 2. We successfully validated 17 of 24 genes by qPCR. Canonical pathways significantly dysregulated in hyperoxia lungs included Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress signaling, p53 signaling, hepatic fibrosis and sildenafil pathways. Interestingly most genes significantly affected following hyperoxia exposure (~70%) showed a pattern of expression consistent with an arrest in lung development. A subset of the genes dysregulated in hyperoxic neonatal mouse lungs, were also differentially expressed in human BPD lung tissue. Conclusion(s): We have identified genes dysregulated in mouse of BPD-like pathology. Further analysis of these data will enhance our current knowledge of BPD, and may be useful for developing novel therapeutic strategies.","group":"g3","id":"b6f10308-d868-4309-b219-84dbed1b86ba","_showDetails":true},"f8b7fe27-f79d-4ad5-b493-6f132b7470d2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71527995","title":"The state of non-specific resistance factors in small airways diseases of bronchial tubes in children","authors":["Mustafayev I."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*R factor","*airway","*diseases","*bronchial tube","*child","*human","*pulmonology","phagocytosis","neutrophil","granulocyte","remission","patient","lung dysplasia","bronchiolitis obliterans","intoxication","asthma","nitroblue tetrazolium test","virus infection"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"49","number":"SUPPL. 37","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.","isbn":"8755-6863","address":"I.

The original cases, now termed \"old\" BPD, were the results of aggressive ventilation strategies in relatively large, premature infants. Over the years, the quality of ventilatory treatment in neonatal care has improved (due to e.g. introduction of antenatal steroids and surfactant replacement). Clinically, however, only the incidence of severe BPD has decreased while the overall incidence of BPD has remained constant. [1] The increasing rates of survival among the smallest of premature infants, contribute to an increase in the incidence of the so-called \"new\" BPD. New BPD is closely associated with low gestational age and low birth weight. The most prominent features of new BPD are disruption of lung development, with decreased septation and alveolar hypoplasia leading to fewer and larger alveoli and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. A recent systematic review of the published literature of general and respiratory health outcomes in adult survivors of BPD showed that survivors of BPD experience more problems during childhood, adolescence and adult age when compared to children born preterm without BPD as well as when compared to healthy controls. [2] These problems emerge in different areas of functioning. We will successively describe pulmonary outcome, neurodevelopment outcome and growth and nutritional problems at school age and beyond. Pulmonary Outcome at school age and beyond Chest symptoms and pulmonary function abnormalities have been found in children as well as in adolescents and young adults with a history of \"old\" and \"new\" BPD. The symptoms are often described as recurrent episodes of wheezing, cough and reduced exercise tolerance (compared to peers). [2,3] Additionally, children with BPD describe symptoms due to airway hyperresponsiveness to exercise, that improve after bronchodilator administration. The pulmonary function abnormalities consist of airway obstruction, airway hyper reactivity and hyperinflation as well as an exercise restriction. [2] Some children with BPD have a lower diffusion capacity. [2] The prevalence of airway hyperreactivity is not different from that of children born prematurely without BPD. Children with BPD who have demonstrable airway hyperreactivity do not have elevated levels of exhaled nitric oxide (a marker for eosinophil-driven inflammation) or an increased incidence of atopy. [4] Therefore, although children with BPD and children with asthma have similar symptoms, the underlying pathophysiology of these two diseases seems to be different. The lungs recovered from older childhood and adult survivors of BPD demonstrate airway wall thickening similar to individuals with asthma. In addition there aremorphologic changes noted on CT scans of the chest, which are compatible with a diagnosis of fixed peripheral airway narrowing (see below).[2,5] Children with asthmalike symptoms due to BPD may respond to inhaled corticosteroids, but the effect is less consistent than in children with asthma [6]. The majority of children with BPD show abnormalities on the CT-scan, including linear and triangular opacities, mosaic perfusion, air-trapping and/ or multifocal emphysema, and bronchial wall thickening both in the first year of life and at older age [2,5]. Cardiovascular complications Because of increased vascular resistance in the lungs, children with BPD may develop right ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy is also seen, possibly associated with systemic hypertension which is commonly found in children with BPD. [7] A rare but serious complication is the development of pulmonary artery hypertension and the resultant right heart failure (cor pulmonale).[7] The incidence and prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in these infants, its risk factors and the outcome of BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension are insufficiently known. Little is known about the characteristics and outcomes of BPD-associated pulmonary artery hypertension in the current era. Severe BPD complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension is associated with an increased early mortality rate. In survivors, a recent global pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Registry suggests that BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension is still present several years after birth and is associated with significant morbidity [8]. Neurodevelopmental Children with BPD (compared with those without BPD) are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. Underdeveloped motor skills, both gross and fine, occur more often in patients with BPD Some studies show that more than one-half of the (severe) BPD group have abnormalities of gross and/or fine motor skills at 10 years of age. More attention deficit problems are seen and children with BPD are more often diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). [9] Children with BPD have a lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and usually have more problems with progression at school. Feeding and growth Problems with growth and nutrition are common directly after birth, but are also seen later in childhood. Some studies found that growth remains delayed at older age, but more recent studies have found no difference in growth when correcting for confounders. [10] Various study designs have been used to study specific effects of BPD in children, adolescents and adults. It is currently unclear whether these provide a complete survey of relevant problems. This makes it difficult to ensure that long term follow up, which is of special importance in neonatal disorders, captures all aspects of medical, psychological and social importance to these patients. In general, an important finding from review of the adult literature is the relative absence of studies to determine nonpulmonary outcomes and consequently there is a need for a multidisciplinary research in this population.","group":"g1","id":"727b574b-73a8-4fa8-9edf-48767ab7b9e8","_showDetails":true},"69a3edd7-336b-4ffa-9480-4cacc6cb79a9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71527957","title":"Optimal management of neonatal lung diseases using current technologies","authors":["Kugelman A."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*implantable cardioverter defibrillator","*technology","*pulmonology","*lung disease","infant","air conditioning","intubation","extubation","human","respiratory distress syndrome","newborn apnea","artificial ventilation","prematurity","extremely low birth weight","positive end expiratory pressure","pregnancy","meta analysis","ventilator","risk","endotracheal intubation","baby","breathing","newborn intensive care","intensive care unit","assisted ventilation","lung function test","intermittent positive pressure ventilation","death","gas","delivery room","lung dysplasia","resuscitation","noninvasive ventilation","health care quality","apnea","risk reduction","risk factor","lung insufficiency","heart rate","lung mechanics","respiratory drive","nasal prong","wrist","pulse oximetry","neonatal respiratory distress syndrome","devices","cesarean section","pH","hypercapnia","endotracheal tube","oxygenation","learning curve","morbidity","upper respiratory tract","thorax wall","cerebral palsy","premature labor","maturation","lung","follow up","corticosteroid therapy","randomized controlled trial (topic)","liquid","gestational age","trachea","catheter","adverse drug reaction","high frequency ventilation","prospective study","safety","conditioning","energy cost","survival","lung dead space","nutrition","nasal cannula","general condition","personnel","surfactant","steroid","oxygen","caffeine","carbon dioxide"],"journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","language":"English","volume":"49","number":"SUPPL. 37","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.","isbn":"8755-6863","address":"A.

The EuroNeoNet figures for 2010 showan incidence of 92% at 24-25 weeks' gestation, 88% at 26-27 weeks, 76% at 28-29 weeks and 57% at 30-31 weeks.1 The aim of management of RDS is to provide interventions that will maximize survival whilst minimizing potential adverse effects.1 Prenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended in all pregnancies with threatened preterm labor below 34 weeks' gestation. In pregnancies delivering between 34 and 36 weeks prenatal steroids do not appear to improve outcome, although when given before elective caesarean section at term they reduce the risk of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, albeit with a high number needed to treat.1 At delivery, the term stabilization is preferred to resuscitation for the vast majority of very preterm infants. Only a minority of babies should require delivery room intubation. If intubation is required, the correct placement of the endotracheal tube can be quickly verified using a colorimetric CO2 detection device before administering surfactant and starting mechanical ventilation. A concentration of 21-30% oxygen is appropriate to start stabilization and adjustments up or down should be guided by applying pulse oximetry to the right wrist from birth to give information on heart rate and saturation. Neopuff can be helpful in the delivery room and the transport to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and enables the administration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and intermittent positive pressure ventilation under controlled condition. Recent large trials that reflect current practice (including greater utilization of maternal steroids and routine post delivery stabilization on NCPAP) demonstrate less risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death when using early stabilization on NCPAP with selective surfactant administration to infants requiring intubation. The comprehensive strategy to prevent BPD in the NICU is based on ventilatory and non-ventilatory measures.2 The ventilatory route allows an individualized endotracheal intubation approach. Recent studies concluded that early nasal CPAP (NCPAP) is a safe alternative to immediate intubation in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.3,4 Endotracheal intubation and ventilation can result in significant damage to premature lungs and are independently associated with cerebral palsy. Furthermore, despite new modes of ventilation and surfactant, BPD remains a significant morbidity and its incidence was correlated with the use and length of endotracheal mechanical ventilation. BPD in itself is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Thus, we need to avoid endotracheal ventilation, if possible. The use of NCPAP requires experience, and learning curves show improved outcomes in rates of BPD. When the infant requires nasal respiratory support (NRS), we should aim for adequate oxygenation (SpO2 of 90-95%),1 permissive hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 45-55mm Hg, pH >7.22) and gentle ventilation, similarly as on endotracheal ventilation.1,2 NCPAP is recommended as the early primary treatment of active respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (to avoid intubation or as part of the INSURE [INtubation SURfactant Extubation] approach), or later, post extubation at RDS resolution, in order to allow shortening of the duration of endotracheal ventilation and to treat apnea of prematurity.1 New studies3,4 report comparable rates of BPD in ELBW infants treated initially with NCPAP as compared to endotracheal ventilation with surfactant administration. Can we enhance NCPAP and get better outcome for NRS by using nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)? NIPPV was defined as a method of augmenting NCPAP by delivering ventilator breaths via nasal prongs. The rationale behind the use of NIPPV is the administration of \"sigh\" to the infant, thus opening microatelectasis and recruiting more ventilation units. It was shown that synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV) compared with NCPAP may improve the patency of the upper airway, could activate the respiratory drive, improves thoraco-abdominal synchrony, stabilizes the chest wall, improves lung mechanics and decreases the work of breathing in premature infants. When NIPPV was compared to NCPAP for the different indications of NRS, it was shown to enhance the potential of NRS. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a relative risk reduction for intubation in the first 72 hours in the NIPPV group compared with NCPAP (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43, 0.83).5 The NIPPV trial6 was a large international multicenter randomized trial powered to study the important outcome of BPD, recruiting 1,009 extremely low birth weight babies, and it showed no difference between babies randomized to NIPPV compared with CPAP. Yet, the results of this study should be considered with caution because of several limitations. For example: There was no uniform experience and equipment used for NIPPV among participating centers; approximately 50% of the infants were supported with biphasic CPAP that is a limited form of NIPPV (maximal peak inspiratory pressure of 9-10 cm H2O in that study). SNIPPV vs. NCPAP for later use, post extubation at RDS resolution, as a \"bridge\" to spontaneous unsupported breathing was shown to be more effective than NCPAP. A pooled meta-analysis showed that SNIPPV was more effective than NCPAP in preventing failure of extubation [RR 0.21 (0.10, 0.45)] and the number needed to treat was only 3 infants to prevent one extubation failure.7 SNIPPV vs. NCPAP, post extubation, also tended to decrease the rate of BPD. SNIPPV may be more effective than NCPAP also for apnea of prematurity.2 A meta-analysis, regarding apnea of prematurity, suggests that SNIPPV is more efficacious with apnea that is frequent or severe. However, the studies performed addressed short-term outcomes and as such could not address properly the incidence of requirement for reintubation. Thus, more studies are needed before recommending SNIPPV as standard of care for apnea of prematurity. While non-invasive ventilation is probably safe, its success depends on gestational age. The data indicate that surfactant may still have a significant role in the treatment of RDS, especially in ELBWinfants. Recently, Morley et al3 and the SUPPORT study4 reported on an intubation rate of ~ 50% in their NCPAP group in ELBW infants. This leads us to the INSURE approach. This approach may allow the infant to benefit from both, surfactant and NRS. A Cochrane review,8 concluded that the INSURE approach with NCPAP compared with later selective surfactant administration, continued mechanical ventilation, and extubation from low respiratory support was associated with less need for mechanical ventilation, lower incidence of BPD and fewer air leak syndromes. Another option for surfactant application to the trachea without endotracheal intubation was described by using a thin catheter in spontaneously breathing preterm infants receiving NCPAP. This technique was reported to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.9 There are ongoing trials with inhaled surfactant. To summarize, the available evidence supports the preference of early or later use of NIPPV/SNIPPV compared to NCPAP because of minimizing the use and the length of endotracheal ventilation.2 There are data to suggest that this approach may also reduce the rate of BPD, however this was not shown yet.2 The results of a large international RCT comparing both primary, and post-extubation use of NIPPV with NCPAP, with a composite primary outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' corrected age indicate no additional benefit, or risk, conferred by NIPPV in comparison to NCPAP.6 Whether NIPPV/SNIPPV is more beneficial than NCPAP within the INSURE approach needs to be shown. Recently, heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) is frequently used as a mode of NRS. High flows result in washout of anatomical and physiological dead space and contribute to improved fractions of alveolar gases with respect to carbon dioxide as well as oxygen and decrease the work of breathing and the energy cost of gas conditioning. HHHFNC probably creates positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) that may contribute to its beneficial effect. However, the PEEP that is not monitored, had raised concerns regarding the safety of HHHFNCin terms of air leak. Recent prospective studies support the notion that HHHFNC is as effective as NCPAP for early stages of RDS, post extubation10 and for apnea of prematurity. Yet, more studies, especially in the initial treatment of RDS and in ELBW infants, are needed before adopting HHHFNC as an alternative mode of NRS in these conditions. New modes of NRS such as neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA), and nasal high frequency ventilation, need to be further studied before concluding on benefits for the short and long term outcomes in premature infants. Non-ventilatory measures in the treatment of RDS, such as caffeine, nutrition, fluid and PDA management and postnatal steroids in certain conditions should be included in the care of premature infants with RDS in order to minimize the rate of BPD.1,2 The noninvasive ventilator strategy needs to be confirmed by large prospective randomized controlled trials (with long-term follow up) in order to assure it is applicable to most ELBW infants. Furthermore, the strategy needs to be tailored to individualized infants according to the infant's maturation; antenatal steroid treatment and severity of RDS; general condition; and to certain practical NICU conditions such as experience, personnel and timing during the day.","group":"g1","id":"69a3edd7-336b-4ffa-9480-4cacc6cb79a9","_showDetails":true},"eab25f09-f58d-453b-94d5-c8f90789806b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71505250","title":"Neonatal physiological correlates of neurodevelopment at 18-22 months in very-low-birthweight preterm children","authors":["Rose J.","Cahill-Rowley K.","Vassar R.","Tamaresis J.","Hintz S.R.","Stevenson D.K."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*nerve cell differentiation","*prematurity","*human","*lung dysplasia","*risk factor","*very low birth weight","*child","*perinatal care","*infant","gait","newborn","velocity","gestational age","quality of life","bilirubin blood level","serum","limb","toddler","Bayley Scales of Infant Development","birth weight","blood level","sepsis","retrolental fibroplasia","necrotizing enterocolitis","C reactive protein","albumin","bilirubin","serum albumin","biological marker"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"J.

We hypothesized that preterm infants exposed to neonatal inflammatory risk factors would demonstrate lower neurodevelopment based on BSID-III and gait scores at 18-22 months. Material(s) and Method(s): 102 VLBW preterm neonates (BW<=1500g, gestational age (GA) <=32wks) admitted to the NICU were recruited to participate from 2010-2011. Neonatal physiological risk factors examined included GA at birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and sepsis, as well as serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and total bilirubin during the first two weeks of life. Neurodevelopment was assessed at 18-22 months adjusted age with the Bayley Scales of Infant-Toddler Development, 3rd edition (BSIDIII). Gait velocity and% single limb support (SLS) were assessed using a GAIT Rite mat. Collinearity was estimated by calculating variance inflation factors (VIF). Two-tailed significance was defined as p<0.05. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: Among the 102 neonates, BW was 1087 +/- 279g, GA-at-birth was 28.7 +/- 2.4 wks.

Mean BSID-III cognitive composite scores were lower in children with neonatal BPD (91.7 +/- 11.6 versus 97.6 +/- 12.6, p = 0.013). Lower BSID-III cognitive composite scores correlated with higher neonatal mean and peak serum CRP (Rho =-0.298, p = 0.008; Rho =-0.325, p = 0.002), respectively. Lower BSID-III motor composite and fine-motor scores correlated with higher mean CRP (Rho =-0.264, p = 0.013; Rho =-0.292, p = 0.008) and peak CRP (Rho =-0.275, p = 0.009; Rho =-0.262, p = 0.013), respectively. Slower gait velocity correlated with higher mean and peak CRP (Rho =-0.298, p = 0.008; Rho =-0.279, p = 0.013). Higher mean and peak CRP correlated with lower serum albumin (Rho =-0.338, p = 0.001; Rho =-0.398, p = 0.000). Lower BSID-III motor composite score correlated with lower neonatal mean serum albumin (Rho = 0.262, p = 0.013) and to higher serum bilirubin (Rho = 0.230, p = 0.029). Risk factors analyzed were found to be noncollinear (VIF<10). Conclusion(s): Low to moderate associations found between neonatal inflammatory risk factors in relation to neurodevelopment and gait at 18-22 months of age suggest associations between early neurodevelopmental outcomes and biomarkers including neonatal BPD, CRP, albumin, and bilirubin warrant further investigation. Preliminary analysis of this ongoing research may offer neonatal clues that may ultimately inform neuroprotective treatment to improve neurodevelopment and quality of life for preterm children.","group":"g1","id":"eab25f09-f58d-453b-94d5-c8f90789806b","_showDetails":true},"6e417025-3eda-4c07-ae10-48abac49428e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71505199","title":"Importance of vitamin a for lung maturation and function","authors":["Biesalski H.K."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*fetus lung maturation","*perinatal care","*supplementation","female","human","pregnancy","lung","maternal plasma","umbilical cord blood","maturation","animal experiment","retinol deficiency","diabetes mellitus","protein synthesis","chronic disease","lung development","vaginal delivery","child","newborn","pilot study","prematurity","blood","infant","colostrum","lung dysplasia","consensus","population","smoking","gestation period","metabolite","premature labor","fetus lung","gene expression","risk","inhalation","Germany","World Health Organization","*retinol","carotene","retinoic acid","vitamin","surfactant","protein"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"H.K.

On average, intake should be one third higher during pregnancy and during the breastfeeding period it should be 0.7 mg/day higher than for nonpregnant or non-breastfeeding women. Based on studies in Germany and the US inadequate vitamin A supply (30% below recommendation) is evident in females in 45-65%. Due to the importance of the (Figure presented) vitamin for lung development and maturation, sufficient intake should be especially ensured during the second and third pregnancy trimesters.In different studies it was shown that the risk of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in preterm infants showing insufficient vitamin A supply is significantly increased. Material(s) and Method(s): The study was conducted as a cross sectional pilot study. 23 women with single conception pregnancy within short birthrates defined as second delivery within 24 months were recruited consecutively at the Universitatsfrauenklinik Ulm between September 03 and August 04. Additionaly 6 women with gemini birth were enrolled to the study. Participants were healthy with absence of chronic disease during pregnancy (gestational diabetics), aged between 20 and 40, normal delivery, full term gestational period (>36 + 0) and smoking less than 5 cigarettes/day. Women were eligible to be enrolled to the study if prenatal no supplementation with>2000 IE/day vitamin A nor with beta-carotene>2 mg/day occurred. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: The frequency distribution of maternal plasma retinol showed that 27.5% of the study population had levels below 1.4 mumol/L which can be taken as a boarderline deficiency near to the deficiency range (<1.05 mumol/L) according to WHO (REF). In one case the retinol level was in a clear vitamin A deficiency range (0.66 mumol/L).It becomes evident, that in cases of multiparous birth mean values of retinol and beta-carotene were significantly lower in samples of maternal plasma (p<0.05) and colostrum (p<0.0001) for retinol. Mean cord blood concentration was 0.51 umol which was significantly lower than the borderline to inadequacy of 0.7umol. There is no clear consensus on the \"cut-off\" concentration for vitamin A deficiency in cord blood. Levels below 0.35 and 0.7mumol/L are discussed. Taking 0.35 mumol/L as cut off levels, 31% of newborn showed levels below. Conclusion(s): Despite a good scioeconomic status vitamin A supply in pregenant females was below the recommended intake and with consequences for the supply of the developing child. There is clear evidence from human and animal studies that the lung needs vitamin A during the last 3-4 weeks prior delivery for adequate maturation (e.g. surfactant protein synthesis). The active metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid, which controls gene expression of a couple of important proteins in the lung, is delivered from specific vitamin A stores in the lung. If vitamin A stores in the embryonic lungs are not formed at the beginning of the last trimester the formation of retinoic acid in the lung might be inadequate. This raises the question how vitamin A status might be improved in particular in cases of preterm birth. In animal experiments we tested different supply routes (parenteral, inhalation) to elucidate how we can increase the vitamin A concentration in the lung. Whether this might be an approach for humans needs to be discussed.","group":"g1","id":"6e417025-3eda-4c07-ae10-48abac49428e","_showDetails":true},"deaaf9f7-e288-4a2d-b691-e849491d106a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"MicroRNA expression profiles and target prediction in neonatal Wistar rat lungs during the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2015.2347","authors":["Xing, Yujiao","Fu, Jianhua","Yang, Haiping","Yao, Li","Qiao, Lin","Du, Yanna","Xue, Xindong"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150917//","keywords":["Animals","*Animals, Newborn/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","*MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/ge [Genetics]","Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","Rats","Rats, Wistar"],"journal":"International journal of molecular medicine","volume":"36","number":"5","isbn":"1107-3756","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26398774"],"address":"Greece","abstract":"In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) regulate lung development after birth, as well as the role of miRNAs in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). For this purpose, a total of 90 neonatal Wistar rats were randomly and equally assigned to either a model group or a control group. On postnatal days 3, 7 and 14, the lung tissues were collected for histological analysis to determine morphological changes. The expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, also known as CD31) were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. A miRCURY TM LNA array was employed to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs, and the possible target genes of those miRNAs were predicted. Our results revealed that, compared with the control group, the following changes induced by hyperoxia were observed in the model group over time: a decrease in the number, but an increase in the size of the alveoli, and a decrease in the number of secondary septa formed. In the model group, from postnatal days 3-14, the mRNA and protein expression levels of PCNA and CD31 were significantly lower than those in the control group. The differentially expressed miRNAs between the 2 groups were identified on days 3, 7 and 14 after birth. Possible target genes were identified for 32 differentially expressed miRNAs. Taken together, these findings suggest that during the development of BPD, an alveolarization disorder with microvascular dysplasia co-exists with the differential expression of certain miRNAs during the different stages of alveolar development in a neonatal rat model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. This indicates that miRNAs may participate in the occurrence and development of BPD.","group":"g3","id":"deaaf9f7-e288-4a2d-b691-e849491d106a","_showDetails":true},"215af87a-fd31-4ecc-a98b-a8eb8d1fd68c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71504983","title":"Evaluation of association between adam33 gene polymorphism and suspectibility to bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants","authors":["Cetinkaya M.","Varturk I.","Korachi M.A.","Akin I.M.","Guven S.","Buyukkale G.","Erener-Ercan T.","Ozumut S."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*DNA polymorphism","*perinatal care","*prematurity","*human","*infant","genotype","gestational age","lung function","female","diseases","wheezing","asthma","hospital","Apgar score","artificial ventilation","morbidity","blood sampling","gene","airway remodeling","pregnancy","birth weight","embryo","prospective study","intensive care unit","newborn intensive care","lung development","extracellular matrix","national health organization","oxygen therapy","risk","risk factor","gene frequency","child","allele","control group","patient","airway resistance","pathogenesis","disintegrin","glycoprotein","surfactant","metalloproteinase","genomic DNA","DNA"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"M.

It was suggested to be important for normal lung development in the embryo as the expression of ADAM 33 can be observed as early as 8-12 weeks after gestation. Although several studies have demonstrated an association between ADAM33 and asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, progression of wheezing illness, airway remodelling, lower lung functions, accelerated lung function decline and higher specific airway resistance in children, no study evaluated the role of ADAM33 in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between ADAM33 gene polymorphism and susceptibility to BPD development. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 120 preterm infants born at gestational age <= 32 weeks and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) were enrolled to this prospective study. BPD was defined according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Detailed perinatal history (birth weight, gestational age, Apgar score at 1, and 5 min after birth) and history of treatment in the hospital (duration of mechanical ventilation and total oxygen therapy, need of surfactant treatment, other morbidities) were recorded during the study period. Blood samples were stored at <= 20 degreeC. Genomic DNA was extracted from these samples. ADAM33 gene at rs 2280090 was analyzed. Allelic frequencies and genotype frequencies were determined from BPD patients and healthy controls. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: A total of 120 preterm infants were enrolled. The frequency of AA genotype and GG genotype were significantly higher than those of GA genotype in infants with BPD compared with the infants without BPD. Comparison of the frequency distribution of ADAM 33 in BPD and healthy control groups revealed the presence of A allele was a risk factor for BPD infants. The homozygos AA and GG genotypes were found to be associated with BPD development. Conclusion(s): To our best of knowledge, this is the first study that suggested a possible association between ADAM33 gene polymorphism and increased frequency of BPD in preterm infants. Future studies are needed to assess the contribution of ADAM 33 to the pathogenesis of BPD and to determine if ADAM 33 gene polymorphisms may be helpful to identify infants at high risk for BPD.","group":"g1","id":"215af87a-fd31-4ecc-a98b-a8eb8d1fd68c","_showDetails":true},"9976a5fa-416e-4902-b0ee-f441ebea5c61":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71504967","title":"CYP2B6 genetic polymorphism and the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm neonates","authors":["Daraki A.","Gavrili S.","Zachaki S.","Boudouvi E.","Baroutis D.","Polycarpou E.","Manola K.N.","Baroutis G."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*genetic polymorphism","*genetic susceptibility","*DNA polymorphism","*prematurity","*human","*risk","*newborn","*perinatal care","genotype","control group","birth weight","gestational age","allele","mutant","statistical analysis","gene","oxidative stress","lung alveolus epithelium","exposure","therapy","Greece","case control study","amino acid sequence","environmental factor","blood","blood sampling","single nucleotide polymorphism","mutation","baby","dental floss","statistical significance","oxygen","digestant","reactive oxygen metabolite","genomic DNA","DNA"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"A.

Although supplemental oxygen is the most commonly used therapy, direct exposure to oxygen can damage the pulmonary epithelium through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). CYP2B6, a phase I metabolic enzyme, encoded from the corresponding CYP2B6 gene, inactivates ROS protecting cells from oxidative stress. CYP2B6 G516T single-nucleotide-polymorphism changes the amino-acid sequence (Gln172His), resulting in enzymatic inactivation. Homozygous and heterozygous for the mutant T allele neonates present reduced capacity to counteract products of ROS and thus may be at increased risk of BPD. Material(s) and Method(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of CYP2B6 germline polymorphism in BPD susceptibility. This case-control study enrolled 82 Greek premature neonates with gestational age <=32 weeks. Among these, 33 developed BPD (case group) and 49 did not develop BPD (control group). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of all neonates. The CYP2B6 genotype was performed by PCR-RFLPs. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: No significant difference was found between the BPD and control groups concerning sex and mode of delivery. However, mean birth weight and gestational age of BPD cases were significantly lower than controls' (953 +/- 196g vs 1325 +/- 266g and 27.8 +/- 1.6 vs 30.2 +/- 1.7, respectively) (p1200g). The statistical analysis revealed a higher incidence of the variant genotypes in BPD neonates of <=1200g than in no BPD neonates of the same birth weight cohort (46.6% vs 35.7%, respectively), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, all babies carrying the homozygous CYP2B6 mutant genotype developed BPD, while none of the control group carried the mutation in homozygous status. In conclusion, a higher frequency of heterozygous (G/T) and homozygous (T/T) neonates for the CYP2B6 polymorphism was observed among neonates who developed BPD compared to controls. Conclusion(s): Our study comprises the first investigation of the G516T CYP2B6 inactivating gene polymorphism in BPD development. Further studies including a larger number of BPD and no BPD preterm neonates are required to elucidate whether the nonfunctional CYP2B6 T allele is implicated in the BPD susceptibility.","group":"g1","id":"9976a5fa-416e-4902-b0ee-f441ebea5c61","_showDetails":true},"5d441c75-a9eb-4092-9a5c-0f825680ff2b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71504962","title":"Heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula versus nasal continuous positive airway pressure for postextubation ventilatory support in neonates: A meta-analysis","authors":["Daish H.","Badurdeen S."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*newborn","*positive end expiratory pressure","*perinatal care","*meta analysis","*nasal cannula","*extubation","human","gestational age","risk","therapy","nose injury","Mantel Haenszel test","Embase","lung dysplasia","baby","nursing","Medline","confidence interval","devices","comfort","intubation","treatment failure","randomized controlled trial","model","prematurity"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"H.

Whilst the perceived advantages of reduced nasal trauma and ease-of-use make this an attractive therapy, there is ongoing debate as to its relative efficacy for providing non-invasive ventilatory support when compared to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). Recent trials have attempted to address this important question; however an upto date meta-analysis to provide a bestevidence answer is lacking, and is urgently needed. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of HHHFNC versus nCPAP in avoiding extubation failure in neonates. Material(s) and Method(s): For studies prior to June 2010, we searched through the list of included and excluded studies generated in the systematic search of a recent Cochrane review (Wilkinson et al. 2011). We updated the search in PubMed, Embase and clinicaltrials. gov for randomised trials assessing the use of high-flow nasal therapy in neonates, published since 2010. The reference lists of articles reviewed in full-text were also screened for relevant studies. Randomised trials examining extubation failure rates in neonates extubated to HHHFNC compared to nCPAP were included. Data were extracted and risk of bias for each study assessed. Meta-analysis was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method using a random-effects model. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: Three Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) with data for 726 neonates were identified for inclusion. Two RCTs (435 neonates) studied neonates born at less than 32 weeks gestational age with the outcome as treatment failure within 7 days of extubation. One RCT (291 neonates) studied neonates born between 28 and 42 weeks gestational age with re-intubation within 72 hours as the outcome. Vapotherm, Optiflow or Comfort Flo devices were used as HHHFNC. None of the studies reported a significant difference in extubation failure rates between HHHFNC and nCPAP groups. The average effect across all studies in the pooled analysis also showed no significant difference between HHHFNC versus nCPAP with respect to extubation failure rate (risk ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.67-1.97), with a high degree of heterogeneity between studies (I2 66%). Conclusion(s): There is no significant difference in the rate of extubation failure in neonates extubated to HHHFNC compared with those extubated to nCPAP. Given the advantages of HHHFNC with regard to nasal trauma and easier nursing, it may be attractive alternative to nCPAP following extubation. There is limited data for babies less than 26 weeks gestational age, and longer term outcomes, such as rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia should be evaluated.","group":"g1","id":"5d441c75-a9eb-4092-9a5c-0f825680ff2b","_showDetails":true},"0f9c8819-f90f-434b-a58b-7fb7628b196d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71504959","title":"Caffeine, a potent modulator of lung surfactant homeostasis and airway remodeling","authors":["Fehrholz M.","Kunzmann S.","Speer C.P."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*airway remodeling","*homeostasis","*perinatal care","human","parameters","epithelium cell","cell line","airway","host resistance","lung function","lung dysplasia","defense mechanism","newborn","prematurity","lung","erythroleukemia","newborn period","protein expression","virus oncogene","immunoblotting","limit of detection","stimulation","pathogenesis","*caffeine","*lung surfactant","*surfactant","messenger RNA","transgelin","protein","connective tissue growth factor","dexamethasone"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"M.

However, caffeine mediated effects on lung epithelial cells are still poorly defined. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of caffeine on expression of surfactant proteins (SPs) as key parameters of surfactant homeostasis as well as on selected members of airway remodeling processes, like connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transgelin, implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Material(s) and Method(s): The human airway epithelial cell lines A549 and H441 were treated with different doses of caffeine in combination with dexamethasone (DEX) or TGF-beta1, respectively. After 24 h mRNA and/or protein expression of surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D, the SPB transcription cofactor erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (ErbB4), as well as CTGF and transgelin were determined by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: While caffeine was able to modulate SP-B mRNA levels after induction with DEX in H441 (206 +/- 59.7-fold, p<0.001) and A549 cells (31.4 +/- 11.1-fold, p<0.05), respectively, SP-D mRNA levels in H441 cells were also affected, but to a lesser extend (4.8 +/- 1.0-fold, p<0.05). Levels of mature SP-B were also elevated by caffeine for high (p<0.05) as well as low (p<0.05) concentrations in combination with DEX. Caffeine was also able to induce higher expression of ErbB4 mRNA in H441 cells alone (5.1 +/- 1.9-fold, p<0.05) as well as in combination with DEX (7.0 +/- 2.4-fold, p<0.05). SP-A1 mRNA levels were not influenced by caffeine and SP-C mRNA levels were below the detection limit in both cell lines. After stimulation with TGF-beta1, caffeine diminished the induction of CTGF mRNA (0.5 +/- 0.1- fold, p<0.05) as well as transgelin mRNA (0.6 +/- 0.1-fold, p<0.05) in A549 cells, which could also be confirmed on the protein level. Conclusion(s): Given the observed effects, it is most likely that caffeine is able to influence diverse key parameters of surfactant homeostasis and airway remodeling processes. These results may help to understand how caffeine is able to improve lung function and innate host defense mechanisms of premature neonates.","group":"g1","id":"0f9c8819-f90f-434b-a58b-7fb7628b196d","_showDetails":true},"c5ff8a5e-0b7c-4a2e-bd0c-58a7317c1691":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71504564","title":"Overview of attempts to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)","authors":["Shinwell E.S."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*perinatal care","prematurity","morbidity","genetic predisposition","infection","artificial ventilation","patent ductus arteriosus","nutrition","male","ventilator","therapy","lung","healing","oxygen","vitamin","caffeine","steroid","nitric oxide"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"E.S.

For many years, dexamethasone was the main drug used to prevent BPD. Reports on adverse effects of dexamethasone on growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, however, turned the enthusiastic use of systemic postnatal steroids into almost complete avoidance, with a subsequent increase in the incidence of BPD. An alternative would be topical application, i.e. via inhalation, but despite a widespread use of this therapy, its effectiveness has never been convincingly shown. With financial support from the 7th Framework Programme of the European Union, we thus launched NEuroSIS, a European multicentre study to investigate whether early prophylactic inhalation of Budesonide (Budiair, Chiesis) reduces the absolute risk of BPD or death in preterm infants born <28 weeks gestational age (GA) by 10%. Our primary objective was to determine whether inhalation of Budesonide within 12 hours of life improves survival without BPD at 36 weeks GA in infants born between 23 and 27 weeks GA. Secondary objectives were whether prophylactic inhalation of Budesonide affects neurodevelopment at a corrected age of 18-22 months, to determine whether inhalation of corticosteroids is associated with adverse treatment effects, alters mortality or BPD incidence at 36 weeks GA, and the duration of positive pressure respiratory support or supplemental oxygen. Data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of inhaled corticosteroids were also collected and a substudy on the genetic susceptibility to BPD performed. The study was designed as a randomised placebo-controlled trial, enrolling a total of 850 infants of 23-27 weeks GA in 40 centres across 8 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands). Infants were randomised during the first 12 hours of life to Budesonide or placebo to prevent BPD. Study drugs was administered via a metered dose inhaler (MDI; Aerochamber Mini) and continued until infants were either off supplementary oxygen and positive pressure support or had reached a GA of 32 0/7 weeks regardless of ventilatory status. The primary outcome of survival without BPD was determined at 36 weeks GA and BPD defined according to the physiological definition. Study patients were followed and neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed at a corrected age of 18-22 months. Recruitment was closed in July 2013 and the database in March 2014, but results will only become available in October 2014. It is hoped that results of this trial will ultimately provide guidance to clinicians whether inhaled steroids are an effective measure to reduce BPD in this vulnerable patient population.","group":"g1","id":"6069cefa-eeb1-412e-b6c9-287ec464d2ff","_showDetails":true},"d889bdd5-9a35-4b72-a6e2-80bd667ae7a2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71504540","title":"NCPAP vs. NIPPV vs. heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) for the treatment of premature infants with RDS","authors":["Kugelman A."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*infant","*human","*nasal cannula","*prematurity","*perinatal care","*respiratory distress syndrome","extubation","air conditioning","intubation","newborn apnea","extremely low birth weight","meta analysis","positive end expiratory pressure","baby","ventilator","breathing","risk","gas","endotracheal intubation","lung function test","death","nasal prong","lung dysplasia","implantable cardioverter defibrillator","intermittent positive pressure ventilation","personnel","general condition","maturation","follow up","artificial ventilation","prospective study","morbidity","adverse drug reaction","cerebral palsy","energy cost","lung","delivery room","lung dead space","health care quality","apnea","resuscitation","risk reduction","risk factor","conditioning","lung mechanics","thorax wall","respiratory drive","safety","upper respiratory tract","randomized controlled trial (topic)","survival","surfactant","steroid","oxygen","carbon dioxide"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"A.

At delivery, the term stabilization is preferred to resuscitation for the vast majority of very preterm infants. Only a minority of babies should require delivery room intubation. Recent large trials that reflect current practice (including greater utilization of maternal steroids and routine post delivery stabilization on NCPAP) demonstrate less risk of BPD or death when using early stabilization on NCPAP with selective surfactant administration to infants requiring intubation.2 The comprehensive strategy to prevent BPD in the NICU is based on ventilatory and non-ventilatory measures.3 The ventilatory route allows an individualized endotracheal intubation approach. Recent studies concluded that early nasal CPAP (NCPAP) is a safe alternative to immediate intubation in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.4,5 Endotracheal intubation and ventilation can result in significant damage to premature lungs and are independently associated with cerebral palsy. Furthermore, despite new modes of ventilation and surfactant, BPD remains a significant morbidity and its incidence was correlated with the use and length of endotracheal mechanical ventilation. BPD in itself is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Thus, we need to avoid endotracheal ventilation, if possible. NCPAP is recommended as the early primary treatment of active RDS (to avoid intubation or as part of the INSURE [INtubation SURfactant Extubation] approach), or later, post extubation at RDS resolution, in order to allow shortening of the duration of endotracheal ventilation and to treat apnea of prematurity.1 New studies4,5 report comparable rates of BPD in ELBW infants treated initially with NCPAP as compared to endotracheal ventilation with surfactant administration. Can we enhance NCPAP and get better outcome for NRS by using nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)? NIPPV was defined as a method of augmenting NCPAP by delivering ventilator breaths via nasal prongs. The rationale behind the use of NIPPV is the administration of \"sigh\" to the infant, thus opening microatelectasis and recruiting more ventilation units. It was shown that synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV) compared with NCPAP may improve the patency of the upper airway, could activate the respiratory drive, improves thoraco-abdominal synchrony, stabilizes the chest wall, improves lung mechanics and decreases the work of breathing in premature infants. When NIPPV was compared to NCPAP for the different indications of NRS, it was shown to enhance the potential of NRS.3 A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a relative risk reduction for intubation in the first 72 hours in the NIPPV group compared with NCPAP (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43, 0.83).6 The NIPPV trial7 was a large international multicenter randomized trial powered to study the important outcome of BPD, recruiting 1009 extremely low birth weight babies, and it showed no difference between babies randomized to NIPPV compared with CPAP. Yet, the results of this study should be considered with caution because of several limitations. For example: There was no uniform experience and equipment used for NIPPV among participating centers; approximately 50% of the infants were supported with biphasic CPAP that is a limited form of NIPPV (maximal peak inspiratory pressure of 9-10 cm H2O in that study). SNIPPV vs. NCPAP for later use, post extubation at RDS resolution, as a \"bridge\" to spontaneous unsupported breathing was shown to be more effective than NCPAP. A pooled meta-analysis showed that SNIPPV was more effective than NCPAP in preventing failure of extubation [RR 0.21 (0.10, 0.45)] and the number needed to treat was only 3 infants to prevent one extubation failure.8 SNIPPV vs. NCPAP, post extubation, also tended to decrease the rate of BPD.3 SNIPPV may be more effective than NCPAP also for apnea of prematurity.3 A meta-analysis, regarding apnea of prematurity, suggests that SNIPPV is more efficacious with apnea that is frequent or severe. However, the studies performed addressed short-term outcomes and as such could not address properly the incidence of requirement for reintubation. Thus, more studies are needed before recommending SNIPPV as standard of care for apnea of prematurity. To summarize, the available evidence supports the preference of early or later use of NIPPV/SNIPPV compared to NCPAP because of minimizing the use and the length of endotracheal ventilation.3 There are data to suggest that this approach may also reduce the rate of BPD, however this was not shown yet.3 The results of a large international RCT comparing both primary, and post-extubation use of NIPPV with NCPAP, with a composite primary outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' corrected age indicate no additional benefit, or risk, conferred by NIPPV in comparison to NCPAP.7 Whether NIPPV/SNIPPV is more beneficial than NCPAP within the INSURE approach needs to be shown. Recently, heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) is frequently used as a mode of NRS. High flows result in washout of anatomical and physiological dead space and contribute to improved fractions of alveolar gases with respect to carbon dioxide as well as oxygen and decrease the work of breathing and the energy cost of gas conditioning. HHHFNC probably creates positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) that may contribute to its beneficial effect. However, the PEEP that is not monitored, had raised concerns regarding the safety of HHHFNC in terms of air leak. Recent prospective studies support the notion that HHHFNC is as effective as NCPAP for early stages of RDS,9 post extubation,10,11 and for apnea of prematurity.12 There is one study that found HHHFNC to be as effective as NIPPV for the initial treatments of RDS in infants >1000 g.13 Yet, more studies, especially in the initial treatment of RDS and in ELBW infants, are needed before adopting HHHFNC as an alternative mode of NRS in these conditions. The noninvasive ventilator strategy needs to be confirmed by large prospective randomized controlled trials (with long-term follow up) in order to assure it is applicable to most ELBW infants. Furthermore, the strategy needs to be tailored to individualized infants according to the infant's maturation; antenatal steroid treatment and severity of RDS; general condition; and to certain practical NICU conditions such as experience, personnel and timing during the day.","group":"g1","id":"d889bdd5-9a35-4b72-a6e2-80bd667ae7a2","_showDetails":true},"0efea120-ca5b-4313-98ec-6a26f13cdf65":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71501544","title":"Suspected fatal transfusion-related acute lung injury (trali) in a neonate following red cell transfusion: A case report","authors":["Naim N.","Kambali M.M.","Cheah I.","Mohammad Ismail H.I.","Hassan R."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*transfusion related acute lung injury","*newborn","*erythrocyte","*transfusion","*human","*case report","*society","*blood transfusion","*hematology","*organization","female","patient","donor","cause of death","thorax radiography","adverse drug reaction","blood component","sepsis","Pseudomonas","heart atrium septum defect","mechanical ventilator","respiratory distress syndrome","oxygen saturation","intensive care unit","newborn intensive care","diagnosis","feeding","child","ambient air","erythrocyte concentrate","lung infiltrate","hyaline membrane disease","weight gain","pregnancy","pH","metabolic acidosis","respiratory acidosis","ward","arterial gas","newborn jaundice","respiratory failure","recipient","hypotension","hospital infection","bacterium contamination","patent","twins","antibody","antibiotic agent","antihypertensive agent","diuretic agent","hemoglobin"],"journal":"Vox Sanguinis","language":"English","volume":"107","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","isbn":"0042-9007","address":"N.

Despite increased awareness and better understanding of the condition, diagnosing TRALI may not be as straight forward, particularly when it involved children and neonates. Aim(s): To discuss the possibility of TRALI as the cause of death of a neonate following red cell transfusion. Case Report: This case involved a female neonate, second of a twin born prematurely at 30th week of gestation. She was initially managed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with respiratory distress syndrome, atrial septal defect, patent ductus ateriosus and neonatal jaundice. As her condition improved, she was transferred out to the general ward while awaiting weight gain and discharge. One morning patient was noted to be anaemic with haemoglobin of 7.7 g/dl. Decision was made to transfuse her 30 ml of packed red cell with diuretic cover. Transfusion was completed within 4 h without incident. Two hours post transfusion she was noted to be lethargic with poor feeding. Working diagnosis of presumed sepsis was made, septic work-up performed and intravenous antibiotics started. At 4 h post transfusion her oxygen saturation (SpO2) level dropped to below 88% under room air. Four hours later she became hypotensive, tachycardic and apnoeic, requiring mechanical ventilator support. Chest radiographs taken showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Despite continuous intensive intervention, patient condition worsened with intractable hypotension, respiratory failure and renal shut down. She passed away less than 48 h after the transfusion. Results/Discussion: Arterial blood gas taken 6 h post-transfusion showed respiratory acidosis with metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.045, SpO2 = 81.2%, PaO2 = 50.4 mmHg, PaCO2 = 60.5 mmHg, HCO3- = 12.5 mM). Series of chest radiographs showed background of resolving Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD) but persistent perihilar infiltrates. These findings were consistent with the patient's clinical presentation. The donor of the red cell unit was a regular female donor who was nulliparous with no history of transfusion. Other blood components prepared from this donation and that of her previous donations were safely transfused without causing any adverse reactions to the recipients. The donor was also tested negative for anti-HLA class I and II antibodies. Anti-HNA antibody however was not tested. The septic work-up performed on the patient was positive for Pseudomonas spp. confirming her underlying nosocomial infection. However, with patient remained afebrile throughout and tests on the remains of the transfused red cell unit and other blood components prepared from the same donation were negative for any bacterial contamination, septic transfusion was ruled out as the cause of the adverse reaction she had. Conclusion(s): From the clinical presentation and the investigations performed on both patient and donor, it was difficult to conclude that TRALI was the cause of death. Despite septic work-up was positive for Pseudomonas spp., septic transfusion was ruled out. Thus it was decided that the patient's cause of death was 'Nosocomial sepsis with TRALI cannot be excluded'.","group":"g1","id":"0efea120-ca5b-4313-98ec-6a26f13cdf65","_showDetails":true},"ff99558f-8d41-4e9a-9fb8-235fda5b3c90":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71425624","title":"Induction of ectopic inflammasome function in fetal lung mesenchyme","authors":["McCoy A.","Greer R.","Prince L."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*fetus lung","*mesenchyme","mesenchyme cell","lung","prematurity","immunocompetent cell","hypothesis","human","lung dysplasia","infant","airway","pathogenesis","mouse","inflammation","*inflammasome","interleukin 1beta","lipopolysaccharide","messenger RNA","interleukin 1beta converting enzyme","peptide","adenosine triphosphate","cytokine","interleukin 1","endotoxin"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"28","number":"1 SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"1530-6860","address":"A.

Inflammation and the soluble inflammatory mediator interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) play major roles in BPD pathogenesis and inhibit normal lung airway formation. IL-1beta release requires both NF-kappaB dependent mRNA expression and post-translational cleavage by caspase-1 containing inflammasomes. Best characterized in immune cells, the inflammasome has not been investigated in the developing lung. Here we test the hypothesis that the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce ectopic inflammasome expression in fetal lung mesenchyme, leading to IL-1beta release. In primary fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells, LPS rapidly induced IL-1beta mRNA expression, but neither LPS nor the inflammasome activator ATP stimulated the release of IL-1beta peptide. However, treating mesenchymal cells with LPS for at least 6h and then stimulating with ATP did release IL-1b peptide, suggesting LPS-dependent priming. These results were consistent with immunoblots showing caspase-1 cleavage when mesenchymal cells were primed with LPS and then activated with ATP. LPS priming also increased caspase-1 mRNA expression. Mesenchymal cells expressing a constitutively active IKKbeta contained higher levels of IL-1beta and inflammasome component mRNA, but did not release IL-1beta peptide unless first primed with LPS and then activated with ATP. These data suggested that IKKbeta activity might not be sufficient to assemble a fully functional inflammasome. These data show that LPS can generate functional inflammasome expression and function in lung mesenchymal cells, potentially propagating the release of inflammatory cytokines within the lung.","group":"g1","id":"ff99558f-8d41-4e9a-9fb8-235fda5b3c90","_showDetails":true},"799f3c6a-9c2c-4711-9b6b-39e7c0b9a40b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71425623","title":"NF-kappaB activation in the fetal lung promotes macrophage maturation","authors":["Stouch A.","Zaynagetdinov R.","Barham W.","Stinnett A.","Yull F.","Hoffman H.","Blackwell T.","Prince L."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*fetus lung","*macrophage","*maturation","lung alveolus macrophage","adult","lung","lung disease","phenotype","risk","inflammation","transgenic organism","exposure","infant","gene expression","pneumonia","prematurity","mouse","newborn","lung dysplasia","flow cytometry","agonist","macrophage activation","human","interleukin 4","marker","dioxygenase","indoleamine","protein","cytokine","fibrinogen"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"28","number":"1 SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"1530-6860","address":"A.

Similar to adult alveolar macrophages, fetal lung macrophages responded to the TLR4 agonist LPS and the alternative activation cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Using a macrophage-specific constitutively active IKKbetaeta transgenic model (IKFM), we demonstrated that macrophage activation increased proinflammatory gene expression and reduced the response of fetal lung macrophages to IL-4 and IL-13. Fetal IKFM lungs contained increased percentages of more mature, CD11bloF4/80hi cells that also expressed higher levels of the alternative activation markers CD204 and CD206.

Conventional BPD rodent models based on mechanical ventilation (MV) present outcome measured at the end of the ventilation period. A reversible intubation and ventilation model in newborn rats recently allowed discovering that different sets of genes modified their expression related to time after MV. In a newborn rat model, the expression profile 48 h after MV was analyzed with gene arrays to detect potentially interesting candidates with an impact on BPD development., METHODS: Rat pups were injected P4-5 with 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). One day later, MV with 21 or 60% oxygen was applied during 6 h. Animals were sacrified 48 h after end of ventilation. Affymetrix gene arrays assessed the total gene expression profile in lung tissue., RESULTS: In fully treated animals (LPS + MV + 60% O(2)) vs. controls, 271 genes changed expression significantly. All modified genes could be classified in six pathways: tissue remodeling/wound repair, immune system and inflammatory response, hematopoiesis, vasodilatation, and oxidative stress. Major alterations were found in the MMP and complement system., CONCLUSION: MMPs and complement factors play a central role in several of the pathways identified and may represent interesting targets for BPD treatment/prevention.Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease occurring in ~30% of preterm infants born less than 30 wk of gestation (1). Its main risk factors include lung immaturity due to preterm delivery, mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen toxicity, chorioamnionitis, and sepsis. The main feature is an arrest of alveolar and capillary formation (2). Models trying to decipher genes involved in the pathophysiology of BPD are mainly based on MV and oxygen application to young mammals with immature lungs of different species (3). In newborn rodent models, analyses of lung structure and gene and protein expression are performed for practical reasons directly at the end of MV (4,5,6). However, later appearing changes of gene expression might also have an impact on lung development and the evolution towards BPD and cannot be discovered by such models. Recently, we developed a newborn rat model of MV using an atraumatic (orotracheal) intubation technique that allows the weaning of the newborn animal off anesthesia and MV, the extubation to spontaneous breathing, and therefore allows the evaluation of effects of MV after a ventilation-free period of recovery (7). Indeed, applying this concept of atraumatic intubation by direct laryngoscopy, we recently were able to show significant differences between gene expression changes appearing directly after MV compared to those measured after a ventilation-free interval of 48 h. Immediately after MV, inflammation-related genes showed a transitory modified expression, while another set of more structurally related genes changed their expression only after a delay of 2 d (7). Lung structure, analyzed by conventional 2D histology and also by 3D reconstruction using synchrotron x-ray tomographic microscopy revealed, 48 h after end of MV, a reduced complexity of lung architecture compared to the nonventilated rat lungs, similar to the typical findings in BPD. To extend these observations about late gene expression modifications, we performed with a similar model a full gene expression profile of lung tissue 48 h after the end of MV with either room air or 60% oxygen. Essentially, we measured changes in the expression of genes related to the MMPs and complement system which played a role in many of the six identified mostly affected pathways.","group":"g3","id":"d2d7e36d-98c9-4fea-aafe-340425a203ae","_showDetails":true},"e486b4cd-1972-46ee-9439-aa192f739f20":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71425486","title":"The preterm pig as a model for acute lung disease after preterm birth","authors":["Van Der Merwe M.","Ewing H.","Caminita F.","Buddington R."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*model","*lung disease","*premature labor","*swine","secretion (process)","animal model","lung dysplasia","fetus (anatomy)","morbidity","mortality","human","nutritional support","cesarean section","pregnancy","fetus","survival","intensive care","newborn","newborn intensive care","artificial ventilation","disability","procedures","lung function","lung parenchyma","dying","gestational age","piglet","lung","histology","pathology","baboon","injury","gadolinium","surfactant","oxygen","surfactant protein B","surfactant associated protein"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"28","number":"1 SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"1530-6860","address":"M.

Preterm pigs were delivered by caesarian section at gestation days (GD) 98, 100, 102,and 104 (comparable to human fetuses delivered at 25, 28, 30, and 32 wks) and were provided intensive care following newborn neonatal intensive care procedures, including mechanical ventilation (MV) or supplemental oxygen and nutritional support. Expression of Surfactant Protein B (SP-B),a surfactant-associated protein absolutely required for postnatal lung function, was determined by western analysis using lung tissue harvested 24 h after delivery or earlier for pigs that became moribund. Pigs delivered at GD 98 and 100, had low SP-B and MV is required for survival. SP-B increases with gestational age. Moreover, provision of MV to preterm piglets delivered at GD 102 causes a dramatic increase in SP-B expression and suggests MV can induce SP-B secretion and reduce dependency on surfactant administration.Based on SP-B expression, lung histology and pathology, and the responses to MV, the preterm pig is a translational large animal model for studying acute lung disease after preterm birth and for preclinical trials to evaluate interventions and improve MV protocols. The large litters of pigs reduce the numbers of pregnant animals needed, the attributes of the preterm pig allow investigators to refine experimental approaches, and the preterm pig replaces the baboon as a large animal model to study acute lung disease and injury after preterm birth.","group":"g1","id":"e486b4cd-1972-46ee-9439-aa192f739f20","_showDetails":true},"cea4486a-0691-402e-a4d7-dca137a29943":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71425242","title":"Identification of redox- and glucose-sensitive Txnip interacting proteins using BioID","authors":["Forred B.","Neuharth S.","Kim D.","Roux K.","Vitiello P."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["pathology","hyperglycemia","model","oxidation","lung dysplasia","cell death","heart ventricle hypertrophy","mutation","enzyme activity","*glucose","*protein","cysteine","thioredoxin","disulfide","ubiquitin protein ligase","antioxidant","biotin"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"28","number":"1 SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"1530-6860","address":"B.

Thioredoxins regulate the reduction-oxidation state of protein substrates through antioxidant enzymatic activities. Thioredoxins have a conserved catalytic site that undergoes reversible oxidation to cysteine disulfide through the transfer of reducing equivalents from the catalytic site cysteine residues to a disulfide substrate. While Txnip has been identified as a critical modulator of several disease pathologies, including beta-cell death during hyperglycemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are relatively unknown. The objective of these studies was to establish a cell model to identify Txnip interacting proteins in an effort to understand molecular events underlying the aforementioned disease pathologies. A proximity-based biotin-dependent labeling system (called BioID) was fused to Txnip and stably-transfected into HEK293 cells to identify novel interacting proteins. Proteomic analysis of BioID lysates identified 50 interacting proteins and mutation of a redox-senstive cysteine (C247S) in Txnip disrupted several interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this cell model can identify dynamic Txnip interactions through treatment with endogenous Txnip regulators such as hyperglycemia.

These offspring are at increased risk for chronic diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a hypoplastic lung disease defined by preterm birth and neonatal O2 therapy. While O2 therapy and preterm birth clinically define BPD, current models of BPD employ hyperoxia in normally grown term neonates without considering the role of low birth weight and altered fetal endocrine milieu. To that end, we hypothesized chronic placental ischemia would decrease expression of insulin like growth factors (IGF) I and II and related proteins in placental and fetal tissues. Chronic placental ischemia was achieved using the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP; n -7) model of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Normal pregnant (NP; n -8) rats served as controls and tissues were collected on day 19 of gestation. Placental IGF-I was decreased in RUPP compared to NP (89.8 +/- 10.9 vs. 133.0 +/- 13.1ng/ml, p<0.05). Conversely, amniotic fluid IGF-I (0.25 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02pg/ml, p<0.05) and IGF-II (62.7 +/- 8.2 vs. 42.0 +/- 5.5 pg/ml, p<0.05) were increased in RUPP vs. NP. Fetal hepatic IGF-2 was increased in RUPP (155.6 +/- 12.6 vs. 117.0 +/- 6.3pg/ml, p<0.05). Finally, fetal lung IGF-IRalpha was not different between the groups. These data indicate chronic placental ischemia alters expression of IGF proteins in placental and fetal tissues and could alter the developmental trajectory of programming susceptible organs such as the lung and kidney.","group":"g1","id":"659c0040-91f7-4943-bcec-c1be359f4105","_showDetails":true},"af33f6e0-463d-4341-981c-8e397e01fb83":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71424962","title":"Reduced uterine perfusion pressure alters angiogenic balance in the amniotic fluid and fetal lung of the rat","authors":["Rear A.","Needham K.","Lovering A.","Regal J.","Gilbert J."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*perfusion pressure","*amnion fluid","*fetus lung","*rat","*uterus","ischemia","very low birth weight","lung parenchyma","fetus","preeclampsia","pregnancy","lung dysplasia","angiogenesis","premature labor","hypothesis","fetus (anatomy)","lung disease","risk","vasculotropin","gadolinium","angiogenic protein","vasculotropin receptor 2","protein tyrosine kinase"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"28","number":"1 SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"1530-6860","address":"A.

Although recent studies suggest preeclampsia increases risk of the hypoplastic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), whether or not chronic placental ischemia results in fetal angiogenic imbalance remains unclear. We hypothesized chronic RUPP would result in decreased expression of angiogenic proteins in the amniotic fluid and fetal lung consistent with the development of BPD. RUPP was induced on gestation day (GD) 14 and fetal lung tissue and amniotic fluid were collected on GD 19 from RUPP and normal pregnant (NP) rats. Fetuses were smaller (1.8 +/- 0.19 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.08 g; P<0.05) and amniotic fluid free vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 12.6+/-0.82 vs. 9.19+/-1.29 pg/ug; P<0.05) decreased in RUPP compared to NP.

VEGF receptor-2 was decreased (48%; P< 0.05) in lung tissue from RUPP compared to NP fetuses. These data show that chronic placental ischemia results in angiogenic imbalance in fetal tissues similar to that previously observed in the maternal circulation by our group and others. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that angiogenic imbalance in utero plays an important role in the abnormal vasculogenesis and alveologenesis associated with very low birth weight infants.","group":"g1","id":"af33f6e0-463d-4341-981c-8e397e01fb83","_showDetails":true},"d867516d-b1a8-4072-bcf9-8cd880ac3f71":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71392091","title":"Role of endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)","authors":["Lal C.V.","Awasthi N.","Xu H.","Schwarz A.","Schwarz R.","Savani R.","Schwarz M."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*medical research","mouse","hyperoxia","apoptosis","lung","lung function","cell proliferation","dysplasia","lung alveolus cell","nick end labeling","fetus lung","angiogenesis","rabbit","rodent","architecture","real time polymerase chain reaction","immunofluorescence","emphysema","lung development","ventilator","Student t test","analysis of variance","*endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II","protein","blocking antibody","oxygen","marker","immunoglobulin G","nonoxinol 9"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"62","number":"2","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"C.V.

We hypothesized that exogenous EMAP II administration would cause BPD-like changes in uninjured-normoxic mice, and that the administration of EMAP II blocking antibody (EMAP II Ab) would rescue alveolar growth in mice exposed to hyperoxia. Methods Used: 1) From postnatal days (PN) 3-15, EMAP II protein or vehicle was administered to mice in 21% oxygen (normoxia) 2) PN 3-15, mice were exposed to either 85% oxygen (hyperoxia) or normoxia and treated with either EMAP II Ab or non specific rabbit IgG control (NsIgG). Lungs were harvested on PN 15. Alveolar architecture was demonstrated by mean linear intercept (MLI), cellular proliferation by Ki67 immunofluorescence, and apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Vascular and epithelial lung markers were analysed by real time PCR. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) was performed at 6 weeks using Scireq Flexivent FX rodent ventilator. Summary of Results: 1)Compared to vehicle-treated pups, normoxia pups treated with EMAP II protein developed alveolar simplification consistent with BPD (MLI: p<0.0001, t test), reduction in epithelial and vascular lung markers and worsening lung functions. 2)Compared to normoxia controls, mice exposed to hyperoxia between PN 3-15 demonstrated distal alveolar dysplasia (MLI p<0.001 ANOVA), increased proliferation (p<0.01) and apoptosis (p<0.01). Compared to NsIgG-treated hyperoxia controls, hyperoxia pups treated with EMAP II Ab had a marked reduction in MLI (p<0.01), alveolar cell proliferation (p<0.01), apoptosis (p<0.01) and had improved compliance. EMAP II Ab had no difference in MLI and alveolar cell proliferation in normoxia pups as compared to NsIgG-treated normoxic controls. Conclusion(s): In neonatal mice exogenous delivery of EMAP II protein induces distal alveolar dysplasia consistent with BPD, while delivery of an EMAP II function-blocking antibody rescues hyperoxia induced alveolar dysplasia, reduces cellular hyperproliferation, apoptosis and improves pulmonary functions. This suggests that EMAP II blockade may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in BPD development.","group":"g1","id":"d867516d-b1a8-4072-bcf9-8cd880ac3f71","_showDetails":true},"e9df6cf4-851e-4253-ad70-6eba3e0e1d16":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71391555","title":"Respiratory involvement in costello syndrome: A report of two cases and review of the literature","authors":["Gomez-Ospina N.","Myers A.","Brennan M.","Bernstein J.A.","Hudgins L."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*Costello syndrome","*medical research","human","patient","newborn period","respiratory failure","sleep disordered breathing","respiratory distress","follow up","mutation","case report","intellectual impairment","failure to thrive","morbidity","gene","counseling","dysplasia","proto oncogene","trachea reconstruction","lung dysplasia","excision","facies","histopathology","intubation","upper respiratory tract obstruction","lung hypoplasia","lung","elastic fiber","phenotype","hypoventilation","lower respiratory tract","disease course","solid tumor","diseases","positive end expiratory pressure"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"62","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"N.

It is characterized by coarse facial features, intellectual disability, postnatal failure to thrive and increased incidence of malignant solid tumors. Integumentary, musculoskeletal and cardiac involvement is also prevalent. Respiratory difficulties have also been reported in CS, however, there has been limited description of their origins. Here we present the clinical course of two patients diagnosed with CS in the neonatal period who presented with respiratory failure soon after birth. Patient 1 presented with respiratory distress requiring temporary intubation. Laringoscopy identified lanringomalacia. The symptoms improved after excision of ariepiglottic folds, lanringoplasty and tracheal reconstruction but on follow up had persistent obstructive sleep apnea. Patient 2 presented with respiratory distress due to hypoventilation and presumptive pulmonary hypoplasia. At follow up the patient was still CPAP dependent. Reviewof the literature revealed additional reports documenting respiratory symptoms in patients with CS including respiratory insufficiency, laryngo/ tracheo/bronchomalacia, hydro/chylothorax, upper airway obstruction, obstructive sleep apnea and small lungs. Postmortem and histopathological studies have shown evidence of lymphagiectasia, atypical elastic fibers in brochi and alveoli, as well as alveolar and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Review of the literature also revealed a correlation between the presence of severe respiratory phenotype and uncommon mutations in the HRAS gene. Our cases and review of the literature suggest respiratory insufficiency is a source of significant morbidity for patients with CS in the neonatal period. Reported mechanisms to explain the upper and lower respiratory tract involvement include impaired elastogenesis, lymphagiectasia and pulmonary dysplasia. The possibility of respiratory compromise in the neonatal period should prompt adequate counseling and plan for delivery in cases of prenatally diagnosed Costello syndrome.","group":"g1","id":"e9df6cf4-851e-4253-ad70-6eba3e0e1d16","_showDetails":true},"993ac905-5e33-4608-a396-177fa8d22857":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71351399","title":"Human rhinovirus bronchiolitis predominant in very low birthweight infants in Argentina","authors":["Linder-Jackson J.E.","Plachco T.E.","Bossi L.","Bauer G.","Polack F.P.","Libster R.P.","Kathryn Miller E.K."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*bronchiolitis","*very low birth weight","*infant","*Argentina","*allergic asthma","*immunology","*Human rhinovirus","human","hospitalization","asthma","prematurity","species","infection","cohort analysis","population","nose smear","lung dysplasia","smoking","risk","mother","female","outpatient","Metapneumovirus","pregnancy","Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus","wheezing","respiratory virus","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","Rhinovirus","respiratory tract infection","aspiration","risk factor","Rhinovirus infection"],"journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","language":"English","volume":"133","number":"2 SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Mosby Inc.","isbn":"0091-6749","address":"J.E.

Premature infants are at increased risk for asthma, and the role of HRV in this group is largely unexplored. METHOD(S): In this prospective cohort study, premature infants weighing <1500gm were enrolled in the NICU from June 2011 through October 2012. Infantswere followed for the first year of life, nasal swabs collected at monthly well visits, and nasal aspirates taken during all acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Real time rt-pcr for respiratory viruses was conducted on specimens. HRV-positive specimens were cloned and sequenced to determine species. RESULT(S): of 139 ARI samples, 66% were positive for HRV, and 53% of infants with HRV had bronchiolitis. There were 26 (32%) hospitalizations: 50% positive for HRV, 15% respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 15% metapneumovirus (MPV). MPV was more likely to be associated with hospitalizations than outpatient visits forARIs (p=0.002).OfHRV-associated ARIs, 70% were species HRVA, 7%HRVB, and 23%HRVC. Twenty-seven percent of mothers smoked during pregnancy and 55% had smokers in the home; 41% of infants had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). CONCLUSION(S): Rhinovirus is the predominant infection associated with ARI in VLBW infants in Argentina. HRV, RSV, and MPV are all associated with infant hospitalizations. Bronchiolitis and BPD were common in this population, suggesting that many risk factors for the development of asthma later in life are affecting these premature infants and they should be targeted for preventive measures.","group":"g1","id":"993ac905-5e33-4608-a396-177fa8d22857","_showDetails":true},"c9aa7a99-3dd3-4de0-a7de-fe90bf663f83":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"612646947","title":"Variability in thy mic size in critically ILL neonates: Ultrasound imaging, clinical and immunological parallels","authors":["Pankratyeva L.L.","Mukhin V.E.","Chernova N.V.","Soldatova I.G.","Roumiantsev S.A.","Volodin N.N.","Roumiantsev A.G."],"date":"2014//","keywords":["abnormal laboratory result","adaptive immunity","anthropometry","article","CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte","correlational study","critically ill patient","disease association","disease course","disease severity","*echography","flow cytometry","gestational age","hospital admission","human","incidence","intestine perforation","lung dysplasia","*lymphatic parameters","lymphocyte count","lymphocytopenia","major clinical study","necrotizing enterocolitis","neonatal intensive care unit","newborn","normal value","perinatal period","peripheral lymphocyte","phenotypic variation","*prematurity","regulatory T lymphocyte","thymus","umbilical cord blood","*weight, mass and size","transcription factor FOXP3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","thymic index","*thymic size"],"journal":"Immunologiya","language":"Russian","volume":"35","number":"1","publisher":"Meditsina Publishers (E-mail: meditsina@mtu-net.ru)","isbn":"0206-4952","urls":["http://www.medlit.ru/journal/386","http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed15&NEWS=N&AN=612646947"],"address":"Russian Federation","abstract":"The thymus is of extreme importance during the first months of life as it provides the environment for the T-lymphocyte differentiation and maturation.

Between 2000-2002 we recruited 129 infants of gestational age < 30 wks. The concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in gastric aspirate and cord blood.

Mechanical ventilation with positive pressure is one of the most common causes of this condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate pneumothorax risk factors in mechanically ventilated neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Besat Hospital in Sanandaj. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a nested case-control study. Case group were neonates under ventilation with pneumothorax admitted to NICU between April 2012 and March 2013. Control group included neonates under ventilation without pneumothorax whose admission times followed in the immediate chronology to the case group. 31 cases and 62 controls were selected. Data collection was performed by use of medical records and ventilator memory in the last 24 hours. The data were introduced into SPSS software. Analysis of qualitative variables was performed by chi-squared and Fisher test. We used Mann Whitney U test for analysis of quantitative variables and logistic regression in order to control confounders. Result(s): 61.3% of newborns with pneumothorax were male and 38.7% female. 61.3% of these neonates were born by Cesarean section and 38.7% by vaginal delivery. Their mean gestational age was 32 weeks and the mean birth weight was 1819 g. 74% of cases had pneumothorax in the right side, 13% left side and 13% bilaterally. Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) was the most common underlying disease (74.2%) in the newborns with pneumothorax. 38% of neonates under pressure controlled ventilation developed pneumothorax compared to 7.1% of neonates under synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), which showed a significant difference (p=0.03). Ventilator parameters associated with higher risk of pneumothorax were more episodes of ventilator adjustments (P<0.001), high peak inspiratory pressure (p<0.001), high positive end expiratory pressure (p=0.029) and high mean airway pressure (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): In general pneumothorax risk factors in mechanically ventilated neonates in our investigation were similar to those of other studies. Our findings indicated that pressure controlled ventilation more episodes of ventilator adjustments, increased peak inspiratory pressure, positive end expiratory pressure and mean airway pressure are major pneumothorax risk factors in the mechanically ventilated newborns. To prevent pneumothorax, it is necessary to avoid frequent changes of ventilator adjustments and decrease in the above mentioned parameters to the levels enough to supply lung oxygenation.","group":"g1","id":"1f1b552c-a325-474f-b21b-a1ccfbeda7fe","_showDetails":true},"e084c4a9-73c0-4ee8-821d-ccc7ddb52d5a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Lack of EC-SOD worsens alveolar and vascular development in a neonatal mouse model of bleomycin-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2015.166","authors":["Delaney, Cassidy","Wright, Rachel H","Tang, Jen-Ruey","Woods, Crystal","Villegas, Leah","Sherlock, Laurie","Savani, Rashmin C","Abman, Steven H","Nozik-Grayck, Eva"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150831//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bleomycin","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/en [Enzymology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Endothelial Cells/en [Enzymology]","Endothelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Hypertension, Pulmonary/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/en [Enzymology]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/ge [Genetics]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/pa [Pathology]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/pp [Physiopathology]","Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/ci [Chemically Induced]","Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/en [Enzymology]","Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/ge [Genetics]","Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/pp [Physiopathology]","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Nitric Oxide/me [Metabolism]","Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/me [Metabolism]","Oxidative Stress","Phenotype","Phosphorylation","*Pulmonary Alveoli/bs [Blood Supply]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/en [Enzymology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","*Pulmonary Artery/en [Enzymology]","Pulmonary Artery/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Artery/pp [Physiopathology]","Signal Transduction","*Superoxide Dismutase/df [Deficiency]","Superoxide Dismutase/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/me [Metabolism]","*Vascular Remodeling","Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/ci [Chemically Induced]","Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/en [Enzymology]","Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/ge [Genetics]","Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/pp [Physiopathology]","Ventricular Function, Right","Ventricular Pressure"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"78","number":"6","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26322414"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) worsens clinical outcomes in former preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Oxidant stress disrupts alveolar and vascular development in models of BPD. Bleomycin causes oxidative stress and induces BPD and PAH in neonatal rats. Disruption in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide signaling pathways contributes to BPD. We hypothesized that loss of EC-SOD would worsen PAH associated with BPD in a neonatal mouse model of bleomycin-induced BPD by disrupting the VEGF/NO signaling pathway., METHODS: Neonatal wild-type mice (WT), and mice lacking EC-SOD (EC-SOD KO) received intraperitoneal bleomycin (2 units/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times weekly and were evaluated at weeks 3 or 4., RESULTS: Lack of EC-SOD impaired alveolar development and resulted in PH (elevated right ventricular systolic pressures, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)), decreased vessel density, and increased small vessel muscularization. Exposure to bleomycin further impaired alveolar development, worsened RVH and vascular remodeling. Lack of EC-SOD and bleomycin treatment decreased lung total and phosphorylated VEGFR2 and eNOS protein expression., CONCLUSION: EC-SOD is critical in preserving normal lung development and loss of EC-SOD results in disrupted alveolar development, PAH and vascular remodeling at baseline, which is further worsened with bleomycin and associated with decreased activation of VEGFR2.","group":"g1","id":"e084c4a9-73c0-4ee8-821d-ccc7ddb52d5a","_showDetails":true},"717d7b09-6e30-406c-a281-e52e5f6e720d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"52404425","title":"Vitamin a supplementation in extremely low-birth-weight infants: Subgroup analysis in small-for-gestational-age infants","authors":["Londhe V.A.","Nolen T.L.","Das A.","Higgins R.D.","Tyson J.E.","Oh W.","Devaskar S.U."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["article","assisted ventilation","birth weight","brain hemorrhage","cause of death","comparative study","controlled study","*extremely low birth weight","gestational age","human","infant","length of stay","leukomalacia","lung dysplasia","major clinical study","necrotizing enterocolitis","patent ductus arteriosus","prematurity","priority journal","retrospective study","risk reduction","secondary analysis","sepsis","*small for date infant","vitamin blood level","*vitamin supplementation","glucocorticoid","*retinol","retinol binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","retinol ester/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Perinatology","language":"English","volume":"30","number":"9","publisher":"Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

A randomized clinical trial by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network demonstrated that vitamin A supplementation in extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) preterm infants requiring early respiratory support decreased the risk of developing BPD. Study Design A subgroup analysis of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants from the original NICHD trial was performed to test the hypothesis that in infants requiring early respiratory support, vitamin A supplementation decreases the relative risk of BPD or death in premature SGA infants to a greater extent than in gestational age-equivalent vitamin A-treated appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants. Results Although vitamin A supplementation significantly increased serum retinol concentrations in AGA ELBW infants (median [5th percentile, 95th percentile]: 16.3 [-7.0, 68.8] versus 2.4 [-13.9, 55.1]; p < 0.001), no increases were noted in SGA ELBW infants. Conclusions Given the limited power of this analysis due to a low number of SGA infants, these data did not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that vitamin A supplementation in preterm SGA infants requiring early respiratory support decreases the relative risk of BPD or death as compared with preterm AGA infants. © 2013 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.","group":"g1","id":"717d7b09-6e30-406c-a281-e52e5f6e720d","_showDetails":true},"9e9d45a0-bb81-4da2-bef5-9a306bbf380f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"369245355","title":"Periostin downregulation is an early marker of inhibited neonatal murine lung alveolar septation","authors":["Ahlfeld S.K.","Gao Y.","Wang J.","Horgusluoglu E.","Bolanis E.","Clapp D.W.","Conway S.J."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["ambient air","animal cell","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","article","cell differentiation","cell proliferation","controlled study","down regulation","histopathology","hyperoxia","*lung alveolus","*lung development","*lung dysplasia","morphogenesis","mouse","*myofibroblast","newborn","nonhuman","perinatal period","priority journal","protein expression","upregulation","Western blotting","alpha smooth muscle actin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*transcription factor RUNX2/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Birth Defects Research Part A - Clinical and Molecular Teratology","language":"English","volume":"97","number":"6","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.

Specifically, therapeutic high level oxygen supplementation adversely affects the premature lungs and results in blunted alveolarization. Prolonged hyperoxic lung injury has previously been shown to upregulate the matricellular protein Periostin (Postn) and stimulate ectopic accumulation of alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) myofibroblasts. Therapies that promote lung septation are lacking largely due to a lack of reliable early biomarkers of injury. Thus, we determined if Postn expression correlated with the initial appearance of myofibroblasts in the saccular lung and was required for early alveolar development. METHOD(S): Lung development in C57BL/6J mice following room-air (RA, 21%-O2) or continuous hyperoxia (85%-O2) from birth (P0) through postnatal day P14 was correlated with Postn and alphaSMA expression. Alveolarization in Postn knockout mice exposed to room-air, 60%-, and 85%-O2 was also examined. RESULT(S): Postn was widely expressed in distal lung septa through P2 to P4 and peak expression coincided with accumulation of saccular myofibroblasts. Initially, 85%-O2 prematurely downregulated Postn and alphaSMA expression and suppressed proliferation before the first evidence of distal lung simplification at P4. By P14, chronic 85%-O2 resulted in secondary upregulation of Postn and alphaSMA in blunted septa. Myofibroblast differentiation and alveolar development was unaffected in Postn null mice and acute 85%-O2 exposure equally inhibited septal formation in Postn null and wild-type littermates. CONCLUSION(S): Postn expression is tightly correlated with the presence of alphaSMA-myofibroblasts and is a novel early biomarker of acutely inhibited alveolar septation during a crucial window of lung development. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","group":"g1","id":"9e9d45a0-bb81-4da2-bef5-9a306bbf380f","_showDetails":true},"8182f1ab-6405-4e7f-87c8-c64f25bb2e5c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"370488303","title":"Recent advances in late lung development and the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Madurga A.","Mizikova I.","Ruiz-Camp J.","Morty R.E."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["angiogenesis","apoptosis","article","artificial ventilation","chorioamnionitis","environmental impact","gene control","human","hyperoxia","intrauterine infection","lung alveolus epithelium","*lung development","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","lung gas exchange","mesenchymal stroma cell","nonhuman","oxidative stress","oxygen toxicity","pathogenesis","persistent pulmonary hypertension/co [Complication]","priority journal","respiratory function","stem cell","beta catenin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","betamethasone","CCAAT enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","connective tissue growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","dexamethasone","epidermal growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","heme oxygenase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]","imatinib","integrin linked kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","isobutylmethylxanthine","lung surfactant/ec [Endogenous Compound]","microRNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","nitrofen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","platelet derived growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone)/ec [Endogenous Compound]","transcription factor RUNX1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","transcription factor Sox5/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"305","number":"12","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1522-1504","address":"R.

A key event in late lung development is secondary septation, in which secondary septa arise from primary septa, creating a greater number of alveoli of a smaller size, which dramatically expands the surface area over which gas exchange can take place. Secondary septation, together with architectural changes to the vascular structure of the lung that minimize the distance between the inspired air and the blood, are the objectives of late lung development. The process of late lung development is disturbed in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease of prematurely born infants in which the structural development of the alveoli is blunted as a consequence of inflammation, volutrauma, and oxygen toxicity.

Method(s): This retrospective analysis was done using 306 clinical records of preterm singleton neonates at <32 weeks of gestation. Two definitions of adverse pulmonary outcome were used: chronic lung disease (CLD), defined as a need for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days after birth; and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as oxygen dependency for at least 28 days after birth plus at 36 weeks postmenstrual age and/or a need for positive-pressure ventilatory support. Selected perinatal variables were compared between these definitions, and factors related to disease development were identified on multivariate analysis. Result(s): The incidence of CLD and of BPD were 42% and 17%, respectively. Regardless of the definitions, the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus and of neonatal infection were significantly higher in the patients who met the disease criteria, but that of chorioamnionitis and of small for gestational age (SGA) were significantly higher in the patients only when the BPD definition was applied. Multivariate analysis identified SGA as an independent risk factor for the development of BPD after controlling for gestational age.

Prompt recognition of problems can enable critical, life-saving interventions to be applied. Whilst there are numerous adaptations of the newborn at birth, this article focuses on those which are the most common and/or clinically urgent, and describes not only the conventional treatments but also emerging therapies. The article therefore covers maladaptive processes in the normal newborn, not those with genetic or other congenital problems which cause maladaptation due to the underlying disease. Likewise, it is outside the scope of this article to discuss neonatal jaundice, as it is arguably not a maladaptation, and may also not be the 'design flaw' that it has previously been considered to be, as bilirubin may have a physiological role as the main antioxidant in the newborn in the first week of postnatal life. I have described five neonatal conditions: transient tachypnoea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension, which can all cause significant hypoxaemia, patent ductus arteriosus which is usually not clinically significant but is common and often causes considerable parental anxiety, and transient hyperinsulinaemia which can cause profound hypoglycaemia.

The detection of antibody arrays indicated that the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-alpha, IL-6 and chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in lung tissues of neonatal rats in LPS+saline group was higher than that in control group, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-2 in LPS+theo group was significantly lower than that in LPS+saline group (decreased by 37.4 times, 12.5 times and 8.6 times respectively), and the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 in LPS+theo group was significantly higher than that in LPS+saline group (increased by 2.4 times, 56.9 times and 17.8 times respectively). Conclusion(s): Theophylline can inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increase the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and relieve alveolar arrest through regulating the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Theophylline may play a role in the amelioration of chorioamnionitis-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g3","id":"5f2ade96-0efd-4575-a7fc-c84192924531","_showDetails":true},"30ee3dc4-3734-4c04-8f4a-93ad3f5e494a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"368351762","title":"Toll-like receptor levels and caffeine responsiveness in rat pups during perinatal period","authors":["Tunc T.","Aydemir G.","Karaoglu A.","Cekmez F.","Kul M.","Aydinoz S.","Babacan O.","Yaman H.","Sarici S.U."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["animal cell","antiinflammatory activity","article","controlled study","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","lung","newborn","newborn apnea","nonhuman","*perinatal period","priority journal","protein expression","rat","very low birth weight","*caffeine","*toll like receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","toll like receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","toll like receptor 4/ec [Endogenous Compound]","toll like receptor 9/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Regulatory Peptides","language":"English","volume":"182","number":"1","publisher":"Elsevier (P.O.

Study Design This was an observational study including all preterm neonates hospitalized in our neonatal intensive care unit over a 21 month period. FIRS was defined as cord blood interleukin (IL)-6 greater than 11 pg/mL. Main outcome parameter was an adverse neonatal outcome defined as hospital mortality and/or the presence of any of 5 prespecified morbidities (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and early- or late-onset sepsis). Results Fifty-seven of 176 preterm infants hospitalized during the study period (32%) had an adverse neonatal outcome and 62 of these 176 infants (35%) had FIRS with median IL-6 values of 51.8 pg/mL (range, 11.2 to >1000 pg/mL). In a regression analysis, FIRS was significantly associated with adverse neonatal outcome (P <.001) and with the single outcome parameters, intraventricular hemorrhage and early-onset sepsis (P =.006 and P =.018, respectively). In the bivariate analysis, FIRS was associated with death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P =.004 and P <.001, respectively). IL-6 correlated with adverse neonatal outcome (r = 0.411, P <.001). When comparing the correlation in neonates less than 32 weeks' gestational age (r = 0.481, P <.001) with neonates 32 weeks or longer (r = 0.233, P =.019), the difference was nearly significant (P =.065). Conclusion FIRS is a risk factor for adverse neonatal outcome in preterm infants. In particular, the combination of IL-6 greater than 11 pg/mL and low gestational age increased the risk for severe neonatal morbidity or death. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

We determined the cardiopulmonary effects of ambrisentan treatment (1-20 mg.kg-1.day-1) in neonatal rats with CLD in 2 models: early treatment during continuous exposure to hyperoxia for 10 days and late treatment starting on day 6 in rat pups exposed postnatally to hyperoxia for 9 days, followed by a 9-day recovery period in room air. Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, right ventricular function, fibrin deposition, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs. In the early treatment model, we investigated the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 25 mg.kg-1.day-1) during ambrisentan treatment. In the early treatment model, ambrisentan improved survival with reduced lung fibrin and collagen III deposition, arterial medial wall thickness, and RVH. These changes were not affected by L-NAME administration. Ambrisentan did not reduce the influx of macrophages and neutrophils or prevent reduced irregular elastin expression. In the late treatment model, ambrisentan diminished PAH, RVH, and right ventricular peak pressure, demonstrating that RVH is reversible in the neonatal period. Alveolarization and vascularization were not affected by ambrisentan.

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term fate of such transplanted cells as well as their effects on alveolar development in neonatally injured lungs. Double transgenic CCSP+/FasL+ mice with inducible lung-specific FasL expression, targeted to induce respiratory epithelial apoptosis in the perinatal period, served as model of neonatal lung injury. Non-injured single transgenic CCSP+/FasL-littermates served as controls. Freshly isolated umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells (0.5 to 1.0 x 106) were administered at postnatal day 5 by intranasal inoculation; sham controls received equal volume PBS. Engraftment, alveolar epithelial differentiation, lung growth, and alveolarization were evaluated one year after transplantation. Engrafted cord blood-derived cells, detected by human-specific FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) analysis, and cord blood-derived alveolar type II-like cells, detected by double immunofluorescence analysis, while sparse, were seen in all conditions and more frequent in double than single transgenic recipients. The total lung volume and volume of air-exchanging parenchyma, assessed by stereological volumetry, were significantly greater in CD34-treated double transgenic animals than in PBS-treated double transgenic controls. Alveolarization, assessed by histomorphometry, was equivalent in these groups. These results suggest that transdifferentiated alveolar epithelial cells, derived from cord blood CD34+ cells, can persist up to one year after intrapulmonary delivery.

In the current study, the relationship between EPC changes of after birth and the development of BPD was investigated, and the effects of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) on EPCs were evaluated. Method(s): Sixty infants with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks and a birth weight of less than 1500 g were studied. NO was administered to infants who were receiving mechanical ventilation or CPAP for at least 2 days between the ages of 7 and 21 days. EPC level was determined by flow cytometry at birth, 7, 21 and 28 days of age and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA), before and after the iNO treatment. Plasma concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were determined via immunochemical assay. Result(s): Twenty-five neonates developed BPD, 35 neonates survived and did not develop BPD. EPC level was decreased on day 7 and 21 in infants who later developed BPD compared with infants that did not develop BPD. From birth to 21 days of age, BPD infants had a persistently lower VEGF concentration compared with non-BPD infants. No difference was found between the two groups at day 28 or 36 weeks PMA. In infants that later developed BPD, iNO raised the KDR+CD133+ and CD34+KDR +CD133+ EPC numbers along with increasing the level of plasma VEGF. Conclusion(s): EPC level was reduced at 7 days of age in infants with BPD, and iNO increased the EPC number along with increasing the level of VEGF.

The involvement of androgens is well evidenced in RDS and it is suspected in BPD. Interestingly, the developing lung is not an inert tissue just exposed to circulating androgens, but is rather an active androgen metabolizing tissue, expressing enzymes involved in both androgen synthesis and inactivation. The present review focuses on the major enzymes involved in androgen metabolism within the developing lung. Testosterone synthesis and inactivation by AKR1C3/Akr1c6 (human/mouse 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) type 5) and HSD17B2 (17beta-HSD type 2), respectively, play an important role in the developing lung. Akr1c14 (3alpha-HSD) shows a strong increase in expression according to developmental time. The canalicular stage of lung development corresponding to the surge of surfactant lipid synthesis, which is linked to RDS, as well as saccularization/alveolarization, which are linked to BPD, are covered by this review for the mouse and human species. The androgen metabolizing enzymes expressed within the developing lung can become potential pharmaceutical targets in the objective of accelerating lung maturation by specific treatments. The classic deleterious effects of androgens on lung maturation and the surge of surfactant synthesis in males are well known. Conversely, androgens also have positive impacts on the development of both male and female lungs. Steroidogenic enzymes are key regulators of these positive effects.

However, clinicians are often unable to explain \"outliers\": large infants with low apparent risk that develop ROP, and small infants with high apparent risk that never develop disease. This project aims to define features of \"outlier\" infants, with the goal of gaining insight about protective or predisposing factors. Method(s): We reviewed infants screened at WCMC and CUMC from 2002-2010. ROP exam results were recorded, along with clinical factors including sex, BW, gestational age, multiple gestation, maternal race, IVF status, mechanical ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neonatal sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The cohort was stratified by weight, highest ROP stage, and need for ROP treatment. Descriptive and correlational statistics were performed. Result(s): During the study period, 1377 infants were screened for ROP. For the overall cohort (n=1377), all clinical factors above and Caucasian race were significantly associated with ROP stage and need for laser treatment (p<0.05). Among 258 infants with BW <750g, 78/258 (30%) were \"outliers\" who developed no ROP. Among 469 infants with BW >1250g, 66/469 (14%) were \"outliers\" who developed ROP. For \"outliers\" with BW <750g or >1250g, the only statistically-significant differences between infants with vs. without ROP were in multiple gestation and neonatal sepsis. Among infants with BW < 500g, there were no statistically-significant differences in any clinical risk factors between the 4 (23%) \"extreme outliers\" without ROP and the 13 (77%) with ROP (Table1). For the 168 with BW >1500g, there were no significant differences in any clinical risk factors between 16 (9%) \"extreme outliers\" with ROP vs. the 152 (91%) without ROP. Conclusion(s): In this large cohort, known clinical risk factors were predictive of ROP stage and need for laser treatment.

Method(s): Retrospective study of 380 infants with a birth weight (BW) of <= 1750 g and/or a gestational age (GA) of <= 32 weeks that were screened by one physician. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment-requiring ROP, in association with putative risk factors (year of exam, gestational age, birth weight, sepsis, oxygen, hyaline membrane disease (HMD), transfusion and intraventricular hemorrhage). Result(s): The mean GA and BW for the 92 cases (24%) of treatment-requiring ROP were 28.2+/-2.00 weeks and 1049+/-281 grams respectively, compared to 30.6+/-2.01 weeks and 1394+/-320 grams in controls. Statistically significant risk factors in multivariate analysis included birth weight (OR=0.998, CI=0.996-0.999, p<0.001), gestational age (OR=0.69, CI=0.56-0.83, p<0.001), sepsis (OR=2.2, CI=1.11-4.51, p=0.0228), and year of exam (OR=5.10, CI=2.34-11.41, p<0.0001). HMD was not statistically significant, but was perhaps clinically significant (OR=2.05, CI=0.97-4.54, p=0.0609). History of oxygen administration, transfusion, perinatal surgeries and intraventricular hemorrhage were not independent predictors of high risk ROP. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that sepsis and possibly HMD are of particular importance in ROP screening in developing nations such as Colombia. It also emphasizes the individual predictive value of both gestational age and birth weight. This information will help to ensure identification of all patients at risk of developing ROP that could benefit from treatment, while decreasing the time and resources required of overextended physicians and the exposure to exams in premature infants. Specifically, utilizing this data to generate a predictive score would decrease the number of patients requiring screening by 26% while still retaining 99% sensitivity (area under ROC curve = 0.86).","group":"g1","id":"05668eb6-4b02-4928-addd-4dbba3b7531f","_showDetails":true},"ecf40955-daa5-44fa-84ff-fb53e5e23ad1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"613016373","title":"Non invasive ventilation strategy in newborns","authors":["Kugelman A."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["apnea monitoring","arterial carbon dioxide tension","catheter","cerebral palsy","clinical effectiveness","controlled study","death","endotracheal intubation","extremely low birth weight","extubation","follow up","general condition","gestational age","high frequency ventilation","human","hypercapnia","infant","intermittent mandatory ventilation","intermittent positive pressure ventilation","learning curve","lung dysplasia","lung mechanics","maturation","meta analysis","morbidity","nasal prong","nervous system malformation","newborn","newborn apnea","*noninvasive ventilation","oxygenation","prematurity","prevention","respiratory distress syndrome","respiratory drive","retrospective study","risk factor","thorax wall","upper respiratory tract","ventilator","work of breathing","steroid","surfactant"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"Supplement 2","publisher":"W.B.

The ventilatory route allows an individualized endotracheal intubation approach. Recent studies concluded that early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is a safe alternative to immediate intubation in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants [2,3]. Endotracheal intubation and ventilation can result in significant damage to premature lungs [4] and are independently associated with cerebral palsy [5]. Furthermore, despite new modes of ventilation and surfactant, BPD remains a significant morbidity and its incidence was correlated with the use and length of endotracheal mechanical ventilation [6]. BPD in itself is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome [7]. Thus, we need to avoid endotracheal ventilation, if possible. Recent trends show an increased use of NCPAP and decreased use of endotracheal ventilation even in ELBW infants [8]. The use of NCPAP requires experience, and learning curves show improved outcomes in rates of BPD [9]. When the infant requires nasal respiratory support (NRS), we should aim for adequate oxygenation (SpO2 of 88-92%), permissive hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 45-55mmHg, pH> 7.2) and gentle ventilation, similarly as on endotracheal ventilation [1]. NCPAP can be used as the early primary treatment of active respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (to avoid intubation or as part of the INSURE [INtubation SURfactant Extubation] approach), or later, post extubation at RDS resolution, in order to allow shortening of the duration of endotracheal ventilation and to treat apnea of prematurity. However, the common use of NCPAP raises several questions. Does it really prevent BPD? Can we enhance NCPAP? What is the role of surfactant in the era of NRS? While previous studies have shown that the lowest incidence of BPD [10,11] or pulmonary morbidity in ELBW infants [12] occurred in NICUs practicing early NCPAP instead of initial mechanical ventilation, new studies [2,3] do not support that conclusion, and report comparable rates of BPD in ELBW infants treated initially with NCPAP as compared to endotracheal ventilation with surfactant administration. Can we enhance NCPAP and get better outcome for NRS by using nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)? NIPPV was defined as a method of augmenting NCPAP by delivering ventilator breaths via nasal prongs [13]. The rationale behind the use of NIPPV is the administration of \"sigh\" to the infant, thus opening microatelectasis and recruiting more ventilation units. It was shown that synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV) compared with NCPAP may improve the patency of the upper airway, could activate the respiratory drive, improves thoraco-abdominal synchrony, stabilizes the chest wall, improves lung mechanics and decreases the work of breathing in premature infants. When NIPPV was compared to NCPAP for the different indications of NRS, it was shown to enhance the potential of NRS. NIPPV for the initial treatment of RDS was shown to significantly decrease the rate of endotracheal ventilation and subsequently the rate of BPD when compared to NCPAP [14]. The results of this study in regards to BPD needs to be taken with caution as the number of ELBW infants in this study was relatively small. Two additional studies [15,16] reported shorter duration of respiratory support [15] and reduced need for endotracheal ventilation with NIPPV [16] compared to NCPAP but no difference in the rate of BPD. A recent study [17] reported no significant difference in rates of endotracheal intubation at 72 hours or in rates of BPD. However, in posthoc analysis, from 24 to 72 hours of life, significantly more infants in the NIPPV group remained extubated compared with those in the NCPAP group. The authors concluded that their results suggest that early use of NIPPV is feasible and safe and may have beneficial effects when compared with NCPAP, especially for infants with a birth weight >1000 g. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a relative risk reduction for intubation in the first 72 hours in the NIPPV group compared with NCPAP (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43, 0.83) [18]. SNIPPV vs. NCPAP for later use, post extubation at RDS resolution, as a \"bridge\" to spontaneous unsupported breathing was shown to be more effective than NCPAP [19,20]. A pooled meta-analysis showed that SNIPPV was more effective than NCPAP in preventing failure of extubation [RR 0.21 (0.10, 0.45)] and the number needed to treat was only 3 infants to prevent one extubation failure [19,20]. SNIPPV vs. NCPAP, post extubation, also tended to decrease the rate of BPD [19,20]. Two retrospective studies [21,22] showed a significantly decreased rate of BPD with NIPPV compared to NCPAP. The larger one showed that early or later use of SNIPPV vs. NCPAP, in infants at greatest risk of BPD or death (500-750 g) was associated with decreased rate of BPD and/or death and decreased rate of neurodevelopmental impairment and/or death [22]. SNIPPV may be more effective than NCPAP also for apnea of prematurity [23]. A meta-analysis, regarding apnea of prematurity, suggests that SNIPPV is more efficacious with apnea that is frequent or severe. However, the studies performed addressed short-term outcomes and as such could not address properly the incidence of requirement for reintubation. Thus, more studies are needed before recommending SNIPPV as standard of care for apnea of prematurity [23]. While non-invasive ventilation is probably safe, its success depends on gestational age [2,3,8]. The data indicate that surfactant may still have a significant role in the treatment of RDS, especially in ELBW infants. Recently, Morley et al. [2] and the SUPPORT study [3] reported on an intubation rate of ~50% in their NCPAP group in ELBW infants. This leads us to the INSURE approach. This approach may allow the infant to benefit from both, surfactant and NRS. A Cochrane review [24] concluded that the INSURE approach with NCPAP compared with later selective surfactant administration, continued mechanical ventilation, and extubation from low respiratory support was associated with less need for mechanical ventilation, lower incidence of BPD and fewer air leak syndromes. Bhandari et al. [25] showed that the INSURE approach with SNIPPV had a significantly lower incidence of BPD/death compared with continued mechanical ventilation. Ramanathan et al. [26] also reported a significant reduction in \"physiologic\" and clinical BPD in the NIPPV group after the INSURE approach compared to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and early extubation to NCPAP. Results of these studies suggest that NCPAP and NIPPV seem to be feasible and effective and result in a lower incidence of BPD when compared with endotracheal ventilation. Another option for surfactant application to the trachea without endotracheal intubation was described by using a thin catheter in spontaneously breathing preterm infants receiving NCPAP. This technique was reported to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation [27]. To summarize, the available evidence supports the preference of early or later use of NIPPV/SNIPPV compared to NCPAP because of minimizing the use and the length of endotracheal ventilation [28]. There are data to suggest that this approach may also reduce the rate of BPD, however this was not shown yet [28]. The preliminary results of a large international RCT comparing both primary, and post-extubation use of NIPPV with NCPAP, with a composite primary outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' corrected age indicate no additional benefit, or risk, conferred by NIPPV in comparison to NCPAP [29]. Whether NIPPV/SNIPPV is more beneficial than NCPAP within the INSURE approach needs to be shown. New modes of NRS such as neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA) [30], and nasal high frequency ventilation [31,32], need to be further studied before concluding on benefits for the short and long term outcomes of premature infants. This non invasive ventilator strategy needs to be confirmed by large prospective randomized controlled trials (with long-term follow up) in order to assure it is applicable to most ELBWinfants. Furthermore, the strategy needs to be tailored to individualized infants according to the infant's maturation; antenatal steroid treatment and severity of RDS; general condition; and to certain practical NICU conditions such as experience, personnel and timing during the day.","group":"g1","id":"ecf40955-daa5-44fa-84ff-fb53e5e23ad1","_showDetails":true},"e5b05adb-3020-45d5-b85a-85ad18ab0463":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"613016328","title":"Prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonatal intensive care units","authors":["Manzoni P.","Mostert M.","De Luca D."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["adult","*adverse device effect","*artificial ventilation","awareness","bacterium contamination","birth weight","blood culture","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","case report","child","chronic lung disease","clinical outcome","clinical trial","colony forming unit","complication","control group","controlled clinical trial","controlled study","cost benefit analysis","coughing","critically ill patient","death","developing country","diagnosis","diagnostic test accuracy study","endotracheal tube","Europe","extubation","gas exchange","general condition","gravity","hand washing","heating","hospital infection","host resistance","human","immune deficiency","infant","infection control","leukocyte","*lung dysplasia","nasotracheal intubation","*neonatal intensive care unit","neonatal ventilator","newborn","North America","nurse patient ratio","nursing","parenteral nutrition","pediatric intensive care unit","population based case control study","pregnancy","*prematurity","prevention","prophylaxis","randomized controlled trial","remission","respiratory distress syndrome","risk factor","sepsis","stress ulcer","supine position","thorax radiography","tracheobronchial toilet","ultrasound","ultraviolet radiation","uncertainty","*ventilator associated pneumonia","antibiotic agent","neuromuscular blocking agent"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"Supplement 2","publisher":"W.B.

NICU= neonatal intensive care unit VAP = ventilator-associated pneumonia BPD= bronchopulmonary dysplasia Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a wellknown problem in adult critical care. VAP represents a particular challenge because it affects patients who need mechanical ventilation for their respiratory failure, thus those who are most critically ill. VAP insurgence is driven by two factors. First, the presence of the endotracheal tube that by-passes natural host defences to the lower respiratory tree and, second, the compromised general conditions of this particular patient population [1]. Clearly, these two conditions also apply to critically ill neonates and to premies in particular, since the latter have even more reduced host defences. Despite this background, research on VAP has been much more limited in neonatal than in adult critical care. However, awareness is raising, since VAP could have relevant clinical consequences in terms of death, length of intensive care unit stay and pulmonary outcomes [2]. Few data are available and several questions need to be addressed. In this paper we will review the topic gathering the knowledge from adult and neonatal research in order to describe the best current evidence to prevent neonatal VAP. Definition and diagnosis of neonatal VAP: VAP requires intubation to occur, but no specific diagnostic test is available. In adults, the diagnosis is attributed gathering together microbiological, clinical and ventilatory data, although microbiological tests have been recently recognised to have little value for the diagnostic process (see below) [3]. This procedure may also be applied to neonates but one more problem is the lack of a specific VAP definition in this population. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention proposed a VAP definition based on clinical and radiographic criteria for infants aged <=12 months [4,5] and this is currently considered the best option to define neonatal VAP for research and epidemiological purposes. VAP is defined by a worsening of gas exchange together with at least 3 clinical criteria plus radiographic criteria. Table 1 shows a modified CDC definition for VAP where some clinical signs have been adapted to the neonatal clinical reality (for instance, the original definition included cough that is rarely seen in neonates). Some peculiarities of the neonatal population are not included in this definition [6]. For instance, chest x-ray appearance is far less specific in newborn infants (especially in premies) than in older children. No mention is made of lung ultrasound that is becoming commonly used, previous antibiotic courses are common and may mask clinical signs and finally there is uncertainty about microbiological investigations to ascertain VAP etiology. The latter is not included in the definition, since lower respiratory airways are colonized a few minutes after intubation [2,3]. Thus, cultures may be useful only to guide therapy and accuracy of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture is acceptable but far from optimal. BALF in neonates is often obtained by non-bronchoscopic technique and, fortunately, recovery and accuracy of this technique seems comparable to fiberbronchoscopic lavage [7,8]. The lavage technique itself is not standardised but some advice has been issued by the European Respiratory Society Task Force on pediatric bronchoalveolar lavage [9]. However, no thresholds of colony forming units or leukocytes are available for the clinical interpretation of these tests. Conversely, blood culture is not accurate enough to have any clinical usefulness [10]. Moreover, endotracheal tube culture or any test performed on the fluid that has been simply aspirated (with no broncho-alveolar lavage) should be avoided as they have very little value. Risk factors for neonatal VAP: Some peculiar characteristics of newborn infants may represent risk factors for VAP insurgence such as the relative immunosuppression (especially of preterm infants), the shorter airways and the possible presence of congenital malformations or immunodeficiencies [11]. Beyond these general traits, identifying specific risk factors would be ideal to protect babies more at risk and prevent VAP, albeit few researches have been conducted with this purpose. However, the available data are quite reliable and consistent. A previous episode of sepsis is a significant risk factor for VAP occurrence in preterm babies [12]. The risk for VAP is significantly higher below 28 weeks' gestation [12] and smaller babies are more at risk for concurrent complications. Two elegant Chinese casecontrol studies [13,14] showed birth weight, parenteral nutrition, reintubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, use of opiates, presence of an orogastric tube, frequent endotracheal suctioning and the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) as significant risk factors associated with VAP. Interestingly, some of these data are consistent with risk factors for VAP identified in pediatric intensive care units or in adults (i.e.: reintubation, duration of ventilation, oral bacterial contamination) [15,16]. The diagnosis of RDS as risk factors deals with prematurity and is linked with the duration of mechanical ventilation that is indeed the main target to be reduced, since the majority of VAP seems to occur after 5.4+/-3.2 days of mechanical ventilation [13]. There are differences concerning VAP distribution. VAP is among the commonest nosocomial pediatric infections in Europe and North- America [17,18], but the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) showed a higher incidence in developing countries, thus this may also be considered a risk factor [19]. Interestingly, there are strong data suggesting that VAP is responsible for a vicious cycle since it leads to a longer duration of ventilation, being the additional days of ventilation inversely related to the birth weight [20,21], to a longer intensive care unit stay [19] and this may obviously affect the insurgence of BDP and secondary sepsis. It is not surprising that duration of mechanical ventilation and VAP represent a significant risk factor for death in preterm babies (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1-2-12.3) [20,21,22]. Preventive measures: Again few researches have been conducted as concerns neonatal VAP prevention. There are some preventive measures that have been widely accepted in adults and that should be considered with no modifications for neonatal critical care, given their simplicity or the positive cost-benefit ratio [1,2]. These include: hand washing and general prevention policy, changing ventilator circuits every 3-4 days, reducing the need for reintubation. Some other measures should also be applied, like preferring orotracheal over nasotracheal intubation and reducing opiates and neuromuscular blocking agents. These measures should be carefully decided for each single patient according to the clinical conditions and to different clinical settings, since an adequate nurse/patient ratio and optimal nursing are obviously needed to achieve the best assistance. What is surely useless is the use of cuffed tubes and repeated endotracheal suctions, while other measures investigated in adults (selective digestive contaminations or stress ulcer prophylaxis) need specific neonatal research and may be even harmful in these little patients. Neonatal research shows that the most important preventive measure is early extubation (<48 h) and the switch to non-invasive respiratory support which reduces the risk of VAP [16]. The choice of which ventilator strategy to adopt is beyond the scope of this study but it is the cornerstone for prevention of VAP and other negative outcomes. The reduction of transfers of babies outside the intensive care unit is also important although no data are available concerning the impact of this specific measure. This goal should not be too difficult to achieve [23]. Recently, an Egyptian study reported an interesting effect of gravitational forces that can reduce respiratory colonization in neonates [24]. It showed that after 5 days of mechanical ventilation, tracheal cultures were positive for 87% of infants randomised to remain in supine position during ventilation and in 30% of infants randomised to the lateral position. Also chest-X rays, inflitration and reintubation rate were significantly higher in the supine position group. These are interesting findings although colonization was studied only on aspirated fluid and not on BALF. Moreover, there are no data on major clinical outcomes and the study enrolled late preterm babies ventilated for up to 5 days. New trials should be conducted to see if there is an effect on main clinical outcomes and also in smaller babies and for reduced ventilation times. Even more recently, two intriguing new approaches have been proposed for preventing VAP in neonatal intensive care units. Ryan et al. used ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in the heating ventilation and air conditioning system of their ward and found a reduction in both tracheal colonization and VAP incidence (from 74% to 39%; relative risk: 1.89; number needed to treat 2.85) [25]. Christensen et al. proposed the use of a low sodium saline solution for airway care and broncho-alveolar lavage in neonates. This strategy was designed to lower the incidence of VAP by reducing the damage to the innate antimicrobial system of airways subjected to serial lavages (as may occur in long term ventilated neonates). In their trial, these authors observed a significant reduction of VAP incidence (from 4.2 episodes over 1.000 ventilator days in the control group, to 1.6 in the treatment group) and a significantly lower incidence of chronic lung disease, as well [26].","group":"g1","id":"e5b05adb-3020-45d5-b85a-85ad18ab0463","_showDetails":true},"765cd274-ce90-434c-8cc2-0b0844c017f8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Attenuation of miR-17~92 Cluster in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201501-058OC","authors":["Rogers, Lynette K","Robbins, Mary","Dakhlallah, Duaa","Yang, Zhaogang","Lee, L James","Mikhail, Madison","Nuovo, Gerard","Pryhuber, Gloria S","McGwin, Gerald","Marsh, Clay B","Tipple, Trent E"],"date":"2015//","keywords":["Autopsy","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*DNA Methylation","DNA Modification Methylases/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","*MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","Promoter Regions, Genetic","RNA, Long Noncoding"],"journal":"Annals of the American Thoracic Society","volume":"12","number":"10","isbn":"2325-6621","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26291337"],"address":"United States","abstract":"RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a significant cause of neonatal morbidity; however, the identification of novel targets to predict or prevent the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains elusive.

The cornerstone of newborn resuscitation resides therefore in the establishment of a functional residual capacity and an adequate oxygenation. Recent guidelines have established guidelines concerning oxygen supplementation in preterm infants in the delivery room (DR); however, they are vague and unspecific. Herewith, we will address available information regarding the use of oxygen supplementation in the DR in preterm infants to satisfactorily overcome postnatal adaptation. Introduction: Resuscitation of the newborn is considered the most frequent and one of the most stressful interventions in the neonatal period. In order to successfully resuscitate depressed newborn infants birth attendants have to be adequately trained and the equipment employed has to meet specific standards of quality [1]. In 2010 the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) released new recommendations for the use of oxygen supplementation during resuscitation [2]. However, the precise management of oxygen in the DR especially in preterm infants still poses a great deal of uncertainty to care givers. Physiologic changes in oxygenation in the fetal to neonatal transition: Fetal to neonatal transition causes cardio-respiratory changes that lead to an abrupt rise in paO2 from 3.1 kPa to 9.3 kPa; however, as a consequence a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) will be generated. Conspicuously, ROS under physiologic circumstances act as signaling molecules modulating maturation of specific metabolic pathways. On the contrary under hypoxic ischemic conditions an excess of oxygen upon re-oxygenation will cause oxidative damage and increased mortality [3]. Conspicuously, the expression of antioxidant enzymes only takes place in the last weeks of gestation paralleling surfactant production. Therefore, babies born prematurely are at high risk of developing oxidative stress associated conditions [3]. Moreover, ROS in the presence of nitric oxide will cause nitrosative stress predisposing preterm infants to pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension [4]. Prematurity also predisposes to chronic conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) or intra-periventricular hemorrhage (IVP) [3]. Interestingly, maturation is gender related and the use of antenatal steroids enhances antioxidant enzymes' activation thus increasing postnatal adaptability of preterm infants [5]. Oxygen supplementation in the delivery room: What is the normal range of oxygen saturation in the first minutes of life? Preductal pulse oximetry provides reliable values of pre-ductal arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) in 60-90 seconds after birth. In term infants preductal SpO2 rises from ~50% to >90% in the first 5 min after birth. In preterm infants time to achieving SpO2 plateau ~90% takes almost 10-15 min [6] as reflected in Dawson's nomogram [6] (see Figure 1). Measuring saturation in the delivery room: SpO2 is at present the most recommended means of monitoring arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate during resuscitation in the delivery room. Achievement of reliable measurements can be obtained in 60-90 seconds in the right hand or wrist with an adequate training. Of interest is the fact that variability below 70% SpO2 may depend on the type of monitor, gestational age, type of sensor and adjustments of frequency of signaling and sensitivity. Therefore, persistent low values should be always confirmed with arterial blood gas analysis. Furthermore, SpO2 values above 93-95% may correspond to hyperoxic paO2 values [7]. At present preterm babies are frequently supported in the DR with a face mask or nasal prongs. The use of these devices will slightly modify achievement of targeted saturations in the first minutes after birth. In a very recent study it has been shown that preterm babies and especially females receiving positive pressure and air attain higher saturations earlier as those spontaneously breathing [8]. Oxygen supplementation in preterm infants: Preterm infants and especially <32 weeks gestation often need respiratory support and oxygen supplementation immediately after birth to adequately perform postnatal adaption. ILCOR recommends using blended air and oxygen according to the infant's needs guided by pulse oximetry trying to avoid hyper-and/or-hypoxia [2]. Interestingly, most preterm infants are not born severely asphyxiated and will just need a mild positive pressure support to stabilize thoracic cage, favor fluid resorption in the lower airways and expand sacculae [7]. The targeted range of SpO2 in the DR should be in the range of 60% in the first minutes, reach around 80% at five minutes and should not be reaching values around 90% until 10-15 minutes after birth have elapsed [6] thus aiming to avoid the risk of causing increased oxidative stress and damage in babies with lower antioxidant capacity. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials it was found a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death pooled risk ratio 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.43, 0.98) for preterm babies who were ventilated with an initial FiO2 < 50%. However, this effect disappeared when only the four trials with adequate allocation concealment were included [pooled risk ratio 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.45, 2.24)]. It was concluded that with the available data there is not sufficient evidence to affirm that the use of lower or higher initial FiO2 in the delivery room for preterm babies confers important benefits or harms [9]. However, after this study was published new information has been substantiated that has not been yet analyzed but that may permit reaching sufficient evidence to establish new guidelines for the use of oxygen in the delivery room [10]. In a recent commentary by experts it was recommended to use of an initial FiO2 between 21% and 30% in all preterm infants under preductal pulse oximeter control. Thereafter, FiO2 should be titrated according to the SpO2 readings with changes performed ever 30 seconds to allow babies cardio-respiratory response. Heart rate is extremely sensitive to hypoxia, and bradycardia is the most reliable parameter of an adequate response to resuscitation maneuvers. If the baby is not adequately ventilated because of mask leakage, insufficient tidal volume, or flow volume increasing oxygen concentration will be unsuccessful. However, if the baby is adequately ventilated FiO2 should be titrated according to the readings of the pulse oximeter and kept within the recommended range of Dawson's nomogram [6,7].","group":"g1","id":"358ca732-e8cf-456b-b393-f5770ac797a1","_showDetails":true},"b34f74e2-6e9f-41e0-8a12-08dc5deae740":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"613016892","title":"Nutritional interventions to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Manzoni P.","Mostert M.","Franco C.","Luparia M.","Tavella E.","Stronati M.","Farina D."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["acceleration","adverse drug reaction","animal model","arm muscle","artificial ventilation","asthma","bovine","brain hemorrhage","breast feeding","breast milk","*caloric intake","catch up growth","chemical binding","child","chronic lung disease","clinical trial","colostrum","controlled study","death","diet restriction","differentiation","disease model","drug combination","drug megadose","enteric feeding","epithelium","exposure","fat intake","feeding difficulty","female","gastrointestinal tract","growth rate","guinea pig","hemolytic anemia","human","immune system","infancy","infant","internalization","intrauterine growth retardation","Lactobacillus","lower respiratory tract infection","lung development","*lung dysplasia","lung function","lung weight","major clinical study","male","maturation","metabolic rate","neonatal intensive care unit","newborn","newborn morbidity","newborn period","nomenclature","nonhuman","normal human","nutrient supply","nutritional status","oral drug administration","oxidation","oxidative stress","perinatal period","postnatal growth","precursor","prevention","protein intake","protein synthesis","*retrolental fibroplasia","school child","sepsis","side effect","stomach","toxicity","very low birth weight","weight gain","wellbeing","wheezing","alpha tocopherol","antifungal agent","antioxidant","endogenous compound","glucocorticoid","inositol","iron","*lactoferrin","lung surfactant","oxygen","phospholipid","placebo","proteinase","reactive oxygen metabolite","retinol","selenium","surfactant","trace element","*vitamin D","*xanthophyll","zeaxanthin","zinc"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"Supplement 2","publisher":"W.B.

NICU = neonatal intensive care unit NEC = necrotizing enterocholitis ROP = retinopathy of prematurity BPD = bronchopulmonary dysplasia Abstract: Nutrients in the prenatal and perinatal period play a major role in the development of the immune system as well as in the ability to contrast infections. A remarkable body of evidence supports the hypothesis that availability of specific, essential nutrients in these periods is critical for the development and appropriate maturation of the respiratory tract. The lungs have been shown to be the target of the actions of a large number of nutrients which condition, directly or not, the onset of chronic lung disease and/or BPD in preterm infants. Decreased intakes of some of these nutrients have been associated with increased odds of developing BPD in preterm infants. Some of these nutrients play a preventative role thus contrasting respiratory infections and morbidity also during the first months of life. The present review aims at updating the current knowledge about the role of nutrition and specific nutrients in the prevention and management of BPD and - more generally - of respiratory morbidity in neonates and young infants. Introduction - nutritional needs of infants at risk of BPD: It is a common finding that preterm infants with ongoing BPD grow poorly in the NICU. Consistent evidence shows that VLBW preterm neonates with major morbidity including BPD have worse growth than VLBW without, and that the impaired growth sometimes extends over the first few years of life [1]. The question is: why do infants with BPD grow slowly? A number of reasons may account for this. Increased work required to breath, early use of corticosteroids, pre-existing intrauterine growth retardation, early postnatal growth retardation, or feeding problems related to inadequate intake or high metabolic rate [2,3]. In the latter case, decreased and inadequate nutritional intakes could be the key factor giving rise to decreased ability of the lungs to grow and differentiate, thus closing a vicious circle that is difficult to overcome. Historical studies on animal models (guinea pigs) give evidence that adequate nutrient supply plays an important role in growth and repair of the immature lung. In these experiments, guinea pigs exposed to food restriction displayed significantly reduced body and lung weight compared with fed controls [4]. The rate of pulmonary protein synthesis determined in vivo was reduced by 33%, thus impairing not only growth, but also repair ability of the immature lungs. Adequate nutrient supply is even more critical when considering that energy needs of infants with BPD is 15% to 25% above healthy controls [5], thus an energy intake of 140 to 150 kcal/kg/d may be necessary during periods of active disease. In line with this, both ESPGHAN statements and Cochrane reviews acknowledge that a higher caloric intake is beneficial for infants with BPD [6,7], thus prompting clinicians to face the difficulties to increase the feeds to an infant who is - per se - poorly responsive to such strategies since he is often mechanically ventilated and/or fed via orogastric tube. In addition, when infants with BPD achieve full enteral feedings and have similar protein-energy intakes to control infants, they often demonstrate similar rates of growth and arm muscle and fat accretion, but do not demonstrate catch-up growth. These observations support the speculation that early reductions in growth velocity contribute to the long-term growth failure in infants with BPD. According to this, currently it appears appropriate to assume that the protein needs of preterm infants with BPD are at least comparable to the protein needs of those without the disease, and therefore, protein intakes of 3.5 to 4 g protein/kg should be provided to meet needs for growth and anabolism. The role of lipid intake in infants with BPD also needs further investigation, in view of a possible correlation between early trophic feeding and BPD and between early versus delayed initiation of progressive enteral feedings for parenterally fed low birth weight infants and BPD. The role of specific nutrients: The neonatal period: Several studies have examined and demonstrated the properties of human milk in preventing many diseases of newborns and preterms infants, including infection, NEC, ROP, CLD / BPD. The mechanism that seems to be at the basis of this protective role is the presence in breast milk of numerous anti-oxidant agents (Vitamins E, A, D, inositol, lactoferrin, especially carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, enzymes and anti-oxidants), which contrast oxidative stress, in turn implicated in the pathogenesis of the above listed diseases. The beneficial effect of human milk has been found to depend on the amounts ingested by the infant. A study exploring neonatal morbidities found out that the proportion of VLBWinfants featuring chronic lung disease dropped dramatically by 50% (from 37% to 19%) by increasing the average quantity of maternal milk ingestion to at least 50 ml/kg/day over the stay in NICU [8]. Vitamin A is essential for development and growth of the lung, as well as for integrity and healing of the epithelium lining the respiratory tract. Vitamin A also upregulates genes involved in alveolarization and surfactant production [9]. Preterm infants at birth have low levels of vitamin A and this has been associated with an increased risk of developing respiratory disease. Supplementation with vitamin A in these children has multiple beneficial effects, including reducing death or oxygen requirement at one month of age (typical RR 0.93, RD -0.05, NNT 20), reducing oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (typical RR 0.87, RD -0.08, NNT 13) and reducing death or oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (typical RR 0.91) [10]. According to this, administration of vitamin A is currently recommended in all VLBW infants. Inositol is an essential precursor of phospholipids, promoting maturation of several components of surfactant, and potentiating the glucocorticoid induced acceleration of differentiation of lung surfactant. Adequate nutritional intakes of inositol can prevent or decrease drastically the incidence of some negative outcomes of prematurity, including BPD. In line with this, inositol supplementation results in statistically significant and clinically important reductions in important short-term adverse neonatal outcomes, including BPD [11]. Vitamin E is an important anti-oxidant agent and its administration in VLBW infants has been proposed for the prevention of ROP, hemolytic anemia, intracranial hemorrhage, and also chronic lung disease. BPD has been assessed in six studies of vitamin E supplementation, involving 558 treated patients and 569 controls. From these studies, vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk of BPD (typical estimate RR 0.91, RD -0.02). Toxicity and side effects related to high doses of vitamin E have been described [12]. The postnatal, early infancy period: During early infancy, the available evidence in literature shows that duration of breastfeeding and the general nutritional status, rather than specific nutrients, impact on airway infections and respiratory morbidity. Nonetheless, recent studies have highlighted the importance of some specific nutrients, such as, zinc and other micronutrients, lactoferrin, vitamin D, lutein and carotenoids. A recent study evaluated the pulmonary function of 12 year old children born from mothers with asthma, comparing those who were breastfed with those who were not. Lung function was significantly better in children previously breastfed, even though their mothers had asthma, than in children not breastfed. This improvement was even more pronounced if breastfeeding was extended beyond 4 months of age [13]. Several nutritional interventions have been evaluated over the years with the aim of reducing the risk of lower respiratory tract infections in early childhood. Most results are inconclusive. Only supplementation with zinc, as well as use of milk fortified with micronutrients (iron, zinc, selenium, copper, vitamins A, E and C) have proved to be effective in meeting endpoints [14]. A strong association exists between respiratory infections and inadequate growth, suggesting the need for interventions to decrease the incidence of underweight children and LBW (low birth weight). The balance between weight gain and respiratory well being, however, is very delicate, and perhaps still not entirely clear, as underlined by recent evidence indicating that the presence of asthma symptoms in preschool age may be associated with increased weight (children with excessive weight gain may be more frequently affected by episodes of recurrent wheezing) [15]. Lactoferrin is the most important protein in breast milk. Its concentration is much higher in colostrum than in mature milk and has a homology of 77% with lactoferrin present in bovine milk (in fact they have the same action and the same internalization by gut). Both have a very high survival during passage through the stomach after oral administration. The biological functions of lactoferrin are numerous, and among them anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating, anti-fungal, antibacterial actions, and inhibition of proteases. Lactoferrin can inhibit the formation of ROS (reactive oxygen species), by binding to iron thus attenuating oxidation [16]. One RCT, involving VLBW infants from 11 different Italian NICU, assessed the effects of administration of 100 mg/day of bovine lactoferrin alone or together with Lactobacillus CG compared with placebo, in preventing sepsis.","group":"g1","id":"b34f74e2-6e9f-41e0-8a12-08dc5deae740","_showDetails":true},"2e364881-0ba9-4e57-a47d-04767cd3395c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"613015235","title":"Lung function in infants","authors":["Sanchez-Solis M.","Garcia Marcos L."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["airway obstruction","asthma","atopic dermatitis","atopy","biopsy","body height","breathing rate","bronchus hyperreactivity","child","cohort analysis","compression","conductance","controlled study","eosinophil","exposure","female","first trimester pregnancy","forced expiratory flow","forced expiratory volume","forced vital capacity","functional residual capacity","gene frequency","gene mutation","genetic susceptibility","haplotype","high risk infant","human","human tissue","infancy","infant","*lung function test","maternal smoking","meta analysis","newborn","normal human","phenotype","preschool child","prospective study","respiratory tract infection","risk factor","school child","single nucleotide polymorphism","smoking","statistical significance","wheezing","beta 2 adrenergic receptor","endogenous compound","glutathione transferase","glutathione transferase P1","glutathione transferase T1","histone deacetylase 4","natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3","nitric oxide","retinoic acid receptor","sonic hedgehog protein","tobacco smoke"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"Supplement 2","publisher":"W.B.

The knowledge of lung function in newborn and infants, should help us to understand the physiology of the illness in wheezing infants, evolution of lung disease from prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and in cystic fibrosis which are the most frequent chronic respiratory diseases in the first two years of life. Wheeze infants: In infants with recurrent wheeze it has been shown a worse lung function compared with healthy matched infant; by mean of the rapid compression technique, it has been possible to show that the maximal flow at functional residual capacity (V'maxFRC) is already diminished in wheeze infants in the first year of life [1,2], suggesting airway obstruction in those infants. Recently, by mean of raised-volume rapid thoraco-abdominal compression technique (RVRTC), after adjustment for sex, age, body length at test and maternal smoking, significant reductions in z-scores for forced expiratory flow at 0.5 seconds (FEV0.5), in forced expiratory flow at 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF75) and in forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25-75) were observed in infants with recurrent wheeze when compared with controls, but not in forced vital capacity (FVC) showing an obvious obstructive airway pattern in recurrent wheeze infants [3]. So the conclusion is that, with different methods of assessment, lung function is reduced in patients suffered recurrent lower respiratory illness (LRI), compared with healthy infants. The first study designed to determine whether early childhood respiratory illness led to decreases in lung function or a low lung function previous to the first airway infection led to an increased risk for wheezing, was the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study. In this prospective study of 124 infants enrolled as newborns, was shown that the risk of having a wheezing illness was 3.7 times higher (95% CI, 0.9-15.5; p = 0.06) among infants whose values for total respiratory conductance (the reciprocal of the resistance to air flow of the entire respiratory system) were in the lowest third, as compared with infants with values in the upper two thirds of the range of values for the group [4]. Seven more cohort studies [5-12], by means of different methods of assessment of lung function, demonstrated consistently a premorbid lower lung function in wheeze infants compared with healthy ones. Majority of these studies were developed assessing lung function with V'maxFRC, however the recent data published from the Southamptom cohort (ALSPAC study) [12] shown that reduction in forced expiratory volume at 0.4 seg (FEV0.4), measured before the 14 weeks of age, is a risk factor to wheeze. This study, for the first time, demostrated too that lower lung function in early infancy is a risk factor for non-atopic wheeze rather than atopic wheeze. The conclusion can only be that some children were born with an obstructive airway pattern and they are in risk to suffer LRI. The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study concludes that diminished initial airway function may be a predisposing factor, not only for the first episode of wheezing, but also for recurrent wheezing respiratory illnesses starting in the first year of life [5]. As it is known, they described three phenotypes based in having recurrent wheezing during first three years of life, evaluated at 6 years of age; transient wheeze (these patients had had at least one wheeze lower respiratory illness during the first 3 years of life but had no wheezing at 6 years), persistent wheeze (they had wheezing both before 3 years of age and at 6 years) and late wheeze (had no wheezing in the first 3 years but had wheezing at 6 years of age), and the most important difference between transient and persistent wheeze infants was that the transient wheeze group had diminished lung function, evaluated by mean of V'maxFRC, both in infancy (previously to the first episode) and at 6 years of age when compared to children who never wheezed. But the persistent wheeze group had V'maxFRC values in infancy that were no different from those of the children who never wheezed and by age 6 years, however, had the lowest lung function with a significant reduction in V'maxFRC [13]. In contrast with the Tucson's study, the cohort of Perth [14] demostrated a relationship between reduction in V'maxFRC at 1 month of age and persistence of wheeze at 4-6 years and even at 11 years of age. Those children with no wheeze from 3 years of age (transient wheeze) have normal V'maxFRC when neonate. As in Tucson's study, a lower infant lung function (V'maxFRC) was seen in transient group from the cohort of Southampton (ALSPAC). But furthermore, in the ALSPAC study, V'maxFRC was reduced in persistent wheeze group. Although there is a clear tendency in a reduction of FEV0.4 in persistent wheeze group, no association was seen between infant FEV0.4 and any phenotype, probably because the limited number of lung function test performed in infant of this group [12]. Recently has been published the results of the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) [15], a cohort of 411 high risk infants whose mothers were asthmatic. In this study the authors found that children who developed asthma by age 7 had reduced airflow when neonate: forced expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity (FEF50) (p = 0.03) and FEV0.5 very close of the statistical significance (p = 0.07). An increased bronchial responsiveness as neonates is related with asthma at 7 years of age, too. This airflow deficit progressed in the first 7 years of life suggesting that disease mechanisms are operating before and after birth. Some risk factors have been described to explain this, very early in life, worse lung function: * Prenatal tobacco exposure. A very recent and large pooled analysis of eight birth cohorts with data on more than 21,000 children showed that maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with wheeze and asthma in preschool children. The likelihood to develop wheeze and asthma increased statistically significantly in a linear dose-dependent manner in relation to maternal daily cigarette consumption during the first trimester of pregnancy [16]. There is accumulating evidence that exposure to parental smoking is associated with impaired lung function during infancy, which is likely to persist. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and in the early months of life remains the most significant source of such exposure. The most consistent finding, from all studies of infant lung function, is of reduced flows at low lung volumes, which may reflect more extensive underlying pathological and functional alterations in the distal airways [17]. Most of the studies, describes a lose in expiratory flows (V'maxFRC [18-24], FEV0.5 [26], FEF50 and FEF25-75 [27]); but at least, a study described a reduction in FRCHe [19] too. * Gene polymorphisms. Recently, from the Southampton Women's Survey Study [23] has been published that five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), relating to four genes, showed significant associations with infant lung function: Hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) was associated with compliance; Retinoic acid receptor b (RARB) was associated with V'maxFRC; the Natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3 (NCR3) respiratory rate and the histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was associated with both compliance and V'maxFRC. On the other hand, different SNPs in Glutathione S-Transferase gens (GSTT1, GSTP1) both in mothers and in infants were associated with a diminished V'maxFRC and bronchial hyperreactivity in infant exposed to tobacco smoke in utero [25]. Neonatal V'maxFRC was reduced in those possessing Gln27 or Arg16 alleles, however there was no effect of beta-2 adrenoceptor gen polymorphisms on FEV1 at 10 years [26]. Conversely, the study from Zhang et al. [27] found no association of haplotypes of beta2-adrenoceptor polymorphisms with infant lung function (V'maxFRC), although they found that some SNPs are associated with lung function and bronchial hyperreactivity later in life (6 and 11 years of age). * Atopy and inflammation. Atopy has been studied as another risk factor for diminishing lung function in the first years of life. The article published by Haland et al. [11] shows that children (less than 2 years of age) with both recurrent LRI and atopic eczema had significantly lower tPTEF/tE at 2 yr and at birth, compared with children with no recurrent LRI or atopic eczema. The study conducted by Debley et al. [28] found no correlation between enrollment single breath exhaled nitric oxide and enrollment lung function, but was associated with a decline in FEV0.5, FEF25-75 and FEF75 over 6 months; a 10 ppb increase in single breath exhaled nitric oxide was associated with a 0.4 z-score decline in FEV0.5, a 0.4 z-score decline in FEF25-75, and a 0.42 z-score decline in FEF75, suggesting a loss of expiratory flows as a consequence of eosinophilic inflammation. In a study from Malmstrom et al. [29], lung function and endobronchial biopsy were obtained; the study failed to show relationship between lung function and histological findings, perhaps because of the small sample.","group":"g1","id":"2e364881-0ba9-4e57-a47d-04767cd3395c","_showDetails":true},"f723cc4c-26f1-42a0-b28b-d76051d16172":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985436","title":"Longitudinal differences in the airway microbiome in premature infants: Changes that predict the development of bpd","authors":["Lohmann P.","Welty S.","Luna R.A.","Hollister E.B.","Runge J.K.","Shang Y.","Versalovic J."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*microbiome","*prematurity","*infant","*human","*American","*society","*airway","genus","chorioamnionitis","female","Klebsiella","Staphylococcus","Acinetobacter","phylum","tracheal aspiration procedure","microbial community","chronic lung disease","intubation","pregnancy","lung dysplasia","extubation","Proteobacteria","Firmicutes","diagnosis","mother","patient","microflora","oxygen consumption","examination","community","library","hypothesis","bacterial DNA","RNA 16S","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.

The relationship between microbial communities in tracheal aspirates and BPD is unknown. Hypothesis: Patterns of respiratory microbiota will differ among ventilated preterm infants born to mothers with and without chorioamnionitis and infants developing BPD. Method(s): 25 subjects, born <=32 weeks of gestation and intubated in the first 24 hr of life were enrolled. Tracheal aspirates were obtained at time of intubation, day of life (dol) 3, 7 and 28 or at time of extubation. Bacterial DNA was extracted from specimens and sequence libraries were constructed by amplification of the V1V3 and V3V5 regions of 16S rRNA using universal bar-coded primers. Utilizing 454 sequencing, an average of 3,000 reads per region was obtained with an average read length over 500 bases. Resulting sequences were analyzed using the Genboree Microbiome Workbench. Chorioamnionitis was determined by histological examination. BPD was defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks post menstrual age. Results A total of 8 phyla and 53 genera were detected. In the patients in whom more than 1 sample was obtained, decreasing bacterial diversity was noted, accompanied by decreasing Acinetobacter, increasing Staphylococcus and Klebsiella. Decreased diversity was noted when comparing the initial specimens in the chorioamnionitis (30 genera) group to the non affected subjects (43 genera), but it was not significant. Significant differences were noted in the bacterial community when comparing infants with and without a diagnosis of BPD. The phylum-level analysis showed, as a function of time, increasing Firmicutes and decreasing Proteobacteria in the BPD group compared to a relatively stable community in the subjects that did not develop BPD. This trend was also present in the genus-level characterization with 36 genera identified in the BPD group and 49 genera in the non-BPD group. Acinetobacter was the predominant genus across all groups, but Staphylococcus and Klebsiella were in greater abundance in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group. As a function of time, the BPD group exhibited steadily decreasing Acinetobacter paired with steadily increasing Staphylococcus and Klebsiella.","group":"g2","id":"f723cc4c-26f1-42a0-b28b-d76051d16172","_showDetails":false},"ef024bc2-1354-4496-90e0-a665248abb58":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985269","title":"Hyperoxia-induced changes in estradiol metabolism in neonatal lung","authors":["Martin Y.N.","Dong J.","Pabelick C.M.","Wigle D.","Prakash Y.S."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*metabolism","*lung","*American","*society","mouse","human","lung dysplasia","cell proliferation","exposure","oxygen therapy","upregulation","hypothesis","newborn","estrogen metabolism","asthma","airway smooth muscle cell","prematurity","in vitro study","microarray analysis","estrogen synthesis","hypoxia","gene","genome","ambient air","lung parenchyma","newborn disease","*estradiol","estrogen receptor","sex hormone","oxygen","enzyme","2 methoxyestradiol","estrogen","protein","messenger RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"J.

Considerable evidence links oxygen exposure to development of neonatal diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma. There is a known sex preference for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but the role of sex steroids (maternal or fetal) is not clear. Understanding the role of local lung metabolism of sex steroids in hyperoxia effects on the immature lung may help to further elucidate mechanisms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that altered local generation of estradiol or estrogen receptor expression with hyperoxia contributes to pathophysiologic changes observed with oxygen treatment in the fetal or neonatal lung. Methods and Results: mRNA expression in postnatal mouse lung was obtained from four groups of mice: room air vs. 80% hyperoxia for 14 vs. 29 days (n=2-3/group) using an Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. Twelve genes related to estrogen receptors, estrogen synthesis and metabolism were expressed in mouse lung. Microarray analysis showed CYP1a1 - an enzyme responsible estradiol metabolism - with the most significant change in expression after 14 days hyperoxia. Therefore, in vitro studies were performed in human fetal airway smooth muscle cells (fASM) exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia and probed for expression of proteins involved in estrogen metabolism. Proliferation studies were performed in in the presence of estradiol. In fASM cells, CYP1a1 expression was altered with hyperoxia exposure while the enhanced cell proliferation observed in hyperoxia was blunted with estradiol. Pharmacologic inhibition studies indicate that this could be attributed to upregulation of CYP1a1 enzyme and subsequent increased metabolism of estradiol to a downstream intermediate 2-methoxyestradiol. Conclusion(s): The goal of this study was to characterize the expression pattern of pathways involved in estrogen signaling and metabolism in the presence of hyperoxia. These results are the first to specifically study estradiol metabolism in fetal and early postnatal lung tissue and its relationship to hyperoxia. The alterations in CYP1a1 expression and changes in cell proliferation with estradiol (and reversal with inhibition of CYP1a1) all suggest CYP1a1 as a potential mechanism for the protective effect of estradiol in the hyperoxia exposed immature lung.","group":"g3","id":"ef024bc2-1354-4496-90e0-a665248abb58","_showDetails":true},"e99fd789-d6eb-4568-a753-36edfdb43bf7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985268","title":"The effects of hyperoxia on bone morphogenetic pathway in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells","authors":["Arawiran J.","Calo J.M.","Parton L.","Olson S."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*human","*bone","*society","*endothelium cell","*American","*hyperoxia","phosphorylation","exposure","lung dysplasia","cells by body anatomy","apoptosis","assay","upregulation","morbidity","primary culture","incubator","cell culture","gas","Western blotting","culture medium","protein expression","nutrition","pathogenesis","prevention","oxygen","transforming growth factor beta","receptor","bone morphogenetic protein","endothelial nitric oxide synthase","cytokine","trypsin","antibody","protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"J.

Expression of BMP as well as their receptor, BMPRII, and downstream targets such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), may influence pathological processes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD remains to be a common morbidity in the NICU despite advances in gentle ventilatory strategies, limitation of hyperoxia exposure, and nutrition. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of hyperoxia on BMP4, phosphorylated eNOS, total eNOS and BMPRII expression in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs). Method(s): HPAECs were cultured in endothelial cell culture medium and maintained in a sterile humidified cell culture incubator at 37oC with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged at 70-80% confluence with trypsin. Primary cultures of passage 5-6 were used in the experiments. HPAECs were plated in 6 well plates and exposed to hyperoxic gas with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for up to 72 hours and cell lysates were collected at 24, 48 and 72h. Antibodies to BMP4, eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS and BMPRII were used in Western blot assays to determine protein expression. Result(s): (Figure presented) Discussion/Conclusion: Preliminary results show that BMP4 expression is decreased in HPAECs exposed to hyperoxia for 72h (Fig 1). Published reports as well as work done in our lab show that BMP influences phosphorylation of eNOS. As such, the effect of hyperoxia on eNOS phosphorylation and eNOS protein expressed was assessed. eNOS phosphorylation was decreased with exposure to high oxygen for 72h (Fig2). Initial upregulation of eNOS expression was seen at 24h but returned to basal levels by 72h (Fig 2). In addition, BMPRII appears to be decreasing with increasing duration of oxygen exposure (Fig 3). Overall, preliminary results demonstrate that hyperoxia decreased BMP4 expression and eNOS phosphorylation at 72h. Information from our studies may provide insight into a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of BPD and ultimately may provide new pharmacological targets for its prevention and treatment.","group":"g1","id":"e99fd789-d6eb-4568-a753-36edfdb43bf7","_showDetails":true},"6c5b5017-3281-4fcd-958b-c245a0c407b1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985265","title":"T-cells are preferentially expressed following neonatal hyperoxia in adult mice","authors":["Kumar V.H.S.","Wang H.","Nielsen L."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*T lymphocyte","*hyperoxia","*adult","*mouse","*American","*society","gene","infant","cell proliferation","lung","human","gene expression","infection","immunoregulation","adaptive immunity","newborn","oxidative stress","B lymphocyte","hypothesis","lung dysplasia","T lymphocyte activation","respiratory system","cell activation","data analysis","lymphocytic infiltration","cytokine response","B lymphocyte activation","lung compliance","gene expression profiling","exposure","ambient air","immune response gene","childhood","cell cycle","prematurity","newborn period","stimulation","long term exposure","messenger RNA","oxygen"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"V.H.S.

We have previously shown that neonatal hyperoxia alters lung compliance, cytokine response & induces lymphocyte infiltration of the lung in adult mice. Infants who survive BPD are susceptible to infections particularly of the respiratory tract. We plan to test the hypotheses that oxidative stress from neonatal hyperoxia may disrupt immunoregulation and produce changes in adaptive immune responses in adult mice. Objective(s): To determine the adaptive immune response gene expression following neonatal hyperoxia in adult mice. Method(s): Newborn litters were randomized at 3d to 85% O2 or room air (RA) for 12d. On d15 following exposure, half were sacrificed & the rest were recovered in RA until 3 months. Whole lung mRNA was isolated in all the groups (N=4 in each group; RA & O2 at 12d & 3 months). Gene expression profiling by RT-qPCR was performed on a focused panel of genes representing T-cell / B-cell activation (84 genes) (SA Biosciences, MD). Data was analyzed by PCR array data analysis web portal. A fold change of > 4 & p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results - 12d hyperoxia increased p21 expression and decreased expression of 23 genes representing T/B activation > 4 fold; three of them significantly (cd1d1, Il4 & rag1) compared to the RA group (Table 1). However, no differences were noted between the RA & O2 groups at 3 months. Adult mice at 3 months decreased expression of p21 and increased expression of 11 genes, 6 of them significantly (cd28, cd40Ig, cd3d, cd3e, Il27) (Table 1). (Table presented) Conclusions - Hyperoxia decreased gene expression involved in T-cell/B-cell activation along with cell proliferation, as suggested by increased expression of p21, an inhibitor of cell proliferation. However, adult mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia, preferentially increased expression of genes involved in T-cell activation, differentiation & proliferation. This selective T-cell response & proliferation was accompanied by a decreased expression of p21. This suggests that p21, a cell cycle regulator, may be involved in immune regulation, particularly T-cell proliferation. P21 may confer proliferation advantages to T-cells over B-cells in adult mice following prolonged stimulation by oxygen in the newborn period. This has implications following BPD in premature newborns. Altered T-cell responses might explain the potential for higher infections in childhood in these infants.","group":"g1","id":"6c5b5017-3281-4fcd-958b-c245a0c407b1","_showDetails":true},"66e673ee-5f59-4dbc-afef-1f556ad03789":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985261","title":"Hyperoxia activates WNT/beta-catenin signaling in neonatal rat lungs","authors":["Demirel N.","Chen S.","Rong M.","Wu S."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*rat","*lung","*American","*society","immunohistochemistry","immunofluorescence","Western blotting","ambient air","pathogenesis","lung alveolus wall","lung injury","staining","premature labor","lung dysplasia","university","pediatrics","cell membrane","cytoplasm","newborn","protein expression","gene expression","exposure","gene","lung development","therapy","extracellular matrix","United States","school","*catenin","connective tissue growth factor","synapsin I","protein","ligand"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"N.

BPD is increasingly recognized as the results of deranged development and disregulated extracellular matrix remodeling in the immature lung. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays an important role in lung development and remodeling. However, the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in BPD pathogenesis is poorly understood. Objective(s): To determine the temporal-spatial expression of Wnt signaling molecules in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats, an experimental BPD. Method(s): Newborn rat pups were randomized within 24 h after birth to receive room air (21% O2) or hyperoxia (90% O2) for 15 days. Lungs were collected on postnatal day (P) 2, 4, 8 and 15 for assessing expression of Wnt7b, beta-catenin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and Wnt-inducible signaling protein 1 (WISP1) by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, Western Blot and quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR. Data are expressed as mean +/- SD with n = 5/group. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure increased gene expression of Wnt7b by 2.5 fold (P<0.01) at P2, CTGF by 3 fold (P<0.01) at P4, and WISP1 by 1.5 fold (P<0.05) at P8. Western blot analysis demonstrated a 2 fold increase (P<0.05) in WISP1 protein expression in hyperoxic lungs at P8. Immunostaining demonstrated a diffused and increased WISP1 expression in the thickened alveolar septa in hyperoxia-exposed lungs at P8 and P15. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that in hyperoxia-exposed lungs b-catenin is localized in the nuclei in thickened alveolar septa from P4 to P15 as compared to room air lungs where it is localized in cytoplasm and cell membrane. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury is associated with activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling as demonstrated by increased expression of Wnt7b (Wnt ligand), and CTGF and WISP1 (Wnt target genes), and nuclear translocation of b-catenin (Wnt signaling protein). Further studies are needed to better understand the role of WISP1 in the pathogenesis of BPD and design novel therapies targeting WISP1 in preventing and treating this disease.","group":"g1","id":"66e673ee-5f59-4dbc-afef-1f556ad03789","_showDetails":true},"21652040-c697-4e2d-a798-c55527ecfbd9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71984904","title":"Pulmonary hypertensive responses to chronic hypoxia are amplified in mice recovering from previous hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in a ros-dependent manner","authors":["Berkelhamer S.K.","Ball M.K.","Kim G.","Schumacker P.T."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*hypertension","*hypoxia","*mouse","*hyperoxia","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","pH","oxidative stress","lung development","exposure","pulmonary hypertension","mare","newborn","protein expression","vascular remodeling","hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension","therapy","heart","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","echocardiography","systolic blood pressure","acceleration","lung","risk","heart catheterization","infant","lung injury","newborn period","messenger RNA","acetylcysteine","antioxidant","protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.K.

The long-term consequences of BPD-associated PH are unknown, and the possibility that it renders infants more vulnerable to PH later in life has not been explored. We hypothesize that mice with altered lung development associated with experimental BPD are at greater risk of developing PH in response to later pulmonary challenges. We assessed response to chronic hypoxia as a second hit to determine if prior existence of BPD enhances hypoxia-induced PH. Mice were treated with N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) to determine the role of oxidant stress in that response. Method(s): Newborn C57Bl/6 mice were maintained in 21%O2 (control) or 75%O2 (BPD) for 2w with daily rotation of dams. Control and BPD mice were subsequently recovered in 21%O2 for 2w prior to exposure to 4w of 21%O2 (normoxia) or 10%O2 (chronic hypoxia). Some mice were treated with NAC (1 gm/kg PO daily) during the 28d exposure. All outcomes were determined at 8w. Hearts were analyzed for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Right heart catheterization was performed to determine right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and echocardiography was used to quantify pulmonary acceleration time/ejection time (PAT/ET). Lungs were inflation fixed for morphometric analysis or perfused and harvested for protein and mRNA analysis. Result(s): BPD and control mice demonstrated comparable RVH. RVSP and PAT/ET at 8w (0.26 +/- 0.01 versus 0.25 +/- 0.01; 25.4 +/- 0.4 versus 24.2 +/- 1.2; and 48.4 +/- 0.8 versus 49.4 +/- 0.4) indicating that the BPD-associated PH is reversible. Chronic hypoxia (CH) induced RVH and PH in both BPD and controls, however BPD mice evidenced greater disease by RVH, RVSP and PAT/ET (0.39 +/- 0.01 versus 0.36 +/- 0.01; 31.1 +/- 2.5 versus 26.6 +/- 2.2; and 36.8 +/- 0.8 versus 39.9 +/- 0.9 for BPD+CH versus control+CH). While NAC did not affect hypoxia-induced RVH or PH in control mice, it attenuated hypoxia induced increases in RVH and RVSP in BPD mice (0.39 +/- 0.01 versus 0.34 +/- 0.01 and 31.1 +/- 2.5 versus 25.0 +/- 1.3 in untreated versus NAC treated BPD+CH mice). The greater degree of hypoxia-induced PH in BPD mice did not correlate with morphological evidence of exaggerated vascular remodeling. Increased NOX4 mRNA and protein expression was present in hypoxia-exposed BPD but not hypoxia-exposed control mice. Conclusion(s): Altered lung development in BPD enhances susceptibility to later hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, indicating that effects of neonatal lung injury persist beyond resolution of the initial response. Oxidant stress signaling may underlie this response, suggesting that antioxidant therapies may be effective in limiting pulmonary hypertensive response after the neonatal period.","group":"g1","id":"21652040-c697-4e2d-a798-c55527ecfbd9","_showDetails":true},"c2bf0bc3-d6ac-4735-ab6d-68db04ec24da":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71984901","title":"Retinoids attenuate oxidative stress and impaired alveolar develpment in the newborn mouse lung","authors":["James M.L.","Ross A.C.","Nicola T.","Zhang W.","Ambalavanan N."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*oxidative stress","*mouse","*lung","*American","*society","hyperoxia","lung development","exposure","human","lung function","lung dysplasia","infant","prematurity","supplementation","mouse model","death","randomized controlled trial (topic)","attenuation","oxidation","lung homogenate","Western blotting","tissues","density","plasma","newborn","ambient air","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","high performance liquid chromatography","*retinoid","retinol","protein","retinoic acid","3 nitrotyrosine","retinol ester","platelet derived growth factor","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.L.

Randomized controlled trials indicate VA supplementation decreases BPD and/or death. Vitamin A is metabolized into retinoic acid (RA), and we have previously demonstrated that a 10:1 molar combination of VA and RA (VARA) synergistically increases lung retinol content in newborn mice. Objective(s): To determine whether the biochemical synergistic effect of VARA translates into functional benefits in the attenuation of hyperoxia-induced inhibition of alveolar development. Method(s): Newborn C57BL/6 mice were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) or room air for 7 or 14 days and given vehicle or VARA every other day. Lung retinol content was measured by HPLC, lung function was assessed by flexiVent, and lung development was evaluated by radial alveolar counts and secondary septal crest density. Additionally, mediators of alveolar development and hyperoxia-induced inhibition of alveolar development were evaluated by qPCR, ELISA, and by western blot in lung homogenates. Result(s): VARA attenuated the hyperoxia-induced inhibition of alveolar development(Figure 1) and improved lung function, with higher compliance and lower resistance (Figure 1), associated with increased lung retinyl ester stores. We also found that VARA attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increases in DNA and protein oxidation associated with activation of Nrf2 but with no changes in MDA-adduct or nitrotyrosine concentrations or MPO activity (Figure 2). In addition, VARA attenuated hyperoxia-induced decreases in PDGF-A protein amounts. Conclusion(s): The VARA combination improves lung development and function, and reduces mediators of oxidative stress in the newborn mouse model of hyperoxia exposure.

Claudins are a family of transmembrane proteins that are required for tight junction formation. The lung-specific tight junction protein claudin-18.1 is the most abundant claudin in type 1 (AT1) pneumocytes and is specifically regulated in human alveolar epithelial cells by lung maturation agonists and inflammatory mediators. This study was undertaken to investigate a potential role for claudin-18 in alveolar barrier function and postnatal alveolarization. Method(s): Lungs from a novel claudin-18 knockout (KO) mouse were compared with wildtype (WT) mouse lungs using whole genome microarray, in addition to histological and biochemical analyses of injury. Alveolar epithelial barrier structure and function were investigated in vivo, including ultrastructural evaluation. Claudin-18 levels were measured in preterm human lungs. Result(s): Histological analysis demonstrated similar histology between genotypes at postnatal day 3 but markedly decreased alveolarization in KO mice by 4 weeks of age (Figure 1). Mean linear intercept (inversely proportional to lung surface area) was significantly increased at 4 weeks in KO mice (WT 29.3 +/- 4.2 vs. KO 50.5 +/- 1.3 mum; P<0.05) but not at postnatal day 3 (WT 48.5 +/- 0.9 vs. KO 51.1 +/- 0.7 mum; P=NS). Microarray analysis followed by quantitative real time PCR revealed differential expression of critical genes involved in lung development and angiogenesis in KO mouse lungs by 4 weeks of age. KO mice had evidence of alveolar epithelial barrier disruption by 4 weeks, as measured by: 1) the accumulation of the AT1 specific marker T1-alpha in broncholalveolar lavage fluid (2.7-fold increase over WT, P<0.001); 2) increased accumulation of FITC-albumin in lavage fluid 4 hours after intraperitoneal instillation (WT 58 +/- 28 mug/ml vs. KO 148 +/- 28 mug/ml, P <0.001); and 3) ultrastructural distortion of AT1-AT1 cell junctions in transmission electron microscopy images of KO mouse lungs (Figure 2). Preterm human infants born 24-28 weeks of gestation are at the highest risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a disease characterized by impaired alveolar development. Preterm human lungs (gestational ages 24-32 weeks, n=4) demonstrated decreased mRNA expression of claudin-18 at 24 to 27 weeks gestational age relative to 32 weeks. Conclusion(s): Claudin-18 deficiency in mice results in alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction and delayed alveolarization. Data suggest that extremely preterm human lungs are relatively claudin-18 deficient. Therefore, claudin-18 deficiency or dysfunction may contribute to infant chronic lung disease.

Specific pro-fibrotic pathways have been implicated in the development of BPD in infants and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in adults. miR-17~92 cluster is predicted to suppress activation of these pro-fibrotic pathways. Reductions in miR-17~92 cluster expression in IPF patients directly correlates with diminished pulmonary function and appears to be mediated via promoter hypermethylation. The present studies tested the hypothesis that miR~17-92 expression is decreased and promoter methylation increased in lungs from human patients that died with BPD when compared to lungs from patients that died from without BPD. METHOD(S): Lung samples (BioRepository for Investigation of Neonatal Diseases of the Lung, Dr. Gloria Pryhuber, University of Rochester) obtained at autopsy from patients who died with BPD (n=10) or without BPD (n=7) were analyzed for individual miR~17-92 cluster expression by qRT-PCR. miR-17~92 promoter methylation was determined in lung samples using Methyl-Profiler Assay. RESULT(S): Expression of individual members of the miR-17~92 cluster was decreased by 40-80% in samples from patients with BPD when compared to non-BPD controls. In promoter methylation analyses, miR-17~92 promoter was 50% methylated and 50% unmethylated in non-BPD control samples. In contrast, miR~17-92 promoter was 98% methylated and 2% unmethylated in lung samples from patients with BPD. CONCLUSION(S): Our novel data indicate that miR-17~92 cluster expression is significantly decreased and promoter methylation significantly increased in lungs from patients who died with BPD compared to non-BPD controls. We speculate that promoter methylation decreases miR-17~92 cluster expression in BPD, thus contributing to previously reported elevations in pro-fibrotic gene expression in these patients. Therapies directed at restoring miR-17~92 cluster expression by attenuating DNA methylation could be therapeutically beneficial in prematurely born infants.","group":"g1","id":"11c1474b-fc13-48e8-a097-d71ed84db148","_showDetails":true},"6c49c687-bf94-4020-b31a-a3f305d94cc9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71984897","title":"Agonists of mas oncogene and angiotensin-type 2 receptors attenuate cardiopulmonary disease in rats with neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury","authors":["Wagenaar G.T.M.","Laghmani E.","Fidder M.","Sengers R.M.A.","De Visser Y.P.","De Vries L.","Rink R.","Folkerts G.","Walther F.J."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*oncogene","*rat","*hyperoxia","*lung injury","*American","*society","*agonist","human","prematurity","pneumonia","stimulation","fibrin deposition","lung","infant","injury","thickness","tissues","adult","prophylaxis","arteriole","inflammatory cell","rat model","lung development","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","gene","hypertension","histopathology","lung dysplasia","renin angiotensin aldosterone system","inflammation","precursor","heart","parameters","mortality","respiratory failure","macrophage","exposure","neutrophil","fetus","morbidity","adverse drug reaction","chronic lung disease","*angiotensin","*receptor","ligand","marker","angiotensinogen","messenger RNA","dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase","angiotensin II","oxygen","vasoconstrictor agent","angiotensin receptor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"G.T.M.

Stimulation of MAS oncogene receptor (MAS) or angiotensin (Ang) receptor type 2 (AT2) may be novel therapeutic options for neonatal chronic lung disease (CLD) by counterbalancing the adverse effects of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II after binding to AT1, consisting of arterial hypertension (PAH)-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and pulmonary inflammation. Studies to confirm a beneficial effect of AT2 signaling in cardiopulmonary disease have long been hampered by low expression of the receptor in normal adult tissues and lack of a highly specific agonist for AT2. In this study we have overcome both pitfalls by using a recently developed highly specific agonist in a neonatal rat model for cardiopulmonary disease, in which AT2 expression is expected to be high, due to its high expression in the fetal period. Methods. We determined the cardiopulmonary effects in neonatal rats with CLD of daily treatment during continuous exposure to 100% oxygen for 10 days with specific ligands for MAS (cyclic Ang-(1-7); 10-50 mug/kg/day) and AT2 (LP2-3: dKcAng-(1-7); 5-20 mug/kg/day). Both ligands are highly specific agonist, are resistant against degradation and do not bind to AT1. Parameters investigated included lung and heart histopathology, fibrin deposition, vascular leakage and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, coagulation and alveolar development. Results. The receptors AT1, AT2 and MAS, the precursor of their ligands angiotensinogen and the converting enzymes ACE1 and ACE2 are differentially expressed during lung development and/or in CLD. Prophylactic treatment with agonists for MAS or AT2 (5 mug/kg twice a day) for 10 days diminished cardiopulmonary injury by reducing alveolar septal thickness and medial wall thickness of small arterioles as a marker for PAH, and preventing RVH. Both agonists attenuated the pulmonary influx of inflammatory cells, including macrophages (via AT2) and neutrophils (via MAS), but did not reduce alveolar enlargement and vascular alveolar leakage. The AT2 agonist attenuated fibrin deposition. Conclusion. Stimulation of AT2 or MAS attenuates cardiopulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation and preventing PAH-induced RVH, but does not affect alveolar and vascular development in neonatal rats with experimental CLD. After extrapolating the beneficial effects of AT2 and MAS agonist treatment in rat pups with experimental CLD to preterm infants with respiratory failure, we might expect a beneficial effect of both agonists on PAH and RVH, which are the major reasons for mortality or severe morbidity in preterm infants with severe CLD or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"6c49c687-bf94-4020-b31a-a3f305d94cc9","_showDetails":true},"36962ddb-015c-4cfa-80ba-8fe089cfad37":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71984267","title":"The p66shc adapter protein regulates mouse lung morphogenesis and epithelial maturation","authors":["Lee M.K.","Smith S.M.","Banerjee M.M.","Volpe M.V.","Nielsen H.C."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*mouse","*lung","*morphogenesis","*maturation","*American","*society","explant","lung development","epithelium cell","Adenoviridae","apoptosis","mitochondrion","prematurity","stress","suspension","oxidative stress","lung dysplasia","chronic lung disease","phenotype","gene","LoxP site","organ culture","serum","trachea","airway","Clara cell","infant","digestion","adhesion","fetus lung","*protein","small interfering RNA","growth factor","cycline","thyroid transcription factor 1","smooth muscle actin","differentiation antigen","lung surfactant"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.K.

The p66Shc isoform has anti-mitogenic properties, regulates oxidative stress responses, and participates in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. It is also highly expressed in the canalicular but not the saccular or alveolar stages of mouse lung development, suggesting an important morphogenetic function. Moreover, p66Shc expression persists in the lungs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease that is induced by premature birth. However, constitutive p66Shc deletion yields no morphologic phenotype, and the structure of the Shc gene precludes the incorporation of the LoxP sites necessary for inducible p66Shc deletion. To elucidate its role in lung development, we microinjected Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) suspensions containing 6.6 nM of either isoform-specific p66Shc siRNA or nonsilencing siRNA into the tracheae of E12 mouse lungs. The lung explants were maintained in serum-free organ culture for three days, after which explants were fixed, sectioned, and subjected to morphometric analysis and immunohistochemical assessment of p66Shc; smooth muscle actin (SMA); proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); the proximal airway differentiation antigens Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10) and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1; and the alveolar surfactant proteins (SP) -A, B, and C. Confirmatory studies were performed in primary fetal mouse lung epithelial cells that were isolated from E17 mice by tryptic digestion and differential adhesion, transfected with p66Shc siRNA or nonsilencing siRNA, and simultaneously infected with p66Shc adenovirus or GFP adenovirus. After three days, SP-C expression was assessed by Western analysis. Explants injected with nonsilencing siRNA demonstrated specific epithelial uptake and normal morphological development relative to uninjected explants. In contrast, explants injected with p66Shc siRNA had significantly increased lumenal cross-section areas, decreased branching, and increased epithelial proliferation (p<0.05 for all). Relative to controls, the expression of SP-B, SP-C, CC10, and TTF-1 in fetal lung explants was decreased by p66Shc knockdown. Similarly, SP-C expression in primary epithelial cells was reduced by p66Shc silencing and restored by p66Shc rescue expression. SP-A was not expressed in lungs transfected with either p66Shc or control siRNA, and SMA expression was not altered by p66Shc silencing. Taken together, these data suggest that p66Shc promotes distal and proximal epithelial maturation during normal and pathological lung development.","group":"g1","id":"36962ddb-015c-4cfa-80ba-8fe089cfad37","_showDetails":false},"efa70bf3-f423-462f-97e3-6ec80ec0255d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71984263","title":"Asporin expression in mouse lung alveogenesis and after elastase treatment","authors":["Srisuma S.","Wongkhat L.","Mariani T.J."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*lung","*American","*society","*mouse","gene expression","lung development","statistical significance","lung dysplasia","adult","human","extracellular matrix","hypothesis","architecture","lung emphysema","model","knockout mouse","animal model","emphysema","real time polymerase chain reaction","newborn","RNA purification","lung parenchyma","*elastase","nonoxinol 9","fibroblast growth factor receptor 3","formaldehyde","sodium chloride","protein","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.

Several extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules have been reported to regulate airspace development. Asporin is an ECM protein found to be overexpressed in human lung tissue with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Asporin is also overexpressed in the lungs of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 and 4 knockout mice, a model of BPD displaying abnormal airspace enlargement, a feature common to BPD and pulmonary emphysema. The biology of asporin in lung development and disease has not been explored. Hypothesis : Asporin gene expression is important for mouse alveolar formation, and may be involved in alveolar destruction in an animal model of emphysema resulting from elastase instillation. Methods : C57BL/6 mouse lungs at postnatal day (P) 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 were harvested for RNA purification and quantitative real time - PCR to identify the temporal pattern of asporin expression. We further determined the changes of asporin expression in elastase-induced airspace enlargement. Mice at P60 were treated with normal saline solution or elastase intratracheally. Lungs were isolated at 7 or 21 days after treatment for analysis of asporin gene expression. In addition, lungs were inflated with 10% buffered formalin at 25 cmH2O, and mean liner intercept (MLI) analysis was performed to determine airspace size. Results : Maximal asporin expression in mouse lungs was observed on P14, during the alveolar stage of lung development, when it was ~20-fold greater than in newborn lungs and ~60-fold greater than in adult lungs (P60; P-value < 0.005). In adult lung, 7 days after elastase treatment, asporin expression was significantly increased compared with control (P-value = 0.002). A directly proportional correlation between airspace size and asporin gene expression was observed (R = 0.44, P-value =0.025). Summary : Regulated expression of asporin was observed in the lung during alveogenesis, and during alveolar destruction associated with elastase instillation. These data suggest that this ECM molecule plays a role in alveogenesis and alveolar maintenance.","group":"g1","id":"efa70bf3-f423-462f-97e3-6ec80ec0255d","_showDetails":true},"1af8d33d-0640-4e3c-9469-ccdaee31c00c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71983304","title":"COX-2 regulates alveolar septation and neonatal hyperoxia induced inhibition of lung development","authors":["Olave N.","Pandit K.","Kaminski N.","Halloran B.","Ambalavanan N."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*lung development","*American","*society","mouse","macrophage","lung injury","lung homogenate","gene","density","wild type mouse","newborn","gene expression","lung dysplasia","antiinflammatory activity","wild type","injection","mare","hypothesis","iloprost","microRNA 214","messenger RNA","protein","interleukin 1beta","interleukin 6","microRNA","tumor necrosis factor alpha","nonoxinol 9","prostacyclin","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"N.

Bioinformatic analysis of microarray data indicated that miR-214 (targets COX-2) is important in mouse lung development. As hyperoxia inhibits normal lung development, our hypothesis was that hyperoxia-induced dysregulation of this miRNA and its target gene COX-2 would contribute to abnormal lung development in hyperoxia. METHOD(S): (1) Lung homogenates from C57BL/6 (Wild-type; WT) mice were evaluated at birth, postnatal day 4 (P4), P7, P14, and P42 for miR-214, Cox-2 mRNA and protein. (2) Newborn WT mice along with their dam were exposed to normoxia (21%) or hyperoxia (95% O2) from 4 to 14 days of age in combination with daily i.p. injections of either Iloprost 200ng/kg/day (a commercially available analog of prostacyclin that is downstream of Cox-2) or vehicle. miR-214, and COX-2 mRNA and protein were estimated in lung homogenates; Alveolar development was estimated by Radial Alveolar Counts, Mean Linear Intercepts, and secondary crest density. (4) The effect of Iloprost on TNF-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 production by LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages was determined. RESULT(S): (1) miR-214 decreased over the course of lung development from P4 to P42, with corresponding increases in Cox-2 mRNA and protein (Figure 1). (2) Hyperoxia decreased miR-214, and increased COX-2 mRNA and protein. (3) Iloprost administration attenuated hyperoxia-induced inhibition of lung development in newborn mice as evident by a reduction in MLI and increase in RAC and SCD compared to hyperoxia-exposed mice (Figure 2). (4) Iloprost reduced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 production by mouse macrophages. CONCLUSION(S): miR-214 and its target gene Cox-2 are regulators of lung development, and mediate abnormal lung development during hyperoxia. Iloprost attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury and has anti-inflammatory effects. Augmentation of Cox-2 signaling using Iloprost is a potential therapeutic strategy that may be useful in hyperoxia-induced lung injury, such as in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

BPD is an inflammatory lung injury that leads to alveolar simplification and loss of surface area for gas exchange. Macrophages play key roles in lung injury, repair, and tissue remodeling. Yet little is known about the role these innate immune cells play in normal or aberrant lung development. Consequently, we assessed macrophage phenotypes in a mouse hyperoxia model of inflammatory lung injury that mimics aspects of human BPD. Method(s): Postnatal (PN) day 0, day 10, or adult C57BL/6 mice were placed in 95% FiO2 for up to 5 days; control animals were housed in normoxia conditions. Pulmonary macrophages were isolated and analyzed via flow cytometry utilizing validated cell surface markers. Hyperoxia- and normoxia-treated animals were compared at postnatal day 0 (PN0), PN3, PN5, and adult timepoints. In parallel, total RNA was isolated from whole lungs for gene expression analysis of via qRT2-PCR. Result(s): CD45+/CD11b-/Cd11c+/Siglec F+ cells (markers of the mature alveolar macrophage phenotype in adult mice) were identified in the adult mouse and PN5 lung. This population was notably absent at birth (PNO) but was present by 5 days of life (PN5). After treatment with hyperoxia, PN3, PN5, and PN15 mice lack CD45+/CD11b-/CD11c+ cells but gain a CD45+/CD11b+/CD11c+ population. The largest reduction in CD45+/CD11b-/CD11c cells was seen in the youngest mice. Adult mice were seemingly resistant to this change and retained a pulmonary CD45+/CD11b-/CD11c+ population after 3 days of hyperoxia. In addition, hyperoxia suppressed expression of IL10, Nos2, IL-10, and Arg1 mRNA in neonatal mouse lungs. Conclusion(s): Newborn mice lack CD45+/CD11b-/Cd11c+/SiglecF+ cells, raising the possibility that they lack alveolar macrophages at the time of birth. These cells accumulate in the neonatal lung within the first few days of life. Interestingly, these cells are depleted in neonatal, but not adult, mice exposed to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia also suppresses expression of immunomodulatory genes associated with regulation of macrophage function. These data raise the possibility that hyperoxia is deleterious to the developing lung via alteration of pulmonary macrophage differentiation within a critical developmental window, which may make the neonatal lung more susceptible to injury.","group":"g3","id":"da948ba8-cb91-43ec-8c81-1e142fd6287e","_showDetails":false},"2b4e6aa7-76b1-4b05-952e-c3fdd32082d9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71982858","title":"Expression of CCN5 (cysteine-rich 61-connective tissue growth factor-nephroblastoma-overexpressed protein) in murine alveolar development and response to hyperoxic injury","authors":["Fiaturi N.A.","Nielsen H.C.","Castellot J."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*injury","*American","*society","lung","staining","infant","pregnancy","lung alveolus cell","human","chronic lung disease","lung dysplasia","protein analysis","stain","airway","prematurity","cell proliferation","mouse","mortality","phenotype","cell cycle","smooth muscle fiber","morbidity","wild type","biological functions","wild type mouse","ambient air","lung alveolus epithelium","angiogenesis","Western blotting","lung development","hyperoxia","*cysteine","*connective tissue growth factor","*nephroblastoma overexpressed protein","oxygen","surfactant protein C","antigen"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"H.C.

In particular, these infants are highly likely to develop Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease with arrested alveolarization and hyperreactive airways. The development of the lung during 23-28 weeks of gestation is a complex process involving cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. To understand BPD, new insight is needed into factors which control alveolar development, especially in response to hyperoxic injury. Of novel interest is the factor CCN5 (Cysteine-rich 61-connective tissue growth factor-nephroblastoma-overexpressed protein) which we have previously reported is present in developing alveolar epithelium where its function is unknown. The mechanism of action and biological function of CCN5 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) has received considerable attention. CCN5 in SMCs is a cell cycle regulator that inhibits SMC proliferation and motility while promoting a differentiated phenotype. However, the cell-specific expression and function of CCN5 in alveolar development and injury is unknown. OBJECTIVE(S): To define the role of CCN5 in alveolar epithelial development and in response to hyperoxic injury. METHOD(S): We used neonatal wild-type (WT) C57/B6 mice. Five-day-old neonatal WT mice were exposed to room air (RA) or 90% oxygen (hyperoxia) from days 5 - 13 of life (corresponding to the major period of murine alveolarization). On day 13, pups were sacrificed and used for study. The right lung was fixed, sectioned and used for immunofluoresence staining. The left lung was isolated for protein analysis. RESULT(S): Immunofluoresence co-staining showed that in WT RA pups at day 13 of postnatal life, CCN5 was prominently expressed in type I alveolar cells (identified by stain for T1 antigen). Co-staining for Ki67 showed that CCN5-positive alveolar T1 cells are in active proliferation. Staining for surfactant protein C ( Sftpc) showed type II alveolar cells are not proliferating and do not express CCN5. Western Blot analysis showed that CCN5 expression is greatly reduced in hyperoxic lungs compared to normoxic lungs. CONCLUSION(S): These data indicate CCN5 expression is high in proliferating alveolar type I cells during alveolarization and low or absent in non-proliferating alveolar epitlelium. This is opposite from CCN5 expression in SMCs where CCN5 is expressed in non-proliferating SMCs and absent in proliferating SMCs. We speculate that CCN5 is a functional component controlling alveolar epithelial proliferation during development and the response to injury.","group":"g1","id":"2b4e6aa7-76b1-4b05-952e-c3fdd32082d9","_showDetails":true},"1e1c7524-9755-444e-be6a-eb7afe33c1c6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71982820","title":"Inadequate extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) levels contribute to persistent hyperoxic injury in murine primary alveolar epithelial type II cells","authors":["Poonyagariyagorn H.K.","Malinina A.","Lopez-Mercado A.","Dikeman D.","Mesarwi O.","McGrath-Morrow S.A.","Neptune E.R."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*injury","*American","*society","gene","hyperoxia","lung","cell count","exposure","pathogenesis","model","mouse","inflammation","Student t test","lung dysplasia","prematurity","growth inhibition","whole cell","chronic respiratory tract disease","apoptosis","tumor suppressor gene","oxidative stress","cell growth","statistical significance","*extracellular superoxide dismutase","antioxidant","messenger RNA","marker","transcription factor","glutathione"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"H.K.

We have previously shown that O2 exposure leads to a distinct injury profile and induces several antioxidant genes in an alveolar epithelial whole cell model, but information on O2-exposed primary alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) remains limited. We hypothesize that extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), an antioxidant produced by AECII, might have a different response (downregulation) and thereby contribute to the persistent airspace injury and inflammation observed in BPD. Method(s): Using 6-8 week old C57Bl/6 mice, AECII were isolated and purified using a modification of published methods. Cells were subjected to either RA/5% CO2 versus 95% O2/5% CO2 for 24h. Each individual experiment was performed using a single isolation, with cells pooled from the lungs of three mice. Measures of alveolar injury were obtained, and RT-PCR measured mRNA expression in cells. Values for measurements were expressed as means+/-SEM, and P-values for significance were designated at <0.05. Student's t-tests were used to determine differences between groups. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure significantly reduced total cell counts (Figure 1A) and total glutathione (GSH) levels in O2 versus RA groups, indicating increased oxidative stress (Figure 1B). This correlated with increased mRNA expression of Bax (a pro-apoptotic gene) and p21 (a tumor suppressor gene) (Figure 2). Antioxidant genes mediated by Nrf-2, a major antioxidant transcription factor, were significantly increased for Ho-1, Gclc, and Nqo-1 in the O2 versus RA group (Figure 2). However, SOD1 and SOD2 mRNA expression was similar between the RA and O2 groups. Interestingly, SOD3, an Nrf-2-independent antioxidant, was significantly increased in the O2-exposed cells compared to RA (Figure 2). (Figure Presented) Conclusion(s): AECII exposed to O2 demonstrate decreased cell counts, increased oxidative injury, and increased markers of apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. This was associated with increased mRNA SOD3 expression in O2-exposed AECII, suggesting these SOD3 levels are inadequate to protect cells fully from damage caused by O2. Such findings provide insight into a possible mechanism for the pathogenesis of BPD. Future studies are needed to determine if augmented SOD3 levels or a mimetic can attenuate or reverse the damage found in this particular model.","group":"g1","id":"1e1c7524-9755-444e-be6a-eb7afe33c1c6","_showDetails":true},"4d7a54ac-44a5-4fbd-9c3d-864dbe80f3d7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71982720","title":"Functional polymorphism of matrix metalloproteinase proteinase-9 is associated with high MMP9 expression and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low birth weight infants","authors":["Paudel U.","Mercado V.","Calo J.","Patel N.","Parton L."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*extremely low birth weight","*American","*society","infant","genotype","tracheal aspiration procedure","human","prematurity","chronic obstructive lung disease","lung development","cohort analysis","gestational age","birth weight","hypothesis","pilot study","gene","maturation","statistical significance","adult","Student t test","chi square test","connective tissue","protein degradation","extracellular matrix","real time polymerase chain reaction","chromosome aberration","allele","lung parenchyma","risk","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","analysis of variance","*proteinase","*matrix metalloproteinase","gelatinase B","protein","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"U.

Alveolarization requires coordinated extracellular matrix remodeling, a process in which matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) has proteolytic activity against connective tissue proteins and its functional polymorphism (C-1562T) appears to play an important role in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. We therefore considered the functional polymorphism of MMP-9 (C-1562T) as one of the candidate genes in the susceptibility to BPD. Objective We tested the hypothesis that the MMP 9 rs3918242 SNP is associated with susceptibility to BPD in ELBW infants. Methods This is an ongoing cohort study that enrolls infants weighing <1 kg at birth, without congenital or chromosomal anomalies. BPD is defined as need for O2 at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. DNA was isolated from buccal mucosal swabs (N=110) and subjected to allelic discrimination using specific probes for MMP 9 SNP (C-1562T) during real-time PCR. Tracheal aspirate was collected (N=21) and MMP 9 level measured by ELISA. ANOVA, Chi square analyses and t-test for independent samples were performed with P<0.05 denoting statistical significance. Results As expected, both birth weights and gestational ages were significantly different between the BPD and No-BPD groups. Also, PDA requiring treatment was found significantly higher among infants with BPD. Genotype distributions for this MMP 9 SNP tested was significantly high for BPD (P=0.04). MMP 9 expression in tracheal aspirate was significantly higher among tt genotype as compared to Ct and CC genotype. Conclusions In this pilot study, ELBW preterm infants who progressed to BPD were more likely to contain the minor allele for the MMP-9 (C-1562T). We speculate that the functional increased expression of MMP-9 proteolytic enzyme in lung parenchyma places preterm infants at increased risk for BPD.

Due to the complexity of risk factors and limited availability of clinical samples, an understanding of this disease, potential biomarkers and causal mechanisms are limited. Prematurely born infants requiring supplemental oxygen often develop BPD, as oxidative stress disrupts critical pathways of lung development. Rodent models involving neonatal exposure to excessive oxygen concentrations (hyperoxia) have been used to study the mechanisms contributing to BPD pathology. Transcriptomic assessment of the effects of hyperoxia in neonatal mouse lungs using RNASeq will identify novel genes and pathways associated with BPD. Method(s): We examined gene expression changes in lung tissue from newborn C57Bl/6 mice exposed to 100% oxygen for 10 days and room air-exposed age matched controls. Total RNA was isolated from individual whole lung tissues (n=14) and pooled in duplicates to perform RNASeq using the Illumina platform. Alignments were generated by ELAND v1.8 algorithm using Illumina CASAVA software. Normalized gene expression data were filtered to remove undetected genes. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used to identify genes with differential expression. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for pathway and network analyses. Expression patterns for selected genes were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Result(s): A total of 798 genes were identified as differentially expressed between 3 hyperoxia and 4 control samples by SAM at FDR = 0, and 300 of those had fold change >= 2. We successfully validated 24 of 31 genes by qPCR. There was a clear association between the magnitude change identified by RNASeq and subsequent qPCR validation. Canonical pathways significantly dysregulated in hyperoxia lungs included Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress signaling, p53 signaling, hepatic fibrosis and sildenafil pathways. Interestingly most genes significantly affected in hyperoxic lungs (~70%) showed opposite expression change during organogenesis, consistent with arrested lung development, but some changed in same direction. 13% of the genes demonstrating a significant response to hyperoxia (103 of 798) were also dysregulated (t-test p<0.05) in human BPD lung tissue. Summary: We have generated genome-wide expression data from hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mouse lung tissue using RNA-Seq. We have identified 300 genes dysregulated in this model of BPD-like pathology. This model captures some aspects of BPD, but likely represents a more acute phase than available human tissue. Further analysis of these data would enhance our current knowledge of BPD, and may be used in developing novel therapeutic strategies.","group":"g3","id":"cea5b192-623a-4fef-a247-d2c9a125297c","_showDetails":false},"a3f15830-5f88-4508-85bb-a4d0d9fd44c8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71982715","title":"Impact of shear stress and transforming growth factor beta on pulmonary (myo)fibroblasts of newborn mice and humans","authors":["Oak P.S.","Jain N.","Koschlig M.","Reicherzer T.","Ehrhardt H.","Hilgendorff A."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*shear stress","*fibroblast","*mouse","*human","*American","*society","lung","in vitro study","prematurity","infant","apoptosis","gas","artificial ventilation","lung injury","fluorescence activated cell sorting","chronic lung disease","dispersion","gestational age","vascularization","tracheal aspiration procedure","primary cell","immunoblotting","lung dysplasia","disease severity","cells by body anatomy","*transforming growth factor","elastin","growth factor","platelet derived growth factor","oxygen","tropoelastin","protein","receptor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.S.

It results as a consequence of prolonged mechanical ventilation with oxygen rich gas acting on the immature lung. Dysregulation of growth factor signaling such as transforming growth factor (TGF) beta is central in development of the disease. Its impact on the PDGF-Ralpha expressing (myo)fibroblasts (MFB) could significantly affect elastin production and septal formation, driven by this cell type. Here we establish the effect of TGF-beta on mouse lung MFBs with/without the additional application of in vitro stretch concerning their functional properties, elastin production as well as growth factor signaling. Furthermore, findings are translated to primary cells obtained from preterm infants. Materials and Methods MFBs isolated from 5-7 day old newborn mouse (C57B6) lungs and tracheal aspirates obtained during early days of life from preterm infants <=29 weeks gestational age; intubated over 3 days were cultured on 6 well plates with/without TGF-beta treatment. In vitro stretch was applied using the Flexcell Tension system (elongation max 10%; frequency 2Hz; 30 cycles/min). Immunoblot and FACS analysis were performed for cell characterization, indicators of apoptosis, proliferation as well as ECM proteins and growth factor expression. Functional characteristics were assessed using standard assessments for proliferation and migration. Results TGF-beta treatment decreased the proliferation, migration and PDGF-Ralpha expression of pulmonary MFBs from newborn mice with or without additional application of stretch compared to the respective controls; stretch alone did not affect receptor expression. In contrast, TGF-beta treatment altered elastin production in a stretch dependent manner. In human samples, the response to TGF-beta treatment w.r.t proliferation, migration and tropoelastin production was dependent on the underlying BPD grade. PDGF-Ralpha expression decreased in a stretch independent manner following TGF-beta treatment, as seen in mice. Conclusion TGF-beta induces alterations in growth factor signaling, elastin production and functional properties in newborn mouse MBFs; some effects being independent of in vitro stretch. The effect in human MFBs depends on predisposing conditions as disease severity. These findings suggest a central role of TGF-beta in mediating the effect of stretch-dependent lung injury and also point towards the importance of preforming conditions.","group":"g1","id":"a3f15830-5f88-4508-85bb-a4d0d9fd44c8","_showDetails":true},"78700fef-fcff-4e61-869c-1a90743dd373":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71982062","title":"RHCC10 modulates tlr mediated NF-kB signaling in the premature lung","authors":["Hubert T.L.","Wu J.","Kimura K.","Shaffer T.H.","Eguchi S.","Wolfson M.R."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*American","*society","*lung","inflammation","lamb","respiratory distress syndrome","lung dysplasia","antiinflammatory activity","RNA extraction","human","Clara cell","acute lung injury","clinical study","lung parenchyma","biochemical analysis","tissues","Western blotting","synthesis","epithelium cell","cell culture","airway","protein","messenger RNA","toll like receptor","beractant","surfactant","complementary DNA","toll like receptor 4","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"187","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"T.L.

Progression from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been linked to acute, iatrogenic, inflammation. Previous preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that rhCC10, when following surfactant treatment, decreases NF-kB mediated inflammation. Additionally, DAMP mediated Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) induced NF-kB activity has been shown to be integral to inflammation in acute lung injury. The effects of rhCC10 on TLR mediated inflammation are unknown. Objective(s): Assess TLR induced NF-kB activity and TLR expression in response to rhCC10 treatment in the preterm lung. Method(s): 24 premature lambs (126 +/- 3 days) were instrumented, delivered, paralyzed, and ventilated. After baseline, animals were randomized to 4 groups (n=6/group): untreated (UNT), SFT (Survanta 100mg/kg; 4ml/kg), or SFT followed by intratracheal rhCC10 (0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg; 2 ml/kg). After 4 hrs, the lambs were anesthetized and lung tissue was harvested and snap frozen for biochemical analysis. Tissue was then homogenized for RNA extraction, followed by cDNA synthesis, and then qPCR of TLR 4, normalized by 18S mRNA expression, was performed. Following qPCR, TLR 4 and pIkB proteins were measured by western blot and then normalized by GAPDH and IkB proteins respectively. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate here that, in the intact preterm animal, rhCC10 increases TLR mRNA expression and protein in a dose dependent manner while also decreasing NF-kB activity. These data demonstrate a disconnect between TLR expression and resulting NF-kB activity that needs further investigation.

Despite being associated with a greater degree of airway remodeling and fibrosis, the symptoms and treatment of BPD are often similar to those of asthma. A potential novel serum biomarker recently shown to be increased in asthma is the chitinase-like protein YKL-40, however, the biological mechanisms underlying this observation remain elusive. YKL-40 levels correlate with airway remodeling (Chupp et al. NEJM 2007;357:2016) and recently YKL-40 was found to increase smooth muscle proliferation (Bara et al. AJRCCM 2012;185:715). It was therefore of interest to further investigate the role of YKL-40 in airway disease by comparing serum YKL-40 in children with asthma and BPD. Methods Age- and sex-matched children with either diagnosed asthma or BPD were included in the study. The protocol included review of journal charts, questionnaires, spirometry, methacholine provocation, measurement of nitric oxide in exhaled (FENO) and blood sampling for atopy. Serum YKL-40 levels were measured in by ELISA (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). All children were examined at 10 years of age and clinical characteristics are shown in table 1. Results Serum YKL-40 was significantly higher in children with BPD compared to asthmatic children, figure 1, and children with BPD had reduced pulmonary function measurement, table 1. When patients were divided into high YKL-40 (upper quartile mean 17.5 ng/ml) vs. low YKL-40 (lower quartile mean 11.5 ng/ml), FEV1 (% predicted) was significantly lower in the high YKL-40 group (73+/-10% vs. 85+/-9%, p<0.007). Furthermore, children with BPD who had received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for more than one month (n=19) had significantly higher levels of YKL-40 compared to BPD children with CPAP treatment for less than one month (19.0+/-5.8 vs. 13.0+/-5.3, p=0.014). Figure 1. Serum YKL-40 in children with asthma and BPD. Conclusion Elevated levels of YKL-40 were found in children with BPD compared to asthma, and the association between high YKL-40 levels, pulmonary function measurements and severity of BPD, suggests that YKL-40 may be involved in the development of airway remodeling and fibrosis in BPD.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to serve as second messengers for SMC growth signaling. The mechanism of how ROS target biological molecules to elicit ligand/receptor-mediated cell signaling is, however, largely undefined. ROS can promote disulfide linkage between glutathione and protein thiols, in the process of protein S-glutathionylation. The present study investigated the mechanism and functions of protein S-glutathionylation in cell growth signaling in lung vascular and airway SMCs. METHOD(S): Human pulmonary artery SMCs (HPASMCs) and human bronchial SMCs (HBSMCs) were purchased from ScienCell and cultured. Cells were treated with SMC growth factors such as PDGF and IL-22. Protein S-glutathionylation and protein carbonylation were monitored by Western blotting, and the protein identities were obtained by mass spectrometry. RESULT(S): While multiple proteins are carbonylated, only one protein (~50 kDa) was found to be S-glutathionylated in untreated HPASMCs. Similarly, while a number of proteins are carbonylated, only a few proteins were found to be S-glutathionylated in untreated HBSMCs, but at different molecular weights (>100 kDa and ~40 kDa). S-Glutathionylation was visualized in non-reducing gels, and the addition of beta-mercaptoethanol eliminated glutathionylation signals. Treatment of cells with PDGF or IL-22 increased S-glutathionylation of ~50 kDa protein in HPASMCs and >100 kDa protein in HBSMCs, as early as 10 min and sustained for 30 min after the ligand stimulation. Ligand/receptor-mediated S-glutathionylation is mediated by NAD(P)H oxidase. The bulk addition of high-level hydrogen peroxide did not mimic ligand/receptor-mediated S-glutathionylation. Mass spectrometry identified that ~50 kDa protein in HPASMCs that can be S-glutathionylated is alpha-tubulin (which is essential for the microtubule formation), and >100 kDa protein in HBSMCs is major vault protein/lung resistance-related protein (the major component of vaults, which are ribonucleoprotein particles with a hollow barrel-like structure that may be involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport as well as multidrug resistance). CONCLUSION(S): Protein S-glutathionylation represents a specific and selective oxidative modification, which may function to regulate ROS signaling. Further understanding of this mechanism may help developing therapeutic strategies to inhibit SMC growth and migration in a tissue-specific manner.","group":"g1","id":"072091a4-b6eb-40b5-bfdf-5eeb5fa9331d","_showDetails":true},"3afb2184-2531-44b3-821e-92655f7fa391":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71844477","title":"Lung function time change in infants born pretem with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Pacheco-Gonzalez R.M.","Sanchez-Solis M.","Garcia-Marcos L.","Perez V.","Quesada J.J.","Bosch V."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*physiology","*lung function","*infant","*lung dysplasia","*European","*society","*lung","human","parameters","respiratory airflow","compression","prematurity","body mass","gestational age","patient","model","analysis of variance"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"42","number":"SUPPL. 57\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"R.M.

Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is not the only marker of eosinophil activation, but also acts as an alarm protein. Very few studies have examined the potential role of eosinophil in development of BPD. This study aims to address the roles of eosinophil and EDN in the early phase of BPD development. Method(s): Study patients were preterm neonates with RDS born at 36 weeks of gestation or lesser (RDS group). Control patients were preterm babies with only minor respiratory problems or none at all. Blood and urine samples were collected to measure total eosinophil count in the blood, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), serum EDN and urinary EDN during the first week of life. Comparisons were made between the RDS group and the non-RDS group and between the BPD group and the non-BPD group. Result(s): A total of 43 neonates were recruited and 10 patients were excluded. There were no differences between RDS and non-RDS group in total eosinophil count, serum ECP, serum EDN, or urinary EDN, except when compared by gestational age, birth weight, and prenatal dexamethasone use. Urinary EDN was increased significantly in the BPD group compared to the non-BPD group. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated the roles of eosinophil and EDN in the development of BPD and urinary EDN may be utilized as a non-invasive tool in predicting development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"03ea0173-5ecb-4c52-83c0-3c6f2434fe0d","_showDetails":true},"cb3553a0-f2ac-4cfc-a419-b44bdff0a600":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71840635","title":"Identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis in BPD","authors":["Gimm T.","Hoeland A.","Schwarz M.","Hossain H.","Ehrhardt H.","Gortner L.","Scholz M.","Reicherzer T.","Hauck S.","Hilgendorff A."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*early diagnosis","*European","*society","urine","fibroblast","gene expression","gene","lung dysplasia","artificial ventilation","gestational age","oxygen toxicity","human","umbilical cord blood","lung function","infant","monocyte","adulthood","cell differentiation","prematurity","embryo development","homeostasis","risk","diagnosis","infection","tracheal aspiration procedure","*biological marker","cytokine","proteome","protein","ion","interleukin 8","growth factor","transcriptome"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"42","number":"SUPPL. 57\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"T.

Mechanical ventilation, oxygen toxicity and infections increase the risk for BPD with impaired pulmonary and neurologic outcome persisting into adulthood. Current definitions rely on late pulmonary function and reliable biomarkers allowing for an early diagnosis are still missing. Objective and Methods: We therefore subjected cord blood (CB) from preterms < 32 weeks gestational age with and without BPD to microarray (Code Link, cohort 1) and cytokine analysis (Luminex, cohort 2) for identification of signaling pathways and potential candidates for biomarker analysis. The results were correlated with data from fibroblasts isolated from tracheal aspirates (TA). First results from proteome analysis in urine and TA (LC-MS/MS) were compared to the results obtained by microarray and cytokine analysis. Result(s): Transcriptome analysis exhibited 102 up- and 134 down-regulated genes in preterms with BPD compared to no-BPD controls. Genes were involved in regulation of gene expression (up), or cell differentiation, embryonic development and ion homeostasis (down). Luminex analyses revealed significant differences in cytokines (sIL-1ra, IL-8, TNF-alpha, MCP-1) and growth factor expression (FGF2, EGF), correlating with functional data in fibroblasts from TA. First proteome data in urine and TA confirmed potential biomarker candidates. Conclusion(s): Gene expression and protein profiling from CB, urine and TA of preterms allows differentiation for later BPD diagnosis with increased monocyte signaling and fibroblast activation playing a central role.","group":"g2","id":"cb3553a0-f2ac-4cfc-a419-b44bdff0a600","_showDetails":true},"e67273a7-b694-4786-ad2f-69d20c08cbfc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71840634","title":"Serum YKL-40 is increased in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared to children with asthma","authors":["James A.","Konradsen J.","Nordlund B.","Ebersjo C.","Bostrom E.B.","Henckel E.","Dahlen S.-E.","Hedlin G."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*human","*child","*lung dysplasia","*asthma","*serum","*European","*society","fibrosis","airway remodeling","positive end expiratory pressure","prematurity","lung function","patient","smooth muscle","diseases","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","biological marker","protein","chitinase"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"42","number":"SUPPL. 57\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"A.

However, little is known about the role of endogenous differences in corticoid sensitivity arising from polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene. Study design: We analyzed GR polymorphisms BclI, N363S and R23K with respect to recorded neonatal outcome parameters in a German Neonatal Network (GNN) multicenter cohort comprising 2.211 very low birth weight preterm (VLBW) infants. Result(s): Birth parameters were not different between genotype groups. Variants BclI and R23K were associated with a significantly higher risk of culture-positive neonatal sepsis (Bcll homozygosity: OR 1.85, p=0.002; R23K-carrier: OR 2.08, p=0.016; adj. for gestational age). In addition, infants carrying BclI alleles were more likely to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR 1.41 per allele [95% CI 1.14-1.75], p < 0.01 adj. for gestational age and mechanical ventilation). A similar relative risk was seen in the subcohort of infants with antenatal betamethasone treatment (OR 1.44, p < 0.01), whereas no such effect was detectable in the small subgroup without steroid treatment (n=185, OR 1.03, n.s.). N363S-carrier tended to have lower mean arterial blood pressure at the first day of life (total cohort: beta=-0.050, p=0.010; BclI-/R23K-wildtype subcohort: beta-0.055, p=0.074) and were more likely to require catecholamine treatment (p<0.01). However, none of the analyzed GR variants significantly influenced incidence rates of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or retinopathy (ROP). Conclusion(s): This study supports the hypothesis that endogenous differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity mediated by GR gene polymorphisms affect the neonatal outcome of VLBW preterm infants.

Electron microscopy further demonstrated the accumulation of lamellar bodies and the co-localization of lamellar bodies with autophagosomes in the cytoplasm of alveolar epithelial type II cells. The inhibition of autophagy with 3-Methyladenine and knockdown of Atg7 abolished hyperoxia-induced SP-C accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK signaling with SP600125 suppressed hyperoxia-induced Atg7 expression and SP-C accumulation. These findings suggest that hyperoxia triggers autophagy via JNK signaling-mediated Atg7 expression, which promotes the accumulation of SP-C within alveolar epithelial type II cells.

This is reflected in current recommendations regarding altitude: traveling in altitude or flying on planes is not recommended during the first year. However no clear recommendations exist for later childhood, making it a challenge for the pediatrician to give adequate counseling. We report here an unusual case of a former premature adolescent with acute respiratory failure. Case report: A 13 year-old boy, born at 27 weeks of gestation with a history of BPD, went for holiday to a ski resort at 2000 m. On the previous days he suffered from acute upper respiratory tract infection with rhinitis. During the first night he developed severe cough, but decided to go skiing the day after. In the afternoon he developed a respiratory distress and produced pink, foamy sputum and presented to the general practitioner in respiratory failure. The first chest X-ray showed severe hyperinflation. After transfer to the University hospital he needed aggressive bronchodilatation and therapy with diuretics, corticosteroid, and positive airway pressure. The patient fully recovered within 24 hours. Discussion(s): Multiple elements explain the origin of this acute respiratory insufficiency. Prematurity with BPD leads to epithelial and capillary dysfunction. The respiratory tract infection contributed to further epithelial and capillary dysfunction and hyperinflation. Sleeping in altitude probably induced capillary leakage and exercise in this situation added to final respiration failure. Conclusion(s): Preterms with BPD among others need a regular pulmonary follow-up to correctly advice daily activity on an individual basis.","group":"g1","id":"45b8113f-3807-46db-b619-412cd77842b3","_showDetails":true},"2a154314-77aa-41ac-8c90-47c2a1b19092":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71735295","title":"Role of sphingolipid signalling in bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Harijith A.","Reddy N.","Bai T.","Usatyuk P.","Pendyala S.","Huang L.","Berdyshev E.","Gorshkova I.","Reddy S.","Raj U.","Natarajan V."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","hyperoxia","mouse","lung injury","wild type","lung parenchyma","newborn","lung lavage","histopathology","chemical analysis","lung function","lung","inflammation","human","prematurity","pathology","histology","protection","Western blotting","adult","exposure","model","*sphingolipid","lyase","sphingosine 1 phosphate","interleukin 6","protein","reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4"],"journal":"Clinical and Translational Science","language":"English","volume":"6","number":"2","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","isbn":"1752-8054","address":"A.

We have earlier shown that exposure of adult mice to hyperoxia enhances sphingosine-1-phosphate levels in lung tissues; however, the role of increased S1P generation and signaling in the pathobiology of BPD has not been investigated. We hypothesized that altered S1P signaling axis in BPD, in part, is responsible for neonatal lung injury and inflammation. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: To test this, newborn (NB) C57BL6/J, SphK1-/-, SphK2-/- and Sgpl1+/- (S1P lyase) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75%) from postnatal day1 to 7, pups were sacrificed on postnatal day 7, and lungs were perfused and used for histology and biochemical analysis. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: SphK1-/-, but not SphK2-/-, deficiency in mice offered protection against hyperoxia-induced lung injury compared to wild type littermate controls. Histopathology revealed better formed alveoli and comparable levels of proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids in SphK1 deficient mice. Further, hyperoxia increased levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6 was decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in SphK1 deficient mice compared to the wild type. Analysis of total cell lysates by Western blots showed decreased expression of Nox-2 and Nox-4 proteins, in the lung tissue of SphK1-/- mice exposed to hyperoxia compared to its wild type control.

Up-regulation of the matricellular protein, Periostin, is a marker of late lung injury, myofibroblast accumulation, and pulmonary fibrosis but it is unknown if Periostin directs normal myofibroblast accumulation during early alveolar septation or if it identifies early lung injury. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Using a murine hyperoxia (85%-O2) model of inhibited alveolar septation, we correlated Periostin expression with the appearance of myofibroblasts in the saccular lung, determined if it was required for early alveolar development, and examined its misexpression in early lung injury. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Periostin was widely expressed in distal lung septa through P2-4 (early alveolar septation) and peak expression coincided with accumulation of alpha -smooth muscle actin ( alpha SMA)+-myofibroblasts. Acutely, hyperoxia blunted normal up-regulation of Periostin and alpha SMA prior to the first evidence of distal lung simplification at P4. Conversely, chronic hyperoxia resulted in abnormal accumulation of Periostin and alpha SMA in blunted septa at P14. Despite its tight association with hyperoxic lung injury, Periostin knockout mice exhibited normal myofibroblast differentiation and alveolar development, and they were equally sensitive to hyperoxia as wildtypes.

Studies suggest that excess generation of reactive oxygen species that exceeds the antioxidant capacity is central to the pathogenesis of neonatal alveolar and pulmonary vascular disease. Method(s): Wild-type mice (WT), and mice lacking EC-SOD (KO) received intraperitoneal bleo (2 units per kilogram) or saline three times weekly during weeks 0-3 of life. At week 4, right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP) were measured and lungs were inflation fixed for morphometric analysis, including radial alveolar counts (RAC), mean linear intercepts (MLI), and nodal point density (NPD), and immunohistochemistry (IHC), or flash frozen for protein content by western blot (WB). Result(s): Lack of EC-SOD impaired alveolar development at week 4, characterized by lower RAC and NPD and increased MLI, and augmented bleo-induced disruption of alveolar development. Bleo also decreased EC-SOD expression in WT mice. Although KO mice had higher RVSP than WT at 4 weeks, bleo treatment did not cause a further increase in RVSP in KO or WT mice. Altered VEGF or serotonin (5-HT) signaling did not account for the impaired lung development in KO mice at baseline or after bleo. No differences were observed between KO and WT mice in VEGF, VEGFR2, or eNOS expression, or in the 5-HT signaling pathway, including 5-HT, tryptophan hydroxylase, 5-HT transporter or 5-HT receptors, 5-HT2a or 5-HT2b. Conclusion(s): We propose that EC-SOD activity preserves normal lung and vascular development, and insufficient EC-SOD activity predisposes to worse outcomes in neonatal lung diseases.

HR-QoL was compared to the sex- and age- matched population. Patients were deemed at risk for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if the IES score was above 30, and had signs of anxiety or depression when the corresponding HAD sub scores were above 10. Results are expressed as median [25-75th percentile]. RESULTS. At the time of influenza, patients were 39 years old [28-46], 7 (54 %) were women, 5 (38.5 %) were obese (BMI[30 kg/m2) and 3 (23 %) were pregnant. Two (15 %) had asthma, 3 (23 %) were smokers, and one had chronic respiratory insufficiency secondary to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At ICU admission, median SAPS II was 59 [54-72] and PaO2/FIO2 ratio was 64 mmHg [52-114]. ECMO and MV duration were 25 days [10-51] and 34 days [15-75], respectively. Patients were evaluated 35 [23.8-40] months after ICU discharge. As compared to their weight after ICU discharge, they gained 8 kg [2.8-19.5 kg]. Only one patient was an actual smoker. Eight out of the 10 patients who previously worked have returned to work, and 7 patients practiced sport at the time of evaluation whereas only 2 did before influenza. Nine (69 %) had no dyspnea or dyspnea on moderate or strenuous exertion, 3 (23 %) had dyspnea when walking, and one (patient with previous chronic respiratory insufficiency) had dyspnea during minimal activity. Their mean SF-36 domains differed significantly from the normative values of the matched population, with lower physical functioning (p = 0.005), general health (p = 0.0003) and vitality scores (p = 0.05) whereas their mean physical and mental composite scores were not different (p values of 0.06 and 0.09, respectively). No patient was at risk of PTSD. Two patients (5 %) showed symptoms of both anxiety and depression, reported by themselves to social concerns. CONCLUSIONS. After 2 years, survivors of influenza A (H1N1)-associated ARDS having required an ECMO have no severe impairment in HR-QoL, and none are at risk of PSTD. However, 31 % have moderate-to-severe dyspnea. Lung function will be assessed more precisely in these patients.","group":"g1","id":"bfa47761-e452-4860-a708-f4d08e600966","_showDetails":true},"5c14f872-2861-4091-975d-3f9ed2ae4e8e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71385578","title":"2013 Society for Pediatric Pathology Fall Meeting","authors":["Anonymous."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*pathology","*society","human","diagnosis","lung dysplasia","seizure","diagnostic value","Hirschsprung disease","gene","nerve","rectum biopsy","patient","Down syndrome","gene rearrangement","spindle cell","neoplasm","umbilical artery","fasciitis","neuroblastoma","mitosis","child","oncology","lung","lung development","suction","thyroid gland","fine needle aspiration biopsy","urine","cytomegalovirus infection","newborn","infant","placenta","Doppler flowmetry","three-dimensional imaging","calretinin","endostatin"],"journal":"Pediatric and Developmental Pathology","language":"English","volume":"16","number":"6\nSP  -","publisher":"Society for Pediatric Pathology","isbn":"1093-5266","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed14&NEWS=N&AN=71385578"],"abstract":"The proceedings contain 29 papers.

This impaired lung development frequently leads to respiratory disease, pulmonary hypertension, and significant long-term morbidity in DS. Genes for potent anti-angiogenic factors, including endostatin (ES), are present on the triplicated chromosome 21 and are likely overexpressed in DS patients. We have previously shown that disruption of angiogenesis during critical periods of lung development impairs alveolarization in newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and that the histology of BPD and DS lungs shares common features of disrupted lung growth. Whether ES-driven impairment of angiogenesis during early development underlies the high risk for lung disease in DS has not been studied. We hypothesized that chromosome 21-driven lung ES overexpression has a previously unrecognized role in the pathogenesis of lung hypoplasia in newborns and infants with DS. More specifically, we hypothesize that (1) lungs of DS patients overexpress ES and (2) increased ES exposure disrupts normal lung development. Design(s): We used banked tissues of pre-and postnatal human DS lungs and age-matched controls to evaluate mRNA expression of ES, as well as major groups of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic genes (Human Angiogenesis RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Array, Qiagen PAHS-024Z, Hilden, Germany). Newborn mice were injected daily with ES for 7 days, and lung architecture using mean linear intercept (MLI) values were compared with controls. Result(s): We detected marked elevation of lung ES mRNA levels in the group containing both pre-(n 5 11) and postnatal (n 5 11) samples (P 5 0.002), as well as in the prenatal subgroup (P 5 0.0017). Lung sections of ES-treated mice showed fewer and larger and simplified distal alveoli, with an increase in MLI values (P 5 0.0364), indicating impaired alveolar development. Conclusion(s): Endostatin expression is significantly elevated in human prenatal DS lungs. Endostatin treatment significantly impairs normal alveolar growth in newborn mice. These results strongly suggest a key role of antiangiogenic signals, specifically those driven by ES, in the pathomechanism of DS-related lung hypoplasia.","group":"g1","id":"33894d42-eccd-4f4c-9e97-ea9b8bdb1b1f","_showDetails":true},"c48646eb-e1f6-4776-9eea-61a1c1f9f6ce":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71366995","title":"Indications, feasibility, and outcome of interventional closure of secundum-type atrial septal defect in children with a bodyweight less than 10 kg","authors":["Knirsch W.","Quandt D.","Kretschmar O."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*heart atrium septum defect","*child","*human","*society","*pediatric cardiology","patient","echocardiography","pulmonary hypertension","devices","failure to thrive","vein thrombosis","prematurity","fluoroscopy","procedures","infant","genetic disorder","lung dysplasia","bleeding","follow up","male","sildenafil"],"journal":"Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeon","language":"English","volume":"61","number":"SUPPL. 2\nSP  -","publisher":"Georg Thieme Verlag","isbn":"0171-6425","address":"W.

Method(s): Retrospective analysis (2005 - 2012) of ASD closures in children less than 10 kg bodyweight. Result(s): In 25 children (13 male) 24 successful interventional secundum ASD device closures were performed at a median age of 1.2 years (0.2 - 2.8) and a bodyweight of median 7.5 kg (4.6 - 9.9). RV volume overload was present on echocardiography in 24 patients, resulting in an Qp/Qs of mean 1.7 (+/- 1). Clinically, nine (36%) patients presented with failure to thrive and eight (32%) were past preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In 12 patients a genetic syndrome (Trisomie 21 in nine patients, 36%) was present. In more than two-third of the patients (n= 18, 72%) pulmonary hypertension was suspected on echocardiography. Hemodynamic evaluation revealed baseline PVR of mean 3.8 WU (+/- 6.7) and mean PAP 25 mm Hg (+/- 10). ASD size was mean 8.1 mm (+/- 2.7) with a ratio of bodyweight/defect size of median 0.87.

Recognize the gender gap in CF: namely that women suffer lower median survival, lower FEV1, and earlier bacterial colonization rates. 2. Review the emerging data linking inflammation and microbiology to 17beta-estradiol (E2). 3. Discuss the implications for therapeutics in CF. Estrogen in Health and Disease: Clinically appreciable female disadvantages in CF appear beginning at puberty when E2 levels in blood begin to rise. Registry data from more than 10 years ago supported the clinical impression that disparities in outcomes could be related to gender and adherence disparities. Recently, epidemiologic data in the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Registry linked the rate of pulmonary exacerbations to gender, although FEV1 remained no different, perhaps reflecting the gains made by advances in therapeutic regimens and guidelines (1). Sex hormones influence organ development (structure) and function in health and disease. Inherent gender differences in lung anatomy and physiology have significant impact at specific times in the lifespan such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and the elderly. At times, sex hormones can be beneficial to the lungs and at other times, they may be detrimental. Applying this general knowledge to a complex systemic disease like cystic fibrosis is challenging. The lung undergoes the greatest differentiation and development in utero, but continues to modify the alveolar regions for the first few years of life and increase in size and complexity into adolescence (2). Female fetuses have fewer bronchi and earlier appearance of surfactant than male fetuses. Maternal steroids can impact fetal development and it is well recognized that acceleration of lung maturation can be induced during pre-term labor by antenatal maternal corticosteroids (3). Premature male infants are more susceptible to respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, thought to be related to the decreased surfactant production and larger lung size. These structural differences translate to a lower specific airways resistance and higher FEF in females than males in childhood. During adolescence and puberty, lung growth translates in increases in FVC and TLC for both genders. During the third trimester of pregnancy, the TLC and FRC decrease. Asthma affects more boys than girls in childhood until puberty, when women overtake men (2). The cyclical variation in circulating sex steroid levels influences asthma symptoms and as many as 40% of women with asthma will experience pre-menstrual asthma, typically during the downswing in estrogen levels. Use of oral contraceptives that suppress fluctuations in hormones seems to relieve pre-menstrual asthma. Asthma tends to decrease around the age of menopause. Estrogen and CF: Estrogen has been known to affect the gene expression of multiple ion transporters (4). Importantly the observations have been female-specific. Higher circulating E2 levels adversely affect the calcium-activated chloride conductance pathways in CF and non-CF airways in vivo (5). This might be at least partially offset in F508del CF by the E2 mediated rescue of F508del (6). The target for E2 in the latter paper was Nherf1. During menses E2 levels fall to about 0.1 nM, then increase through the follicular phase and peak several days before ovulation. Coakley, et al demonstrated the target for E2 related to non-CFTR channels to be UTP-stimulated calcium activated chloride conductances which directly impact airway surface liquid depth (5). They predict that airway mucociliary clearance will be compromised for one week out of every four of the menstrual cycle in CF where patients lack functional CFTR chloride channels. Anecdotal complaints of female patients do not exactly coincide with the predicted week of the cycle, likely due to the multiple pathways impacted by E2. Estrogen promotes fluid retention by being pro-absorptive and anti-secretory in the intestines which leads to bloating, particularly when used during assisted reproduction. Extracellular fluid retention is highest mid-menstrual cycle and on oral contraceptives. Progesterone rises as E2 falls during the menstrual cycle. Progesterone did not affect airway surface liquid in the Coakley study (5). However, progesterone can antagonize estrogen-mediated increases in CFTR and the sodium bicarbonate exchanger in vitro in uterine tissues (7). Estrogen-targeted therapy might consist of anti-estrogenic compounds like tamoxifen. However side effects likely outweigh potential benefits. Oral contraceptives are associated with an estrogen state and would be predicted to worsen airway mucociliary clearance. Yet, in a study of 681 women with CF in the UK, use of oral contraceptives was not associated with impairment of lung function or BMI in over 5 years of follow-up (8). CF and Host/Pathogen Interactions: Sex steroids are metabolized or utilized in signaling by some bacteria. Bacteria have developed mechanisms to circumvent the effects of these hormones or to utilize them as carbon and energy sources. Estradiol and its metabolite estriol induce alginate production in a lab strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and promote acquisition of the mucoidy phenotype. Using registry data, the authors observed a reduced need for antibiotics if the patient was on oral contraceptives (9). Implications: Early identification of those adolescents and women with CF who experience worsening of symptoms during the menstrual cycle may enable therapeutic modulation of E2 levels.","group":"g1","id":"8d4de6c4-c71d-45cd-bcfb-6e554fc5d5e8","_showDetails":true},"c7016767-8436-4a6f-9e57-164360fd5c99":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Hyperoxia-induced methylation decreases RUNX3 in a newborn rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12931-015-0239-x","authors":["Zhu, Yuting","Fu, Jianhua","Yang, Haiping","Pan, Yuqing","Yao, Li","Xue, Xindong"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150624//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","*Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/bi [Biosynthesis]","*DNA Methylation/ph [Physiology]","*Disease Models, Animal","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley"],"journal":"Respiratory research","volume":"16","isbn":"1465-9921","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26104385"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants is a predominantly secondary occurrence to intrauterine inflammation/infection and postpartum mechanical ventilation; in recent years, an association with epigenetics has also been found. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs), and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), mediated by the methyltransferase, Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), are some of the most commonly found modifications in epigenetics. Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is associated with pulmonary epithelial and vascular development and regulates expression at the post-transcriptional level by DNA methylation through DNMT1 or DNMT3b. However, the involvements of these epigenetic factors in the occurrence of BPD are, as yet, unclear., METHODS: Newborn rats were randomly assigned to a model, hyperoxia (85 % O2) or control, normoxia group (21 % O2). Lung tissues and alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells were collected between 1-14 days. The expression of DNMTs, and EZH2 was detected by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real-time PCR. The percentage of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 levels in the RUNX3 promoter region was measured by bisulfite sequencing PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. RUNX3 protein and mRNA expression in AT2 cells was also measured after inhibition using the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, the H3K27me3 inhibitor, JMJD3, and the EZH2 inhibitor, DZNep., RESULTS: Compared with the control group, RUNX3 protein was downregulated and DNMT3b and EZH2 were highly expressed in lung tissues and AT2 cells of the model group (P < 0.05), while high DNA methylation and H3K27me3 modifications were present in the RUNX3 promoter region, in lung tissues of the model group (P < 0.05). Following hyperoxia in the model group, JMJD3 and DZNep significantly reversed the hyperoxia-induced down-regulation of RUNX3 expression in AT2 cells (P < 0.05), more so than 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: 1) DNA methylation and H3K27 trimethylation are present in the BPD model; 2) RUNX3 down-regulation is attributed to both DNMT3b-catalyzed DNA methylation and EZH2-catalyzed histone methylation.","group":"g1","id":"c7016767-8436-4a6f-9e57-164360fd5c99","_showDetails":true},"67fa25b7-dc9d-485f-aa84-24731133c7db":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71276956","title":"Identification of txnip interacting proteins using BioID","authors":["Neuharth S.","Forred B.","Kim D.","Roux K.","Vitiello P."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*society","pathology","hyperglycemia","model","cell death","oxidation","heart ventricle hypertrophy","cell culture","lung dysplasia","mutation","transgene","diabetes mellitus","phenotype","*free radical","*protein","thioredoxin","glucose","thioredoxin interacting protein","cysteine","oxidoreductase","thiol"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"65","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"S.

Redox regulation of dithiol/disulfide status is critical for numerous cell signaling processes, many of which are dependent on activities of the thioredoxin family. Thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) acts as a negative reuglator of thioredoxin function and is a critical modulator of several disease pathologies including beta-cell death during hyperglycemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are relatively unknown. the objective of these studies was to identify Txnip interacting proteins using a novel proximity-based labeling method known as BioID in an effort to understand molecular events underlying the aforementioned disease pathologies. HEK293 cells stably-transfected with the BioID transgene fused to Txnip were used to identify novel interacting proteins. Proteomic analysis of BioID lysates identified 50 interacting proteins and mutation of a redox-senstive cysteine (C247S) in Txnip disrupted several interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this cell model can be used to identify dynamic Txnip interactions due to known environmental regulators such as hyperglycemia. Differential proteomic studies were conducted in cells cultured under low (5.5 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose concentrations to model hyperglycemic pathologies consistent with beta-cell death during diabetic phenotypes. Continued studies will focus on understanding the biological relevance of the identified interactions to better understand cellular alterations resulting in disease pathologies.","group":"g1","id":"67fa25b7-dc9d-485f-aa84-24731133c7db","_showDetails":true},"e4bd9e13-d19c-4f05-943c-4d89a736814b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71276726","title":"Aurothioglucose improves alveolarization in a murine model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Tipple T.E.","Moyer S.","Pierce D.","Hill C.L.","Rogers L.K."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*murine model","*lung dysplasia","*society","mouse","body weight","lung development","newborn","gene","prematurity","lung","hyperoxia","lung injury","human","toxicity","infant","hypothesis","agonist","morbidity","protection","attenuation","fetus lung maturation","endothelium cell","injection","in vitro study","model","safety","adult","exposure","ambient air","*free radical","*aurothioglucose","sodium chloride","antioxidant","mitogenic agent","vasculotropin","nuclear factor","auranofin","thioredoxin reductase 1"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"65","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"T.E.

Aurothioglucose (ATG) and auranofin (AFN) potently inhibit thioredoxin (Trx) reductase-1 (TrxR1). We have previously shown that ATG safely and effectively prevents hyperoxic lung injury in adult mice, likely via nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. in newborn mice, Nrf2 regulates lung maturation and protection from O2 toxicity suggesting that Nrf2 agonists might prevent BPD. the present studies tested the hypothesis that ATG would attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits in a newborn murine model of BPD. to test our hypothesis, newborn C3H/HeN mice were treated with a single i.p. dose of 25 mg/kg ATG or saline within 12 h of birth and were exposed in either room air (RA) or 85% hyperoxia (O2) for up to 14 d. Morphometric analyses at 14 d revealed that hyperoxic exposure arrested normal lung development. ATG treatment significantly attenuated O2-induced increases in alveolar area and decreases in alveolar number. Lung development was not different between ATG-treated and saline-treated mice raised in RA. Body weights in saline-treated O2-exposed mice were significantly lower at 7 d and 14 d than in RA controls while ATG treatment significantly attenuated O2-induced decreases in body weight. to determine the impact of TrxR1 inhibition on Nrf2 activation in vitro, murine alveolar epithelial (MLE-12) cells were treated with 1 uM AFN for 1 h. AFN treatment decreased TrxR1 activities by 90% compared to saline-treated controls. qRT-PCR analyses of AFN-treated cells revealed that transcription of Nrf2-driven genes GCLM, HO-1, NQ01, and TrxR1 was significantly increased as was transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen that is significantly decreased in BPD. Our novel preliminary data indicate that a single ATG injection at birth attenuates O2-induced alterations in alveolar development in newborn mice. Furthermore, ATG treatment was well tolerated as evidenced by normal lung growth in RA-exposed controls and attenuation of O2-induced decreases body weight in saline-treated mice. Induction of Nrf2 target genes by AFN treatment in MLE-12 cells support a working model in which the protective effects of TrxR1 inhibitors are Nrf2-dependent. Future studies will determine the safety and efficacy of TrxR1 inhibition as a novel approach to attenuate O2-mediated neonatal lung injury and arrested lung development, a significant and costly cause of morbidity in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"e4bd9e13-d19c-4f05-943c-4d89a736814b","_showDetails":true},"3bfcda08-4839-4bfe-bd7d-3cb822dfde21":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71276724","title":"Hyperoxia interacts with circadian rhythm to worsen neonatal lung injury","authors":["Sengupta S.","Yang G.","Sadreameli A.","Go H.","Dennery P.A."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*circadian rhythm","*lung injury","*society","lung","gene","gene expression","newborn","mouse","density","regulator gene","human","in vitro study","lung function","lung development","lung dysplasia","architecture","thickness","histology","prematurity","exposure","ambient air","lung blood vessel","injury","light dark cycle","*free radical","oxygen","antioxidant","cigarette smoke"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"65","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"S.

Result(s): Expression of circadian genes especially Rev-erba and BMAL as well as downstream targets such as p21 and PGC1alpha were significantly altered by the combined effect of hyperoxia and constant light on day 3. Radial alveolar count and vessel density were reduced and medial wall thickness was increased in this group, most pronounced by day 14 (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): in the neonatal lung, hyperoxia disrupts circadian gene expression and interacts with circadian dysregulation to distort alveolar architecture and reduce pulmonary vessel density. Circadian regulation may be an avenue for modulating hyperoxic injury and repair in neonates.","group":"g1","id":"3bfcda08-4839-4bfe-bd7d-3cb822dfde21","_showDetails":true},"b30b2f47-82bc-4611-8b25-2e4dd9a4e2c9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71198624","title":"Amniocentesis in preterm labor between 24-29 weeks' gestation and neonatal/infant outcomes","authors":["Meints L.","Harrison R.","Albayrak S.","Chelliah A.","Kruger M.","Bahado-Singh R."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*amniocentesis","*premature labor","*pregnancy","*society","*gynecological examination","maternal age","female","newborn morbidity","risk","death","child death","newborn death","birth weight","population","diseases","prevention","mortality","diabetes mellitus","disease control","anemia","newborn","air conditioning","hyaline membrane disease","congenital malformation","fever","national health organization","patient","human","study design"],"journal":"Reproductive Sciences","language":"English","volume":"20","number":"3 SUPPL. 1","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc.","isbn":"1933-7191","address":"L.

Study Design: Data from the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were analyzed from the years 2004 to 2006. Nineteen states, representing 49% of the population, reported data. There were a total of 8,405,654 births. Analysis was limited to singleton cases between 24-29 weeks with documented preterm labor. Maternal age >= 35 years and congenital anomaly cases were excluded to minimize the chances that AC was performed for genetic reasons. Only cases reporting whether or not AC was performed were included. The frequency of AC overall and in different GA groups was determined, as was the correlation between AC and different maternal and newborn outcomes. Odds Ratios (OR) were calculated and then adjusted for GA at delivery, maternal race and age, diabetes and hypertensive disorders; the non-AC served as the reference group. Result(s): There were 19,909 eligible PTL cases of which 273 (1.4%) underwent AC. There was no difference in mean birth weight (p=0.20), mean maternal age (p=0.06), or race (0.83) in cases with and without AC. The rate of AC utilization did not vary with GA. No differences were found in early onset neonatal morbidities such as hyaline membrane disease, ventilation, anemia, fever. AC was associated with a higher adjusted OR for death at less than 7 days of life (2.16, 95% CI 1.60, 2.90), neonatal death (2.07, 95% CI 1.54, 2.77), and infant death (2.24, 95% CI 1.71, 2.94). Conclusion(s): These data suggest low rates of AC utilization in potentially eligible patients with PTL. There were no significant differences in maternal age or race for rates of AC utilization or in neonatal morbidities. However, death at less than 7 days of life, neonatal death, and infant death were positively associated with AC, possibly suggesting increased utilization of AC in pregnancies at the highest risk.","group":"g1","id":"b30b2f47-82bc-4611-8b25-2e4dd9a4e2c9","_showDetails":true},"b751cd4c-1c68-471f-92d3-cfe87c6b5773":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71156904","title":"The role of the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor Tgfbr3 in the regulation of pulmonary vascular development","authors":["Niess G.","Wygowski J.","Seeger W.","Morty R.E."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["smooth muscle fiber","vascular smooth muscle","lung blood vessel","mouse","lung","lung dysplasia","lung hypoplasia","hyperoxia","smooth muscle","artery muscle","laser microdissection","patient","model","muscle tissue","pulmonary artery","human","assay","apoptosis","cell function","growth, development and aging","*transforming growth factor","*receptor","messenger RNA","protein","4 [4 (1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl) 5 (2 pyridinyl) 1h imidazol 2 yl]benzamide"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"Meeting Abstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"1530-6860","address":"G.

The molecular basis of this is not well understood. Expression studies in the lung of hyperoxia (85% O2) treated mice, a model of BPD, have revealed that the protein level of the type III TGF-beta receptor (Tgfbr3) is reduced by 4-fold. Laser microdissection confirmed downregulated expression (mRNA level) of tgfbr3 in the pulmonary vasculature of the developing mouse lung. Immunohistochemical studies suggested that the changes in TGF-beta receptor expression were largely confined to the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, suggesting a possible role for these receptors in the smooth muscle tissue in the development of BPD. Knockdown of TGFBR3 in primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) increased proliferation by 2-fold, in a TGF-beta-independent manner (observed in the presence of the TGF-beta pathway inhibitor SB431542). Migration of PASMC assessed by Boyden Assay was increased 4-fold. However, apoptosis of PASMC was not affected by the knockdown of TGFBR3. Taken together, these data suggest a role for TGFBR3 in vascular smooth muscle cell function which could lead to a dysregulation of TGF-beta signalling in the pulmonary vasculature which in turn could contribute to the impaired pulmonary vascular growth and development associated with the lung hypoplasia observed in patients with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"b751cd4c-1c68-471f-92d3-cfe87c6b5773","_showDetails":true},"895d6bc5-2b62-4c31-88f5-5c26a2d0b9d6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71121188","title":"Antenatal glucocorticoids counteract LPS-induced changes in TGF-beta signalling pathway in fetal lung","authors":["Kunzmann S.","Collins J.","Kuypers E.","Newnham J.","Kallapur S.","Jobe A.","Speer C.","Kramer B."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*fetus lung","exposure","inflammation","phosphorylation","fetus","lung dysplasia","injection","lung development","Western blotting","immunohistochemistry","down regulation","etiology","uterus","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","*glucocorticoid","lipopolysaccharide","protein","connective tissue growth factor","messenger RNA","transforming growth factor","betamethasone","sodium chloride","caveolin 1"],"journal":"Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde","language":"English","volume":"161","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Springer Verlag","isbn":"0026-9298","address":"S.

Inflammation and antenatal glucocorticoids affect lung development and may contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), its activated Smad signalling pathway and its downstream mediators, like connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), are implicated in the etiology of BPD. The effects of the combined exposures on inflammation and antenatal glucocorticoids on these members of TGF-beta family are unknown. Therefore we asked whether glucocorticoids altered intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects on TGF-beta expression, its signaling molecule pSmad2, and CTGF and Cav-1 expression. Methods. Ovine singleton fetuses were randomized to receive either an intra-amniotic injection of LPS and/or maternal betamethasone (BTM) intra-muscularly 7 and/or 14 days prior to delivery at 120 days GA (term = 150 days GA). Saline was used for controls. Protein levels of TGF-beta1 and 2 were measured by ELISA. Smad2 phosphorylation was assessed by immuno-histochemistry. CTGF and Cav-1 mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results. Free TGF-beta1 and -2 and total TGF-beta1 levels were unchanged after LPS and/or BTM exposure, although total TGF-beta2 increased in animals exposed to BTM 7 days before LPS. Smad2 phosphorylation increased 7 days after LPS exposure. Similarly, CTGF mRNA and protein levels increased 7 days after LPS exposure as Cav-1 mRNA and protein levels decreased. BTM exposure prior to LPS prevented Smad2 phosphorylation, CTGF induction and Cav-1 down-regulation. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that the intra-uterine inflammation induced TGF-beta signaling can be inhibited by antenatal glucocorticoids in fetal lungs, which may influence the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"895d6bc5-2b62-4c31-88f5-5c26a2d0b9d6","_showDetails":true},"c8bf513c-5973-4eac-aae6-cb361b26ea5c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71121187","title":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in a double-hit mouse model induced by intrauterine hypoxia and postnatal hyperoxia: Are human cord blood mononuclear cells (UCB-MNCs) a therapeutic option?","authors":["Tutdibi E.","Monz D.","Mildau C.","Shen J.","Kasoha M.","Laschke M.","Roolfs T.","Schmiedl A.","Meier C.","Tschernig T.","Gortner L."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*human","*lung dysplasia","*mouse","*animal model","*fetus hypoxia","*hyperoxia","*umbilical cord blood","*mononuclear cell","lung","therapy","brain weight","newborn","experimental model","prematurity","prevention","stem cell","prenatal growth","fetus lung maturity","thickness","down regulation","fetus lung maturation","neonatology","gene","mortality","lung parenchyma","single drug dose","hypoxia","control group","Germany","cell count","river","allotransplantation","clinical feature","model","inflammation","transplantation","body weight","architecture","gene expression","pathogenesis","diseases","adverse drug reaction","safety","marker"],"journal":"Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde","language":"English","volume":"161","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Springer Verlag","isbn":"0026-9298","address":"E.

BPD remains a major threat of very preterm neonates especially with intrauterine growth restriction and treatment options still are limited. Stem cell-based regenerative therapy offers an innovative option in the prevention and treatment of BPD but is controversial in neonatology. Aim. As an adequate experimental model of BPD in small animals for evaluation of novel therapies is still lacking, the goal of the present study was to develop a perinatal double-hit model of BPD in neonatal mice, which is close to clinical features in humans. It was aimed to test whether allogenic transplantation of human UCB-MNCs improves experimental BPD in mice. Methods. In the experimental setting date-mated pregnant mice (C57BL/6, Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were randomly assigned to a control group (normoxia) or to a double-hit group: prenatal hypoxia (FiO2 0.1) from gestational day E14 until spontaneous delivery and postnatal hyperoxia (FiO2 0.75) from postnatal day P1 to P14. At day P7 double-hit pups were randomly allocated to receive intraperitoneally a single dose of UCB-MNCs with median cell numbers of 2x105. At day P14 pups were sacrificed and lung tissues were immediately excised for further histological and molecular analyses. Results. In double-hit exposed neonatal mice the development of body, lung and brain weight was retarded and pups showed a less morphological lung maturity by day P14 compared with normoxic controls. Histomormphometric analysis revealed reduced alveolarization and increased septal thickness without pronounced inflammatory lesions. A down-regulation of transcriptional markers of lung maturation Sftpb, Sftpc and Mtor genes was observed in double-hit animals compared with controls. Transplantation of human UCB-MNCs did not lead to adverse events; mortality was in the same range as for untreated animals. Furthermore there was tendency to increased body weight, lung and brain weight in the treated animals in comparison to the controls. Pulmonary architecture was slightly improved in treated animals and showed increased Mtor gene expression. Conclusion. We established a new experimental model of BPD mimicking closely the pathogenesis in human preterm neonates using pre- and postnatal hits as a basis for research on restoration of normal lung growth. Our study results demonstrate that UCB-MNC therapy of BPD in a double-hit rodent model was efficient by reducing the severity of the disorder without adverse effects. It thus might be considered as a translational option, given further studies will improve efficacy without loss in safety.","group":"g3","id":"c8bf513c-5973-4eac-aae6-cb361b26ea5c","_showDetails":true},"8a70f6d8-593c-457e-aebd-d055137665a9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71115371","title":"The relation between vitamin D binding protein single nucleotid polymorphisms and bronchopulmonary dysplasia or related diseases","authors":["Serce O.","Karatekin G.","Koksal V.","Benzer D.","Gursoy T.","Ovali F."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*perinatal care","*diseases","*single nucleotide polymorphism","sepsis","risk factor","tissue injury","antiangiogenic activity","human","patient","genetic susceptibility","DNA sequence","patent ductus arteriosus","classification","angiogenesis","newborn","very low birth weight","infection","inflammation","respiratory distress syndrome","gene","tumor cell","pathology","*vitamin D binding protein","oxygen","sobetirome","fatty acid","actin","vitamin D","DNA"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"41","number":"SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co.

The main pathophysiologies of the bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are inflammation, infection, tissue damage, defects on angiogenesis, and genetic susceptibility. Since VDBP may affect these factors, we aimed to investigate the relationship between VDBP polymorphisms and BPD or BPD related diseases. Patients, Methods: PCR DNA sequence analysis were used for GC gene p.T436K (T420K, rs4588) and p.D432E (D416E, rs7041) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 160 very low birth weight neonates (= 32 GWs, = 1500 g) who were hospitalised between July 2010 - 2011.

Besides the prenatal inflammation that is facilitated by some infections, some authors consider malnutrition to be a factor favouring BDP. In an experimental animal model, caloric restriction has been shown to reduce the number of alveoli and the effective alveolar surface area {12055}. The aim of this study is to analyse the contribution of enteral and parenteral protein and lipid intake during the first 14 days of life to the development of BPD. MATERIAL AND METHOD A retrospective cohort study was conducted between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2012 in infants weighing less than 1500 g and/or born before 32 weeks' gestational age. The nutritional parameters examined included the cumulative consumption of liquids, proteins, calories and carbohydrates in the first 14 days of life.

RESULTS Our neonatal intensive care unit treated 185 very low birth weight infants, of whom 20 were excluded from analysis due to death or transfer to other hospitals. The prevalence of BPD in the period analysed was 38.4%. Total caloric intake was significantly lower in the infants with subsequent BPD. According to our results, the energy intake of the latter infants, during the first two weeks of life, was below recommended levels. Taken overall, parenteral caloric intake was not associated with BPD. Multinomial logistic regression indicates that for every increase of one KCal/Kg enteral intake in the first 14 days of life, the chance of developing mild, moderate or severe BPD is multiplied by an OR of 0.99, 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. In all, this reflects a slight protective effect against BPD. We observed no difference in total fluid intake between patients with and without subsequent BPD. CONCLUSIONS We observed a slight protective effect of enteral cacaloric intake against theonset of BPD, but no such effect concerning parenteral caloric intake.","group":"g1","id":"1b6ba623-c4f9-450b-ad5b-8e53a384ac97","_showDetails":true},"1ca43bc2-f188-41cb-9405-2ee85d57411a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023 to 2024>","title":"High-mobility group box-1 peptide ameliorates bronchopulmonary dysplasia by suppressing inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.06.032","authors":["Hara, Takeya","Shimbo, Takashi","Masuda, Tatsuo","Kitayama, Tomomi","Fujii, Makoto","Hanawa, Morifumi","Yokota, Kazuha","Endo, Masayuki","Tomimatsu, Takuji","Kimura, Tadashi","Tamai, Katsuto"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230609//","keywords":["Animals","Humans","Mice","Infant, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Injury","HMGB1 Protein/me [Metabolism]","*HMGB1 Protein","Animals, Newborn","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Hyperoxia","Cytokines/ae [Adverse Effects]","Inflammation/dt [Drug Therapy]","Inflammation/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Fibrosis"],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","volume":"671","isbn":"0006-291X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med24&NEWS=N&AN=37329659"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the effect of the HMGB1 peptide on Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-related lung injury in a mouse model., RESULTS: HMGB1 peptide ameliorates lung injury by suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and decreasing soluble collagen levels in the lungs.

FATIICs were isolated on embryonic day 19 and exposed to 65%-oxygen for 24 hrs. Cells in room air were used as controls. IL-10Rs protein and mRNA were analysed by ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively. IL-10SPs were assessed by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies. IL-10Rs protein and mRNA increased significantly in FATIICs during hyperoxia, but JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation showed the opposite pattern. To evaluate the impact of IL-8 (shown previously to be increased) and the role of IL-10Rs, IL-10SPs were reanalysed in IL-8-added normoxic cells and in the IL-10Rs' siRNA-treated hyperoxic cells. The IL-10Rs' siRNA-treated hyperoxic cells and IL-8-added normoxic cells showed the same pattern in IL10SPs with the hyproxic cells. And pre-treatment with rIL-10 prior to hyperoxia exposure increased phosphorylated IL-10SPs, compared to the rIL-10-untreated hyperoxic cells. These studies suggest that JAK1 and TYK2 were significantly suppressed during hyperoxia, where IL-8 may play a role, and rIL-10 may have an effect on reverting the suppressed JAK1 and TYK2 in FATIICs exposed to hyperoxia.

Family studies indicate that BPD has a significant genetic component. We assessed the gene encoding Kit ligand (KITLG) as a candidate for genetic predisposition to BPD due to its role in augmentation of inflammation. Method(s): Eight KITLG -tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in cohorts of very preterm infants originating from northern Finland (56 cases of moderate or severe BPD and 197 controls), southern Finland (n = 59 + 52 controls) and Canada (n = 58 + 68 controls). Additional replication populations included infants born in Finland (n = 41 + 241 controls) and Hungary (n = 29 + 40 controls). The results were controlled for the degree of prematurity and for other known risk factors of BPD. Result(s): Six SNPs of KITLG and a haplotype including all eight genotyped SNPs were associated with moderate-to-severe BPD. When the Finnish and Hungarian replication populations were combined with the original Finnish and Canadian populations, SNP rs11104948 was significantly associated with BPD. Conclusion(s): Polymorphisms of the KITLG gene are associated with susceptibility to BPD. Kit ligand and its receptor have proposed roles in lung inflammation and pulmonary growth. In addition, Kit ligand promotes the differentiation of mast cells that accumulate in the lungs of infants with severe BPD. This supports the possibility that KITLG polymorphisms predispose to reactive lung disease associated with mast cells.","group":"g1","id":"37c05f01-1c92-447a-a209-432b57318234","_showDetails":true},"57df91f3-d712-4027-b683-62d26a75071b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71111517","title":"Caffeine and rolipram down-regulate smad signalling and TGF-beta-stimulated ctgf and transgelin expression in lung epithelial cells","authors":["Kunzmann S.","Fehrholz M.","Bersani I.","Speer C.P."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*lung","*epithelium cell","*workshop","lung fibrosis","respiratory tract inflammation","airway remodeling","promoter region","lung dysplasia","upregulation","Western blotting","lung development","real time polymerase chain reaction","phosphorylation","second messenger","newborn","pathogenesis","genetic transfection","actin filament","assay","plasmid","prematurity","human","*caffeine","*rolipram","*transgelin","*surfactant","connective tissue growth factor","protein","messenger RNA","transforming growth factor beta","luciferase","phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor","phosphodiesterase inhibitor","factor A"],"journal":"Neonatology","language":"English","volume":"103","number":"4","publisher":"S.

However, the effects of caffeine on airway remodelling in preterm neonates are still undefined. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signalling pathway is one of the key regulators of lung development, airway inflammation, airway remodelling and lung fibrosis. All contribute to development of BPD. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a downstream mediator of TGF-beta, and transgelin, a binding and stabilising protein of the actin cytoskeleton, are both regulated by TGF-beta and play an important role in airway/vascular remodelling. Objective(s): To clarify whether caffeine, an unspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, and Rolipram, a specific PDE IV inhibitor, affect TGF-beta-induced Smad signalling and CTGF/ transgelin expression in lung epithelial cells. Method(s): The effects of caffeine and Rolipram on Smad signalling were investigated using a luciferase- assay via transfection of a TGF-beta-inducible reporter-plasmid in A549 cells. The regulation of CTGF and transgelin expression by caffeine and Rolipram were studied by promoter analysis, real-time PCR and Western-blotting. Result(s): Caffeine and Rolipram inhibited TGF-beta induced Smad3 phosphorylation in a dosedependent manner, with an 84 +/- 3.5% inhibition by caffeine (10 m M ; p < 0.05) and a 75 +/- 4% inhibition by Rolipram (1 m M ; p < 0.05). They also antagonized the TGF-beta-induced up-regulation of CTGF and transgelin on promoter-, mRNA-, and protein-level (p < 0.05 for all methods). Both effects of caffeine and Rolipram on inhibition on Smad signalling and CTGF/transgelin expression were mediated by the second messenger cAMP. Conclusion(s): The findings support possible new molecular mechanisms of caffeine and Rolipram in pathogenesis of BPD. We speculate that caffeine and Rolipram which essentially inhibit the TGF-beta signalling pathway including various downstream mediators, may reduce airway inflammation, remodelling and pulmonary fibrosis.","group":"g1","id":"57df91f3-d712-4027-b683-62d26a75071b","_showDetails":true},"fef6b667-57e7-47d3-be32-9b0b491a417d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71064891","title":"Interventional closure of secundum type atrial septal defect in children with a bodyweight less than 10 kg: Indications, feasibility and outcome","authors":["Quandt D.","Knirsch W.","Kretschmar O."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*society","*heart atrium septum defect","*cardiology","*child","*human","*Japanese","*pediatric cardiology","*heart surgery","*Asia","devices","echocardiography","procedures","patient","failure to thrive","vein thrombosis","bleeding","prematurity","fluoroscopy","pulmonary hypertension","infant","trisomy 21","morbidity","genetic disorder","lung dysplasia","follow up","risk","male","sildenafil"],"journal":"Cardiology in the Young","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","isbn":"1047-9511","address":"D.

Aim of our study was to evaluate indications, feasibility, periprocedural complications, and outcome of interventional ASD closures in very small children with a bodyweight less than 10 kg. Method(s): Retrospective analysis (2005-2012) of ASD closures in children less than 10 kg bodyweight. Result(s): In 25 children (13 male) 24 successful interventional ASD device closures were performed at a median age of 1.2 years (0.2-2.8) and a bodyweight of median 7.5 kg (4.6-9.9). RV volume overload was present on echocardiography in 24 patients, resulting in a Qp/Qs of mean 1.7 (61). Clinically 9 (36%) pts presented with failure to thrive. 8 (32%) were past preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In 12 pts a genetic syndrome (Trisomy 21 in 9pts, 36%) was present. In more than 2/3 of the pts (n=18, 72%) pulmonary hypertension (PAH) was suspected on echocardiography. Haemodynamic evaluation revealed baseline PVR of mean 3.8WU/m2 (+/-6.7) and mean PAP 25mmHg (+/-10). ASD size was mean 8.1mm (62.7) with a ratio of bodyweight/defect-size of median 0.87. Mean femoral sheath size used was 7Fr (61.5) and ASD closure devices of 10mm (+/-3 mm), procedure time 84 min(+/-34), fluoroscopy time 13 min (67). There were no periprocedural complications, postinterventionally prolonged femoral bleeding (n=1) and femoral venous thrombosis (n=1) occurred. Median follow-up was 0.5 years (0.1-6) showing complete closure of ASD with no residual shunt in all 24 pts. All pts showed regression of PAH measured by echocardiography, one pt still being treated with sildenafil. Conclusion(s): Interventional ASD closure in children weighing less than 10 kg can be performed without any additional risks and shows a favorable outcome with a slight device oversizing in defect sizes up to 8 mm. Defect sizes in these small children, which comply with the bodyweight of the patient in kg, mostly can be addressed successfully with a percutaneous device closure. Indications for early closure are co-morbidities as BPD, failure to thrive or suspected PAH on echocardiography. As these pts do benefit significantly from the procedure, there are no restrictions to withhold timely procedures from this specific group.","group":"g1","id":"fef6b667-57e7-47d3-be32-9b0b491a417d","_showDetails":false},"9fd5c236-7b74-46b2-929d-dd51c3a6b16b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71033753","title":"Lipid peroxidation products and anti-oxidant enzymes in sick preterm neonates and their relation with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Kanya M.","Mohammad A.","Shalmoli B.","Praveen K."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*lipid peroxidation","*newborn","*human","*prematurity","*lung dysplasia","*society","*Australia and New Zealand","baby","blood","pregnancy","birth weight","blood level","urine level","death","urine","disease predisposition","gestational age","*oxidizing agent","*enzyme","catalase","oxide","malonaldehyde","antioxidant","protein"],"journal":"Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","language":"English","volume":"49","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing","isbn":"1034-4810","address":"M.

We have shown that curcumin accelerates lung maturation by stimulating key alveolar epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and it blocks hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, suggesting it as a potential intervention against BPD. However, its useful as a therapeutic modality has remained limited due to its low bioavailability. We hypothesized that curcumin delivered directly to lungs via nebulization in nanoparticle form would be an effective alternate strategy to overcome the issue of its low bioavailability. Methods Used: Curcumin-loaded apotransferrin nanoparticles (nanocurcumin) were prepared by sol-oil chemistry according to previously described methods. To determine the effect of nanocurcumin on lung maturation, embryonic day 19 rat lung fibroblasts or 1-day old neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to graded doses of nanocurcumin, in vitro (0-10 muM), or in vivo (0-25 mg/kg administered via nebulization in 2 ml saline), respectively, for 24h. Furthermore, nebulized (10 mg/kg once daily) nanocurcumin's effect on hyperoxia (95% O2 for 72h)-induced lung injury was determined by analyzing for functional biomarkers of lung injury/repair. Summary of Results: Both in vitro and in vivo, nanocurcumin administration increased functional biomarkers of lung maturation dose-and timedependently (increased parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor, PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, CCT-alpha, and triolein uptake). Concomitant treatment with nebulized nanocurcumin blocked both the hyperoxia-induced decrease (C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma) and increase (fibronectin and vimentin) in markers of lung injury/ repair. Similarly, in vivo hyperoxia-induced changes in molecular markers of lung apoptosis (decreased BCL2/Bax ratio) were effectively blocked in the nanocurcumin-treated group.

Curcumin has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and it modulates signaling of PPARgamma, an important molecule in the pathobiology of BPD. Curcumin protects against hyperoxia-induced lung injury in the short-term; however, its role in longerterm prevention of BPD is not known. Therefore, we determined if curcumin has a protective effect against hyperoxic neonatal rat lung injury for 5 days at 21 days of age. Methods Used: 1-day old Sprague Dawley rat pups were exposed to either 21% or 95% O2 for 5 days with or without curcumin (5 mg/kg) administered i.p. once daily in 100 Kl volumes. During this time period, the pups were allowed to breast feed ad libitum. To prevent hyperoxic lung injury to the mother, the dams were interchanged every 24h between the 21% and 95 % O2 groups. After 5 days, the pups were allowed to grow with their mothers. At postnatal day (PND)21, pup lung development was studied, including the determination of pulmonary function, gross and cellular structural and functional effects, and molecular mediators of inflammatory injury. To gain mechanistic insights to curcumin's protective effect against hyperoxia-induced lung injury, embryonic day 19 rat lung fibroblasts were cultured and examined for markers of apoptosis and MAPK activation following in vitro exposure to hyperoxia for 24h in the presence or absence of curcumin (5KM). Summary of Results: Systematic analysis for markers of lung injury [apoptosis, Bcl-2/Bax, collagen III, alphaSMA] and lung morphology (radial alveolar count, matrix proteins elastin, tropoelastin, FGFR3, 4, Fibrillin2, 5 and Lox) demonstrated that curcumin effectively blocks hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Exposing e19 lung fibroblasts to 95%O2 for 24 h inhibited cell division, an effect that was dose-dependently reversed by curcumin; mechanistically, curcumin prevented the hyperoxia-induced increases in cleaved caspace-3 and phosphorylation of MapKinase mediators (Erk 1/2, p42 and p44).

The transcription factor NFkappaB regulates expression of both cytoprotective and pro-inflammatory genes, providing a potential mechanistic link for both findings. We hypothesized that the NF-kappaB inhibitory proteins IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta serve separate and specialized roles in mediating the transcriptional response to inflammation in the developing pulmonary endothelium. Methods Used: Presence of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta in the developing lung was assessed by immunofluorescence staining on lung sections obtained from P1 mice and by Western analysis of fetal pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) and alveolar type-2 epithelial cells (AT2). The kinetics of IkappaB degradation, NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA binding, and downstream gene expression (QPCR) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was assessed in wild-type (WT) and IkappaBbeta overexpressing (AKBI) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Summary of Results: Though IkappaBalpha stained diffusely through the lung, IkappaBbeta was expressed primarily in the microvascular endothelium. Supporting this finding, a higher ratio of IkappaBbeta to IkappaBalpha was found in PAEC compared to AT2 (p<0.05). In WT and AKBI MEF, LPS (1h) induced IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta degradation, with return to baseline by 2h of exposure. WT MEF demonstrated peak NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA binding at 1h exposure. AKBI MEF demonstrated prolonged NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA binding compared to WT MEF. Apoptosis, measured by Caspase-3 activity and expression of anti-apoptotic genes, was unaltered in AKBI MEF. However, AKBI MEF demonstrated a muted transcriptional response of multiple pro-inflammatory genes (IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES, IL-11). Conclusion(s): Differential expression of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta can alter the kinetics and gene targets of NF-kappaB activation. The developing pulmonary microvascular endothelium predominately expresses IkappaBbeta, suggesting a unique role for IkappaBbeta in lung development and response to inflammatory insults. A better understanding of the roles played by IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta in mediating cytoprotective and pro-inflammatory responses in the developing pulmonary vasculature may lead to novel therapies aimed to prevent neonatal lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"f17deed8-53bf-4795-83eb-d1eaa52d3dbf","_showDetails":true},"36ed842b-fc45-4b6c-9135-7dca0f61258e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70993419","title":"The incidence and impact of CMV infection in preterm infants","authors":["Turner K.M.","Lee H.C.","Boppana S.B.","Carlo W.A.","Randolph D.A."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*infant","*human","*prematurity","*medical research","*cytomegalovirus infection","very low birth weight","hearing impairment","nursery","death","adverse outcome","data base","patient","screening","risk","necrotizing enterocolitis","sepsis","multivariate analysis","hospital","medical record","controlled study","premature labor","lung dysplasia","United States","encephalomalacia","brain hemorrhage","perception deafness","retrolental fibroplasia","neuroimaging","digestive system perforation","child","Cytomegalovirus"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"61","number":"2","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"K.M.

Limited data exist regarding whether congenital CMV is associated with preterm delivery. The extent to which CMV infection increases the risk of adverse outcomes in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants is also unknown. We aimed to determine the incidence of congenital CMV in VLBW infants, and to describe and role of congenital and acquired CMV in modifying outcomes of VLBW preterm infants. Methods Used: This was a retrospective case controlled study of infants admitted to the UAB nursery where CMV screening is part of routine admission orders. All infants admitted between the years 1993-2008 and weighing G1500 grams were included. CMV status and clinical outcomes were queried using two internal patient databases and hospital-based medical records. For clinical outcomes analysis, the 5 consecutive VLBW infants born before and after each CMV-positive case were used as controls. The primary outcome was death or NDI. Secondary outcomes included sensorineural hearing loss, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and culture proven late-onset sepsis. Multivariate analysis was performed. Summary of Results: Seventeen of 4,594 VLBW infants queried had congenital CMV (0.37%), a lower rate than that published for term infants. An additional 16 infants (0.35%) acquired CMV in the nursery. Compared to controls, congenitally infected VLBW infants were more likely to have hearing loss (64% vs. 10%, p<0.0001) and abnormal neuroimaging (71% vs. 28%, p<0.0001). Developmental motor outcomes were also significantly worse for CMV infected infants (50% vs. 12%, p=0.03), although this information was available for only 6 congenital CMV infants and 33 controls. Congenital CMV was not associated with death. Acquired CMV was only associated with gastrointestinal perforation (p=0.008). Conclusion(s): CMV infection is not positively associated with prematurity. Congenital but not acquired CMV in VLBW infants is associated with hearing loss and neurologic deficits.","group":"g1","id":"36ed842b-fc45-4b6c-9135-7dca0f61258e","_showDetails":false},"b762e05f-c492-4e6f-8a12-8e792b9f840d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71223497","title":"Role of flow cytometry in diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis","authors":["Jain P.","Pradhan R.","Warner N.","Singh A.K.","Chatterjee M."],"date":"2013//","keywords":["*flow cytometry","*diagnosis","*newborn sepsis","*Indian","*society","*hematology","*blood transfusion","sepsis","human","patient","monocyte","neutrophil","monitoring","infant","infection","newborn","predictive value","risk","laboratory","innate immunity","pathogenesis","thrombocyte count","exposure","bloodstream infection","lung dysplasia","prematurity","leukocyte count","control group","blood sampling","parameters","treatment response","blood","fluorescence","antibiotic resistance","newborn apnea","hospitalization","T lymphocyte","hospital infection","body temperature","antigen presentation","major histocompatibility complex","prospective study","publication","bacterial infection","upregulation","transient tachypnea of the newborn","antibiotic therapy","algorithm","antimicrobial therapy","physical disease by body function","economic aspect","health care","antibiotic agent","marker","acute phase protein","C reactive protein","biochemical marker","antiinfective agent","interleukin 6","cell surface receptor","alpha integrin","Fc receptor","procalcitonin","cell surface marker"],"journal":"Indian Journal of Hematology and Blood Transfusion","language":"English","volume":"29","number":"4","publisher":"Springer India","isbn":"0971-4502","address":"P.

In both term and preterm infants, early warning signs and symptoms are often minimal, subtle, non-specific, and can easily be misinterpreted as being due to non-infective causes such as transient tachypnea of the newborn, environmentally induced fluctuation of body temperature, apnea of prematurity, and acute exacerbations of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [1]. In particular, blood stream infections (sepsis) develop very rapidly, and are often fatal within hours of neonatal exposure to pathogens. It is classified into early-onset form (EONS) within the first 72 h of life and late-onset form (LONS) afterwards. Infected infants must be promptly identified and differentiated from non-infected patients, and antibiotics started without delay. Consequently, treatment is often initiated empirically based on clinical algorithms and it is estimated that an average of 17 infants is treated for each one who is truly infected [2]. Continuation of antibiotics for presumptive bacterial infection often leads to unnecessary and prolonged treatment adding to cost of care, risk of developing nosocomial infections during hospital stay and may lead to emergence of antibiotic resistance. An 'ideal' marker for neonatal sepsis should have a sensitivity and negative predictive value approaching 100 % along with specificity and positive predictive value of 85 % or better [1]. A wide variety of surrogate hematological and biochemical markers have been investigated for the evaluation of clinical sepsis. Most notable of these include total WBC count, Immature to Total neutrophil ratio (I/T ratio), Platelet counts, micro-ESR, IL-6 and acute phase reactants such as Creactive protein and procalcitonin. None of these tests are however, sensitive and specific enough to influence the clinical decision for withholding antibiotic treatment at the onset or within 24 h of suspected infection [1]. Over the last decade various flow cytometry based methods have been explored to identify activation of cells of innate immunity as markers of sepsis that detect infection earlier than the acute phase reactants, with the rationale that it is the activation of these cells that leads to the generation of acute phase reactants [3]. Up-regulated expression of CD64, the Fc-gamma receptor [1], and CD11b (Integrin alpha M) on neutrophils and down-regulated expression of HLA-DR (MHC class II cell surface receptor involved in antigen presentation to T cells) on monocytes have shown promise in various studies for diagnosis, prognostication or monitoring response to antibiotics in neonatal sepsis [1-7] In a prospective study (manuscript under preparation) we have investigated the utility of flow cytometric evaluation of five markers pertaining to innate immunity (CD64, CD11b, HLA-DR, CD282 and CD88) in 100 patients with suspected neonatal sepsis. We also derived and evaluated a novel composite parameter \"Sepsis Index (SI)\", based on ratio of median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD64 on neutrophils (nCD64) to MFI of HLA-DR on monocytes (mHLA-DR). Peripheral blood samples were collected at diagnosis based on clinical suspicion (sample 1), after 24 h of initiation of antibiotics (sample 2), and after 4-6 days from diagnosis (sample 3). Twenty-nine control samples from healthy neonates were also studied to define the cut-offs for upregulation or downregulation of these markers. Of the 100 cases, 63 patients were eventually classified to have sepsis based on culture positivity (21 cases) and European Medical Agency (EMA) clinical sepsis criteria [8] (42 cases). These 63 patients were grouped as 'Final Sepsis' (FS) cases. The remaining 47 patients were grouped as 'Final No Sepsis' (FNS) cases. Expectedly, the expression of nCD64 on sample 1 was significantly upregulated in the FS group when compared to the FNS and healthy controls (p<0.001). Expression of nCD88 was significantly downregulated in FS and FNS groups in comparison to the control group (p<0.001). However, in terms of expression of nCD11b, nCD282 and nHLA-DR, there were no significant differences between the groups. With regard to monocytes, mHLA-DR was significantly down-regulated in the FS group as compared to FNS and healthy controls (p<0.001) and mCD88 showed a consistent but non-significant decrease in the FS and FNS groups (p = 0.064). There was no clear cut trend observed with mCD64 expression as also mCD11b and mCD282 showed no significant differences across the groups. Amongst the laboratory parameters studied, nCD64 and Sepsis Index had the highest sensitivity to detect sepsis on day 1 sample (73 %each) followed by '=2 EMA laboratory signs for sepsis' (63 %), CRP (38 %) and mHLA-DR (19 %). Sensitivity improved with information from sample 2 in case of nCD64 (86.53 %) and SI (82.69 %). It further improved to 92.3 %, when either nCD64 or SI values were considered from both Samples 1 and 2. Specificity to detect sepsis at day 1 for nCD64 and SI was 89 and 72 % respectively. Overall as a stand-alone parameter nCD64 had the best diagnostic efficacy. We also explored the role of nCD64 and SI in monitoring the response to antibiotics and predicting the need to add/ change the antimicrobial therapy. We found SI to perform better than nCD64 in these aspects. In sepsis cases, where sample 3 was > cut-off, the odds ratio (OR) for change of antimicrobials on/beyond day 4 was 5.92 (p = 0.021, 95 %CI 1.22-32.22) for nCD64 and 6.33 (p = 0.007, 95 % CI 1.52-26.34) for SI. Taken together, this study and the experience of others as evident in published literature, endorse that flow cytometric testing of cell surface markers should be incorporated as a part of the 'septic screen' to diagnose/rule-out sepsis. It would also be worthwhile to undertake further studies to validate the role of nCD64 and Sepsis Index in monitoring therapeutic responses in comparison with more established tools like CRP.","group":"g1","id":"b762e05f-c492-4e6f-8a12-8e792b9f840d","_showDetails":true},"5d13ee4d-a0cd-451f-b78a-4f2dd3ab92ff":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Exome Sequencing of Neonatal Blood Spots and the Identification of Genes Implicated in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201501-0168OC","authors":["Li, Jingjing","Yu, Kun-Hsing","Oehlert, John","Jeliffe-Pawlowski, Laura L","Gould, Jeffrey B","Stevenson, David K","Snyder, Michael","Shaw, Gary M","O'Brodovich, Hugh M"],"date":"2015//","keywords":["Animals","Blood Specimen Collection","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Case-Control Studies","*Exome/ge [Genetics]","Female","Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Genome-Wide Association Study","Haploinsufficiency","Humans","Infant","Infant, Extremely Premature","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Lung/em [Embryology]","Male","Mice","*Morphogenesis/ge [Genetics]","Neonatal Screening","Sequence Analysis, DNA","*Twins, Dizygotic/ge [Genetics]","*Twins, Monozygotic/ge [Genetics]","*Wnt Signaling Pathway/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine","volume":"192","number":"5","isbn":"1073-449X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26030808"],"address":"United States","abstract":"RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a prevalent severe lung disease of premature infants, has a strong genetic component. Large-scale genome-wide association studies for common variants have not revealed its genetic basis., OBJECTIVES: Given the historical high mortality rate of extremely preterm infants who now survive and develop BPD, we hypothesized that risk loci underlying this disease are under severe purifying selection during evolution; thus, rare variants likely explain greater risk of the disease., METHODS: We performed exome sequencing on 50 BPD-affected and unaffected twin pairs using DNA isolated from neonatal blood spots and identified genes affected by extremely rare nonsynonymous mutations. Functional genomic approaches were then used to systematically compare these affected genes., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 258 genes with rare nonsynonymous mutations in patients with BPD. These genes were highly enriched for processes involved in pulmonary structure and function including collagen fibril organization, morphogenesis of embryonic epithelium, and regulation of Wnt signaling pathway; displayed significantly elevated expression in fetal and adult lungs; and were substantially up-regulated in a murine model of BPD. Analyses of mouse mutants revealed their phenotypic enrichment for embryonic development and the cyanosis phenotype, a clinical manifestation of BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the role of rare variants in BPD, in contrast with the role of common variants targeted by genome-wide association studies. Overall, our study is the first to sequence BPD exomes from newborn blood spot samples and identify with high confidence genes implicated in BPD, thereby providing important insights into its biology and molecular etiology.","group":"g2","id":"5d13ee4d-a0cd-451f-b78a-4f2dd3ab92ff","_showDetails":true},"751b507e-1a8f-434f-817e-f5556e9c89bb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"365366847","title":"Neonatal mice genetically modified to express the elastase inhibitor elafin are protected against the adverse effects of mechanical ventilation on lung growth","authors":["Hilgendorff A.","Parai K.","Ertsey R.","Juliana Rey-Parra G.","Thebaud B.","Tamosiuniene R.","Jain N.","Navarro E.F.","Starcher B.C.","Nicolls M.R.","Rabinovitch M.","Bland R.D."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["airway remodeling","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","apoptosis","article","*artificial ventilation","controlled study","*DNA modification","emphysema","enzyme activity","enzyme inhibition","*lung development","mouse","newborn","nonhuman","priority journal","protein degradation","protein expression","signal transduction","vascular endothelium","*ventilator induced lung injury/et [Etiology]","caspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*elafin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","elastase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","gelatinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound]","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","oxygen","transforming growth factor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"303","number":"3","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1522-1504","address":"R.

Prior studies in preterm sheep and neonatal mice showed that MV-O2 stimulated lung elastase activity, causing degradation and remodeling of matrix elastin. These changes yielded an inflammatory response, with TGF-beta activation, scattered elastic fibers, and increased apoptosis, culminating in defective alveolar septation and arrested lung growth. To see whether sustained inhibition of elastase activity would prevent these adverse pulmonary effects of MV-O2, we did studies comparing wild-type (WT) and mutant neonatal mice genetically modified to express in their vascular endothelium the human serine elastase inhibitor elafin (Eexp). Five-day-old WT and Eexp mice received MV with 40% O2 (MV-O2) for 24-36 h. WT and Eexp controls breathed 40% O2 without MV. MV-O2 increased lung elastase and MMP-9 activity, resulting in elastin degradation (urine desmosine doubled), TGF-beta activation (pSmad-2 increased 6-fold), apoptosis (cleaved-caspase-3 increased 10-fold), and inflammation (NF-kappaB activation, influx of neutrophils and monocytes) in lungs of WT vs. unventilated controls. These changes were blocked or blunted during MV-O2 of Eexp mice. Scattered lung elastin and emphysematous alveoli observed in WT mice after 36 h of MV-O2 were attenuated in Eexp mice. Both WT and Eexp mice showed defective VEGF signaling (decreased lung VEGF-R2 protein) and loss of pulmonary microves-sels after lengthy MV-O2, suggesting that elafin's beneficial effects during MV-O2 derived primarily from preserving matrix elastin and suppressing lung inflammation, thereby enabling alveolar formation during MV-O2. These results suggest that degradation and remodeling of lung elastin can contribute to defective lung growth in response to MV-O2 and might be targeted therapeutically to prevent ventilator-induced neonatal lung injury. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","group":"g1","id":"751b507e-1a8f-434f-817e-f5556e9c89bb","_showDetails":true},"1bf3b728-343e-4d42-8cba-87ab26f0091f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"365664346","title":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","authors":["Kaiser C.","Gembruch U.","Janzen V.","Gast A.-S."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["abdominal bleeding/th [Therapy]","adult","article","blurred vision/co [Complication]","brain hemorrhage","brain ventricle peritoneum shunt","case report","cesarean section","Coombs test","erythrocyte transfusion","eye examination","facial nerve paralysis","female","fetus lung maturity","gestational age","HELLP syndrome","hospital admission","human","hydrocephalus/co [Complication]","hydrocephalus/su [Surgery]","intracytoplasmic sperm injection","laboratory test","laparotomy","lung dysplasia","male","newborn","newborn mortality","plasmapheresis","pneumothorax","positive end expiratory pressure","prematurity","primipara","priority journal","reoperation","reticulocyte count","sepsis","survival rate","thrombocyte count","thrombocyte transfusion","*thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/di [Diagnosis]","*thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/th [Therapy]","treatment response","twins","betamethasone","D dimer/ec [Endogenous Compound]","haptoglobin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","hemoglobin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","lactate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","von Willebrand factor cleaving proteinase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","dichorionic diamniotic twins"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"25","number":"10","publisher":"Informa Healthcare (69-77 Paul Street, London EC2A 4LQ, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1476-4954","address":"A.-S.

A re-laparotomy had to be performed because of intra-abdominal bleedings. The patient was given seven packed thrombocytes and five packed erythrocytes. The patient complained about blurred vision. The right corner of the mouth was slightly depressed in terms of a facial nerve paresis. Further platelet counts were about 50000/l. Haemoglobin: 7.8 mg/l. D-Dimer: 1066 mg/l.

Inhalation of CO2 (therapeutic hypercapnia) has been described to limit cytokine production and to have anti-inflammatory effects on the injured lung; we therefore hypothesized that therapeutic hypercapnia would prevent bleomycin-induced lung injury. Spontaneously breathing rat pups were treated with bleomycin (1 mg/kg/d ip) or saline vehicle from postnatal days 1-14 while being continuously exposed to 5% CO2 (PaCO2 elevated by 15-20 mmHg), 7% CO2 (PaCO2 elevated by 35 mmHg), or normocapnia. Bleomycin-treated animals exposed to 7%, but not 5%, CO2, had significantly attenuated lung tissue macrophage influx and PHT, as evidenced by normalized pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular systolic function, decreased right ventricular hypertrophy, and attenuated remodeling of pulmonary resistance arteries. The level of CO2 neither prevented increased tissue neutrophil influx nor led to improvements in decreased lung weight, septal thinning, impaired alveolarization, or decreased numbers of peripheral arteries. Bleomycin led to increased expression and content of lung tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which was found to colocalize with tissue macrophages and to be attenuated by exposure to 7% CO2. Inhibition of TNF-alpha signaling with the soluble TNF-2 receptor etanercept (0.4 mg/kg ip from days 1-14 on alternate days) prevented bleomycin-induced PHT without decreasing tissue macrophages and, similar to CO2, had no effect on arrested alveolar development. Our findings are consistent with a preventive effect of therapeutic hypercapnia with 7% CO2 on bleomycin-induced PHT via attenuation of macrophage-derived TNF-alpha. Neither tissue macrophages nor TNF-alpha appeared to contribute to arrested lung development induced by bleomycin. That 7% CO2 normalized pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular function without improving inhibited airway and vascular development suggests that vascular hypoplasia does not contribute significantly to functional changes of PHT in this model. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","group":"g1","id":"f32fc01b-31a2-4dd8-adc2-f4ca0b4b0dcc","_showDetails":true},"9f221711-16a8-4bfb-a51e-6bd7d3bed864":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"52085412","title":"Spectrum of chronic lung disease in a population of newborns with extremely low gestational age","authors":["Hjalmarson O.","Brynjarsson H.","Nilsson S.","Sandberg K.L."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["Apgar score","article","artificial ventilation","*blood oxygenation","clinical article","cohort analysis","disease severity","female","gestational age","hospital discharge","human","infant","lung alveolus oxygen tension","*lung dysplasia","lung function","male","*newborn disease","oxygen therapy","pathogenesis","population research","predictor variable","priority journal","prospective study","risk factor","sensitivity and specificity","tertiary health care","*extremely low gestational age"],"journal":"Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics","language":"English","volume":"101","number":"9","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd (9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2XG, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1651-2227","address":"O.

Study design: We studied the sucking patterns and fidgety movements of 44 preterm infants (gestational age <35 weeks) longitudinally from 34 weeks' postmenstrual age up to 14 weeks postterm. We used the Neonatal Oral-Motor Assessment Scale during feeding and scored the sucking patterns as normal or abnormal. Abnormal sucking patterns were categorized into arrhythmic sucking and uncoordinated sucking. At 14 weeks postterm, we scored the quality of fidgety movements from videotapes as normal, abnormal, or absent. Result(s): The postmenstrual age at which sucking patterns became normal (median, 48 weeks; range, 34 to >50 weeks) was correlated with the quality of fidgety movements (Spearman rho = -0.33; P =.035). The percentage per infant of normal and uncoordinated sucking patterns was also correlated with the quality of fidgety movements (rho = 0.31; P =.048 and rho = -0.33; P =.032, respectively). Infants with uncoordinated sucking patterns had a higher rate of abnormal fidgety movements (OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 1.4-40; P =.019). Conclusion(s): The development of sucking patterns in preterm infants was related to the quality of fidgety movements. Uncoordinated sucking patterns were associated with abnormal fidgety movements, indicating that uncoordinated sucking, swallowing, and breathing may represent neurologic dysfunction.

High concentrations of oxygen were implicated, and BPD was equated with 'pulmonary oxygen toxicity'. The etiologic role of not only oxygen but also peak inspiratory pressures and the duration of exposure to both was emphasized in the 1970s, but BPD remained a dreaded complication of managing respiratory distress syndrome in the 1980s. It was only after exogenous surfactant became commercially available for endotracheal administration that 'classical' BPD began to disappear and was replaced by the 'new' BPD. 'Classical' BPD was seen in more mature preterm infants (>28 weeks' gestational age) and in its severe form was characterized radiographically by micro- and macrocysts of the lung, lung hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragms. In contrast, 'new' BPD is seen in less mature infants (<28 weeks' gestational age), has comparatively mild radiographic abnormalities and has been defined as continued oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Pathologically, 'classical' BPD frequently revealed obstructive bronchiolitis and fibrosis of lung parenchyma, whereas 'new' BPD demonstrates minimal fibrosis but uniform arrest of development. Herein, factors which may contribute to the etiology of BPD are described, as well as possible preventative and therapeutic strategies. Copyright © 2012 S.

Method(s): Neonatal rats were exposed to hyperoxia to establish BPD models (control group was exposed to air), lung water was measured and Western blot was applied to detect the expression of three homologous subunits: alpha-, beta- and gamma-ENaC in the lung tissues. Furthermore, ATII cells were isolated from neonatal rats, and primarily cultured under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. The ENaC expression was also examined in these cells. In addition, the amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents induced by hyperoxia were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Result(s): The alpha-ENaC expression was increased after 5 days of hyperoxia in rat lung tissues, whereas not after 1, 3 and 7 days. ATII cells showed alpha-ENaC expression was reduced after 1 and 2 days' hyperoxia, but no change after 3 days. In contrast, beta- and gamma-ENaC expression was increased after hyperoxia in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in hyperoxia-exposed ATII cells were also increased, which was consistent with the upregulated expression of beta- and gamma-ENaC. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia upregulates the expression of ENaC, especially beta- and gamma-ENaC subunits, in both neonatal rat lung tissues and ATII cells. Hyperoxia also enhanced the activity of ENaC in neonatal rat ATII cells.

Variants in genes regulating surfactant function and metabolism are implicated in some rare and common respiratory diseases. Congenital surfactant deficiencies are rare diseases due to mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins and cause significant and often lethal respiratory failure in newborns and interstitial lung disease in older children. Diagnosis is made by molecular analysis and eventually confirmed by histological analysis of lung tissue. A multi-factorial contribution, resulting from interaction between multiple genes and environmental factors, has been supposed for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Several potential candidate genes, especially regarding surfactant proteins and cytokines, have been shown in association with these diseases. Genetic variants predisposing to RDS or BPD are usually polymorphisms which are not causative, but can increase susceptibility to the disease.

Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protects adult and newborn mice against hyperoxic lung injury by mediating increases in the expression of phase I (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A) and phase II (NADP(H) quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1)) antioxidant enzymes (AOE). AhR positively regulates the expression of RelB, a component of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) protein that contributes to anti-inflammatory processes in adult animals. Whether AhR regulates the expression of AOE and RelB, and protects fetal primary human lung cells against hyperoxic injury is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that AhR-deficient fetal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) will have decreased RelB activation and AOE, which will in turn predispose them to increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death compared to AhR-sufficient HPMEC upon exposure to hyperoxia. AhR-deficient HPMEC showed increased hyperoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and cell death compared to AhR-sufficient HPMEC. Additionally, AhR-deficient cell culture supernatants displayed increased macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha and 1beta, indicating a heightened inflammatory state. Interestingly, loss of AhR was associated with a significantly attenuated CYP1A1, NQO1, superoxide dismutase 1(SOD1), and nuclear RelB protein expression. These findings support the hypothesis that decreased RelB activation and AOE in AhR-deficient cells is associated with increased hyperoxic injury compared to AhR-sufficient cells.

In the present study, we examined the effects of maternal exposure to captopril (2.85. mg/kg/day) during late pregnancy (G13-G21) on postnatal rat lung development. Treatment with captopril during late pregnancy caused a significant decrease in ACE activity in P0 rats. Body weight decreased at P0 (p < 0.001), P8 and P15 (p < 0.01) in captopril-treated rats. Lung weight of P0 and P8 pups was lower in treated-animals (p.< 0.05). Lungs from captopril-treated animals showed impaired alveolar formation, with enlarged distal airway spaces at P8, P15 and P30. Interalveolar wall distance measured by mean linear intercept increased in treated vs. age-matched animals at P8, P15 (p < 0.001) and P30 (p < 0.05) resembling new bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In control animals, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) marker was higher at P0 and then drops gradually, while in captopril-treated animals PCNA marker remains higher at all stages studied. alpha-Smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), a marker of fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, was higher at the tips of developing secondary septa in captopril-treated lungs at P8 and P15. The increased expression of PCNA and alpha-SMA in treated pups suggest that beyond the effect caused by captopril, the developing lungs have the capacity to recover once the treatment was stopped. Taking together the low weight, histomorphological changes and increased expression of cellular markers caused by ACE inhibition during late pregnancy, it appears that the RAS could be an intrinsic factor involved in secondary septa formation during lung development. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","group":"g1","id":"6b15817a-5dd6-40f6-bc4f-d94a06e1061d","_showDetails":true},"ea70605b-c792-4e64-878a-f83599789acf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"368721018","title":"Randomized controlled trial of two methods of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP) in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: Underwater bubbly CPAP vs. Medijet system device","authors":["Hosseini M.-B.","Heidarzadeh M.","Balila M.","Ghojazadeh M.","Janani R.","Safavi-Nia S.","Naghavi-Behzad M.","Alikhah H."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["abdominal distension/co [Complication]","article","brain hemorrhage/co [Complication]","cause of death","comparative study","controlled study","extremely low birth weight","female","general medical device","gestational age","human","hyperemia/co [Complication]","infant","Iran","length of stay","lung dysplasia/co [Complication]","lung hemorrhage/co [Complication]","major clinical study","male","nasal prong","necrotizing enterocolitis/co [Complication]","*neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/th [Therapy]","newborn","newborn apnea/co [Complication]","newborn intensive care","outcome assessment","oxygen consumption","pneumothorax/co [Complication]","*positive end expiratory pressure","*prematurity","randomized controlled trial","respiratory gas humidifier","respiratory tract parameters","retrolental fibroplasia/co [Complication]","small for date infant","treatment duration","treatment failure","betamethasone","bubble continuous positive airway pressure device","fraction of inspired oxygen","*nasal positive end expiratory pressure","nose hyperemia/co [Complication]"],"journal":"Turkish Journal of Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"54","number":"6","publisher":"Turkish Journal of Pediatrics (Samanpazan, P.O.

All infants were randomized in the first hour of life to B-CPAP or MJ system. Short binasal prongs were used in both groups and CPAP was set at the level of 5-6 cm H2O. The primary outcome of this study was duration of CPAP need (hour). Other outcomes, such as complications of the two methods of N-CPAP, were evaluated using a checklist. Ninety infants were randomized to the MJ system, and 71 were randomized to B-CPAP. The mean gestational age and birth weight were similar in the two groups, as was the duration of CPAP need (44.3+/-20.64 vs. 49.2+/-21.2 hours, respectively; p=0.66). Moreover, the probability of complications, such as CPAP failure rate, pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage, abdominal distention, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, was the same between the two study groups (p>0.05). There was a trend of more hyperemia of the nose in the B-CPAP group in comparison to the MJ system group (10% versus 3.3%, respectively), but the difference was not significant (p=0.08). In conclusion, the MJ system is as effective as B-CPAP in the management of infants with RDS.","group":"g1","id":"ea70605b-c792-4e64-878a-f83599789acf","_showDetails":true},"4507b1a0-338d-4bb1-a9f9-0011fbc2d85a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"365543347","title":"Effects of intrauterine infection or inflammation on fetal lung development","authors":["Westover A.J.","Moss T.J."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["arachidonic acid metabolism","article","autocrine effect","*fetus lung maturation","human","hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system","*intrauterine infection","lung function","lung parenchyma","meta analysis (topic)","*neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","*neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/pc [Prevention]","neonatal respiratory distress syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","nonhuman","paracrine signaling","premature labor","protein expression","risk","sheep","stimulation","urogenital tract inflammation","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","arachidonic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound]","corticosteroid/dt [Drug Therapy]","glucocorticoid receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","hydrocortisone/ec [Endogenous Compound]","lung surfactant","prostaglandin E2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","prostaglandin synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology","language":"English","volume":"39","number":"9","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing (550 Swanston Street, Carlton South VIC 3053, Australia)","isbn":"1440-1681","address":"T.J.

Preterm infants are at risk of acute respiratory distress as a result of lung immaturity; evidence of exposure to infection and/or inflammation before birth is associated with a reduced risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Experimentally induced intrauterine inflammation or infection in sheep causes a precocious increase in pulmonary surfactant in the preterm lungs that improves preterm lung function, consistent with the reduced risk of RDS in human infants exposed to infection and/or inflammation before birth. The effects of intrauterine inflammation on fetal lung development appear to result from direct action of proinflammatory stimuli within the lungs rather than by systemic signals, such as the classical glucocorticoid-mediated lung maturation pathway. However, paracrine and/or autocrine production and/or metabolism of glucocorticoids in fetal lung tissue may occur as a result of inflammation-induced changes in the expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (types 1 and 2). Likely candidates that mediate inflammation-induced surfactant production by the preterm lung include prostaglandin E2 and/or other arachidonic acid metabolites. Intrauterine inflammation induces the expression of enzymes responsible for prostaglandin production in fetal lung tissue. Inhibition of prostaglandin production prevents, at least in part, the effects of inflammation on fetal lungs. Our experiments are identifying mechanisms of surfactant production by the preterm lungs that may be exploited as novel therapies for preventing respiratory distress in preterm infants. Elucidation of the effects of inflammation on the fetal lungs and other organs will allow more refined approaches to the care of preterm infants exposed to inflammation in utero.

Extrapulmonary effects of iNO are widely recognized, but the underlying chemistry and pharmacology are poorly understood. Growing evidence suggests that, in addition to acting via diffusion, NO can be converted into nitrosants capable of reacting with endogenous L-cysteine (L-Cys) in the alveolar lining fluid, forming S-nitrosothiol (SNO)-L-cysteine (CSNO). CSNO can then enter cells via the type L amino acid transporter (LAT). To determine the influence of LAT and supplemental L-Cys on the functional activity of iNO and transpulmonary movement of SNOs or other related species, we exposed C57Bl6 mice to nebulized L-Cys or D-cysteine (D-Cys) and/or LAT competitors. Isolated lungs were then perfused with physiologic buffer while effluent was collected to assay perfusate SNOs. Nebulized L-Cys, but not D-Cys, augmented the iNO-induced increase in circulating SNOs in the effluent without altering iNO-induced pulmonary vasodilation. Addition to the perfusate of either L-leucine (L-Leu) or 2-amino-2-norborane carboxylic acid, two distinct LAT competitors, inhibited appearance in the perfusate of SNOs in L-Cys-exposed lungs; a higher concentration of L-Leu significantly inhibited the iNO-induced pulmonary vasodilation as well as SNO accumulation. We conclude that iNO-induced pulmonary vasodilation and the transpulmonary movement of iNO-derived SNOs are mediated in part by formation of extracellular CSNO, uptake by alveolar epithelial LAT, and/or export by LAT from the pulmonary endothelium into the circulation. Therapies that exploit and optimize LAT-dependent SNO transport might improve the efficacy of and clinical outcomes with NO-based therapy by improving systemic SNO delivery.

Intra-amniotic LPS exposure decreased Shh mRNA levels and Gli1 protein expression, which was counteracted by both betamethasone pre- or posttreatment. mRNA and protein levels of fibroblast growth factor 10 and bone morphogenetic protein 4, which are important mediators of lung development, increased 2-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, 14 days after LPS exposure. Both 7-day and 14-day exposure to LPS changed the mRNA levels of elastin (ELN) and collagen type I alpha 1 (Col1A1) and 2 (Col1A2), which resulted in fewer elastin foci and increased collagen type I deposition in the alveolar septa. Corticosteroid posttreatment prevented the decrease in ELN mRNA and increased elastin foci and decreased collagen type I deposition in the fetal lung.

Irritants and antioxidant defences: There a variety of irritating and pro-inflammatory environmental stimuli, including air pollution and smoking. Further, there are allergic agents, such as house dust mite that include oxidant-producing NADPH oxidases and infectious agents, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with pigments that can stimulate the production of oxidants, such as pyocianin. Inflammatory cells will also lead to the production of reactive oxidative species and reactive nitrogen species. Nutrition will affect the microflora. The microflora has multiple effects on both innate immunity, eg by competing with pathogens, signalling through Toll Like Receptors (TLR's), peptadoglycan affecting neutrophil function through NOD1, and effects on adaptive immunity. Changes in the adaptive immunity may largely work through dendritic cell promotion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). This can lead to tolerance. Prebiotic oligosaccharides can promote the growth of beneficial commensal organisms and can also act directly on cellular receptors on immune cells such as Tregs (van 't Land B et al, Eur J Pharmacol 2011; 668: S101-S107). The antioxidant network really functions as a network, involving dietary elements, such as vitamins E and C and beta-carotene, the glutathione system which requires dietary precursors for glutathione synthesis, and enzymes, including SOD, catalase, Glutathione Peroxidase and Glutathione Reductase. Further, there is compartmentalization of antioxidant defenses. Vitamin E is lipid soluble and resides in membranes to protect the lipid fraction. Vitamin C is water soluble, and so works in the cytoplasm and extracellular fluid space. In fact, up to 30% of plasma antioxidant capacity can be attributed to Vitamin C. There are a variety of superoxide dismutases that require metals such as manganese and copper. Catalase exists in peroxisomes. Glutathione, which is the major scavenger of peroxides, is also responsible for restoring the antioxidant potential of vitamin E and vitamin C. Glutathione exists primarily intracellularly, mostly in the cytoplasm, but also in the mitochondria where oxidants are produced. It also is found in high abundance in the lung lining fluid, which is not surprising given the number of oxidants our lungs are exposed to daily. NrF2 is a transcription factor that is activated when there is oxidative stress in the cytosol. It binds to the promoter regions of many genes representing Phase II enzymes. This leads to a coordinated activation of many proteins active in the control of antioxidant defenses, such as the production of glutathione. Nutritional aspects related to asthma: Asthma is associated with oxidative stress. The inflammatory cells involved in asthma include both eosinophils and neutrophils, and both of these cells types produce oxidants. While airway total glutathione may be elevated in patients with asthma, potentially as a defense against oxidative stress, the amount of oxidized glutathione is elevated (Kelly FJ et al, Lancet, 1999; 354: 482-483). Further, patients with asthma have decreased amounts of several dietary-derived antioxidants, e.g. vitamins E and C, in their lung lining fluid (Kelly FJ et al, Lancet, 1999; 354: 482-483). Total antioxidant capacity of serum is reduced during an acute exacerbation. Of note, upon recovery, the degree of improvement in lung function correlated with the degree of increase in antioxidant capacity and the recovery level of antioxidant capacity (Katsoulis K et al, J Asthma 2003; 40: 847-853). As an example of derangement of antioxidant defences, the activity of Superoxide Dismutase is also suppressed during an asthma exacerbation (Katsoulis K et al, Monaldi Arch Chest Dis 2010; 73: 99-104). So can asthma be prevented? In a recent systematic review, it was noted that there are no randomized controlled trials. However, serum vitamin A is lower in asthmatic children, and maternal intakes of vitamin D and E during pregnancy were protective from developing wheezing and asthma outcomes (for example, Martindale et al, AJRCCM, 2005; Devereux G et al, AJRCCM, 2006; 174: 499-507). A Mediterranean diet seems to help in persistent wheeze, and fruit and vegetable intake appear beneficial for asthma (Nurmatov U et al, JACI 2011; 127: 724-733). In a cross-sectional study of three European countries, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables was associated with better lung function, as determined by the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second or FEV1. So, in other words, your mother was right (Tabak C et al, Thorax, 1999; 54: 1021-1026)! An apple a day does keep the doctor away; more than five apples per week is associated with a lowered incidence of asthma (Shaheen et al, Am J Resp Crit Care Med, 2001; 164: 1823-1828). Low intake of selenium, a co-factor in glutathione peroxidase activity, is also associated with asthma. However, it is easy to have too much selenium in your diet (Shaheen et al, Am J Resp Crit Care Med, 2001; 164: 1823-1828). Dietary intake of n-6 PUFAs has increased with the rise in the use of vegetable oils, such as margarines, containing lots of linoleic acid. This has resulted in an alteration in the intake of essential fatty acids skewed towards the n-6 PUFAs. n-6-PUFAs give rise to arachidonic acid and its metabolites, including leukotrienes, known contributors to asthma. Supplementing young children with fish oils, rich in omega-3 fatty acids will increase blood concentrations of these fatty acids (Marks GB et al, JACI 2006; 118: 53-61). However their effect on asthma symptoms at age 5years was not demonstrable. Further arachadonic acid levels may be low in atopy so simply focusing on omega-3 which targets arachadonic acid metabolism may not be adequate. Some n-6 fatty acids, such as gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), found in plant oils such as evening primrose oil, have been found to reduce inflammation. GLA in supplements is largely converted to DGLA, known to be anti-inflammatory; this conversion being promoted by adequate intakes of magnesium, zinc, vitamins C, B3, and B6 (Marks GB et al, JACI 2006; 118: 53-61; Sala-Vila A et al, Clin Exp All 2008; 38: 1432-1450 ). In looking at fatty acid intake during pregnancy, a UK study found that the ratio of linoleic: a-linolenic acid (n-6:n-3 PUFA) was slightly. associated with late-onset wheeze (Odds Ratio 1.30). However, the associations seen were no longer significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (Newson RB et al, JACI 2004; 114: 531-537). In a more recent study from Japan, intake of linolenic (n-3) and DHA (n-3 product) was associated with decreased risk of wheeze (Odds Ratio 0.52). Intake of n-6 PUFAs and linoleic acid was not associated with increased risk of wheeze. Further, there was no exposure-response relationships to intake of meat and fish and n-3:n-6 PUFA consumption (Miyake Y et al, Thorax 2009; 64: 815- 821). As for breastfeeding as a preventative measure for asthma, the potential protective effect of breastfeeding is strongest in those with a positive family history for atopy (Gdalevich M et al, J Pediatr 2001; 139: 261-266). There is a move to study functional or medicinal foods. For example, resveratrol, a natural nonflavenoid polyphenol found in fruits and vegetables especially grapes, reduces airway hyper-reactivity in a murine model of asthma (Lee M et al, Int Pharmacol 2009; 9: 418- 424). Nutrition and chronic lung disease of prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Nutritional and antioxidant interventions for the prevention of BPD have had limited success to date. However, there is data on risk factors for the development of BPD. In a single center study, while total caloric intake did not differ, those with BPD received less enteral calories during the first two weeks of life (Wemhoner A et al BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2011; 11:7). These enteral caloric differences were true for carbohydrate, protein, and total calories in the first two weeks of life. Of note those receiving excess fluid developed BPD (Wemhoner A et al BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2011; 11:7). In a large multi-center study, where the degree of illness was defined by needing mechanical ventilation for less than the first seven days or seven or more days, increased total caloric intake was associated with eventually having less severe BPD (Ehrenkranz RA et al Ped Res 2011; 69: 522-529). Of note, again all those receiving excess fluid developed BPD. Another study looked at infants born at less than 28 weeks and weighing less than 1000 gm who required total parenteral nutrition. The combination of high supplemental oxygen with vitamins being added to the amino acid portion of total parental nutrition rather than being added to the lipid portion increased oxidative stress (whole blood glutathione redox potential) in infants. Recall that vitamin E serves to stabilize lipids. The severity of eventual BPD at 36 weeks corrected gestational age was associated with the degree of oxidative stress at Day 7 or 10 (Chessex P et al, Free Rad Med Biol 2010; 49: 1380-1386). Vitamin D and lung disease: Vitamin D3 comes from two sources: the skin through photostimulation, and our diet. Vitamin D3 is first hydroxylated in the liver to 25-OH vitamin D3. Typically vitamin D is monitored through serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D3. For bone protection, levels of 30 ng/ml or 75 nmol/L are sought. 25-OH Vitamin D3 then undergoes a second hydroxylation step to its active form, 1,25-di-hydroxy vitamin D3. The best known second hydroxylation occurs in the kidney and is under regulation from parathyroid hormone, and is largely responsible for regulating serum calcium.","group":"g1","id":"78f78881-b541-4d0a-b608-56644eeb6160","_showDetails":true},"928c00f8-0209-4cf2-b1fb-a93f3e7a25bf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"612983415","title":"Non invasive ventilation strategy in newborns","authors":["Kugelman A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["apnea monitoring","arterial carbon dioxide tension","catheter","cerebral palsy","clinical effectiveness","controlled study","death","endotracheal intubation","extremely low birth weight","extubation","follow up","general condition","gestational age","human","hypercapnia","infant","intermittent mandatory ventilation","intermittent positive pressure ventilation","learning curve","lung dysplasia","lung mechanics","maturation","meta analysis","morbidity","nasal prong","nervous system malformation","newborn","newborn apnea","*noninvasive ventilation","oxygenation","prematurity","prevention","respiratory distress syndrome","respiratory drive","retrospective study","thorax wall","upper respiratory tract","ventilator","work of breathing","steroid","surfactant"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"13","number":"Supplement 1","publisher":"W.B.

The ventilatory route allows an individualized endotracheal intubation approach. Two recent studies concluded that early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is a safe alternative to immediate intubation in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants [2,3]. Endotracheal intubation and ventilation can result in significant damage to premature lungs [4] and are independently associated with cerebral palsy [5]. Furthermore, despite new modes of ventilation and surfactant, BPD remains a significant morbidity and its incidence was correlated with the use and length of endotracheal mechanical ventilation [6]. BPD in itself is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome [7]. Thus, we need to avoid endotracheal ventilation, if possible. Recent trends show an increased use of NCPAP and decreased use of endotracheal ventilation even in ELBW infants [8]. The use of NCPAP requires experience, and learning curves show improved outcomes in rates of BPD [9]. When the infant requires nasal respiratory support (NRS), we should aim for adequate oxygenation (SpO2 of 88-92%), permissive hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 45-55mm Hg, pH> 7.2) and gentle ventilation, similarly as on endotracheal ventilation [1]. NCPAP can be used as the early primary treatment of active respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (to avoid intubation or as part of the INSURE [INtubation SURfactant Extubation] approach), or later, post extubation at RDS resolution, in order to allow shortening of the duration of endotracheal ventilation and to treat apnea of prematurity. However, the common use of NCPAP raises several questions. Does it really prevent BPD? Can we enhance NCPAP? What is the role of surfactant in the era of NRS? While previous studies have shown that the lowest incidence of BPD [10,11] or pulmonary morbidity in ELBW infants [12] occurred in NICUs practicing early NCPAP instead of initial mechanical ventilation, new studies [2,3] do not support that conclusion, and report comparable rates of BPD in ELBW infants treated initially with NCPAP as compared to endotracheal ventilation with surfactant administration. Can we enhance NCPAP and get better outcome for NRS by using nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)? NIPPV was defined as a method of augmenting NCPAP by delivering ventilator breaths via nasal prongs [13]. The rationale behind the use of NIPPV is the administration of \"sigh\" to the infant, thus opening microatelectasis and recruiting more ventilation units. It was shown that synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV) compared with NCPAP may improve the patency of the upper airway, could activate the respiratory drive, improves thoraco-abdominal synchrony, stabilizes the chest wall, improves lung mechanics and decreases the work of breathing in premature infants. When NIPPV was compared to NCPAP for the different indications of NRS, it was shown to enhance the potential of NRS. NIPPV for the initial treatment of RDS was shown to significantly decrease the rate of endotracheal ventilation and subsequently the rate of BPD when compared to NCPAP [14]. The results of this study in regards to BPD needs to be taken with caution as the number of ELBW infants in this study was relatively small. Two additional studies [15,16] reported shorter duration of respiratory support [15] and reduced need for endotracheal ventilation with NIPPV [16] compared to NCPAP but no difference in the rate of BPD. A recent study [17] reported no significant difference in rates of endotracheal intubation at 72 hours or in rates of BPD. However, in posthoc analysis, from 24 to 72 hours of life, significantly more infants in the NIPPV group remained extubated compared with those in the NCPAP group. The authors concluded that their results suggest that early use of NIPPV is feasible and safe and may have beneficial effects when compared with NCPAP, especially for infants with a birth weight >1000 g. SNIPPV vs. NCPAP for later use, post extubation at RDS resolution, as a \"bridge\" to spontaneous unsupported breathing was shown to be more effective than NCPAP [18,19]. A pooled meta-analysis showed that SNIPPV was more effective than NCPAP in preventing failure of extubation [RR 0.21 (0.10, 0.45)] and the number needed to treat was only 3 infants to prevent one extubation failure [18,19]. SNIPPV vs. NCPAP, post extubation, also tended to decrease the rate of BPD [18,19]. Two retrospective studies [20,21] showed a significantly decreased rate of BPD with NIPPV compared to NCPAP. The larger one showed that early or later use of SNIPPV vs. NCPAP, in infants at greatest risk of BPD or death (500-750 g) was associated with decreased rate of BPD and/or death and decreased rate of neurodevelopmental impairment and/or death [21]. SNIPPV may be more effective than NCPAP also for apnea of prematurity [22]. A meta-analysis, regarding apnea of prematurity, suggests that SNIPPV is more efficacious with apnea that is frequent or severe. However, the studies performed addressed short-term outcomes and as such could not address properly the incidence of requirement for reintubation. Thus, more studies are needed before recommending SNIPPV as standard of care for apnea of prematurity [22]. While non-invasive ventilation is probably safe, its success depends on gestational age [2,3,8]. The data indicate that surfactant may still have a significant role in the treatment of RDS, especially in ELBW infants. Recently, Morley et al. [2] and the SUPPORT study [3] reported on an intubation rate of ~50% in their NCPAP group in ELBW infants. This leads us to the INSURE approach. This approach may allow the infant to benefit from both, surfactant and NRS. A Cochrane review [23] concluded that the INSURE approach with NCPAP compared with later selective surfactant administration, continued mechanical ventilation, and extubation from low respiratory support was associated with less need for mechanical ventilation, lower incidence of BPD and fewer air leak syndromes. Bhandari et al. [24] showed that the INSURE approach with SNIPPV had a significantly lower incidence of BPD/death compared with continued mechanical ventilation. Ramanathan et al. [25] also reported a significant reduction in \"physiologic\" and clinical BPD in the NIPPV group after the INSURE approach compared to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and early extubation to NCPAP. Results of these studies suggest that NCPAP and NIPPV seem to be feasible and effective and result in a lower incidence of BPD when compared with endotracheal ventilation. Another option for surfactant application to the trachea without endotracheal intubation was described by using a thin catheter in spontaneously breathing preterm infants receiving NCPAP. This technique was reported to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation [26]. To summarize, the available evidence supports the preference of early or later use of NIPPV/SNIPPV compared to NCPAP because of minimizing the use and the length of endotracheal ventilation [27]. There are data to suggest that this approach may also reduce the rate of BPD, however this was not shown yet [27]. Whether NIPPV/SNIPPV is more beneficial than NCPAP within the INSURE approach needs to be shown. This non invasive ventilator strategy needs to be confirmed by large prospective randomized controlled trials (with long-term follow up) in order to assure it is applicable to most ELBWinfants. Furthermore, the strategy needs to be tailored to individualized infants according to the infant's maturation; antenatal steroid treatment and severity of RDS; general condition; and to certain practical NICU conditions such as experience, personnel and timing during the day.","group":"g1","id":"928c00f8-0209-4cf2-b1fb-a93f3e7a25bf","_showDetails":false},"379e9807-23a3-4b6b-b51b-e041227ce3f7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"612983375","title":"Childhood interstitial lung disease","authors":["Bush A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["adulthood","airway cell","airway obstruction","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","autosomal dominant inheritance","biopsy","brain","bronchiolitis obliterans","capillaritis","case study","cell hyperplasia","chromosome 14","chromosome 16","chromosome 2","chromosome 8","classification","clearance","codon","complication","controlled study","coughing","crackle","death","developmental disorder","developmental stage","diagnosis","DNA structure","DNA transcription","exon","family study","fetus","follow up","frameshift mutation","gain of function mutation","gene frequency","gene locus","genetic predisposition","genetic susceptibility","glycogen metabolism","glycogen storage disease","heart","Human respiratory syncytial virus","hyaline membrane disease","hyperinflation","*infancy","infant","*interstitial lung disease","interstitium","intron","intubation","kidney","lamellar body","live birth","loss of function mutation","lung alveolus macrophage","lung alveolus proteinosis","lung development","lung dysplasia","lung function test","lung hemorrhage","lung hypoplasia","lung transplantation","male","mesenchyme cell","middle aged","multigene family","neonatal respiratory distress syndrome","neuroendocrine system","neurosecretory cell","newborn","newborn period","nonhuman","phenotype","physical disease by body function","pig","prematurity","preschool child","prevalence","protein C deficiency","protein family","protein processing","pulmonary hypertension","pulmonary vein","respiratory failure","staining","systemic disease","tachypnea","thinking","thorax radiography","thrombocyte","thyroid disease","transcription regulation","treatment response","virus infection","wheezing","acid protein","biological marker","bombesin","corticosteroid","endogenous compound","eosin","glass","glycogen","granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor","hematoxylin","hydroxychloroquine","messenger RNA","oxygen","protein precursor","surfactant","surfactant protein B","surfactant protein C","thyroid transcription factor 1"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"13","number":"Supplement 1","publisher":"W.B.

The total prevalence of chILD is estimated at 0.36/100,000 and there are numerous diverse conditions of great rarity which contribute to the spectrum of disease (see detailed review [ref 1]). The same genetic disorder may manifest very differently at different developmental stages. These factors combine to make chILD difficult to study, and unsurprisingly there are no evidence based treatments. Most statements about diagnostic pathways and prognosis are based on very small case series, and great caution should be exercised in discussions with parents. Classification of chILD: In most cases, separate classifications are used in the age groups 0-2 and 2-18 years. There is some overlap between the age groups, however. chILD age 0-2: The North American classification is most used [2], although as knowledge increases, modification is inevitably required. Eight broad categories are described. There is some overlap between categories pathologically, and some (for example, obliterative bronchiolitis) may better be considered as airway diseases, or diffuse distal lung diseases. Category One: Diffuse developmental disorders: These are largely fatal in early life. They are believed to be due to defects in one of the primary molecular mechanisms of lung development; they include acinar dysplasia, congenital alveolar dysplasia, and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins. Category Two: Growth abnormalities reflecting deficient alveolarisation Abnormal alveolar development which is largely secondary is the hallmark of this group, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia. Chronic lung disease of prematurity is in this group, although it is arguable whether this should truly be considered part of the chILD spectrum. Category Three: Specific conditions of undefined aetiology: These two conditions (Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy or NEHI, and Pulmonary I interstitial glycogenosis, or PIG) appear to be found purely in infancy; whether they are specific conditions, or related non-specifically to disordered lung development is unclear. Neuro-endocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy: Characteristically, NEHI presents in the first year of life (mean age 3.8 months in the largest published series) with tachypnoea and respiratory distress, in a relatively well infant [3]. Cough and wheeze are not prominent [3]. Presentation requiring intubation at birth has not been described [1]. Crackles are often heard. The chest radiograph (CXR) typically mimics post-viral infection airway changes. HRCT shows patchy ground glass opacification, typically centrally and in the right middle lobe and lingula, with air trapping elsewhere [4]. Infant pulmonary function tests show a mixed pattern with air trapping [5]. The pathology is of apparently almost normal lung tissue on haematoxylin and eosin staining, but with increased numbers of bombesin-positive airway cells, which intriguingly are seen in the normal developing lung, as well as other postnatal conditions. These are also seen in healthy controls, but the upper limit of normal is 5% of the epithelial area [3]. KL-6 has been proposed to be a useful biomarker distinguishing NEHI from surfactant protein disorders [6]. There is no treatment other than oxygen if the child is hypoxic, and the long term outlook is relatively good, with no deaths recorded, and long term pulmonary function at worst showing mild airflow obstruction. However, up to two thirds of the children remained symptomatic at follow up. Thus parents of infants diagnosed with NEHI can probably be reassured as to the prognosis. Pulmonary Interstitial Glycogenosis (PIG): Glycogen containing foetal Type 2 cells are seen in normal lung development, regressing towards term [7,8]. However, the pathological hallmark of PIG is the expansion of the interstitium by primitive mesenchymal cells rich in glycogen. This is specific to the lungs, there is no generalised disorder of glycogen metabolism or storage. Presentation is with non-specific respiratory symptoms, and onset is usually early, with biopsies in the first case series being performed at 2-4 weeks of age; four of the seven described cases were pre-term [9]. There is a male preponderance in the very small numbers of cases reported to date. Radiology is non-specific, with interstitial infiltrates, a fine reticular pattern, hyperinflation and ground glass shadowing. Six of seven infants did well, one died of the complications of extreme prematurity. Treatment was with corticosteroids and sometimes hydroxychloroquine. Category Four: Surfactant dysfunction disorders: There are five groups of genetic disorders currently placed in this category. These are mutations of surfactant protein (Sp)-B and -C (the two surface active members of the Sp family); ABCA-3, a protein important in the post-translational processing of surfactant; thyroid transcription factor (TTF) 1, a transcription factor relevant to Sp-B, Sp-C and ABCA-3; and GM-CSF-receptor mutations, preventing the clearance of surfactane from alveoli. SpB gene mutations: Sp-B deficiency is an autosomal recessive, loss of function mutation. It is a rare condition, with estimated prevalence being one in a million live births [10]. The gene is located on chromosome 2, comprises approximately 10,000 base pairs in 11 exons (of which only the first 10 are translated), and encodes a 381 amino-acid pre-protein. 23 amino acids are removed co-translationally to produce pro-Sp-B, which then undergoes complex processing to produce the mature protein. Production is primarily by the Type 2 cells [11]. The most common mutation is a net two base pair insertion in codon 121 (121ins2), which accounts for about two thirds of mutant alleles; more than 30 others have been described [11,12]. The classical presentation is with relentlessly progressive respiratory distress, mimicking hyaline membrane disease in the preterm, with no response to treatment and death within months, unless lung transplantation can be offered. The pathology is often but not invariably a PAP-like picture, but there may be more of a Type 2 cell hyperplasia. These infants may also have secondary abnormalities in Sp-C processing, (pro- Sp-C to Sp-C), with poorly organised lamellar bodies [13-15]. Although the classical disease is lethal in infancy, rare partial deficiencies have been described, with prolonged survival [16,17]. SpC gene mutations: Sp-C deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a gain of function mutation [18]. Sporadic disease has also been reported, about equally frequently with the inherited condition. The SpC gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 8, and is transcribed to a 900 base pair mRNA, which after post-translational processing yields one of either a 191 or 197 amino acid protein. At least 35 mutations have been described [19]. The clinical phenotype is extremely variable, and many present after RSV bronchiolitis [20], related to SpC gene mutation cells being more vulnerable to the cytotxic effects of the virus [21]. and studies of several generations in families detect presentation with the same Sp-C mutation in the newborn period with relentlessly progressive respiratory distress, and as onset of UIP in late middle age [22]. There is no known treatment. ABCA3 gene mutations: ABCA3 deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition of unknown prevalence. This very large gene is located on chromosome 16, and contains 60,000 base pairs in 33 exons (the first 3 of which are not translated) which encode a 1704 amino acid protein [23,24]. The disease is thought to be due to loss of function mutations. More than 100 mutations have been described [25]; the huge size of the gene means that many more mutations are likely so far undetected. The gene is most highly expressed in lung tissue, but also in heart, brain, platelets and kidney; however, ABCA3 deficiency has no known clinical phenotype in these tissues. The commonest mutation E292V, was found in 5% of older chILD patients [26,27]. However, as might be expected in such a complex gene, many different mutations have been described [25]. Typically presentation mimics Sp-B deficiency, with onset in infancy, and indeed ABCA3 deficiency may be the commonest genetic cause of neonatal respiratory failure. Rarely, ABCA3 deficiency may mimic primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn [28]. Initially the disease was thought to be uniformly fatal [29]. However, it is becoming clear that late-presenting disease with a better prognosis can also be due to ABCA3 deficiency. Lung function may remain stable over a period of years, but poor growth is common [29]. As with Sp-C deficiency, a wide variety of lung pathology is found. TTF-1 gene mutations: These are autosomal dominant mutations, on chromosome 14, and around 20 mutations have been described. TTF-1 is a homeodomain-containing nuclear transcription protein of the Nkx2 gene family encoded by a single gene locus spanning approximately 3.3 kilobases and consisted of two exons and a single intron. The full-blown brain-lung-thyroid syndrome is characterized by severe dysfunction in all three organs, but it is becoming clear that lung disease can occur with only minor abnormalities in brain and thyroid. The commonest presentation is with neonatal respiratory distress [30,31]. GM-CSFR gene mutations: Clearance of surfactant by alveolar macrophages requires a functional GM-CSF receptor. Mutations in the b-, and more latterly the a-chain of the GM-CSF receptor have been shown to be a rare cause of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [32,33]. The condition must be distinguished from other causes of this condition (Table 1). Category Five: Disorders related to systemic disease processes: This includes pulmonary capillaritis, presenting with a suspected pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome.","group":"g1","id":"379e9807-23a3-4b6b-b51b-e041227ce3f7","_showDetails":true},"63c2e9ae-3979-4f46-a7a5-c8ba513d6ad3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"SOD2 activity is not impacted by hyperoxia in murine neonatal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms16036373","authors":["Gupta, Anita","Perez, Marta","Lee, Keng Jin","Taylor, Joann M","Farrow, Kathryn N"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150319//","keywords":["Animals","Cell Hypoxia/ph [Physiology]","Disease Models, Animal","Hypertension, Pulmonary/me [Metabolism]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/pp [Physiopathology]","Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/me [Metabolism]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/me [Metabolism]","Oxidation-Reduction","*Pulmonary Artery/cy [Cytology]","*Pulmonary Artery/me [Metabolism]","*Superoxide Dismutase/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","volume":"16","number":"3","isbn":"1422-0067","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25809610"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) complicates bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in 25% of infants.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, leads to arrested lung development and can be associated with permanent respiratory dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that administration of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) may benefit lung repair; however, ethical and immunological concerns limit the clinical relevance of ESC. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), ESC-like cells engineered from adult somatic cells, may alleviate some of ESC-associated concerns and there is increasing evidence that iPSC may differentiate in vivo and restore the functionality of damaged organs such as heart and liver. Hypothesis. iPSC differentiate into AT2 cells in vitro and attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung damage in vivo. Methods and results. For differentiation, mouse ESC and fibroblast-derived iPSC were cultured as embryoid bodies with activin A (4 days) and small airway growth medium (14 days). Immunofluorescence staining and FACS revealed that ESC and iPSC acquired lung cell-specific markers: prosurfactant protein C (AT2) and aquaporin 5 (AT1). Newborn mice were exposed to 95% O2 from postnatal day (P) 4 to P14. Cells (ESC, iPSC or lung fibroblasts - LF) were injected intratracheally at P4 (prevention) or P14 (rescue), followed by lung function testing and histological analysis at P28. ESC and iPSC could prevent, but not rescue, hyperoxia-induced decreases in lung resistance and elastance. ESC and, to a lesser extent, iPSC, prevented, but did not rescue, arrested alveolar growth, while LF had no effect. In vitro evaluation of potential paracrine actions revealed that ESC and iPSC conditioned medium (CdM) significantly accelerated wound closure rate in confluent AT2 compared to LF CdM. iPSC and ESC CdM also protected against AT2 hyperoxic injury while LF CdM had no effect (MTT assay). Conclusions. Mouse iPSC differentiate into alveolar epithelial cells, accelerate wound healing and prevent hyperoxic injury in vitro, while improving lung function in a mouse model of BPD. The possibility of using readily available iPSC to generate AT2 for cell-based therapy for lung injury warrants further study.","group":"g1","id":"356a27fa-f788-4532-890d-443787de217b","_showDetails":true},"4d69c05f-977a-4865-ae83-9511f08aa016":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71993684","title":"Endothelial progenitor cells repair experimental lung damage through a paracrine activity","authors":["Fung M.E.","Alphonse R.S.","Vadivel A.","Eaton F.","Yoder M.C.","Thebaud B."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung injury","*American","*society","*endothelial progenitor cell","human","lung","umbilical cord blood","chronic lung disease","pulmonary hypertension","rat","hyperoxia","therapy","stem cell","angiogenesis","lung dysplasia","colony forming cell","wound closure","cell culture","body weight","prematurity","newborn","model","serum","in vitro study","regeneration","cells by body anatomy","intraperitoneal drug administration","injection","Sprague Dawley rat","morphometrics","echocardiography","acceleration","pulmonary artery","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","angiogenic factor","matrigel"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.E.

Arrested alveolar growth and disrupted vasculogenesis are the histological hallmarks of BPD. Evidence suggests that pro-angiogenic factors promote alveolar growth and regeneration. Accordingly, we showed that endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs), a recently identified vascular progenitor cell type with self-renewal and clonogenic potential, exist in the developing lung and promotes lung repair. Increasing evidence suggests that stem cells exert their therapeutic potential through a paracrine effect. We hypothesized that cell-free conditioned media from human cord blood derived ECFCs prevents lung injury in an experimental O2-induced BPD model in newborn rats. METHOD(S): To test the therapeutic potential of ECFCs, we generated ECFC conditioned media (CdM) by treating confluent human-umbilical cord blood ECFC cultures with serum free DMEM for 24 hrs. RESULT(S): In vitro, ECFC CdM significantly restored the endothelial network forming ability of hyperoxia exposed fetal human lung ECFCs on matrigel and improved wound closure of fetal rat alveolar type II cells cultured as a monolayer. In vivo, daily 1 muL/g body weight intraperitoneal ECFC CdM injections in Sprague Dawley rats exposed to hyperoxia from postnatal day (P) 1 to P14 significantly preserved alveolar development as assessed by lung morphometry at P21. Furthermore, ECFC CdM therapy significantly attenuated pulmonary hypertension, a major complication of severe BPD, as assessed by improved pulmonary artery acceleration time on echocardiograms and decreased right ventricular hypertrophy. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings suggest that ECFCs prevent lung injury and pulmonary hypertension through a paracrine effect. This may lead to novel therapies for chronic lung diseases characterized by impaired alveolar growth.","group":"g1","id":"4d69c05f-977a-4865-ae83-9511f08aa016","_showDetails":true},"237d8395-3409-4908-ab46-07a9cb8dde5d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71993429","title":"Hyperoxia regulates the degradation of the circadian protein rev-ERBalpha: Implications for cytoprotection","authors":["Biswas C.","Hinson M.","La P.","Yang G.","Dennery P.A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*cell protection","*American","*society","myofibroblast","phosphorylation","injury","secretion (process)","lung","mutant","effluent","lung dysplasia","immunofluorescence","phenotype","microenvironment","cell differentiation","mouse","apoptosis","cell proliferation","Western blotting","adipocyte","steady state","pathogenesis","mesenchymal stem cell","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","*Rev protein","protein","interleukin 1","broxuridine","interleukin 6","caspase 3","2 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 3 (1 methyl 3 indolyl)maleimide","messenger RNA","receptor protein","cell nucleus receptor","serine","cytokine","protein kinase B"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.

The precise signaling mechanisms dictating myofibroblast differentiation have not been clearly elucidated. The nuclear receptor protein Rev-ERBI+/- is an important regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Its degradation is regulated through phosphorylation of specific serine residues (55/59) via GSK3I2. The role of Rev-ERBI+/- in myofibroblast differentiation has not been elucidated. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate whether Rev-ERBI+/- inhibits myofibroblast differentiation in mouse neonatal lung-mesenchymal (MLg)-progenitor cells and protects against hyperoxic injury. METHOD(S): Rev-ERBI+/- WT and phosphorylation defective mutant (SD: 55/59 Ser to Asp) MLg cells were exposed to 95%O2/5%CO2 (hyperoxia) or air/5%CO2 (normoxia) for 0-24 hours. In other experiments, cells were pre-incubated with SB216763, an inhibitor of GSK3I2 to prevent Rev-ERBI+/- degradation. Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorportation and p21 mRNA levels. Cell differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype was asssessed by measuring I+/-SMA immunofluorescence. Apoptosis was evaluated with caspase-3 activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1I2 and IL-6) were evaluated in the effluent media using ELISA. Cellular steady-state lmRNA and protein levels of Rev-ERBI+/- and p-GSK3I2, were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. RESULT(S): MLg-WT cells exposed to hyperoxia had increased Akt/kinase activity, increased levels of pGSK3I2 protein and significantly decreased Rev-ERBI+/- protein levels,. This was associated with decreased BrdU incorporation and increased p21 mRNA levels. Immunoreactive I+/-SMA and caspase-3 activity were also increased, as was IL-1I2 and IL-6 secretion. In contrast, Rev-ERBI+/- levels remained stable in the SD mutants and in the cells pre-incubated with SB216763 and exposed to hyperoxia. This was associated with increased BrdU incorporation, decreased p21 as well as decreased immunoreactive I+/-SMA, caspase-3 activity and IL-1I2 and IL-6 secretion. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that hyperoxia mediates the degradation of Rev-ERBI+/-. Preventing this degradation protects reduces myofibroblast differentiation and protects the cells against hyperoxic injury. SPECULATION: Activation of AKT kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of pGSK3I2 may mediate the degradation of lung Rev-ERB in hyperoxia, thereby reducing levels of this cytoprotective protein, promoting myofibroblast differentiation and enhancing susceptibility to hyperoxia.","group":"g1","id":"237d8395-3409-4908-ab46-07a9cb8dde5d","_showDetails":false},"b15baf44-2c21-47c6-98bf-11e855115db2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71989481","title":"The role of the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptors in the regulation of pulmonary vascular development","authors":["Nieb G.","Seeger W.","Morty R.E."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*American","*society","mouse","human","vascular smooth muscle","model","apoptosis","hyperoxia","lung blood vessel","lung","immunohistochemistry","protein expression","in vitro study","lung injury","smooth muscle","lung development","exposure","lung dysplasia","lung hypoplasia","muscle tissue","pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell","machine","animal model","laser microdissection","vascular smooth muscle cell","immunoblotting","cell function","growth, development and aging","patient","*transforming growth factor","*receptor","messenger RNA","4 [4 (1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl) 5 (2 pyridinyl) 1h imidazol 2 yl]benzamide","nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase","transforming growth factor beta receptor 3","endoglin","broxuridine","small interfering RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"G.

The molecular basis of the peturbed pulmonary vascular development is not understood. Our preliminary studies in mice, employing a hyperoxia-based model of BPD, have revealed dysregulated expression of components of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling machinery. In this study, we particularly address the type I and type III TGF-beta receptors, in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle behaviour. These receptors include two type I (Acvrl1 and Tgbfr1) and two type III [endoglin (Eng) and betaglycan (Tgfbr3)] receptors. METHOD(S): Exposure of C57BL/6N mice to 85% O2 for the first 28 days after birth was employed as a model or arrested late lung development. TGF-beta receptor localisation, and mRNA and protein expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry, real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot, respectively. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) were transfected with siRNA with LipofectamineTM , and were assessed for proliferation by 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and for apoptosis by cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. RESULT(S): Preliminary immunohistochemical studies suggested that the changes in TGF-beta receptor expression were largely confined to the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, suggesting a possible role for these receptors in the smooth muscle tissue in the development of BPD. Knockdown of TGFBR3 in PASMCs increased PASMC proliferation two-fold in vitro, in a TGF-beta-independent manner (revealed by parallel trends in proliferation observed in the presence of the TGF-beta pathway inhibitor SB431542). However, apoptosis of PASMCs was not affected by the knockdown of TGFBR3. Furthermore, Tgfbr3 expression is markedly perturbed in the lungs of neonatal mice with hyperoxia (85% O2)-induced lung injury, a popular animal model of BPD. The mRNA expression of tgfbr3 was downregulated (4.4-fold, respectively) while eng mRNA levels were upregulated (2.7-fold). Laser microdissection confirmed dysregulated expression of TGFBR3 in the pulmonary vasculature of the developing mouse lung. CONCLUSION(S): Taken together, these data suggest a role for TGFBR3 in vascular smooth muscle cell function which could lead to a dysregulation of TGF-beta signalling in the pulmonary vasculature which in turn could contribute to the impaired pulmonary vascular growth and development associated with the lung hypoplasia observed in patients with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"b15baf44-2c21-47c6-98bf-11e855115db2","_showDetails":true},"c2a6bd9f-454a-4e40-a32c-d3c7740ecd94":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71989475","title":"Endothelial-monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) is produced by epithelial cells and macrophages in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)","authors":["Persad E.A.","Xu H.","Savani R.C.","Schwarz M.A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*epithelium cell","*macrophage","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","hyperoxia","mouse","lung","model","dysplasia","emphysema","capillary","cell proliferation","angiogenesis","Student t test","Western blotting","lung development","fetus lung","monocyte","protein analysis","immunohistochemistry","pathogenesis","harvesting","analysis of variance","*endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II","fibronectin","oxygen","CD1 antigen","nonoxinol 9","chemoattractant","paraformaldehyde","peptide"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"E.A.

Previous work regarding fetal lung development has illustrated that the expression of EMAP II decreases during periods of vasculogenesis, exogenous EMAP II profoundly disrupts alveolar-capillary growth, and is elevated in lung dysplasias such as BPD and emphysema. The cellular contributors of EMAP II in lung dysplasia have not been elucidated to date. We hypothesize that EMAP II overexpression by epithelial cells and macrophage are associated with vascular inhibition and lung dysplasia of BPD. Method(s): Lungs were harvested from neonatal CD1 mice exposed to 85% oxygen from day of life (DOL) 3 to 15 as well as normoxic controls. Harvesting was done on DOL 3, 10, 15, 20 and 30. Lung specimens were either inflation fixed at 25mmHg with 4% paraformaldehyde or harvested for protein analysis. EMAP II and monocyte (F480) expression were determined via Western Blot while EMAP II distribution in macrophages, fibronectin deposition and cell proliferation were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Result(s): The murine hyperoxia model of BPD demonstrated distal alveolar dysplasia (mean linear intercept p<0.001, ANOVA), and increased macrophage infiltrate, fibronectin deposition and alveolar proliferation consistent with that seen in BPD. EMAP II expression was significantly increased on days 10, 15, and 20 (p=0.01, p=0.005, and p=0.07 respectively, Student T-test, figure) as compared to normoxia control. IHC identified increased EMAP II expression in the bronchial and alveolar regions. Co-localization with F480 determined that macrophages expressed EMAP II in hyperoxia mice. Conclusion(s): The murine hyperoxia model of BPD demonstrates increased fibronectin deposition, macrophage infiltrate, alveolar proliferation and alveolar dysplasia. Pulmonary EMAP II expression is markedly elevated at DOL 10 and 15 of mice exposed to hyperoxia and also at DOL 20 in mice post-hyperoxia as compared to controls. Macrophages contribute to EMAP II expression. These findings indicate that in BPD elevated EMAP II expression is in part due to macrophage recruitment and subsequent macrophage expression of EMAP II. We speculate that EMAP II expression in epithelial and macrophage cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD.

In BPD, treatment involves respiratory support with high oxygen levels, and oxidative stress is an adverse side effect that has been associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Genetic polymorphisms in a few candidate genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood. In this study, we used haplotype association mapping (HAM) to identify the role of genetic background in differential susceptibility to oxidant injury in developing lungs. Method(s): Time-mated pregnant inbred mice were allowed to deliver spontaneously. Time-mated pregnant outbred mice were used as foster dams during exposure. At post-natal day 1 (P1), neonates were pooled and randomly reassigned to litters exposed to 100% O2 or air for 72hr. Dams were provided with food ad libitum. Following exposure, neonates were necropsied at P4, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis (protein concentration, total cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) and histopathology were measured as disease phenotypes. All exposures were conducted at NIEHS and approved by IACUC. HAM of response phenotypes was done using SNPster. Results and Conclusion(s): Significant inter-strain variation was found for all phenotypes and heritability estimates ranged from 33.6% to 55.7%. Further genetic analysis by SNPster identified significant quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9, and candidate susceptibility genes were identified (Cntnap5a, Cntnap5b, Cyp2j5, Cyp2j6, Cyp2j9, Cyp2j11, Mgmt, Fat3, and Chrm2). Chrm2 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 2, cardiac) is known to have a role in lung physiology and disease. A SNP (rs30378838) in Chrm2 causes an amino acid substitution (P265L) in exon1 and, relative to neonate strains homozygous for the wild-type allele, significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation was found in strains with the mutant allele (p<0.0001). Further, targeted deletion of Chrm2 caused significantly (p<0.001) reduced lung permeability and edema following neonatal hyperoxia exposure compared to wild-type controls. Thus, we developed a genetic model of lung injury with similarities to BPD. We also found a novel susceptibility gene that may significantly improve the current understanding of neonatal lung injury.","group":"g3","id":"84a93a09-69fb-4610-9987-40f0efd0ff07","_showDetails":false},"9a79465e-e021-46db-880b-f8926f47f4dc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71987486","title":"Educating fellows in practice-based learning and improvement and systems-based practice: The value of quality improvement in clinical practice","authors":["Carey W.A.","Colby C.E."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*total quality management","*clinical practice","*American","*society","*learning","curriculum","competence","pediatrics","academic achievement","lung dysplasia","experiential learning","catheter infection","safety","teaching","accreditation","medical education","documentation","morbidity","certification","graduate","newborn morbidity","evidence based practice","feedback system","mortality","model"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"W.A.

Among these are two relatively abstract and complex competencies: Practice-Based Learning & Improvement (PBLI) and Systems-Based Practice (SBP). Many program directors find that PBLI and SBP are difficult concepts to grasp, perhaps limiting their ability to develop effective means of teaching and evaluating these competencies. Because PBLI and SBP are related conceptually to Quality Improvement (QI), a QI-based curriculum may be an effective means by which to teach these competencies. However, there are few examples of QI curricula that have improved resident knowledge in PBLI and SBP while providing program directors the means by which to document resident competence. Method(s): We engaged our fellows in experiential learning by requiring them to participate in our division-level program of continuous quality improvement. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act change model, fellows partnered with faculty to develop and implement QI projects designed to reduce common neonatal morbidities. To assess fellow competence in PBLI and SBP, program directors maintained portfolios for each fellow, including written self-reflections, evaluations and documentation of all resulting academic achievement. Result(s): As members of our unit's multidisciplinary Quality & Safety Committee (Q&S), our fellows identified two outcomes meriting improvement - bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and catheter-associated blood stream infection (CABSI). They then developed and implemented evidence-based plans to reduce the incidence of each disease, then collected and analyzed outcomes data with guidance from division faculty. To complete the QI cycle, fellows communicated outcomes and future plans for QI to all NICU staff. Our fellows' QI projects led to significant and sustained reductions in the rates of BPD and CABSI. We assessed fellow performance by reviewing goal- and strategy-based self-reflections with each fellow semi-annually. In addition, all division faculty provided competency-based feedback in response to fellow presentations of Q&S outcomes at our quarterly Morbidity & Mortality conferences. Our fellows' active engagement in QI also resulted in meaningful academic achievement as well. For example, our fellows have presented the clinical outcomes of their BPD initiative at two national academic meetings (American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference and Exhibition, 2010 and 2011). Also, one of our fellows earned Performance in Practice credit toward her maintenance of certification by the American Board of Pediatrics. Conclusion(s): By integrating clinical and educational systems, a QI-based curriculum may be an effective means by which to teach and assess PBLI and SBP.","group":"g1","id":"9a79465e-e021-46db-880b-f8926f47f4dc","_showDetails":false},"823dde1a-5fd3-4007-a183-fa830f97e5d1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71986357","title":"Respiratory symptoms and health-related quality of life in adult survivors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Gough A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*adult","*survivor","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","*quality of life","human","asthma","diagnosis","adulthood","infant","hospital","physician","very low birth weight","general practitioner","weight","drug therapy","childhood","dyspnea","wheezing","control group","lung function","chi square test","sample size","screening","health survey","European Union","adolescence","gender","artificial ventilation","birth weight","newborn care","risk","newborn period","statistical significance","analysis of variance","surfactant"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"A.

Studies suggest increasing respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function persist through childhood and into early adolescence but little is known about those reaching adulthood. The few studies to date have been limited by small sample size. We report respiratory symptoms and quality of life in adult survivors of BPD from the largest study to date with comparison groups comprising very low birth weight (VLBW) and term controls. METHOD(S): One hundred and fifty-three infants cared for in the Regional Neonatal Unit, Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast, between January 1978 and April 1993, who developed BPD were prospectively traced from hospital birth records and contacted through their General Practitioner. Of those, 72 (47.1%) responded and participated and were compared with age, sex and birth weight matched individuals born prematurely with VLBW (<1500g) not requiring mechanical ventilation (n=56) and age and gender matched term infants (n=55). See Table 1 for demographics. Respiratory symptoms were assessed using the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) screening tool. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D). Differences between dichotomous and continuous variable were tested using chi-square analyses, and one-way ANOVA with contrasts. RESULT(S): No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between BPD participants (n=72) and BPD non-responders (n=81). ECRHS and EQ5D scores for BPD participants and control groups are shown in Table 2. BPD participants were significantly more likely to report respiratory symptoms (wheeze, shortness of breath) and use asthma medication. Compared to term controls, BPD subjects were twice as likely to be defined as 'symptomatic' on the ECRHS scoring tool (30.6% vs 14.5% p=0.035) and more likely to have a physician diagnosis of asthma (40.3% vs 16.4%, p=0.004). BPD subjects with a physician diagnosis of asthma were younger (mean GA; 26.6 weeks vs 27.5 weeks), and lighter (mean weight; 927g vs 974g) than those without an asthma diagnosis; however these did not reach statistical significance. BPD participants who had not been treated with surfactant were much more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma compared to those given surfactant (79.3% vs 20.7%, p=0.210). CONCLUSION(S): Although health-related quality of life is not significantly impaired, BPD survivors have increased respiratory symptoms and a greater likelihood of asthma which persists into adulthood. Whether surfactant treatment in the neonatal period reduces the risk of asthma in adulthood needs confirmation in further studies.

Oxidative stress is one factor. 8-Oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) is an enzyme that repairs DNA damaged by reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species convert guanine to 8-oxoguanine. The Ser326Cys polymorphism (rs1052133) in the OGG1 gene results in decreased enzymatic activity and has been associated with lung cancer and other conditions. We hypothesize that the Ser326Cys polymorphism in OGG1 affects the enzyme activity thus leading to increased oxidative stress-mediated damage that renders patients more susceptible to ailments common to premature neonates such as BPD, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Method(s): DNA was isolated from buccal mucosal swabs (N=164). Infants were enrolled who weighed <1 kg at birth and had no congenital or chromosomal abnormalities. Allelic discrimination was performed using a specific probe for the Ser326Cys with Real-time PCR. BPD is graded by the need for oxygen at 36 weeks PMA. Mild BPD is need for supplemental oxygen at 28 DOL but no supplementation needed at 36 weeks PMA. Moderate BPD means FiO2 of <0.3 at 36 weeks PMA while severe means FiO2 is >0.3 at 36 week PMA. Chi square analyses and t-test for independent samples were performed with P<0.05 denoting statistical significance. Result(s): The Ser326Cys SNP was not associated with BPD (p=0.293). On the other hand, being homozygous for the mutant allele (GG) was associated with NEC (p=0.049). The G-allele was also associated with NEC (p=0.042). We found that the GG-genotype is associated with IVH (p=0.016). The G-allele is also significant (p=0.027) for IVH. Genotype tables for OGG1 polymorphism (rs1052133) Conclusion(s): The Ser326Cys SNP is associated with IVH and NEC but not BPD. This relationship points to a common mechanism such as increased DNA damage secondary to oxidative stress. Further work such as testing tracheal aspirates for presence or activity of OGG1 would be fruitful.

Protein concentrations were assessed by bradford assay and KC, MIP-2, and MCP-1 expressions were measured in BAL by ELISA. Result(s): Protein concentrations, KC, and MCP-1 expressions in BAL were significantly increased in vehicle injected and 85% O2 exposed mice compared to RA controls. Treatment with 10 mg/kg ASA while exposed to 85% O2 significantly reduced BAL protein concentrations and MCP-1 expression. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that treatment with 10 mg/kg ASA reduced inflammation in pups exposed to hyperoxia.

In this study, we assessed the contribution of activin A-a member of the TGFbeta superfamily-to the development of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal mice., METHODS: We placed newborn C57Bl6 mouse pups in continuous hyperoxia (85% O2) to mimic many aspects of BPD including alveolar simplification and pulmonary inflammation.

ActRIIB-Fc also reduced pulmonary leukocyte infiltration, normalized tissue: airspace ratio and increased septal crest density.

Multiple factors contribute to the development of BPD including barotrauma and volutrauma from mechanical ventilation, infection and oxidative stress among others. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multi-factorial growth factors that belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily, which has pleiotropic functions in regulating development, homeostasis and repair of various tissues including vascular endothelium. Endogenous nitric oxide is an important mediator of pulmonary vasodilation and reactivity and has a role in vascular remodeling during oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that BMP2 and BMP4 may have a role in the phosphorylation and activity of eNOS in bPAECs. Objective(s): We tested the hypothesis that BMP2 and eNOS expression is attenuated in HPAECs exposed to hyperoxia. Method(s): HPAECs were cultured in endothelial cell culture medium and maintained in a sterile humidified cell culture incubator at 37oC with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged at 70-80% confluence with trypsin. Primary cultures of passage 5-6 were used in the experiments. HPAECs were plated in 60 mm plates and exposed to hyperoxic gas with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for up to 48 hours and collected at 12, 24 and 48 hours. Antibodies to BMP2, phosphorylated eNOS and eNOS were used in Western blot assays to determine protein expression. Result(s): eNOS expression increased by up to 25% in cells exposed to hyperoxia at 24 hours compared to control although did not achieve statistical significance. BMP2 expression, was also upregulated with prolonged exposure to hyperoxia. Discussion/Conclusion: Contrary to our expected findings, our preliminary data demonstrated that BMP2 and eNOS expression was upregulated in hyperoxia. Based on previous published literature, BMP2 may have a role in eNOS phosphorylation. Thus, we speculate that upregulation of both BMP2 and eNOS may reflect a protective response of the vascular endothelium to oxidative stress.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature infants, that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Hyperoxia, volutrauma and barotrauma directly injure the immature lung, however injury is partly mediated by recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and release of inflammatory mediators. Marked inflammation and secondary inhibition of alveolarization occur with the destruction and abnormal repair that pathologically marks BPD. Our microarray expression analysis identified differential expression of mast cell (MC) specific genes in autopsied BPD and normal infant lungs. Two human mast cell subtypes have been described based on the production of peptidases. MC that produce tryptase without chymase are predominant in mucosa of normal lung while dual tryptase and chymase MC, generally submucosal and connective tissue (MCCT) in location, are infrequent in non-diseased lung. MCCT are noted to be increased in severe asthma, interstitial lung disease and lung fibrosis. Our previously reported immunohistochemistry confirmed numerous tryptase and chymase producing MCCT in BPD lungs. This study determines that MC peptidases can be detected in tracheal aspirates samples (TAs) of premature infants at risk for BPD in comparison to term infants without lung disease. Methods. TAs were collected at routine suctioning, centrifuged and supernatants frozen at -80degreeC until assayed for MC products. Peptidases were detected by Western blot using mouse monoclonal anti-human tryptase and chymase antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA and AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, respectively). Results. In this pilot study, six subjects were evaluated, three preterm (age at birth <35 wks) with RDS or BPD, and three full term, intubated for reasons other than lung disease. On Western blot analysis, both 32 and 37 kDa bands consistent with tryptase and chymase, respectively, were observed in two of the preterm TAs. Light bands in a 4-day old infant, GA 35 wks and very intense bands in a 27-day old, ex-28 wk infant. The third PT infant was an ex-24 wk infant, 7 mo. old on testing, in which specific peptidases were not detected. No peptidase bands were detected in the term infant samples. Conclusions. MCCT are increased in distal lung tissue of infants with BPD. Products of those MC can be detected in airway secretions of premature babies during the postnatal period when BPD develops but not in healthy infant lungs. MC secretory products may be markers of BPD risk and suggest novel therapeutic targets. Studies to correlate airway MC signature proteins with pulmonary function and outcomes are underway.","group":"g1","id":"676ac5c2-e1b1-4e9b-8e1e-881f7ae5e22d","_showDetails":false},"0a0e2fba-9c80-4af8-bc2a-5711f2f8f2a0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71986232","title":"Simulation of BPD and treatment of auto-PEEP-induced asynchrony","authors":["Demers R.","Swezea W.","Ngo C.","Angelico P.R."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*society","*simulation","*American","*positive end expiratory pressure","human","lung model","patient","chronic obstructive lung disease","population","neonatal ventilator","ventilator","lung dysplasia","artificial ventilation","breathing rate","airway obstruction","endotracheal tube","breathing","respiratory therapist","pulmonologist","exercise","caregiver","adult","obstructive airway disease","water"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"R.

In both populations, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (Auto-PEEP) can occur secondary to expiratory airflow obstruction. Asynchrony is often observed during mechanical ventilation of such patients, whereby inspiratory efforts sporadically fail to elicit triggering of the ventilator into the inspiratory phase. We wished to simulate BPD- and Auto-PEEP-induced asynchrony by means of a neonatal lung model, and to demonstrate how that asynchrony could be corrected. Method(s): We employed a neonatal lung model described elsewhere1. This apparatus was connected to a source of a pulsatile subatmospheric pressure, generated at a rate of 60 per minute, to simulate rhythmic and regular inspiratory efforts. A neonatal ventilator (Avea, CareFusion, San Diego, CA) in the pressure-controlled/assist-control mode was interfaced to the neonatal lung model, and its sensitivity was adjusted to deliver an assisted breath in response to each inspiratory effort. We then extrinsically compressed the endotracheal tube leading to each chamber of the lung model, until an Auto-PEEP level between four and five centimeters of water was observed. At that point, an external PEEP level of five centimeters of water was imposed. Result(s): The baseline respiratory rate (RR) was observed to be 60/min. The creation of an Auto-PEEP level between four and five centimeters of water resulted in asynchrony, with a resultant RR of 40/min. The subsequent imposition of an external PEEP level of five centimeters of water was observed to abolish asynchrony, with a return to the displayed RR of 60/min. Conclusion(s): Neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) can sometimes effectively deal with asynchrony2. However, one is not obliged to resort to such a sophisticated solution. The imposition of an external PEEP level equal to, or marginally higher than, the prevailing Auto-PEEP level also succeeds in dealing with asynchrony, and at far lower cost and complexity. Some respiratory care practitioners (RCPs) and pulmonologists are familiar with the imposition of external PEEP as a method of counteracting the effects of Auto-PEEP-induced asynchrony3, but many are not. This simulation exercise can increase caregivers awareness of this simple and straightforward method of dealing with asynchrony whenever that dysfunction is observed clinically.","group":"g1","id":"0a0e2fba-9c80-4af8-bc2a-5711f2f8f2a0","_showDetails":false},"ee818904-2cae-46fa-a5d5-5e8c0c3adb15":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71986229","title":"Using the asynchrony index (AI) to quantify asynchrony events during simulated bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)","authors":["Angelico P.R.","Demers R.R.","Swezea W.","Ngo C."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","positive end expiratory pressure","human","simulation","ventilator","patient","model","breathing rate","mortality","lung","sedation","lung model","airway obstruction","mechanical ventilator","chronic obstructive lung disease","caregiver","exercise","clinical competence","water"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.R.

Clinicians often have difficulty identifying and responding to asynchrony appropriately, whether it is physiologically or mechanically induced. Regrettably, the first line of action is often sedation, not ventilatory optimization. This can lead to more time on the ventilator.1-3 Therefore; using simulation to teach clinicians to recognize and respond to asynchrony will benefit the patient. In obstructive disease states such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, physiologic asynchrony attributable to intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (\"Auto-PEEP\") can occur secondary to expiratory airflow obstruction, making the ventilator refractory to some inspiratory efforts. Using a mechanical lung model4 we simulated BPD- and Auto-PEEP-induced asynchrony4 and quantified it by calculation of the asynchrony index (AI). An AI of >=10% is an indicator of substantial asynchrony and is relatively common.5 Mortality can be higher in patients with an AI of >30%.1 Simulations can teach how asynchrony can be corrected.4 Methods: We employed a neonatal lung model to simulate BPD, elicit Auto-PEEP, and induce asynchrony.4 When an Auto-PEEP level of about five centimeters of water was observed, an external PEEP level of five centimeters of water was imposed. We calculated AI as [(# of wasted efforts/total respiratory rate (RR) x100], where \"total RR\" includes wasted efforts.3, 5 Results: The baseline RR was observed to be 60/min. The creation of the Auto-PEEP resulted in wasted efforts, with a resultant RR of 40/min and a worrisome AI of 33%. Subsequent imposition of an external PEEP level of five centimeters of water was observed to abolish asynchrony with a return to the displayed RR of 60/min. Conclusion(s): We employed a simple mechanical model to simulate asynchrony. We subsequently calculated AI, and implemented a solution to optimize patient-ventilator interaction. Some clinicians are familiar with the consequences of asynchrony, the AI, and the imposition of external PEEP as a method of counteracting the effects of Auto-PEEP-induced asynchrony, but many are not. A simulation exercise using a simple and inexpensive model can increase caregivers' awareness of: 1) asynchrony events; 2) quantification of asynchrony by means of the AI; and 3) the appropriate response to asynchrony events. Many more asynchrony simulations can be generated by means of various mechanical ventilator adjustments (e.g. sensitivity, inspiratory time, flow) and the AI index employed to quantify the degree of asynchrony.

The pathogenesis of BPD is believed to be secondary to oxidative damage from hyperoxia and inflammation that leads to impaired alveolar formation and often chronic lung dysfunction. A murine model of BPD utilizing acute postnatal hyperoxia followed by short-term recovery in room air (RA) mimics the durable effects after injury during alveolar development. Although several antioxidant genes are induced during hyperoxic exposure, we hypothesize that extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), an antioxidant uniquely targeted to the extracellular matrix and alveolar fluid, might have a different response (downregulation) and thereby contribute to the persistent airspace injury and inflammation after recovery. METHOD(S): C57Bl/6 pups (24h old) were placed in an 85 to 90% FIO2 chamber or RA for 4 days with recovery in RA for 14 days. Measures of alveolar injury were obtained. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR measured protein and mRNA expression in lung tissue lysates, respectively. SOD3 was localized in lung parenchyma using immunohistochemistry-immunofluorescence (IHC-IF), and assays were used to measure SOD activity. Values for measurements were expressed as means+/-SEM, and P-values for significance were designated at <0.05. Student's t-tests were used to determine differences between groups. RESULT(S): Interestingly, mRNA expression for antioxidant genes mediated by Nrf-2, a major antioxidant transcription factor, was significantly increased for Ho-1, Gclc, and Nqo-1 in the hyperoxia (n = 4) versus RA group (n = 5) (Table 1). Similar results were found for SOD1 and SOD2 mRNA expression. SOD3, an Nrf-2-independent antioxidant, was significantly reduced in the hyperoxia-exposed mice compared to RA (Table 1). IHC-IF revealed decreased and disrupted SOD3 deposition in the alveolar ECM of hyperoxia-exposed mice (Figure 1). SOD3 protein expression and SOD activity were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION(S): Newborn mice exposed to acute hyperoxia followed by RA recovery demonstrated (1) increased mRNA expression of certain antioxidant genes mediated by Nrf-2 and (2) a significant decrease in SOD3 mRNA expression and fragmented deposition in the alveolar ECM. Importantly, this reduced SOD3 expression uniquely correlated with alveolar injury measures in the recovered neonatal hyperoxic lung. Such findings provide insight into a possible mechanism for the pathogenesis of BPD. Future studies are needed to determine if increased SOD3 levels in the lung or a mimetic can attenuate or reverse the airspace damage found in this particular model.

BPD is characterized in part by arrested development of the lung, and apoptosis is known to contribute to the hyperoxic response of the lung in models of BPD. TRAIL is known to target both endothelial and epithelial cells, therefore we hypothesize that TRAIL mediated apoptosis will play a role during recovery from hyperoxia. Method(s): C57BL/B6 (B6) mice were exposed to 75% oxygen from postnatal day (P) 2 to P14, a period of alveolarization of the developing murine lung, in order to generate a BPD phenotype. TRAIL expression in the lung was evaluated in RA and hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice using Western analysis. Additionally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to analyze and quantify TRAIL expression in lung tissue from RA and hyperoxia-exposed animals on P14 (end of hyperoxia exposure) and P17 (RA recovery for 3 days). Lung sections were also immunolabeled with F4/80, a macrophage specific marker. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze caspase-3 expression. Result(s): Decreased TRAIL protein expression was shown by Western analysis during hyperoxia exposure, followed by an increase during the recovery phase. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in TRAIL expression by IHC between the hyperoxia-exposed tissue and RA controls on P14, the final day of oxygen exposure. However, TRAIL expression was increased approximately 3-fold (p=0.009, n=4) at P17 (3 days after hyperoxia) in the exposed animals compared to the RA controls. When lungs from P17 hyperoxia-exposed animals were compared to those from P14, TRAIL expression was increased >2.5-fold (p=0.01, n=4). Additionally, TRAIL expression was co-localized exclusively to F4/80 labeled macrophages. Increased apoptosis was demonstrated in hyperoxia-exposed animals at P17 assessed by caspase-3 expression using qRT-PCR. Conclusion(s): Increased TRAIL expression is associated with apoptosis during recovery from hyperoxia-induced injury in the developing lung. TRAIL expression was exclusively localized to macrophages in the parenchymal airspace wall. These results suggest that TRAIL expression contributes to lung recovery in a model of BPD. In order to better target therapies for BPD, an understanding of apoptosis during different phases of the disease is essential.","group":"g1","id":"c236a147-8211-4400-ad15-f393f33f647d","_showDetails":true},"da7852b7-f0d3-493b-b183-c98b4c70d87a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985753","title":"Microrna-based regulation of angiogenic gene expression in a murine model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Collura C.A.","Carey W.A.","Dong J.","Sutor S.L.","Prakash Y.S.","Wigle D.A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*gene expression","*murine model","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","gene","human","angiogenesis","lung","mouse","endothelium cell","hyperoxia","immunohistochemistry","cell proliferation","book","model","statistical analysis","regulatory mechanism","newborn","lung parenchyma","animal model","histology","ambient air","upregulation","Institute for Cancer Research mouse","protein expression","tube","cell migration","data base","maturity","cell growth","gene ontology","immunoblotting","analysis of variance","*microRNA","messenger RNA","angiogenin","vascular endothelial cadherin","protein","brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor","receptor","microRNA 210","catenin","CD31 antigen","oxygen","beta catenin","microRNA 29a","microRNA 29","locked nucleic acid","vasculotropin"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.A.

Reduced expression of pro-angiogenic genes has been implicated in human cases and animal models of BPD, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether miRNA up-regulation might correlate with the reduced pro-angiogenic gene expression in a model of BPD. Method(s): Neonatal ICR mice were exposed to 80% oxygen (O2) or room air for 29 days. Lung microanatomy was assessed using standard histological techniques. Comprehensive mRNA and miRNA profiling was performed using lung tissue from both groups. The effect of hyperoxia on mRNA and miRNA levels was determined using ANOVA statistical analysis of CT values and fold-change. Potential direct mRNA targets of miRNAs within angiogenic pathways were predicted through miRNA-mRNA endogenous correlation and computational mapping in miRBase. Individual genes involved in angiogenesis were assessed by Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis for miRNA regulatory networks using the DAVID database and manual reviews of known pro-angiogenic genes. Protein expression was evaluated by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry techniques. Result(s): After 29 days, the lungs of O2-exposed mice displayed histological changes consistent with BPD. We found decreased expression of several pro-angiogenic genes, including Angiogenin-1, Angiogenin-3, b-catenin, PECAM-1, VE-cadherin and VEGF-A. Many of these genes are predicted targets of simultaneously up-regulated miRNAs, including mir-135b, mir-210, mir-699, mir-690, let-7i, mir-322, mir-497 and mir-27a. Most of the observed down-regulated genes are required for normal alveolar and pulmonary vascular development, and many are diminished in the lungs of human neonates with BPD. Immunodensitometry demonstrated decreased expression of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, beta-catenin and angiogenin proteins in the P29 O2-exposed mice. In our manual review, we discovered markedly decreased expression of Ntrk2 which encodes a neurotrophic receptor (TrkB) involved in a known signaling pathway that stimulates angiogenesis. In addition, Ntrk2 expression was a predicted target of up-regulated mir-29a and mir-29c. Immunohistochemistry clearly demonstrated decreased expression of the TrkB receptor. Conclusion(s): Using an established model of BPD, we found evidence that miRNAs may impair angiogenesis by targeting mRNA transcripts whose encoded proteins promote endothelial cell growth and functional maturity. Future directions include demonstrating the effect of hyperoxia on human endothelial cell proliferation, cell migration, and endothelial tube formation and attempting to recover impaired cellular processes by over-expression of mRNA and/or silencing miRNA via locked nucleic acids.","group":"g3","id":"da7852b7-f0d3-493b-b183-c98b4c70d87a","_showDetails":true},"8580bd31-64ee-4baa-af64-78a33a62aafe":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985750","title":"Nuclear factor kappa B activation in the neonatal lung protects against lipopolysaccharide induced alveolar disruption by repressing macrophage inflammatory-2 expression","authors":["Hou Y.","Iosef C.","Chen C.","Cornfield D.N.","Alvira C.M."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung","*macrophage","*American","*society","mouse","inflammation","exposure","lung dysplasia","infection","lethal dose","gene expression","hypothesis","lung capillary","immunoblotting","risk","newborn period","density","capillary density","injury","lung development","immunohistochemistry","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","*immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein","*lipopolysaccharide","cytokine","messenger RNA","transcription factor","fibroblast growth factor","vasculotropin receptor 2","protein","neutralizing antibody","macrophage inflammatory protein 2","immunoglobulin G","vasculotropin A","growth factor","vasculotropin"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.M.

While systemic infections during the neonatal period increase the risk of BPD, the molecular mechanisms that impair alveolarization in response to inflammation are incompletely understood. Our previous work demonstrated a unique protective role for the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappaB) in the neonatal lung. Therefore, we hypothesized that: i) postnatal exposure to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) disrupts alveolarization; and ii) NFkappaB activity in the neonatal lung protects against this alveolar disruption. Method(s): To test this hypothesis, neonatal (6 day old) mice were treated with vehicle (PBS), a sub-lethal dose of systemic (LPS), or the combination of LPS and the NFkappaB inhibitor, 2 (LPS+BAY). At 8h, mRNA and protein was extracted for qPCR, western immunoblot and ELISA. At 24h, the lungs were inflation fixed at 25 cm H2O pressure for morphometric analysis, and determination of pulmonary vascular density by CD31 immunostaining. In separate experiments, LPS and LPS + BAY treated mice were pretreated with either macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) neutralizing antibody, or isotype control IgG. Result(s): Postnatal LPS impaired alveolarization, increasing airspace size (p<0.01), and decreasing radial alveolar counts (RAC) (p<0.001). Blocking NFkappaB with BAY markedly worsened this effect, increasing airspace size by 83% (p<0.001) and decreasing RAC by 38% (p<0.001). Either treatment with LPS alone, or LPS + BAY reduced the gene expression of fibroblast growth factors (FGF) -7 and -10, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) to a similar degree. While LPS + BAY treatment also decreased the expression of VEGF-A, pulmonary capillary density was unchanged. However, treatment with LPS + BAY also caused significant elevations in the expression of cytokines known to disrupt lung development, including a 300-fold increase in MIP-2 (p<0.01). Furthermore, neutralization of MIP-2 reduced alveolar size (p<0.01) and increased RAC (p<0.05) to levels that were similar to mice treated with LPS alone. Conclusion(s): Exposure to systemic LPS at the onset of alveolarization disrupts alveolar development, and decreases the expression of key epithelial growth factors. NFkappaB activity protects the developing lung against more severe injury by repressing the inflammatory cytokine, MIP-2. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NFkappaB plays a novel, developmentally regulated, protective role in alveolar development even in the presence of systemic inflammation. We speculate that diminished NFkappaB activity may play a pathogenic role in BPD, and that strategies to enhance NFkappaB signaling may be effective in promoting alveolar development.","group":"g3","id":"8580bd31-64ee-4baa-af64-78a33a62aafe","_showDetails":true},"24fcde7b-8dea-4d7f-96a2-19c2fbb5f91d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985747","title":"Pulmonary neuroendocrine bodies (NEBS) form at stereotyped positions within the epithelium of developing airways","authors":["Kuo C.S.","Krasnow M.A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*airway","*American","*society","*epithelium","lung","adult","infancy","mouse","staining","neurosecretory cell","precursor","lung dysplasia","optics","confocal microscopy","respiratory tract disease","fetus lung","diseases","dissection","cell hyperplasia","normal distribution","fluorescent antibody technique","tomography","model","cell labeling","vascularization","cell structure","pulmonary artery","cre recombinase","antibody"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.S.

NE cells exist as solitary cells and as clusters in the developing and adult lung, but their relationship to each other is unknown. Increases in NEBs are specific to a pediatric condition known as neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI), whereas other conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia of infancy (BPD) are associated with increases in NE cells without the characteristic increase in NEBs seen in NEHI. One of the challenges to characterizing and experimentally modeling NE cell abnormalities is a lack in understanding of the normal distribution and placement of NE cells. We asked whether NEBs localization is stereotyped during embryonic lung growth as a first step towards the cellular and molecular dissection of NEB development. METHOD(S): Using whole mount staining techniques developed in our lab combined with immunohistochemical detection techniques, we have mapped the location of NEBs within embryonic mouse lungs. We used both confocal microscopy and optical projection tomography (OPT) to image the fluorescently labeled samples. Analysis of the precise location of each NEB at airway bifurcations was performed using the branching lineage of the mouse lung developed in our lab (Metzger, 2008). We also label individual NE precursors using genetic Cre-recombinase mediated to mark single NE cells. RESULT(S): Larger NEBs are biased towards airway branchpoints (such as branch Left 1 (L1), Anterior 2 (A2)), where we always see a cluster at the same location (Figure 1). All 20 samples examined at late embryonic stages had a cluster present at this characteristic location and a similar analysis was carried out within other branchpoints within the left lobe. Single cell-labeling techniques show reveal distinct NE cell morphology within a cluster. Representative images of E18 left upper lobe showing three-dimensional structure of proximal airway branches with accompanying vasculature along with NEBs (panel b and c). (a) Stereoscopic view of L1 and first two anterior (A1,A2) and ventral branches (V1, V2) demonstrated by whole mount fluorescent antibody staining with anti-alpha SMA antibody. The pulmonary artery (PA) accompanying each branch is also well-visualized. (b and c) Maximum projection images through a stack of confocal images of whole mount immunofluorescent samples double stained for alpha-SMA (green) and CGRP(red). CONCLUSION(S): Larger NEBs are biased towards airway bifurcations and development appears to be highly regulated at certain branchpoints. Understanding the signals regulating NEB placement is key for understanding diseases where NEB size or location is altered.

Lung prematurity associated with preterm birth frequently results in respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which remain the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. The mechanisms synchronizing gestational length and lung maturation remain to be elucidated. Method(s): A genome-wide mRNA expression time-course study (E15 to Postnatal Day 0) was designed using lung RNAs from C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J mice that differ in gestational length by ~30hr. Comprehensive bioinformatics and functional genomics analyses were used to identify key regulators, bioprocesses and transcriptional networks controlling lung maturation. Result(s): Both temporal and strain dependent gene expression patterns were identified during lung maturation. For time dependent changes, cell adhesion, vasculature development, and lipid metabolism/transport were major bioprocesses induced at E16-E17. CEBPA, PPARG, VEGFA, CAV1 and CDH were found to be key regulators of these processes. Innate defense/immune responses were induced at later gestational ages (E19-20), STAT1, AP1, and EGFR being key regulators of these responses. Cell cycle and chromatin assembly were repressed during lung maturation and were regulated by FOXM1, PLK1, chromobox, and high mobility group families of transcription factors. Strain dependent mRNA expression differences peaked at E18.5. At this time, mRNAs regulating surfactant and innate immunity were more abundantly expressed in lungs of B6 than in A/J mice, while genes involved in chromatin assembly and histone modification were expressed at lower levels in B6 than in A/J mice. Prior to birth, innate immune responses and surfactant production were critical and connected processes that contributed to lung maturation necessary for air breathing after birth. Epigenetic regulators played a repressive role by altering chromatin structure and controlling the cell cycle. The precise balance of these positive and negative gene networks is likely a critical determinant of the timing of lung maturation that differs in the B6 and A/J mouse strains. Conclusion(s): The present study systemically mapped key regulators, bioprocesses, and transcriptional networks controlling lung maturation, revealing insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying lung maturation.","group":"g3","id":"1e56b40b-a0fd-452e-b455-63dae60c1bb9","_showDetails":true},"83629953-9f65-49c6-affd-e21dda23b2d6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Genetic polymorphisms of heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) may impact on acute kidney injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and mortality in premature infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2015.44","authors":["Askenazi, David J","Halloran, Brian","Patil, Neha","Keeling, Susan","Saeidi, Behtash","Koralkar, Rajesh","Ambalavanan, Namasivayam"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150309//","keywords":["*Acute Kidney Injury/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","DNA Primers/ge [Genetics]","*Heme Oxygenase-1/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Infant","Infant Mortality","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/ge [Genetics]","Prospective Studies","Ureohydrolases/bl [Blood]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"77","number":"6","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25751573"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) catalyzes heme degradation, and offers protection for several organs, including the kidney.

We recently found that expression of POSTN is increased in the lungs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice, an animal model of BPD. POSTN knockout (KO) mice are protected against hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization and interstitial fibrosis, findings typical of BPD. We hypothesized that POSTN regulates pro-fibrotic gene expression in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mouse lungs. Method(s): Postnatal day 2 mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 days. Lungs were processed for sectioning, mRNA or protein analysis, or collagenase-digested for mesenchymal cell isolation. Mesenchymal cells were cultured for 5 days and treated with TGF-b1. Expression of genes involved in myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis was examined by qPCR. Result(s): Hyperoxia increased the mean chord length of airspaces and expression of a-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), collagen (COL1A1), and elastin (ELN) in the alveolar interstitia. These changes were not observed in the lungs of hyperoxia-treated POSTN KO mice. Hyperoxia also significantly increased lung mRNA expression of ELN, COL1A1, CTGF, POSTN, TGF-b1, and CXCL1 (p<0.05). ACTA2, CYR61, and CXCL2 were also increased. In contrast, hyperoxia failed to increase expression of these genes in POSTN KO mice. Compared to cells from normoxic mice, lung mesenchymal cells from hyperoxic wild-type mice showed increased ELN, SFRP (for secreted frizzled-related protein) and CYR61 transcripts (p<=0.05, ANOVA). Mesenchymal cells from POSTN KO mice did not show increased gene expression. In addition, TGF-b1 treatment of mesenchymal cells from hyperoxia-exposed mice increased mRNA expression of SMTN (smoothelin), SFRP and CYR61 (each p<=0.05) but had no effect in cells from hyperoxic POSTN KO mice. Finally, immunohistochemical staining showed that CYR61 expression was increased in the lungs of infants with BPD and hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice.

Genetic variation in a number of genes has been suggested as one of the etiological factors. An underlying aberration in lung developmental pathways may result in the development of BPD when exposed to insults like hyperoxia and prolonged ventilation. We hypothesized that BPD genes are significantly differentially expressed over the course of normal lung development, consistent with BPD resulting from an aberration in development. We also wanted to assess the effect of variation in these genes on lung function later in life. Method(s): Eighteen human genes previously associated with BPD were selected after a comprehensive literature search. These genes were then tested for differential expression during human lung development. We used genome-wide gene expression profiles from 114 human fetal lung tissue samples with an estimated gestational age of 54 days-196 days on the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. The analysis was carried out under the assumption of a linear model of expression over time. A gene was considered to be differentially expressed if any of its probes had a significant p value (nominal p<0.0016, the Bonferroni correction for 31 probes). As a preliminary assessment of the impact of these genes on postnatal pulmonary function, 496 genetic variants, within 50 KB of the BPD genes, from 403 parent-child trios from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), were assessed for genetic association with lung function (FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC) using family-based association tests adjusted for age, gender and height. A p value <0.0001 was considered significant. Result(s): Of the 18 genes analyzed, 12(67%) were found to be differentially expressed during early human lung development. Of note, one genetic variant in the factor VII gene (rs9324220) was also found to be significantly associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) (p=5.08E-05) in the CAMP cohort. Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate that genes previously associated with BPD are differentially expressed during early human lung development.

Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of this disease is incomplete and therapeutic interventions are severely limited. Method(s): We analyzed Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) and Asporin (ASPN) expression in lung tissues from human BPD subjects. We analyzed IGF1 and ASPN expression in a mouse model of BPD-like neonatal chronic lung disease resulting from Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) receptor deficiency. We studied the IGF1-ASPN regulatory axis in primary cultures of isolated lung fibroblasts in vitro. Result(s): Genome-wide expression profiling of BPD lung tissues identified a cluster of IGF1-related genes with abnormal expression in BPD, including increased expression of ASPN, a growth factor-binding extracellular matrix proteoglycan involved in cellular differentiation. In the normal mouse lung, ASPN expression initiates at birth, increases during the early postnatal period and returns to low levels at maturity. In a mouse model of BPD, characterized by increased IGF1 production, we observed excessive and persistent expression of ASPN. In early passage normal fetal human lung fibroblasts, baseline expression of ASPN was strongly induced by IGF1 treatment . In early passage, mouse lung fibroblasts, we find that IGF1 is both necessary and sufficient for maximal APSN expression. Treatment of mouse lung fibroblasts with 50 ng/ml IGF1 leads to a 10-fold increase in ASPN expression, while treatment of these cells with 10 ug/ml IGF1 receptor-blocking antibody leads to a 10-fold decrease in ASPN expression. In contrast, mouse lung fibroblasts treated with 25 ng/ml of FGF1 and FGF2 show reduced expression of both IGF1 and ASPN. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that alterations in IGF1 and FGF signaling may contribute to aberrant expression of ASPN in BPD. The role of this novel extracellular matrix proteoglycan in lung development and disease is a focus of current studies.","group":"g2","id":"b791dd42-83e9-4992-b221-0ba7f622f9ac","_showDetails":true},"fcb4907b-6e6b-4b38-a561-22d604a53188":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985737","title":"Reduced expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha in neonatal lung mesenchymal stromal cells from infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Popova A.P.","Bentley J.K.","Bozyk P.","Linn M.J.","Lei J.","Goldsmith A.M.","Pryhuber G.S.","Hershenson M.B."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung","*mesenchymal stroma cell","*infant","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","human","mouse","prematurity","angiogenesis","DNA synthesis","hyperoxia","gene expression","tracheal aspiration procedure","gene","vascular smooth muscle cell","newborn","model","gene probe","immunohistochemistry","immunoblotting","university","risk","lung parenchyma","respiratory distress","artificial ventilation","phenotype","baby","protein expression","cell proliferation","*platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor","platelet derived growth factor","platelet derived growth factor D","oxygen","thymidine","DNA","platelet derived growth factor AA","actin","catenin"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"A.P.

We also hypothesized that differences, if present, would be reflected in the lungs of infants with BPD and hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice, a model of BPD. Design/Methods: MSCs were isolated from tracheal aspirates of premature neonates. Low passage MSCs were studied. DNA synthesis in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA was assessed by [3H]-thymidine uptake. Two day-old mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 days. Lung tissue from human infants with BPD was obtained from University of Rochester Neonatal Lung Biorepository. Gene expression was analyzed by gene array, qPCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. Result(s): Compared with cells from infants not developing BPD, 199 gene probe transcripts were differentially expressed by neonatal lung MSCs from infants developing BPD. MSCs from infants developing BPD showed significantly lower expression of mRNAs encoding PDGF-R a, PDGF-Rb and PDGF-D, which are important for lung alveolarization, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Results were confirmed by qPCR, and immunoblots showed reduced protein expression of PDGF-Ra and PDGF-Rb. MSCs from infants developing BPD showed reduced PDGF-AA-induced DNA synthesis. Lungs from hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice and human infants with BPD showed hypoalveolarization and lower PDGF-Ra expression. Finally, a subset of MSCs from babies developing BPD showed a myofibroblastic phenotype characterized by increased a-actin, b-catenin and phospho-GSK-3b content. Conclusion(s): MSCs from infants developing BPD demonstrate stable alterations in gene expression which favor reduced proliferation and angiogenesis, as well as myofibroblastic differentiation.","group":"g2","id":"fcb4907b-6e6b-4b38-a561-22d604a53188","_showDetails":true},"e901fc6e-60ce-4fc1-8747-ff6c6a14c18f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71985736","title":"Neurotrophin overexpression in lower airways of neonates as a biomarker of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Grayson S.","Samsell L.J.","Walton C.","Piedimonte G."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lower respiratory tract","*newborn","*lung dysplasia","*American","*society","infant","human","prematurity","female","lung","cell fractionation","lavage","patient","liquid","morbidity","disease course","pregnancy","intensive care unit","respiratory tract inflammation","newborn intensive care","exposure","oxygen consumption","serum","immunoassay","artificial ventilation","hypothesis","virus infection","etiology","mortality","intubation","synthesis","fiber","blood level","disease severity","*neurotrophin","*biological marker","nerve growth factor","cytokine","protein","marker","oxygen","neurotransmitter"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"185","number":"MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.

Previous studies have shown a multi-factorial etiology including prematurity, need for mechanical ventilation, and oxygen exposure. More recently, an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to predict the development and disease course of BPD. Neurotrophins like the nerve growth factor (NGF) control the development of afferent and efferent fibers innervating the lower respiratory tract and modulate the synthesis and release of sensory and motor neurotransmitters. Our previous studies have shown significantly increased NGF levels in the lungs of term infants during acute viral infections, but neurotrophins expression in the lungs of premature infants has never been investigated. Objective(s): We tested the hypothesis that NGF levels are elevated in premature infants who develop BPD compared to premature infants who do not develop BPD and term infants. Method(s): We used a highly sensitive immunoassay to measure the nerve growth factor concentrations in serum samples and in the cell fractions of tracheal lavage fluid on day 1 and 2 post-intubation of 33 infants to our neonatal intensive care unit. Our patients included: 5 term patients intubated for cardiac conditions, 18 premature infants who did not develop BPD, and 10 premature infants who developed BPD. Result(s): Data show significantly higher NGF concentrations in the cell fraction of tracheal lavage fluid obtained from infants with BPD (26.6 +/- 10.9 pg/mg protein) compared to control term infants (2.3 +/- 10.9 pg/mL) and a smaller increase compared to premature infants without development of BPD (19.6 +/- 7.8 pg/mL). Serum levels of NGF from infants with BPD (1077.3 +/- 580.8 pg/mg) were significantly higher compared to control term infants (320 +/- 70.5 pg/mL) and similar to premature infants without development of BPD (1545.7 +/- 827 pg/mL). Conclusion(s): We conclude that NGF is markedly over-expressed in the lungs of infants born prematurely and may contribute to the development of airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. Additional studies are ongoing to determine whether this factor could be used as a prognostic marker for disease severity.","group":"g1","id":"e901fc6e-60ce-4fc1-8747-ff6c6a14c18f","_showDetails":true},"2840cf5b-a074-455c-9efa-440820c61bd0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71925527","title":"Pregnancy complications and respiratory outcomes in very preterm infants","authors":["Gagliardi L.","Rusconi F.","Da Fre M.","Mello G.","Carnielli V.","Di Lallo D.","Macagno F.","Miniaci S.","Corchia C.","Cuttini M."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*prematurity","*infant","*human","*European","*society","*pregnancy complication","mortality","risk","diseases","Italian (citizen)","premature labor","hypothesis","pathology","membrane","immaturity","rupture","lung dysplasia","newborn","maternal age","citizenship","infection","maternal hypertension","morbidity","mother","gestational age","population","intrauterine infection","death","respiratory distress syndrome","confidence interval","prenatal growth","education","female","steroid"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"40","number":"SUPPL. 56\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"L.

Method(s): A population-based prospective cohort of 2085 singleton infants 23 to 31 weeks gestational age (GA) born in 6 Italian regions in 2003-2005 (ACTION study), was analyzed.

Supplemental oxygen can damage the pulmonary epithelium through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) enzyme is involved in ROS detoxification. The encoding gene is subjected to the inactivating sense polymorphism (C609T). Individuals homozygous for the mutant allele (T/T) completely lack NQO1 activity, whereas heterozygotes (C/T) have low enzyme activity. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the potential role of NQO1 inborn polymorphism in BPD susceptibility. Patients/Methods: The study enrolled 119 Greek premature neonates with gestational age <=32 weeks; 42 developed BPD (case group) and 77 did not develop BPD (control group). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of all neonates. NQO1 genotyping was performed by real-time PCR. The NQO1 gene status was also evaluated in respect to gender. Result(s): A different distribution of NQO1 genotypes was found between BPD neonates and controls, with a higher frequency of variant genotypes (heterozygotes C/T and homozygotes T/T) in BPD population (50% in BPD vs 28.6% in no BPD neonates, p=0.046). Thus, a significantly higher frequency of the mutant T allele was observed in BPD neonates as compared to controls (0.27 vs 0.17, p=0.058). According to gender, we observed no genotypic differences. Conclusion(s): The higher incidence of the C/T and T/T variant genotypes among neonates who developed BPD suggests that the NQO1 C609T inborn polymorphism probably constitutes an early biomarker of BPD development.","group":"g1","id":"14d9b816-4198-4e88-8bed-d08735ae2f52","_showDetails":false},"9836fc40-2e68-4972-b638-2012f2133612":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71925508","title":"Development of a quality of life instrument for children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Schaap L.","Flokstra-De Blok B.M.J.","Van Der Hulst J.","Dubois A.E.J.","Vrijlandt E.J.L.E."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*child","*human","*lung dysplasia","*European","*society","*quality of life","questionnaire","parent","morbidity","risk","validity","hospitalization","social behavior","academic achievement","exercise","coughing","premature labor"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"40","number":"SUPPL. 56\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"L.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of preterm birth. It is associated with prolonged hospitalization, long-term pulmonary morbidity and an increased risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. The impact of these complications on health-related quality of life (HRQL) is not known because there is no disease-specific instrument to measure HRQL available. Aim. To develop a disease-specific questionnaire to measure HRQL in children with BPD aged 4 to 8 years old. Methods. Participant(s): children aged 4 to 8 years old with BPD. The first steps in the development of a HRQL instrument are item generation and item reduction. Sources for item generation were literature, expert opinion and parents of participants. For item reduction, parents indicated how much the items affected the HRQL of their child. The clinical impact method and item analysis were used to reduce items. Results. 51 children participated in the study; 20 in item generation and 31 in item reduction. 130 items were identified. With the clinical impact method 53 items with an overall importance (OI) >1.00 were selected. Three items with highest OI were 'easily distracted' (2.52), 'having a cold for longer period of time' (2.42) and 'coughing' (2.39). After item analysis, 47 items remained in the questionnaire. Items were linked to a variety of subjects such as pulmonary problems, growth/nutrition, exercise, school, behavior, social and emotional functioning. Conclusion. This is the first time the development of a disease-specific instrument to measure HRQL in BPD has been undertaken. The items in the developed questionnaire have clinical impact. The next step will be to determine validity of these items.","group":"g1","id":"9836fc40-2e68-4972-b638-2012f2133612","_showDetails":true},"4dabba57-742a-4c90-95fe-ea1a3c22c4ae":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71923231","title":"LSC 2012 abstract Repair of the very immature lung following brief, injurious mechanical ventilation commences within 24 hours","authors":["Brew N.","Hooper S.","Wallace M.","Harding R."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*artificial ventilation","*European","*society","*lung","injury","gene","lung injury","sheep","fetus","human","lung dysplasia","fetus lung","infant","trachea","surgery","gestational age","ewe","autopsy","early response gene","model","prematurity","gene expression","messenger RNA","interleukin 6","interleukin 8","metallothionein","urokinase receptor","interleukin 1"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"40","number":"SUPPL. 56\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"N.

Method(s): Neonatal mice were exposed to 80% oxygen (O2) or room air (RA) for either 14 or 29 days. Lung histology was assessed using standard techniques. Comprehensive miRNA and mRNA profiling was performed using lung tissue from each group.

Functional significance was investigated using Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis for miRNA regulatory networks using the DAVID and MetaCore databases. Result(s): At both 14 and 29 days, the lungs of O2 mice displayed histological changes consistent with BPD. Between the two time points we identified 2,714 mRNAs and 66 miRNAs that were dynamically regulated by O2 exposure. All but one of the miRNAs were up-regulated. We identified 581 dynamically regulated, direct mRNA targets of these miRNAs by computational mapping in miRBase. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that hyperoxia modulated genes involved in a variety of lung developmental processes, including cell cycle, cell adhesion, inflammation and angiogenesis.

The p66Shc isoform has anti-mitogenic properties, regulates oxidative stress responses, and participates in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. It is also highly expressed in the canalicular but not the saccular or alveolar stages of mouse lung development, suggesting an important morphogenetic function. Moreover, p66Shc expression persists in the lungs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease that is induced by premature birth. However, constitutive p66Shc deletion yields no morphologic phenotype and the structure of the Shc gene precludes the development of an inducible isoform-specific knockout mouse. To elucidate its role in lung development, we microinjected Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) suspensions containing 6.6 nM isoform-specific p66Shc or nonsilencing siRNA into the tracheae of E12 mouse lungs. The lung explants were maintained in serum-free organ culture for three days, then subjected to morphometric analysis. To assess cellular proliferation and differentiation, sections were also immunostained for p66Shc; smooth muscle actin (SMA); proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); the proximal airway differentiation antigens Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10) and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1; and the alveolar surfactant proteins (SP) -A, B, and C. Explants injected with nonsilencing siRNA demonstrated specific epithelial uptake and normal morphological development relative to uninjected control explants. In contrast, explants injected with p66Shc siRNA had significantly increased lumenal crosssection areas, decreased branching, and increased epithelial proliferation (p<0.05 for all) as well as decreased epithelial p66Shc expression. Relative to controls, the expression of SP-B, SP-C, CC10, and TTF-1 were decreased by p66Shc knockdown. SP-A was not expressed in lungs transfected with either p66Shc or control siRNA, and SMA expression was not altered by p66Shc silencing. These data suggest that p66Shc attenuates epithelial proliferation while promoting both distal and proximal epithelial maturation during normal and pathological lung development.","group":"g1","id":"46949bde-d339-4b23-9667-716f9aa072c0","_showDetails":true},"4e8c9789-bb32-4c99-b888-40a7058c3bab":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71386185","title":"Impact of perinatal nutrition on kidney function at five years in very low birth-weight children","authors":["Rachel V.","Sorana G.","Aissata S.","Francis G.","Jean-Michel H."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*kidney function","*very low birth weight","*child","*human","*society","*nephrology","*nutrition","protein intake","newborn period","low birth weight","childhood","adulthood","kidney failure","multiple linear regression analysis","hypertension","model","monitoring","longitudinal study","control group","blood pressure","multivariate analysis","risk factor","albuminuria","glomerulus filtration rate","pregnancy","birth weight","lung dysplasia","gender","height","hyaline membrane disease","enterocolitis","urine","albumin"],"journal":"Pediatric Nephrology","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"9","publisher":"Springer Verlag","isbn":"0931-041X","address":"V.

Some symptoms may be diagnosed in childhood allowing a better monitoring. We aimed to determine the impact of perinatal factors on renal function in five year-old preterm-born children. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospective longitudinal study of preterm-born children followed-up from birth to five years. Neonatal renal function was evaluated weekly for one month. Then it was measured at four and five years. Five year-old full-term children (EDEN study) composed the control group. The primary outcome was renal function at five years: blood pressure (BP), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria. Multivariate analysis was performed with multiple linear regression models. Result(s): 168 children were included aged 5.1+/-0.1 years. 133 preterm-born children, born at (mean+/-SD): 29.2+/- 1.4 weeks gestation, birth-weight: 1216+/-336 grams; 35 full-term children aged five. Systolic BP (sBP) was 97.5+/- 7.1 mmHg in preterm-born children versus 92.2+/-8.1 mmHg in full-term controls, p=0.0001. In preterm-born children, sBP increased by (beta+/-sigma): 2.2+/-1.0 mmHg for each gram/kg increase in proteins/day on day 28, and decreased by -3.0+/- 1.4 in case of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, after adjustment on gender and height at five years. eGFR was 176.3+/- 37.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 at five in preterm-born children. It was significantly decreased when children had presented hyaline membrane disease or necrotising enterocolitis, respectively (beta+/-sigma): -17.6+/-6.7 and -25.7+/-10.4 mL/min/ 1.73 m2. eGFR at five was not associated with neonatal nutrition. Urine albumin/creatinine ratio was: 1.3+/-2.8 mg/ mmol in preterm-born children vs. 1.1+/-0.8 mg/mmol in full-terms. 14.4 % preterm-born children had an albumin ratio >2 mg/mmol vs. 11.1 % full-terms, p=0.7. Renal volume, absolute or relative, at five years was negatively correlated to protein intakes from day 14 onwards in the neonatal period: R=-0.69, p=0.006.

Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) can mitigate inflammation and aid tissue repair in fetal and adult lung disease. We hypothesised that hAECs would attenuate hyperoxia-induced changes to neonatal lung structure. Method(s): From birth, neonatal mice were exposed to hyperoxia (FiO2 = 85%) for 14 days. Mice were kept in climate-controlled chambers on a 12hour day/night cycle. Human AECs were administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection on days 5, 6 and 7. Controls were exposed to normoxia (FiO2 = 21%) and received IP saline replacement. Body weight was monitored every second day and lungs were collected on day 14 for assessment. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure resulted in reduced neonatal growth, pulmonary inflammation and altered lung structure. Human AECs significantly improved neonatal body weight, and significantly attenuated hyperoxia-induced changes to mean linear intercept, septal crest density, and associated altered gene expression of TGF-beta and PDGF-beta (all, p<0.05). However, mitigation of hyperoxia-induced changes to alveolar airspace volume, septal tissue volume, tissue-to-airspace ratio, collagen content and leukocyte infiltration was nonsignificant (all, p>=0.05).

Our objective was to determine for the first time early molecular pathways associated with fetal lung injury in the saccular stage of lung development, which is when BPD is thought to originate. Method(s): Ten chronically catheterized pregnant monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) at 118-125 days gestation (term=172 days) received choriodecidual inoculation of either: 1) Group B Streptococcus 1 x 106 colony forming units (n=5) or 2) saline (n=5). Cesarean section and fetal necropsy was performed 4 days after GBS or 7 days after saline infusion to collect tissues. RNA was extracted from fetal lungs and profiled by microarray. Statistical analysis focused on single genes and gene set analysis. Results were validated by RT-PCR (chorioamnion) and Luminex (AF). Result(s): Only two GBS animals developed early labor and chorioamnionitis with no cervical change in remaining animals. Despite uterine quiescence in most cases, fetal lung injury occurred in four GBS animals (intra-alveolar neutrophils, interstitial thickening) and was absent in controls. Significant elevations of AF cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-6) were detected in GBS versus controls (p<0.05). Lung injury was not directly caused by GBS, because GBS was undetectable (AF, fetal lungs) by culture and PCR. A total of 187 genes were differentially expressed in fetal lungs (p <0.05; fold change >2.0) with a striking upregulation of innate and adaptive immunity (e.g. IL-1beta, IL- 8, chemotaxis, dendritic cell antigen processing, T cell activation). Pathways critical for angiogenesis (ANGPT1, VEGF regulation), morphogenesis (WNT3), and cell survival (aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10) were downregulated. Conclusion(s): A transient choriodecidual infection may induce fetal lung injury without AF infection, chorioamnionitis or preterm labor. Our results provide a window for the first time into early molecular pathways disrupting fetal lung angiogenesis and morphogenesis before preterm labor occurs.","group":"g3","id":"9b68f588-204f-4849-86f1-a61089258755","_showDetails":true},"e3ea955f-e888-4dc3-95fd-81ca7a9bb6c7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71194437","title":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) causing idiopathic tachypnoea in newborn","authors":["Allgood C.","Edwards M.","Chin R.","Dunstan R.","Freelander M.","Morgan L.","Whitehall J."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*ciliary dyskinesia","*tachypnea","*newborn","*human genetics","*human","*society","*Australia and New Zealand","female","dextrocardia","pregnancy","periostitis","hyperbilirubinemia","eukaryotic flagellum","resuscitation","male","pathogenesis","hyaline membrane disease","mother","patent ductus arteriosus","retrolental fibroplasia","mucus","Apgar score","arm","boy","gene","patent foramen ovale","microscopy","air conditioning","echocardiography","rubella","stenosis","mutation","situs inversus","plasma","phototherapy","blood","bodily secretions","patient","autosomal recessive disorder","urine","syphilis","cholestasis","positive end expiratory pressure","heart atrium septum defect","Human immunodeficiency virus","dynein adenosine triphosphatase","oxygen","galactose 1 phosphate uridylyltransferase"],"journal":"Twin Research and Human Genetics","language":"English","volume":"15","number":"4","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","isbn":"1832-4274","address":"C.

Previously, it was reported that high-dose DXM leads to deteriorated quality of general movements (GMs). We determined neurological functioning in infants after low-dose DXM treatment, assessed by the GM-quality until three months post term. Methods We included preterm infants, admitted to our NICU between 2010-2012 and treated with DXM (starting dose 0.25 mg/ kg/d). GM-quality was assessed before (day 0), during and after treatment until three months post term. We determined the change in GM-quality by comparing the GM-quality of day 0 with the GMquality of the last video recording. Additionally, we calculated a motor optimality score (MOS), ranging from 8 (low optimality) to 18 (high optimality). Results Sixteen infants were included [median GA 26.9 wks (25.0-29.7); BW 800 g (620-1665)]. Before treatment, 4 infants had normal GMs which remained normal after starting treatment. GM-quality improved in 8 of 12 initially abnormal infants (Mc Nemar; P=0.008), whilst MOS slightly increased: median 10.5, 12.0 and 12.5 on days 0, 1 and 7, respectively (NS). Cumulative DXM doses, treatment duration and postnatal ages at starting DXM were not associated with change in GM-quality. Infants whose GMs improved were ventilated for a shorter period than infants whose GMs remained the same quality (P=0.065). Conclusions GM-quality did not deteriorate after DXM treatment but rather improved in infants with initial abnormal GMs. Our findings suggest that neurological functioning until three months post term is not adversely affected after low-dose DXM.","group":"g1","id":"f7522ec5-d4fa-4584-adf6-239bf0357381","_showDetails":true},"1bfbc5b4-cddd-4ce6-9d6d-18b414ed1eb3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71062533","title":"Oxygen dependence is associated with supply protein offers at first 35 days of life for preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Moraes-Barbosa A.","Pacheco H."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*infant","*human","*prematurity","*lung dysplasia","*organization","newborn","weight","baby","Brazil","nutritional status","*protein","*oxygen","amino acid"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"97","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"A.

Results Hyperoxia significantly upregulated peroxiredoxin 6 expression compared to room air exposed newborn mice. Treatment with MnTBAP downregulated the expression of myeloperoxidase and Prdx6-rs1. Hyperoxia downregulated the expression of angiogenic genes such as angiopoietin 1 & 2, TGF 1, TGF 3 and HGF; MnTBAP treatment during the hyperoxia exposure reversed this effect and these genes were upregulated.

We evaluate the association of in utero smoking (IUS) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) with the respiratory events of BPD and non-BPD children. Two hundred sixty-two children born before 35 weeks of gestational age (GA) and regularly followed up in our regional network for preterms were enrolled. They were paired according to their BPD status, their gestational age and birth weight (131 children with BPD and 131 without BPD, 28 mean weeks GA; mean weight 1000 g). Respiratory data were obtained prospectively during their first 2 years of life. A complementary questionnaire was completed by the parents about their child's respiratory health at the age of 2, their home environment, and tobacco status. IUS concerned 12.6 %; ETS, 48.8 % (67 % in BPD children treated with oxygen at home). No further influence on respiratory outcome could be found by exposure to intrauterine smoke or extrauterine tobacco smoke in this patient sample., CONCLUSION: IUS and ETS exposures are as high in preterm children as in a general pediatric population. The highest exposure occurs among BPD infants treated with oxygen at home., WHAT IS KNOWN: * Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and in utero smoking (IUS) are responsible for many morphological, functional, and clinical changes in children. * Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have more respiratory events in their first years of life than preterm children without BPB, maybe triggered by ETS and IUS. What is New: * The exposition to ETS and IUS is high in preterm children with and without BDP, as high as in a general. * Pedaitric population, particularly in children with BPD and treated with oxygen at home. * No further influence on respiratory outcome could be found by exposure to ETS or IUS in our studied population.","group":"g1","id":"e96c7210-f5b4-47a8-b671-e48d3ad514b9","_showDetails":true},"b9caece6-3581-4459-8f18-371a94b17373":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71062315","title":"A double blind, randomized controlled trial on the resuscitation of preterm infants with 30% versus 65% oxygen at birth","authors":["Rook D.","Vlaardingerbroek H.","Schierbeek H.","Van Der Eijk A.C.","Escobar J.","Longini M.","Buonocore G.","Vento M.","Van Goudoever J.B.","Vermeulen M.J."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*human","*resuscitation","*randomized controlled trial","*infant","*prematurity","*organization","oxidative stress","survival","plasma","oxidation","lung dysplasia","heart rate","oxygen saturation","birth weight","*oxygen","protein","marker","iron","DNA"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"97","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"D.

Human milk as early enteral feeding has trophic effects on the gastrointestinal tract and shows anti-infectious properties. The requirements of growth and organ development create a challenge in nutritional management of newborn infants, especially preterms and those with additional disorders, such as intestinalfailure, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and sepsis. Nutritional support improves outcome in critically ill infants but is affected by fluid restriction, metabolic derangements, gastric intolerance and feeding interruptions. Few studies compare more critically ill infants with less critically ill infants as far as nutritional support during the initial weeks of life looking at growth and rates of adverse outcomes. Accordingly, the influence of critical illness on the risk of adverse outcomes seems to be mediated by energy intakes during the first week of life (Pediatr Res 2011; 69:522). Changes in amounts and ratios of protein and energy, fat quality (medium chain triglycerides, oleic acid and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids through parenteral nutrition), maintaining normoglycemia during full or partial parenteral nutrition, shortand medium term effects of either parenteral or enteral glutamine supplementations, daily supplemental zinc, rate of feeding advancements and avoidance of postnatal growth retardation represent the main items whose roles in critically ill preterm infants have been considered so far.

Methods Using an inducible double transgenic mouse line (SPC-rtTA; tet(O)Fgf10) we established a BPD model by exposing the pups to 85% oxygen (experimental and control group) and normoxia (control group) for 28 days. Activation of the transgene Fgf10 was done after birth (P0) by doxycycline treatment. Gene expressions for Fgfr2b and Fgf10 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. To study lung morphology histology, mean linear intercept (MLI) and radial alveolar count (RAC) were performed. Results Real-time PCR results showed a significant decrease of Fgfr2b and Fgf10 expression in the hyperoxia group at day 21 and day 28 indicating epithelial cell damages. The histology showed a simplification of alveoli in the hyperoxia group (85% oxygen) but not in the normoxia group after 14 days. In contrast, the hyperoxia group with overexpression of Fgf10 showed less simplification of alveoli. These findings were confirmed by MLI and RAC. Conclusion We conclude that Fgf10 may have a protective/regenerative effect on lung injury by increasing secondary septa formation.","group":"g1","id":"f5d8903a-bdaa-44ac-879b-6f119d4f081c","_showDetails":true},"e4dacd73-8436-48fe-afb5-abae5aacf596":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71062103","title":"Clues for the neurodevelopmental prognosis of the high risk preterm and term newborns","authors":["Gucuyener K."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*prognosis","*risk","*newborn","*organization","survivor","birth weight","childhood","seizure","necrotizing enterocolitis","neurologic disease","visual impairment","cerebral palsy","brain hemorrhage","gestational age","lung dysplasia","infant","retrolental fibroplasia","hyperactivity","hearing impairment","anxiety","attention deficit disorder","pregnancy","feeding","academic achievement","cognition","school","congenital malformation","brain injury","home environment","early intervention","extremely low birth weight","nuclear magnetic resonance imaging"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"97","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"K.

Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome.

In humans and rats, alveolar formation depends on the transcriptional regulator, PPARgamma. We demonstrated that IUGR decreases PPARF expression in the newborn rat lung. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is an important downstream target of PPARgamma in the lung. SCD catalyzes the rate-limiting step in synthesis of palmitoleic acid (C16:1). Palmitoleic acid contributes to surfactant synthesis and alveolar formation. However, the effect of IUGR on SCD and palmitoleic acid levels in the rat lung is unknown. We hypothesize that IUGR will decrease SCD and palmitoleic acid levels in newborn rat lung compared to control lung. Methods Used: IUGR was induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation in the rat. SCD mRNA levels were measured in lung tissue harvested at birth (d0) from IUGR and control rat pups. Lung fatty acid composition of both IUGR and control rat pups was determined by gas chromatography. Summary of Results: IUGR decreased mRNA transcript levels of SCD (58.0 +/- 0.4*) in d0 rat lung compared to controls. IUGR also decreased palmitoleic acid levels in d0 rat lung when compared to controls (78.3 +/- 1.1%*). P<0.01 Conclusion(s): We conclude that IUGR reduces both SCD mRNA levels as well as levels of a key SCD product, palmitoleic acid, in lung tissue of newborn rat pups. Interestingly, the observed change in mRNA and lipid levels parallels the observed change in PPARgamma expression in IUGR. We speculate that the down regulation of SCD and palmitoleic acid levels in IUGR is a result of direct action by PPARgamma on SCD transcription.","group":"g1","id":"62fe8fbd-3c77-422b-b847-9cd533430c48","_showDetails":true},"c8c7a559-283a-49f2-a363-1b7ff54ebc9c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70983054","title":"Curcumin blocks hyperoxia-induced pulmonary alveolar type II cell and lipofibroblast apoptosis","authors":["Villarreal P.","Sakurai R.","Li Y.","Torday J.","Rehan V.K."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*apoptosis","*medical research","exposure","protection","lung","Western blotting","DNA synthesis","immunofluorescence","cell proliferation","staining","in vitro study","lung injury","spice","lung dysplasia","fetus lung maturation","Sprague Dawley rat","in vivo study","cell type","Indian","rat","*curcumin","caspase 3","protein p53","turmeric","marker"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"60","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"P.

We have recently shown that curcumin, the Indian spice in turmeric, blocks hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. However, the underlying mechanism (s) and the cell-types involved in this protection are not fully known. Since curcumin has potent anti-apoptotic properties, we hypothesized that it blocks the hyperoxia-induced cellular apoptosis of both alveolar type II (ATII) cells and lipofibroblasts (LIF). Methods Used: Embyronic day 19 ATII cells and LIF were exposed to 21% or 95% O2 for 1-24h following 1h pretreatment with curcumin. Cell proliferation (thymidine incorporation) and apoptosis (Western blot analysis for p53, BcL-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3, and confocal immunofluorescence staining for caspase-3), were performed. For in vivo studies, 1-day old Sprague Dawley rat pups were exposed to: normoxia (21%O2), normoxia + curcumin (5 mg/kg BW), hyperoxia (7d exposure to 95%O2), or hyperoxia (7d exposure to 95%O2) + curcumin (5 mg/kg BW). Curcumin was administered i.p. once daily. At the end of the experimental period, the pups were sacrificed and the lungs analyzed for apoptosis markers by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Summary of Results: Initially, we established and in vitro hyperoxia exposure results in time-dependent decreases ATII cell and LIF proliferation, accompanied by an increase apoptosis. 1h curcumin (5 KM) pretreatment blocked the hyperoxia-induced decrease in cell proliferation (decrease in thymidine incorporation) and increase in cellular apoptosis (decrease in BcL-2/Bax ratio, and increases in cleaved caspase-3 and p53) in both ATII cells and LIFs. Similarly, parenteral curcumin administration blocked the in vivo hyperoxia-induced increase in ATII cell and LIF apoptosis. Further studies on the mechanistic basis for this curcumin-mediated protection against cellular apoptosis are in progress. Conclusion(s): Curcumin, in addition to its previously documented role of accelerating neonatal lung maturation, blocks the hyperoxia-induced increase in cellular apoptosis in both ATII cells and LIF, offering a potential mechanism for protection against Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"c8c7a559-283a-49f2-a363-1b7ff54ebc9c","_showDetails":true},"570ec415-363b-412c-9c80-5b48169b2d93":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70983050","title":"Macrophage polarization & bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Chan B.","Li A.","Lombardi V.","Geroge R.","Ramanathan R.","Akbari O.","Minoo P."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*macrophage","*polarization","*lung dysplasia","*medical research","human","mouse","newborn","lung alveolus macrophage","gene expression","female","Western blotting","bone marrow cell","tissue repair","lung","pregnancy","lung injury","prematurity","mating","inflammation","microenvironment","gestational age","tracheal aspiration procedure","phenotypic plasticity","flow cytometry","gene","genotype","transgenic mouse","tissues","animal model","receptor","transforming growth factor beta","protein","antibody","RNA"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"60","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"B.

Macrophages exhibit significant phenotypic plasticity. Depending on the microenvironment, they undergo \"polarization\" that either propagates inflammation (M1 polarized), or promotes tissue repair (M2 polarized). Little is known about lung macrophages in neonates and how TGFb impacts them. In this study we characterized polarization of macrophages obtained from the lungs of human premature neonates and determine their response to TGFb. To examine the mechanism, we generated & characterized transgenic mice that carry macrophage-specific homozygous inactivation of the gene for TGFb receptor II (TBRII). Methods Used: Tracheal aspirates (TA) was obtained from neonates born at various gestational ages. Macrophages were isolated and sorted by flow cytometry using antibodies specific for M1 or M2 polarization. Macrophages were treated with IL10 and gene expression was analyzed by Realtime-PCR. Macrophage-specific inactivation of TBRII was accomplished by mating between the Lyz22-cre driver line & TBRII flox/flox mice. TBRII inactivation was confirmed by genotyping and western blot. Macrophages from double-transgenic Lyz22-cre; TBRII flox/flox bone marrow cells were isolated and treated with M1 or M2 inducers. RNA and protein were quantified using Realtime-PCR & western blot analyses. Summary of Results: Macrophages from neonates born at <28 weeks gestation exhibited distinct dysregulation of IL10-induced M2 polarization. TGFb inhibited M2 polarization in human neonatal macrophages. IL4, an M2 inducer, activated M2 gene expression in WT mouse macrophages. Addition of TGFb inhibited IL4 induced polarization. TGFb upregulated M1 gene expression in WT mouse macrophages. Inactivation of TGFb receptor appeared to enhance M2 polarization of macrophages in response to IL4. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize lung macrophage polarization in human neonates. Our studies in genetically altered mice suggest that macrophage-specific inactivation of TBRII leads to M2-skewed polarization. Since M2 polarization is critical for tissue remodeling, further studies are underway to elucidate if TBRII deletion is protective against lung injury in BPD mouse models.","group":"g1","id":"570ec415-363b-412c-9c80-5b48169b2d93","_showDetails":true},"111f1249-9f48-42c9-82bc-b1a25df19498":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70982238","title":"Sex differences in hyperoxic lung injury: Role of cytochrome p450 (CYP) 1a and inflammation","authors":["Lingappan K.","Jiang W.","Wang L.","Couroucli X.I.","Moorthy B."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung injury","*inflammation","*medical research","*sex difference","female","mouse","hyperoxia","male","human","lung","exposure","infant","prematurity","injury","wild type","modulation","gene","neutrophil","liver","newborn","hypothesis","lung dysplasia","respiration control","morbidity","assay","breathing","immunohistochemistry","experimental animal","histopathology","gender","weight","*cytochrome","*cytochrome P450","messenger RNA","enzyme","protein","apoprotein","ethoxyresorufin deethylase"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"60","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"K.

Hyperoxia contributes to lung injury in experimental animals and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. CYP1A enzymes attenuate hyperoxic lung injury. Whether CYP1A enzymes play a role in gender differences is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that mice will display sex-specific differences in hyperoxic lung injury, and that this phenomenon will be altered in mice lacking the genes for CYP1A1 or 1A2. Methods Used: 8 week-old male and female (C57BL/6J) mice; wild type (WT), Cyp1a1-null, and Cyp1a2-null mice were exposed to 72 hours of hyperoxia (FiO2>0.95). Lung injury was estimated by lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios, lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Pulmonary and hepatic CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 activities were determined by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyresorufin O-deethylase (MROD) assays, respectively. Apoprotein levels were determined byWestern blotting, and mRNA levels by RT-PCR. TNF-alpha mRNA expression was quantified by RT-PCR. Summary of Results: Upon exposure to hyperoxia, WT males showed a greater increase in LW/BWratios, compared to air-breathing controls, and more pulmonary perivascular and alveolar injury, neutrophil infiltrates and TNF-alpha mRNA expression than females. Analysis of liver microsomal proteins showed higher CYP1A2 level and activity in WT females compared to WT males and a greater induction in CYP1A2 mRNA levels in WT females after hyperoxia exposure. These findings were reversed in Cyp1a1- and Cyp1a2- null mice. Conclusion(s): The increased susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury of WT males compared to females and the reversal of effects in Cyp1a1- and 1a2- null mice indicates an important role for CYP1A in the sex-specific effects. Further studies to elucidate the role of CYP1A in the gender specific modulation of hyperoxic injury could explain the mechanisms underlying the better outcomes in female neonates.","group":"g1","id":"111f1249-9f48-42c9-82bc-b1a25df19498","_showDetails":true},"f84b2a60-7bf6-4511-83f8-6dd354a8c433":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Conditional overexpression of TGFbeta1 promotes pulmonary inflammation, apoptosis and mortality via TGFbetaR2 in the developing mouse lung.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12931-014-0162-6","authors":["Sureshbabu, Angara","Syed, Mansoor A","Boddupalli, Chandra Sekhar","Dhodapkar, Madhav V","Homer, Robert J","Minoo, Parviz","Bhandari, Vineet"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150116//","keywords":["Acute Lung Injury/ge [Genetics]","*Acute Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Acute Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Acute Lung Injury/pp [Physiopathology]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Apoptosis","Disease Models, Animal","Genotype","Humans","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Transgenic","Phenotype","Pneumonia/ge [Genetics]","*Pneumonia/me [Metabolism]","Pneumonia/pa [Pathology]","Pneumonia/pp [Physiopathology]","Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/df [Deficiency]","Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/ge [Genetics]","*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/me [Metabolism]","Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II","Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/df [Deficiency]","Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/ge [Genetics]","*Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/me [Metabolism]","Signal Transduction","Time Factors","*Transforming Growth Factor beta1/bi [Biosynthesis]","Transforming Growth Factor beta1/ge [Genetics]","Up-Regulation"],"journal":"Respiratory research","volume":"16","isbn":"1465-9921","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25591994"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have reported that transforming growth factor beta 1(TGFbeta1) is a critical mediator of hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) in developing lungs, leading to impaired alveolarization and a pulmonary phenotype of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

We hypothesized that TGFbeta1 signaling via TGFbetaR2 is necessary for the pathogenesis of the BPD pulmonary phenotype resulting from HALI., METHODS: We utilized lung epithelial cell-specific TGFbeta1 overexpressing transgenic and TGFbetaR2 null mutant mice to evaluate the effects on neonatal mortality as well as pulmonary inflammation and apoptosis in developing lungs. Lung morphometry was performed to determine the impaired alveolarization and multicolor flow cytometry studies were performed to detect inflammatory macrophages and monocytes in lungs. Apoptotic cell death was measured with TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry and western blotting and protein expression of angiogenic mediators were also analyzed., RESULTS: Our data reveals that increased TGFbeta1 expression in newborn mice lungs leads to increased mortality, macrophage and immature monocyte infiltration, apoptotic cell death specifically in Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), impaired alveolarization, and dysregulated angiogenic molecular markers., CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated the potential role of inhibition of TGFbeta1 signaling via TGFbetaR2 for improved survival, reduced inflammation and apoptosis that may provide insights for the development of potential therapeutic strategies targeted against HALI and BPD.","group":"g1","id":"f84b2a60-7bf6-4511-83f8-6dd354a8c433","_showDetails":true},"2b73279a-120a-4c2f-9bcb-7c604fc9a40a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70936192","title":"Comparison of the general movement assessment and the test of infant motor performance with cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in very low birthweight infants","authors":["Peyton C.","Adde L.","Yang E.","Schreiber M.D.","Fjortoft T.","Msall M.E."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*infant","*nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","*very low birth weight","*cerebral palsy","*motor performance","human","child","gestational age","neuroimaging","birth weight","brain hemorrhage","prematurity","gray matter","risk","newborn morbidity","videorecording","laser surgery","cohort analysis","necrotizing enterocolitis","lung dysplasia","motoneuron","pathology","intensive care unit","newborn intensive care","motor development","brain","white matter","high risk infant","motor dysfunction","early intervention","retrolental fibroplasia","study design","classification","tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase","oxygen"],"journal":"Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology","language":"English","volume":"54","number":"SUPPL. 6","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","isbn":"0012-1622","address":"C.

The analysis of general movements (GMs), and fidgety movements (FMs) in particular, in the infant under 5 months post-term age has been reported to predict the development of cerebral palsy with a high degree of certainty. Cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans at near term have improved our understanding of the preterm brain and have been found to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age. Our objective was to describe early motor development of high risk preterm infants using GMs and the Test of Infant Motor Profile (TIMP) at 10 to 15 weeks post term after neuroimaging at term. Design(s): Prospective cohort study design of very preterm infants. Participants and Setting: Ten infants who were born at <=31 weeks gestational age, with a birthweight <1500 g, and required oxygen at birth were recruited from a regional neonatal intensive care unit. Materials/Methods: The infants received a cerebralMRI scan on a 3T Phillips Achievea MRI using a SENSE MRI coil array at term age equivalent.MRIs were scored using a standardized system by an experienced pediatric neuroradiologist masked to neonatal morbidities. Scores were given for white and gray matter pathology as well as cerebellar volume. Video recordings at 10 to 15 weeks post term age were classified based on absent or present FMs and the Assessment of Motor Repertoire (AMR) using Prechtl's approach. The TIMP Version 5 was administered at the same session as the video recordings by an experienced, credentialed testermasked to neonatal and neuroimaging status. Result(s): Of the 10 infants only one had an unscathed neonatal profile characterized as birthweight (BW) >1000 g, Gestational age (GA) >28 weeks, and absence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) requiring laser surgery. Overall four children had BPD, one child had NEC and IVH grade 3, and 1 child had severe ROP requiring laser surgery. Only one child had an abnormal performance on the TIMP and 50% had absent fidgety movements. Further results are shown in Table 1. No child was receiving early intervention services. Conclusions/Significance: Motor impairments in the first 5 months of life are not reliably predicted by birthweight, gestational age, neonatal morbidities, or neuroimaging metrics at term. The classification of FMs and AMR total optimality score, not TIMP, detected more motor risk in these vulnerable children. Further studies are required to determine the relationship between neuroimaging, early motor assessments and long term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

However, oxygen overload may induce injury or other diseases. For the past decades, several diseases in preterm infants, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity, have been correlated with hyperoxia. Vascular endothelial cells are one of the major targets of hyperoxic injury. Hyperoxia increases cell apoptosis and suppresses cell functions, such as angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor production. Rg1, the key component in Ginseng, has been demonstrated to promote the function of cultured vascular endothelial cell in proliferation, angiogenesis and protein production in previous research. Aim(s): To study the effect of Ginsenoside-Rg1 on cell survival and VEGF production in vascular endothelial cells under hyperoxia. Method(s): In this study, various concentrations of Rg1 were administrated to the medium of vascular endothelial cells cultured under 60% oxygenation. Cell functions were evaluated in 72 h duration. Result(s): The results showed that 60% oxygenation will suppress cell survival and function, but the Rg1 receptor protein was not decreased. Rg1 was able to increase vascular endothelial growth factor production in the first 24 h under hyperoxia. However, no obvious effect was found in the production of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase or phosphor-Akt. Rg1 could improve cell survival and increase vascular endothelial growth factor production of cells under hyperoxic condition. However, some effects of Rg1 were suppressed, which appeared to be mediated through the Akt pathway. Conclusion(s): Rg1 may be useful in preventing some of the hyperoxic injury. However, further study on its mechanism should be performed.","group":"g1","id":"e03ca5f0-4930-4b65-adcb-7877b1643272","_showDetails":true},"79c49a12-ab24-4409-b876-e8f22b23a1e5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70923793","title":"Inhibition of Cox-2 decreases macrophage infiltration in newborn hyperoxic lung injury","authors":["Rogers L.K.","Velten M.","Tipple T.E.","Britt R.D."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*macrophage","*newborn","*lung injury","*society","hyperoxia","mouse","human","lung parenchyma","prematurity","infant","risk","lung dysplasia","mass spectrometry","leukocyte","tissue section","lung lavage","ambient air","chronic lung disease","metabolite","lung","*free radical","protein","celecoxib","acetylsalicylic acid","prostaglandin E2","antibody","prostaglandin","cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor","chemokine"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"53","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"L.K.

Method(s): Newborn pups were injected daily with vehicle, 10 mg/kg ASA or 5 mg/kg celecoxib while exposed to room air (RA) or hyperoxia for 14 days. On day 14, mice were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissues were collected. Protein concentrations, and KC and MCP-1 protein levels were assessed in BAL. Macrophage numbers were determined in a blinded fashion in tissue sections immunohistochemically stained with F4/80 antibodies. Prostaglandin (PG) products of Cox-2 were measured by mass spectrometry. Result(s): Protein concentrations, and KC and MCP-1 protein levels in BAL were significantly increased in hyperoxia-exposed control mice when compared to RA controls. ASA treatment (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced protein concentrations and MCP-1 levels in the BAL. Both ASA and celecoxib treatment decreased macrophage numbers in lung tissues and the levels of PGE2, PGD2, and PGD2 metabolites PGJ2, 15-deoxyPGJ2, and 13,14- dihydro-15-keto PGD2 in BAL.

Inflammation is one of the primary processes underlying BPD. Recruitment and subsequent activation of macrophages in the lung is mainly controlled by MCP-1/CC chemokine receptor 2 signaling pathway. The role of CC chemokines and angiogenesis has not been extensively studied in the course of BPD. We hypothesized that hyperoxiainduced lung injured CCL-2deficient mice show increased alverolarization thereby promoting alveolar growth and pulmonary protection during hyperoxic injury. Method(s): Time-dated pregnant C57BL/6J (WT) and CCL-2-/- female dams were allowed to deliver spontaneously. On postnatal (PN) day 3, neonatal mice were divided into four groups: 1) WT- 21% oxygen (n=5); 2) CCL-2-/- 21% oxygen (n=5) 3) WT-75% oxygen (n=5); 2) CCL-2-/- 75% oxygen (n=5). Body weight, survival and lung architecture, capillary density, histopathology and inflammation were studied at PN 14 days. Lung angiogenesis and inflammation markers were assessed by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Result(s): Hyperoxia adversely affected the survival and growth of neonatal mice (both p<0.01). CCL-2-/- show an increase in survival and growth compared with WT hyperoxic exposed animals (p<0.02) Morphometric analysis revealed significant decrease in mean linear intercept, an index of airspace size, indicating hyperalveolarization (p<0.01) in CCL-2-/- compared to age-matched WT hyperoxic control at 14days. Expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) were upregulated under hyperoxic conditions. However, CCL-2-/- exposed to hyperoxia showed a significant decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA levels. Hyperoxia decreased the VEGF-A/B expression in WT- hyperoxic mice compared to age-matched control. Conversely, absence of CCL-2 augments not only the production of VEGF-A/B under hyperoxic insult but also increases capillary density compared to oxygen-exposed group. Conclusion(s): We show that CCL-2deficiency may attenuate vascularization by decreasing the production of antiangiogenic mediators in vivo. We speculate that MCP-1/CCL2 signaling maybe protective against hyperoxia-indced lung injury by inducing angiogenic markers and consequently inhibiting the production of activated proinflammatory mediators.","group":"g3","id":"140fdae5-dcb6-42ab-b800-6b07fabf0967","_showDetails":true},"003061f3-40a2-4132-b519-c0b45374db00":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70890842","title":"Hyperoxia regulates the degradation of the circadian protein Rev-Erba: Implications for cytoprotection","authors":["Hinson M.D.","Biswas C.","La P.","Yang G.","Dennery P.A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*cell protection","*society","*lung","myofibroblast","mutant","injury","secretion (process)","cell proliferation","effluent","adipocyte","lung dysplasia","phosphorylation","apoptosis","immunofluorescence","phenotype","cell differentiation","microenvironment","pathogenesis","mouse","Western blotting","steady state","mesenchymal stem cell","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","*free radical","*Rev protein","interleukin 1","broxuridine","caspase 3","interleukin 6","protein","2 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 3 (1 methyl 3 indolyl)maleimide","messenger RNA","cytokine"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"53","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"P.A.

The role of Rev-ERBa in myofibroblast differentiation is not known. Our objective was to evaluate whether Rev- ERBa inhibits myofibroblast differentiation in mouse neonatal lung-mesenchymal (MLg)-progenitor cells and protects against hyperoxic injury. Method(s): Rev-ERBa WT and phosphorylation defective mutant degradation resistant (SD: 55/59 Ser to Asp) MLg cells were exposed to 95%O2/5%CO2 (hyperoxia) or air/5%CO2 (normoxia) for 0-24 hours. In other experiments, cells were pre-incubated with SB216763, an inhibitor of GSK3b to prevent Rev-ERBa degradation. Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorporation and p21 mRNA levels. Cell differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype was assessed by measuring aSMA immunofluorescence. Apoptosis was evaluated with caspase-3 activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1b and IL-6) were evaluated in the effluent media using ELISA. Cellular steady-state lmRNA and protein levels of Rev-ERBa and p-GSK3b, were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Result(s): MLg-WT cells exposed to hyperoxia had increased Akt/kinase activity, increased levels of pGSK3b protein and significantly decreased Rev-ERBa protein levels,. This was associated with decreased BrdU incorporation and increased p21 mRNA levels. Immunoreactive aSMA and caspase-3 activity were also increased, as was IL-1b and IL-6 secretion. In contrast, Rev-ERBa levels remained stable in the SD mutants and in the cells pre-incubated with SB216763. This was associated with increased BrdU incorporation, decreased p21 as well as decreased immunoreactive aSMA, caspase-3 activity and IL-1b and IL-6 secretion in hyperoxia.

Dexamethasone (DEXA), a glucocorticoid (GC), has been shown to induce ABCB1 expression in enterocytes and hepatocytes. However, no data exists in placental cells neither for DEXA nor for betamethasone (BETA) and prednisone (PRED), while these GCs are used during pregnancy. We investigated the modulation of placental ABC transporter and nuclear receptor expression by these drugs. Placentas from normal full-term pregnancies were obtained and cytotrophoblasts isolated. We first assessed the influence of cell differentiation on transporter and nuclear receptor gene expression by taking samples of cytotrophoblasts after 24, 48 and 72 h of cell culture (n = 7 placentas). Then, incubations were conducted with DEXA, BETA and PRED vs. no drug for 24 h (n = 6). mRNA expression was quantified by qRT-PCR. No influence of syncytialisation was observed, except for ABCB1, ABCC2 and ABCC5 expression between t = 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). DEXA (50, 200 nM, 1 muM) and BETA (20, 100, 400 nM) significantly induced ABCB1 gene expression by around 4-fold (3.54 +/- 1.79, 3.96 +/- 2.49 and 3.82 +/- 1.82, P < 10-2 for DEXA and 3.42 +/- 1.59, 3.97 +/- 2.83, 4.16 +/- 2.64, P < 10-3 for BETA, respectively). However, BETA decreased GR mRNA amount by 4-22% (0.96 +/- 0.20, 0.78 +/- 0.13 and 0.84 +/- 0.06, respectively; P < 10-2). Conversely, PRED showed no effect on transporter or receptor expression. As a conclusion, we showed that DEXA and BETA, which are in particular administered to women at risk of preterm birth to prevent hyaline membrane disease, can induce ABCB1 expression in the human placental barrier. Given ABCB1 apical localization, its induction may potentiate the efflux of its substrates when co-administered with GCs, entailing variable drug exposure for the fetus. This altered transfer may be protective for the fetus, notably when the mother needs to receive anticancer drugs. However, it may conversely be deleterious in particular cases in which fetal exposure is wanted, like in the prevention of HIV mother-tochild transmission.","group":"g1","id":"3071912a-0151-4275-b822-6b83d255f60b","_showDetails":true},"5ba20553-bbe3-4043-bff8-50c5869855bb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70866283","title":"Design of a neonatal intervention based on joint evaluation of efficacy and toxicity","authors":["Watterberg K.","Higgins R.","Das A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*society","*clinical trial (topic)","*toxicity","safety","risk","human","death","sample size","hypothesis","morbidity","nerve cell differentiation","lung dysplasia","side effect","extubation","procedures","artificial ventilation","risk factor","model","prematurity","confidence interval","dose calculation","hydrocortisone","dexamethasone"],"journal":"Clinical Trials","language":"English","volume":"9","number":"4","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","isbn":"1740-7745","address":"K.

However, the overall clinical effect often involves efficacy and adverse safety or side effect trade-offs. While joint efficacy and safety endpoints have often been used for Phase II dose finding studies, such approaches have found limited application in Phase III trials. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading morbidity in extremely preterm infants, and prolonged mechanical ventilation increases BPD risk. Dexamethasone can facilitate extubation and decrease BPD incidence, but risk of neurodevelopment impairment (NDI) has led to decreased use. Because preliminary evidence suggests a better long-term safety profile for hydrocortisone than for dexamethasone, we designed a Phase III trial to sequentially evaluate the composite hypothesis that hydrocortisone (a) reduces the risk of death or BDP at 36 weeks; and (b) has an acceptable safety profile for death or NDI at 18 to 22 months. For the two- stage evaluation using robust Poisson models, we will first estimate relative risk and test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone lowers risk of death or BPD. If this test shows benefit, we will evaluate safety descriptively with safety considered achieved if either (1) the point estimate of risk of death/NDI is lower for hydrocortisone, or (2) death/NDI risk for hydrocortisone is increased, but the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the ratio of death/BPD benefit to death/NDI risk is greater than 4. We describe procedures used for power and sample size calculations for this two- stage testing approach, present results from those calculations, and compare operating characteristics of this approach to one previously reported that involves joint testing of the bivariate death/BPD and death/NDI outcomes using extensions of methods described by Tournoux.","group":"g1","id":"5ba20553-bbe3-4043-bff8-50c5869855bb","_showDetails":true},"9a990653-3498-4d7f-bfdb-b9bac9dd2966":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70857539","title":"The hyperoxia-mediated decrease in tenascin-C in fetal lung fibroblasts inhibits cell migration","authors":["DeCoux A.","Chaplin J.","Wilson G.","Benjamin J.","Gebb S."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*fetus lung","*lung fibroblast","*cell migration","fibroblast","exposure","lung","myofibroblast","lung dysplasia","protein expression","hypothesis","cell adhesion","*tenascin","protein C","protein","fibronectin","adhesive agent","scleroprotein"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"26","number":"Meeting Abstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"0892-6638","address":"A.

Although various strategies have been reported, prevention of BPD still remains elusive. CDP-choline is an endogenous intermediate in the biosynthesis of phospatidylcholine, a major constituent of surfactant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive effect of CDP-choline treatment on hyperoxic lung injury and apoptosis in a neonatal rat model of BPD. Method(s): A total of 30 newborn pups were arranged in 3 groups: control, hyperoxia, and hyperoxia+CDP-choline. Ten hours after birth, pups in the control group were kept in room air containing 21% O2 and received daily saline injections, while those in hyperoxia and hyperoxia+CDPcholine groups were exposed to 95% O2 and received daily injections of saline and CDP-choline (300 mg/kg) throughout postnatal day 10, respectively. Histopathological scoring, radial alveolar count, lamellar protein count, fibrosis and apoptosis (TUNEL) evaluation was performed on the lung samples obtained on the 10th day. In addition, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and malonedialdehyde (MDA) content in lung tissues were determined. Result(s): Hyperoxia induced severe lung damage which was reduced significantly by CDP-choline treatment as indicated by histological grading. Masson's trichrome stained sections showed cell infiltration, oedema and fibrosis in the hyperoxia group, but not in the control or hyperoxia+CDP-choline group. Radial alveolar count and lamellar protein count were significantly recovered, while number of TUNEL positive cells was significantly decreased by CDP-choline treatment. Moreover, activities of tissue GSH-Px and SOD were preserved, whereas tissue MDA content and MPO activities were significantly reduced in hyperoxia+CDPcholine group compared to those in hyperoxia group. Conclusion(s): This is the first study that reported prevention by CDPcholine treatment of hyperoxic lung injury in a neonatal rat model of BPD. Intraperitoneal CDP-choline administration significantly improved histopathological lung injury, preserved alveolarisation, and decreased both fibrosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, CDP-choline decreased lipid peroxidation and oxidant status, while increasing antioxidant status. These data suggest that, CDP-choline may be used as an effective therapeutic agent for prevention of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"a7d14fda-c96c-427f-b88b-ce5f21fcdbc6","_showDetails":true},"b8eb669d-6f37-408d-82ad-514966503307":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Antioxidant response genes sequence variants and BPD susceptibility in VLBW infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2014.200","authors":["Sampath, Venkatesh","Garland, Jeffery S","Helbling, Daniel","Dimmock, David","Mulrooney, Neil P","Simpson, Pippa M","Murray, Jeffrey C","Dagle, John M"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20141217//","keywords":["*Antioxidant Response Elements/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Enzyme Induction/ge [Genetics]","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ge [Genetics]","*Genetic Variation/ge [Genetics]","Genotype","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Models, Genetic","NF-E2-Related Factor 2/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"77","number":"3","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25518008"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Lung injury resulting from oxidative stress contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis.

Our choice was based on some of the lesions most commonly found in children, or lesions concerned by a new classification. Respiratory distress in newborn infants can be related to numerous causes. Hyaline membrane disease, also called respiratory distress syndrome, remains one of the major causes of death in live-born infants. Hyaline membrane disease affects premature infants. It is the clinical expression of surfactant deficiency in neonates. Infants are usually symptomatic within minutes following birth. Neonates present with non-specific tachypnea, grunting and cyanosis. Classic radiologic findings are observed in untreated patients and reflect generalized acinar collapse. Chest radiograph demonstrates underaeration of the lungs and diffuse consolidation (fine granular appearance) with air bronchograms. Mechanical ventilation and exogenous surfactant therapy have modified the radiological appearance of the disease. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a long-term consequence of this disease. The incidence has not changed significantly, but the severity in infants born before 28 weeks of gestation is less important due to improved management and treatment. Pediatric diffuse lung disease, also called interstitial lung disease (ILD), encompasses a heterogeneous group of uncommon disorders characterized by impaired gas exchange and widespread pulmonary parenchymal pathology. It is now widely accepted that the idiopathic interstitial lung disease described in adults is not applicable to children. A new and specific pediatric classification was proposed in 2007 by the Child Research Cooperative group. This new classification is largely based on clinicopathologic findings. Radiologists must be aware of this classification so as to work with clinicians and pathologists and define characteristic imaging patterns. Genetic disorders of surfactant should be highlighted. They currently represent a well known cause of chronic diffuse lung disease in the neonatal period and childhood. Most frequent genetic defects involve adenosine triphosphate binding cassette A3 (ABCA3), surfactant protein B (SP-B), surfactant protein C (SP-C) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1). Congenital pulmonary malformations also represent a challenging topic. Their classification depends on investigators' specialties. Some investigators classify congenital pulmonary malformations according to embryological considerations (the lesions are defined as lesions of defective budding, differentiation and separation of the primitive foregut). Other investigators consider that congenital pulmonary malformations result from airway obstruction with secondary pulmonary dysplastic changes. Vascular theory has also been supported. Some authors have developed a very practical approach based on morphological findings in radiology and pathology. Three groups have been defined: parenchymal lesions, vascular lesions and a combination of both. Three malformations need highlighting: congenital lobar emphysema, congenital pulmonary airway malformations and pulmonary sequestrations. Congenital lobar emphysema may cause respiratory distress in the neonatal period. Classification of congenital pulmonary airway malformations, previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations, has been updated to include 5 types by Stocker 2002. This new classification highlights two points: the term \"adenomatoid\" should not be used any longer, as it refers to one of the 5 types only. Moreover, the term \"cystic\" refers to 3 types only (1, 2 and 4). Pulmonary sequestrations combine parenchymal and vascular lesions. They are classified into two types (intralobar and extralobar). They are mostly located in lower lobes. Children with intralobar sequestration usually present with recurrent infections in the lower lobes. Extralobar pulmonary sequestration is diagnosed during the neonatal period and presents as a lung mass. This malformation is characterized by a systemic arterial supply. The pulmonary tissue of intralobar pulmonary sequestration has roughly the same appearance as that of CPAM and up to 50% of extralobar pulmonary sequestrations are associated with type 2 CPAM. Pneumonia is a very frequent infection in children (more than 150 million pediatric cases reported each year, according to the estimation of the World Health Organization). Numerous types of infectious agents are responsible for pneumonia in children. The radiological findings are rarely specific. Frontal chest radiographs are frequently the only required imaging modality. The lateral view is useful for visualizing hilar lymph nodes. CT is useful in pulmonary complications, in case of tuberculosis or in immunocompromised children. Bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity in children younger than 2 years of age. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis. X-ray findings are related to a small airways obstruction (hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening, subsegmental atelectasis). Performing chest Xrays rarely impacts on the treatment and X-ray is recommended only for severe cases. Lung abscess is a complication of pneumonia. Lung abscesses used to be related to congenital pulmonary malformations with primitive lung abscesses being less frequent. Due to prenatal diagnosis, these malformations are now commonly treated before infectious complications occur. Recognizing the primitive nature of lung abscesses at diagnosis is challenging even when a chest CT is performed. In our experience, the CTshould be performed much later, after the acute episode, so as to detect an underlying pulmonary malformation. The prognosis of lung abscesses in children is usually good without sequelae. Pediatric tuberculosis remains a worldwide challenge. About 1 million annual cases occur in children younger than 15 years of age. The great majority (95%) of infected children will not develop the disease, and a disseminated form of the disease is more frequent in children younger than 2 years of age. The association between chronic pneumonia and hilar lymphadenopathies should raise suspicion for tuberculosis. Chests radiographs remain very effective for detecting parenchymal lesions and lymphadenopathies. CT is useful in case of equivocal chest X-ray, complicated presentation or disseminated disease. In immunocompromised children, chest CT is helpful for the evaluation of lung infection, particularly when X-ray does not contribute. CT findings in keeping with pulmonary fungal infection are characterized by nodules with poorly defined margins. Cavitation of the nodules and ground-glass opacity surrounding the nodules strongly suggest this diagnosis. Cavitation occurs in half of all cases and is characterized by the air-crescent sign. The halo sign is related to haemorrhage around a nodule or to inflammatory infiltration within the lung parenchyma. This sign may also be observed in other diseases such as viral infections and bacterial abscesses. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutation in the CFTR gene and remains the most common cause of pulmonary insufficiency in children. Low-dose high-resolution technique computed tomography is the technique of choice (the gold standard) for the evaluation of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. However, there are concerns about the cumulative radiation dose in these patients. MRI seems to be a valuable technique to replace CT in the near future for the evaluation of cystic fibrosis. Recently, an MR-scoring system based on morphological and functional data was suggested for annual follow up.","group":"g1","id":"2e50612c-3215-48eb-bdbf-95bbe8d83645","_showDetails":true},"5ee78aee-4b41-4b69-91e9-5446eb87a9d8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70821410","title":"Neonatal chest: What the neonatologist needs to know from the pediatric radiologist","authors":["Enriquez G."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*human","*radiologist","*radiology","*postgraduate student","*society","*thorax","lung","congenital malformation","patient","tube","diagnosis","newborn","respiratory distress","surgery","perforation","prematurity","esophagus atresia","adenomatoid tumor","pneumomediastinum","pneumothorax","feeding apparatus","emphysema","lymphangiectasis","rib","respiratory distress syndrome","nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","reading","patient positioning","trachea stenosis","thorax radiography","examination","atelectasis","lung disease","density","tissues","pharynx","muscle spasm","endotracheal tube","X ray tube","thymus","granuloma","stomach","agenesis","cystic adenomatoid malformation","conservative treatment","iatrogenic disease","esophagus","cardiomegaly","hypoplastic left heart syndrome","clavicle","heart injury","screening","infant","ultrasound","pneumonia","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","meconium aspiration","lymphangiomatosis","venous return","pulmonary vein","atresia","lymph vessel","positive end expiratory pressure","tachypnea","diaphragm hernia","nasogastric tube","hyaline membrane disease","supine position","X ray film","forelimb","lung malformation","vascularization","lung sequestration","aeration","solid","infection","lung hypoplasia","emergency surgery","congenital diaphragm hernia","differential diagnosis","newborn period","radiodiagnosis","surfactant"],"journal":"Pediatric Radiology","language":"English","volume":"42","number":"SUPPL. 3","publisher":"Springer Verlag","isbn":"0301-0449","address":"G.

Proper positioning of the patient and X-ray tube is extremely important to avoid a distorted chest image. Upward angulation of the tube can result in a bizarre configuration of the ribs, whereas lordotic patient positioning produces an abnormally prominent cardiac apex, simulating right ventricular hypertrophy. If the infant is rotated to one side the upper lung may appear hyperlucent and be misinterpreted as a pathologic finding. To ensure that the chest is not rotated, the operator should verify that the ribs and the medial borders of the clavicles are symmetrical. It is also essential to know that the features of films obtained in expiration often simulate cardiomegaly or increased lung density, mimicking pulmonary disease. Hence, the chest examination must be performed in appropriate inspiration, which can only be determined with the experience of reading numerous radiographs. The nasogastric tube is the chosen nutritional technique in premature infants. It is essential to check the position of feeding tubes because it can provide important diagnostic information regarding esophageal atresia and traumatic esophageal pseudodiverticulae. Inability to properly advance an oral tube may indicate esophageal atresia. Traumatic pharyngeal perforation should be suspected when the feeding tube is seen outside the esophagus in unexpected locations. These iatrogenic lesions can occur when the tube comes into contact with the fragile pharyngeal wall tissue, causing cricopharyngeal spasm and perforation. The endotracheal tube position should also be checked. Improperly positioned tubes can cause lobar or lung atelectasis or hyperaeration, or lead to long-term complications of tracheal stenosis or granuloma formation. Furthermore, visualization of the tracheobronchial tube in the stomach while the lungs are well aerated in a newborn is the key to establishing the diagnosis of tracheal agenesis. Clinical conditions leading to respiratory distress in the first days of life can be divided into two groups: those that can be treated medically and those requiring surgery. The radiologic patterns of several medical conditions, such as hyaline membrane disease, also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnea (TRDN), meconium aspiration and neonatal pneumonia, have been extensively reported. Ultrasound is particularly useful in the diagnosis of RDS and some authors speculate that it may serve as a screening method for early administration of surfactant in preterm infants with this condition. A huge increase in lung echogenicity (\"white lung\") is the US diagnostic hallmark. Pulmonary lymphangiectasis is a less common condition that also produces severe respiratory distress. It can occur as an isolated abnormality, as a part of generalized lymphangiectasis or associated with heart lesions (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, anomalous venous return or pulmonary vein atresia). The lymphatic vessels are dilated in this condition and appear as nodular or somewhat reticular images on plain films. Positive-pressure ventilation is often a part of the treatment for these conditions and related complications such as interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum can be recognized on plain films. The variety of air-leak patterns produced should not be interpreted as pulmonary malformations. Interstitial blebs can simulate lung adenomatoid malformation and air in the anterior portion of the chest seen in patients in supine position (\"anterior pneumothorax\") may simulate lobar emphysema. In patients with pneumomediastinum, air sometimes elevates the thymus, producing the so-called \"angel wings\" or \"spinnaker sail\" sign, simulating a mediastinal mass. Congenital lung malformations are usually detected prenatally, and most newborns are asymptomatic at birth and show normal chest plain films. To postnatally confirm the malformation, US, CT, or MRI should be performed. On US, an echogenic mass with systemic vascularization is seen in cases of pulmonary sequestration, whereas abnormal aeration with increased and heterogeneous parenchymal echogenicity is common in cystic adenomatoid malformation. In asymptomatic patients, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI can be performed later on (6-8 months) for complete characterization of the malformation. There is considerable debate in the literature on the management of patients with these congenital malformations. Most authors agree that solid sequestrations can regress spontaneously, and conservative management is recommended. However, cystic or hybrid lesions usually persist and may increase in size or develop infection; therefore surgical management may be more appropriate. Last, conditions causing respiratory distress in the neonatal period requiring surgery usually manifest on plain films as mediastinal displacement to the contralateral side. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a major surgical emergency in the newborn. The prenatal assessment, which mainly focuses on the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia and determines the postnatal management, is based on US and MRI study. In more severe cases, prenatal tracheal plug placement can be applied to increase the volume of the affected lung. The differential diagnosis of diaphragmatic hernia should be established, particularly with congenital adenomatoid malformation and pulmonary lymphangiomatosis.","group":"g1","id":"5ee78aee-4b41-4b69-91e9-5446eb87a9d8","_showDetails":true},"f069f4ba-4de6-4afc-9514-ddaf73d3b12a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70804197","title":"Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFB) signaling is required for distal lung development","authors":["Ahlfeld S.K.","Poindexter E.","Gao Y.","Wang J.","Conway S.J."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung development","transgene","lung structure","lung alveolus cell","pathogenesis","lung","lung dysplasia","chronic lung disease","prematurity","hyperoxia","lung alveolus epithelium","hypothesis","nursing","mare","model","oncogene c myc","density","morphogenesis","mouse","therapy","*transforming growth factor beta","doxycycline","transcription factor RUNX2","nonoxinol 9"],"journal":"Clinical and Translational Science","language":"English","volume":"5","number":"2","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing","isbn":"1752-8054","address":"S.K.

Using a hyperoxia model of BPD, we have observed decreased TGFB signaling coincident with the earliest evidence of BPD. Therefore, we genetically inhibited TGFB superfamily signaling in the lung epithelium during alveolar development to test the hypothesis that loss of TGFB signaling simplifies distal lung structure. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Neonatal mice carrying a Tet-On myc-tagged Smad7 transgene as well as a doxycycline-inducible SPC-rtTA were generated. At birth, nursing dams were given dox-feed continuously to activate the transgene and overexpress Smad 7 in Type II alveolar cells to inhibit TGFB signaling. At P14, distal lung structure was analyzed and compared to single transgenic (TetO-Smad7-/SPC-rtTA+) control pups. RESULTS/ ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Double transgenic pups had marked elevation of c-myc, indicating activation of the myc-tagged Smad7 transgene, and reduced expression of periostin, a downstream product of TGFB signaling. Distal lung structure was simplified with reduced septal development, as evidenced by a nearly 10% increase in mean linear intercept, 15% increase in airspace-to-septal ratio, and 15% decrease in nodal density. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Inhibition of TGFB signaling in Type II alveolar cells alone during postnatal distal lung morphogenesis sufficiently phenocopies the lung structural changes in BPD. These results indicate that loss of TGFB signaling during a critical window of saccular lung development may contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Understanding BPD pathogenesis will aid in designing appropriate therapies to treat and prevent BPD.","group":"g1","id":"f069f4ba-4de6-4afc-9514-ddaf73d3b12a","_showDetails":true},"b1224f12-bb16-4a36-bb40-5e951571c3ad":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70796609","title":"Pulmonary angiogenesis: Genetic association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Mahlman M.","Huusko J.","Hallman M."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*angiogenesis","*genetic association","*lung dysplasia","*workshop","infant","human","female","allele","pregnancy","population","hypothesis","gene","single nucleotide polymorphism","pathogenesis","biogenesis","patient","heredity","disease predisposition","twins","safety","risk","clinical trial","haplotype","*surfactant","vasculotropin A","vasculotropin receptor 2","vasculotropin","receptor"],"journal":"Neonatology","language":"English","volume":"101","number":"4","publisher":"S.

The vascular hypothesis states that the deficiency in biogenesis of alveoli is a prominent feature in pathogenesis. Formation of alveoli depends on normal pulmonary angiogenesis that is critically dependent on genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and its receptor, VEGFR-2. Our aim was to investigate whether the allelic variants of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 associate with predisposition to BPD. Patients and Methods: The study population consisted of 259 infants (61 cases with moderate or severe BPD) born in Oulu during 1997-2010. All infants were of the Finnish origin and were born before 31 weeks' gestation. An additional study population consisted of 110 infants (63 BPD cases) born in Helsinki during 1997-2003. Six VEGF-A and 25 VEGFR-2 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. Results were corrected for length of gestation and for multiple comparisons. Result(s): VEGF-A SNP rs3025000 associated with BPD with the minor allele T being overrepresented in BPD infants compared to their controls (32.8 vs. 22.8%, p < 0.05). VEGFR-2 SNP rs4576072 minor allele C was overrepresented in infants with BPD compared to controls (22.5 vs. 13.1%, p < 0.05) and a low-frequency VEGFR-2 6-SNP haplotype was overrepresented in BPD infants (4.2 vs. 0.2%). Significant associations between the alleles and BPD were also detected in infants born in Helsinki. Conclusion(s): We show evidence for the first time that the polymorphisms of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 influence susceptibility to BPD. This strengthens the vascular hypothesis of BPD. A clinical trial of VEGF in infants with very high-risk of BPD is not indicated until safety and efficacy are further proven.","group":"g1","id":"b1224f12-bb16-4a36-bb40-5e951571c3ad","_showDetails":true},"b31cd33e-0ea7-45ce-8a4c-f28dac24d9dc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70791939","title":"Impact of perinatal nutrition on kidney function at five years in very low birth-weight children","authors":["Vieux R.","Galu S.","Guillemin F.","Hascoet J.M."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*kidney function","*very low birth weight","*child","*human","*workshop","*neonatology","*nutrition","newborn period","protein intake","longitudinal study","hyaline membrane disease","pregnancy","height","lung dysplasia","gender","enterocolitis","urine"],"journal":"Journal of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"5","number":"2","publisher":"IOS Press","isbn":"1934-5798","address":"R.

Although supplemental oxygen is the most commonly used therapy, direct exposure to oxygen can damage the pulmonary epithelium through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To protect against ROS there are powerful defence mechanisms. The detoxification enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) is involved in the cellular response to oxidative damage. The encoding NQO1 gene is subject to an inactivating polymorphism, namely C609T, leading to a change in its aminoacid sequence. Individuals homozygous for the mutant allele (T/T) completely lack NQO1 activity, whereas heterozygotes (C/T) have low enzyme activity as compared to the wild type (C/C). Therefore, the mutant T allele may predispose neonates to BPD. The aim was to investigate the potential role of NQO1 inborn polymorphism in BPD susceptibility. Patients/methods: This case-report study enrolled 119 Greek premature neonates with gestational age U32 weeks. Of these 42 developed BPD (case group) and 77 did not developed BPD (control group). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of all neonates. The NQO1 genotype was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The NQO1 gene status was also evaluated in respect to gender. Result(s): A different distribution of NQO1 genotypes was found between BPD neonates and controls, with a higher frequency of variant genotypes (heterozygotes C/T and homozygotes T/T) in BPD population (50% in BPD vs. 28.6% in no BPD neonates, chi2 = 6.14; d.f. = 2; p = 0.046). Thus, a significantly higher frequency of the mutant T allele was observed in BPD neonates as compared to controls (0.27 vs. 0.17, chi2 = 3, 59; d.f. = 1; p = 0.058). According to gender, we observed no differences in the genotype frequencies. Discussion/conclusion: Our results provide evidence for a pathogenetic role of the NQO1 polymorphism on BPD occurrence. The higher incidence of the C/T and T/T variant genotypes among neonates who developed BPD suggests that the NQO1 C609T inborn polymorphism constitutes a risk factor in BPD susceptibility. Identification of involved genetic polymorphisms would permit early identification of neonates at increased risk of BPD development.","group":"g1","id":"2104e0ac-9909-40bb-be34-cbcbb60c5eb0","_showDetails":true},"5cc8c3be-62b7-46ff-a0e5-2ffd704039ac":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70781423","title":"Caffeine affects smad signalling and TGF-beta stimulated transgelin expression in the lung epithelial cells A549","authors":["Kunzmann K.","Fehrholz F.","Bersani B.","Speer S."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung","*epithelium cell","*perinatal care","airway remodeling","prematurity","cytoskeleton","phosphorylation","actin filament","genetic transfection","assay","lung injury","gene expression","lung dysplasia","Western blotting","real time polymerase chain reaction","plasmid","second messenger","upregulation","*caffeine","*transgelin","protein","luciferase","transforming growth factor","messenger RNA"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"25","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"K.

However, caffeine effects on airway remodelling in the lung of premature neonates are still undefined. Transgelin, a binding and stabilising protein of actin cytoskeleton, is a novel immediate target of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/ Smad3-dependent gene expression in lung epithelial cells. It was hypothesized that transgelin may contribute to the TGF-beta- dependent airway remodelling after lung injury by altering and rearranging the epithelial cytoskeleton. Aim(s): The present study had the aim to clarify whether caffeine was able to affect TGF-beta-induced Smad signalling and transgelin expression in lung epithelial cells. Method(s): The pharmacological effect of caffeine on Smad signalling was investigated by means of a luciferase-assay through the transfection of the TGF-beta-inducible CAGA-plasmid in A549 cells by lipofectamin. The regulation of transgelin expression was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western-blotting. Result(s): Caffeine inhibited Smad2/3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in A549 lung epithelial cells. The highest inhibition was found with a caffeine concentration of 10 mM. The effect of caffeine on Smad2/3 phosphorylation was mediated by the caffeineinduced second messenger cAMP. In addition, caffeine leads to a downregulation of both transgelin mRNA and protein in A549 cells. Caffeine also antagonized the TGF-beta-induced upregulation of transgelin. This effect of caffeine on transgelin expression was also mediated by cAMP. Conclusion(s): The present study highlighted a new molecular mechanism of caffeine, inhibiting Smad signalling and modifying transgelin expression in the lung. Since destabilisation of the actin cytoskeleton might result in a suppression of the TGF-beta/Smad signalling, transgelin, linking molecule between cytoskeleton and TGF-beta/ Smad signalling, may be a new regulator involved in the airway remodelling process, and its activity was found to be affected by caffeine.","group":"g1","id":"5cc8c3be-62b7-46ff-a0e5-2ffd704039ac","_showDetails":true},"5081e5f4-a23d-4629-b7fd-f9553ddff479":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70781414","title":"Acute or expectant management of premature labour with pprom before 30th week of gestation","authors":["Hajek Z.","Koucky M.","Dokoupilova M.","Germanova A."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*pregnancy","*perinatal care","*premature labor","latent period","newborn mortality","morbidity","female","infection","newborn","human","mother","chorioamnionitis","infant","funisitis","Apgar score","umbilical cord","monitoring","placenta","infantile spasm","hypoxia","gestational age","lung dysplasia","examination","bleeding","newborn morbidity","membrane","fetus distress","leukomalacia","brain hemorrhage","rupture","retrolental fibroplasia","mortality","fetus","profit","methodology","marker"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"25","number":"SUPPL. 2","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"Z.

As an acute labour we presented a labour <48 h after PPROM and an expectant one after 48 h of latency, with maximum 542 +/- 412.3 h, it is approximately 3 weeks. The pregnancy with PPROM was terminated at the beginning of fetal distress, increasing infection markers, severe infection and bleeding of mother. After birth, histological examination of placenta and umbilical cord have been done. We evaluated Apgar score, severe morbidity of the newborn (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD], retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage III and IV groups, periventricular leucomalacia), the incidence of chorioamnionitis, funisitis and neonatal mortality. Results and discussion: The incidence of chorioamnionitis and funisitis was rising with latency period, but was not statistically different in comparison with acute management. The newborn morbidity, especially BPD was higher (neonatal seizures [NS]), but the mortality rate was the same (5.8% vs. 5.3% NS). The infection was the general cause of delivery, the fetal apposition with hypoxia was statistically significant in category with latency of labour than in category of acute labour.

However, prolonged hyperoxia contributes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that postnatal treatment of newborn wild type (WT) or Cyp1a2-null mice with BNF, followed by exposure to hyperoxia, would alleviate lung injury by mechanisms involving CYP1A-mediated detoxification of F2-isoprostanes. Method(s): Newborn WT or Cyp1a2-null mice were treated, i.p., once daily with the vehicle corn oil (CO) or BNF (25Mol/kg), for 4 days, and were maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 3 days. The mice were sacrificed on day 7 of life. Lung injury was assessed by measuring lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios and histology. CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression was studied at the enzymatic (flourimetry), protein (western blotting) and mRNA levels (real time RT-PCR), respectively. F2-isoprostane levels in lung and liver were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Newborn WT and Cyp1a2-null mice showed lung damage in response to hyperoxia, with Cyp1a2-null mice displaying increased susceptibility to lung injury compared to WT mice. The extent of lung injury positively correlated with levels of F2- isoprostanes. BNF, which induced CYP1A expression, attenuated lung injury inWTas well as Cyp1a2-null mice. These results support the hypothesis that BNF protects against hyperoxic lung injury by inducing CYP1A1, which may act via detoxifying F2-isoprostanes. Future studies could lead to the development of rational strategies in the prevention/treatment of BPD in premature infants.","group":"g1","id":"c24c63d9-bda3-4ab7-96ac-a91df035ca7b","_showDetails":true},"0726b021-a034-4f8d-a765-fd1a8c382b7d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70702689","title":"Human amnion epithelial cells modulate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury in mice","authors":["Vosdoganes P.","Lim R.","Koulaeva E.","Chan S.T.","Acharya R.Y.","Moss T.J.M.","Wallace E.M."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["*lung injury","*hyperoxia","*human","*Pacific islands","*mouse","*epithelium cell","*health care organization","*amnion","*Asian","*Australia and New Zealand","*society","exposure","lung disease","pneumonia","intraperitoneal drug administration","body weight","lung structure","tissues","density","gene expression","leukocyte","therapy","infant","risk","lung dysplasia","morbidity","inflammation","tissue repair","adult","lung","collagen","oxygen","sodium chloride","nonoxinol 9","platelet derived growth factor"],"journal":"Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","language":"English","volume":"48","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Wiley Blackwell","isbn":"1034-4810","address":"P.

A next-generation nasal cannula (Neotech RAM cannula) has recently been used to provide nasal NIV. The impact of the Neotech RAM cannula on the delivery of pressure needs to be studied., METHODS: In this ex vivo experimental design, a lung simulator (IngMar ASL 5000, version 3.4) was programmed to model a neonate (~1-3 kg of body weight) with normal-to-moderately affected lungs. We used a Covidien PB840 ventilator with NIV software activated to compensate for leaks. Nasal NIV was set at peak airway pressures of 15, 20, and 25 cm H2O and PEEP of 5, 6, and 7 cm H2O. Three sizes of the Neotech RAM cannula were used (prong outer diameters of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm). The nose was designed to keep the leak of the nares by the prongs to 30%. We also created a worst case leak (58% leak) by using the largest simulated nostril diameter with the smallest diameter Neotech RAM cannula prong. The outcome measure was the difference in pressures, referred to as leak effect, measured by the lung simulator relative to the set peak airway pressure and PEEP on the ventilator., RESULTS: For the interface with 30% leak, leak effects of peak airway pressure during simulated nasal NIV were similar with all Neotech RAM cannula sizes, with 63-75% of peak airway pressure and 70-90% of PEEP being transmitted across the nasal interface. The worst case scenario produced a 92% leak effect in peak airway pressure and PEEP., CONCLUSIONS: When used with <= 30% leak, the Neotech RAM cannula interface results in clinically acceptable transmission of pressures. With > 50% leak, a clinically negligible amount of pressure is transmitted to the artificial lungs.

Among these are two relatively abstract and complex competencies: Practice- Based Learning & Improvement (PBLI) and Systems-Based Practice (SBP). Many program directors find that PBLI and SBP are difficult concepts to grasp, perhaps limiting their ability to develop effective means of teaching and evaluating these competencies. Because PBLI and SBP are related conceptually to Quality Improvement (QI), a QI-based curriculum may be an effective means by which to teach these competencies. However, there are few examples of QI curricula that have improved resident knowledge in PBLI and SBP while providing program directors the means by which to document resident competence. Purpose(s): We engaged our fellows in experiential learning by requiring them to participate in our division-level program of continuous quality improvement. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act change model, fellows partnered with faculty to develop and implement QI projects designed to reduce common neonatal morbidities. To assess fellow competence in PBLI and SBP, program directors maintained portfolios for each fellow, including written self-reflections, evaluations and documentation of all resulting academic achievement. Description: As members of our unit's unit's multidisciplinary Quality & Safety Committee (Q&S), our fellows identified two outcomes meriting improvement- bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and catheter-associated blood stream infection (CABSI). They then developed and implemented evidencebased plans to reduce the incidence of each disease, then collected and analyzed outcomes data with guidance from division faculty. To complete the QI cycle, fellows communicated outcomes and future plans for QI to all NICU staff. Our fellows' QI projects led to significant and sustained reductions in the rates of BPD and CABSI. We assessed fellow performance by reviewing goal- and strategy-based self-reflections with each fellow semi-annually. In addition, all division faculty provided competency-based feedback in response to fellow presentations of Q&S outcomes at our quarterly Morbidity & Mortality conferences. Our fellows' active engagement in QI also resulted in meaningful academic achievement as well. For example, our fellows have presented the clinical outcomes of their BPD initiative at two national academic meetings (American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference and Exhibition, 2010 and 2011). Also, one of our fellows earned Performance in Practice credit toward her maintenance of certification by the American Board of Pediatrics. Conclusion(s): By integrating clinical and educational systems, a QI-based curriculum may be an effective means by which to teach and assess PBLI and SBP.","group":"g1","id":"cde2d277-5fe4-4ef0-9e50-1b7a17ec6b04","_showDetails":true},"4ac9e151-8ee5-4fc6-8501-4d8218a07480":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"365763181","title":"Dynamic regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha expression in alveolar fibroblasts during realveolarization","authors":["Chen L.","Acciani T.","Le Cras T.","Lutzko C.","Perl A.-K.T."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["animal cell","animal experiment","animal tissue","article","cell differentiation","controlled study","epithelial mesenchymal transition","flow cytometry","gene expression","immunohistochemistry","inhibition kinetics","lung resection","mouse","*myofibroblast","nonhuman","precursor","protein expression","real time polymerase chain reaction","regeneration","signal transduction","transgene","alpha smooth muscle actin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","bone morphogenetic protein 4/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","fibroblast growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","green fluorescent protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","rosiglitazone","sonic hedgehog protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","Wnt protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","language":"English","volume":"47","number":"4","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1044-1549","address":"A.-K.T.

During alveolar development, PDGFR-alpha-expressing cells induce alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and differentiate to interstitial myofibroblasts. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling regulates myofibroblast differentiation during alveolarization, whereas peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma activation antagonizes myofibroblast differentiation in lung fibrosis. Using left lung pneumonectomy, the roles of FGF and PPAR-gamma signaling in differentiation of myofibroblasts from PDGFR-alpha-positive precursors during compensatory lung growth were assessed. FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling was inhibited by conditionally activating a soluble dominant-negative FGFR2 transgene. PPAR-gamma signaling was activated by administration of rosiglitazone. Changes in alpha-SMA and PDGFR-alpha protein expression were assessed in PDGFR-alpha-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mice using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry demonstrated that the cell ratio and expression levels of PDGFR-alpha-GFP changed dynamically during alveolar regeneration and that alpha-SMA expression was induced in a subset of PDGFR-alpha-GFP cells. Expression of a dominant-negative FGFR2 and administration of rosiglitazone inhibited induction of alpha-SMA in PDGFR-alpha-positive fibroblasts and formation of new septae. Changes in gene expression of epithelial and mesenchymal signaling molecules were assessed after left lobe pneumonectomy, and results demonstrated that inhibition of FGFR2 signaling and increase in PPAR-gamma signaling altered the expression of Shh, FGF, Wnt, and Bmp4, genes that are also important for epithelial- mesenchymal crosstalk during early lung development. Our data demonstrate for the first time that a comparable epithelial- mesenchymal crosstalk regulates fibroblast phenotypes during alveolar septation.

Multi-slice computed tomography (CT) chest scans were obtained at elevated lung volumes during a brief respiratory pause in sedated infants and toddlers; 38 CLDI were compared with 39 full-term controls. For CLDI subjects, gestational age at birth ranged from 25 to 29 weeks. Airway size was measured for the trachea and the next three to four generations into the right lower lobe; lung volumes and tissue density were also measured. The relationship between airway size and airway generation differed between the CLDI and full-term groups; the sizes of the first and second airway generations were larger in the shorter CLDI than in the shorter full-term subjects. The increased size in the airways in the CLDI subjects was associated with increasing mechanical ventilation time in the neonatal period. CLDI subjects had a greater heterogeneity of lung density compared with full-term subjects.

In the respiratory system, the hormone has implications for a variety of processes, including lung development, alveolar type II cell function and differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and matrix interactions. PTHrP regulates branching morphogenesis and type II cell maturation in fetal lung through bidirectional interactions with lung fibroblasts. Consequently, it appears to have a role in the pathophysiology of respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In adult lung, the molecule has autocrine actions on type II pneumocytes that stimulate phosphatidylcholine production, inhibit cell proliferation, and sensitize to apoptotic stimuli. Type II cell PTHrP levels fall after lung injury, inversely coordinated in time with their proliferation, suggesting that reduction in its growth inhibitory effect may contribute to the increase in type II cell numbers after injury. Air space levels of the protein are inversely related to the risk of lung injury or injury severity in neonatal and adult lung, consistent with its production by pneumocytes. Thus, PTHrP has clinical significance as a biomarker for injury and as a potential target for treatment. © 2012 The Author(s).","group":"g1","id":"42dd57b9-26b6-4064-b6e2-de7de6a267e8","_showDetails":true},"673456ce-9f23-4b3c-9130-aadfa6f724cf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"363112886","title":"Hyperoxia-induced activation of the integrated stress response in the newborn rat lung","authors":["Konsavage W.M.","Zhang L.","Wu Y.","Shenberger J.S."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["animal experiment","article","cell structure","endoplasmic reticulum","endothelium cell","epithelium cell","*hyperoxia","immunoreactivity","*lung","lung alveolus cell type 2","newborn","nonhuman","priority journal","protein expression","protein phosphorylation","protein synthesis","rat","RNA splicing","*stress","*unfolded protein response","activating transcription factor 3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","activating transcription factor 4/ec [Endogenous Compound]","activating transcription factor 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","glutamate cysteine ligase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","initiation factor 2alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]","mitogen activated protein kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","mitogen activated protein kinase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","mitogen activated protein kinase p38/ec [Endogenous Compound]","nuclear protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","protein kinase R/ec [Endogenous Compound]","stress activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","X box binding protein 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*integrated stress response"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","language":"English","volume":"302","number":"1","publisher":"American Physiological Society (9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD 20814-3991, United States)","isbn":"1522-1504","address":"J.

The signal transduction network culminating in these effects is referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR) or, when initiated by misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the unfolded protein response (UPR). Given that we previously reported that exposure of 4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats to 95% O2 (Ox) diminishes global pulmonary protein synthesis and increases eIF2alpha phosphorylation, we conducted the current study to determine whether Ox activates the ISR or UPR. We found that Ox-induced alterations in ER morphology of alveolar type II cells and interstitial fibroblasts were not associated with activation of the UPR sensors PERK or activating transcription factor (ATF) 6 or with X-box binding protein-1 mRNA splicing in whole lung extracts. Exposure to Ox enhanced ATF4 immunoreactivity and nuclear protein content, followed by a 2- and 5-fold increase in ATF3 protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The accumulation of nuclear ATF4 protein coincided with induction of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, an ISR-responsive gene. Immunohistochemistry revealed that changes in ATF3/4 expression were prominent in the alveolus, whereas primary cell culture implicated epithelial and endothelial cells as targets. Finally, induction of ISR intermediates in the intact lung occurred in the absence of the phosphorylation of PKR, JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK. These findings demonstrate that Ox activates the ISR within the newborn lung and highlight regional and cell-specific alterations in the expression ISR transcription factors that regulate redox balance. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","group":"g1","id":"673456ce-9f23-4b3c-9130-aadfa6f724cf","_showDetails":true},"036a6e09-a6ba-408f-80ed-fc416fb190fb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"365175752","title":"Role of lung epithelial-mesenchymal transformation mechanism in bronchopulmonary dysplasia of mice","authors":["Liu F.-J.","Deng C.","Guo C.-B.","Fu Z."],"date":"2012//","keywords":["animal cell","animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","article","breathing rate","controlled study","*epithelial mesenchymal transition","immunohistochemistry","inhibition kinetics","lung alveolus","*lung dysplasia/et [Etiology]","lung fibroblast","lung fibrosis","lung function test","lung parenchyma","mouse","nonhuman","oxygen concentration","plethysmography","polymerase chain reaction","protein expression","quantitative analysis","tidal volume","calvasculin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","collagen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","surfactant protein B/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Chinese Journal of Biologicals","language":"Chinese","volume":"25","number":"5","publisher":"Changchun Institute of Biological Products (No. 137, Xi'an Road, Chnagchun, Jilin 130062, China)","isbn":"1004-5503","address":"F.-J.

At P14, lungs were harvested for analyses including morphometry for alveolarization, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, myeoloperoxidase activity, mRNA level of tumor necross factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), human glycera-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and p47phox, and collagen levels. Increases in TUNEL-positive cells were attenuated in all transplantation groups. However, hyperoxia-induced lung injuries, such as reduced alveolarization, as evidenced by increased mean linear intercept and mean alveolar volume, and increased collagen levels were significantly attenuated in both HT2 and HT3, but not in HT1, with better attenuation in HT3 than in HT2. Dose-dependent human GAPDH expression, indicative of the presence of human RNA in lung tissue, was observed only in the transplantation groups, with higher expression in HT3 than in HT2, and higher expression in HT2 than in HT1. Hyperoxia-induced inflammatory responses such as increased myeloperoxidase acitivity, mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TGF-beta of the lung tissue, and upregulation of both cytosolic and membrane p47phox, indicative of oxidative stress, were significantly attenuated in both HT2 and HT3 but not in HT1. These results demonstrate that intratracheal transplantation of human UCB-derived MSCs with appropriate doses may attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung injury through active involvement of these cells in modulating host inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in neonatal rats. © 2011 Cognizant Comm.

Recently, we established that acute glucocorticoid exposure at clinically relevant doses produces neural progenitor cell apoptosis in the external granule layer of the developing mouse cerebellum and permanent decreases in the number of cerebellar neurons. As the cerebellum naturally matures and neurogenesis is no longer needed, the external granule layer decreases proliferation and permanently disappears during the second week of life. At this same time, corticosterone (the endogenous rodent glucocorticoid) release increases and a glucocorticoid-metabolizing enzyme that protects the external granule layer against glucocorticoid receptor stimulation (11beta-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase-Type 2; HSD2) naturally disappears. Here we show that HSD2 inhibition and raising corticosterone to adult physiological levels both can independently increase neural progenitor cell apoptosis in the neonatal mouse. Conversely, glucocorticoid receptor antagonism decreases natural physiological apoptosis in this same progenitor cell population suggesting that endogenous glucocorticoid stimulation may regulate apoptosis in the external granule layer. We also found that glucocorticoids which HSD2 can effectively metabolize generate less external granule layer apoptosis than glucocorticoids this enzyme is ineffective at breaking down. This finding may explain why glucocorticoids that this enzyme can metabolize are clinically effective at treating respiratory dysfunction yet seem to produce no neurodevelopmental deficits. Finally, we demonstrate that both acute and chronic glucocorticoid exposures produce external granule layer apoptosis but without appropriate control groups this effect becomes masked. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for glucocorticoid therapy and neurodevelopment during the perinatal period. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","group":"g1","id":"ab160fc1-82ae-4e6d-92d6-c041ba430d48","_showDetails":true},"5debb6d9-5ecf-47c9-814a-18a4fd0528b0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Aberrant elastin remodeling in the lungs of O2-exposed newborn mice; primarily results from perturbed interaction between integrins and elastin.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-2035-1","authors":["Han, Wenli","Guo, Chunbao","Liu, Qiutong","Yu, Benli","Liu, Zhaoyun","Yang, Junqing","Deng, Chun"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20141127//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Elastin/me [Metabolism]","Extracellular Matrix Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression Profiling","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Integrin alphaV/me [Metabolism]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Oxygen/pd [Pharmacology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Recombinant Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Time Factors","Transforming Growth Factor beta1/me [Metabolism]","Tropoelastin/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Cell and tissue research","volume":"359","number":"2","isbn":"0302-766X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25428696"],"address":"Germany","abstract":"Excessive localization of elastin from septal tips to alveolar walls is a key feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The abnormal accumulation of lung elastin, involving the structural and functional interaction of a series of proteins, remains poorly understood. To further investigate the mechanisms accounting for the abnormal accumulation of elastin in the lungs of newborn mice with BPD, we evaluate elastin distribution and its interaction with proteins involved in its aberrant localization, such as integrin alphav, fibulin-5 and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), in lungs of newborn mice exposed to 60% O2 for 21 days. Lung histology revealed aberrant elastin production and impaired lung septation in O2-exposed lungs, while tropoelastin, integrin alphav, fibulin-1, fibulin-2 and fibulin-4 gene expression were elevated. Dual staining image analysis of lung sections revealed that co-localization of integrin alphav and elastin increased following O2 exposure with elastin distributed throughout the walls of air spaces rather than at septal tips. Furthermore, integrin alphav appeared to be induced initially. Concurrently, increased fibulin-5 and TGF-beta1 (which may regulate elastic fiber assembly) expression was detected, which may explain the altered lung elastin deposition and defective septation that are observed during BPD. These data support the hypothesis that excessive and aberrant alphav integrin expression was initially induced by hyperoxia; alphav integrin then interacted with and recruited elastin. These alterations were accompanied by fibulin-5 deposition and TGF-beta1 activation, which may impede normal matrix remodeling, thereby contributing to the pathological pulmonary features of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"5debb6d9-5ecf-47c9-814a-18a4fd0528b0","_showDetails":true},"57bb6a7a-1d80-4846-9d67-b64d0305c2bc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"362235799","title":"Phosphodiesterases:

It includes a number of structural changes, such as epithelial detachment, basement membrane (BM) thickening, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and new vessel formation. These changes contribute to thickening of airway walls and, consequently, to irreversible airway narrowing, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, airway edema and mucous hypersecretion. Airway remodeling is associated with poor clinical outcomes among asthmatic patients [9]. Early diagnosis and prevention of airway remodeling has the potential to decrease disease severity, improve control and prevent disease expression [9]. We hereby summarize means currently used for the assessment of airway remodeling, which may further our understanding of the relationship between structural changes and clinical and functional abnormalities. Techniques for the assessment of remodeling in tissue: The usual assessment of remodeling is by histological examination of bronchial tissues. Tissue processing, visualisation and quantification have been well described [10]. Airway remodeling is evaluated after histochemical and immunohistochemical staining. In general, the assessment of tissue structure is performed with haematoxylin and eosin staining on paraffin tissues. Sirius red, van Gieson or Masson- Trichrome stain the total collagen. Periodic-acid shiff staining is used to visualise the mucus glands. Immunohistochemistry allows detection of specific proteins such as ECM proteins. Specific primary antibodies directed against a variety of cytokines are available. After staining, the slides are analyzed under light microscopy [2]. Reticular basement membrane thickness (RBM): Increased bronchial epithelial RBM thickness has been proposed as one of the main features of airway remodeling [1,3-6]. Measurements of RBM thickness in individuals follows a log-normal distribution. For a precision of approximately +/-15%, 31-45 measurements are required in adults. It is recommended that RBM be measured at 20mm intervals over a 1mm reticular basement membrane length [11]. This methodology has been successfully applied in preschool and school-age children [12]. Inflammatory and structural cells counts: It is recommended that a zone beneath the RBM of at least 5 mm of RBM should be included for counts of inflammatory cells [12]. The results are usually expressed as the number of cells per area [2]. Increased airway smooth muscle mass is present in fatal and nonfatal asthma. The study of the cellular mechanism (i.e., hyperplasia vs. hypertrophy) may add useful information regarding the functional consequences of airway smooth muscle remodeling [13]. For measurement of myocyte number and mean volume, cell nuclei are counted to enumerate myocytes under the assumption that these cells have only one nucleus. The volume of ASM may be measured using point and line intersection counts as previously described [8,10]. Epithelial integrity: Epithelial integrity is expressed as a percentage of length of the RBM with intact epithelium on 2 biopsies, if possible [14]. Tissue density quantification: - Surface area. A simple stereologic technique of point counting may be used to determine surface area and structural composition (ie, the percentage of the biopsy specimen composed of epithelium, RBM, subepithelial stroma, smooth muscle, submucosal glands, and other features) [10,15]. A grid with points is superimposed on the tissue section, and the number of points overlying the tissue of interest and other subepithelial tissue (for normalization) is recorded. The results are usually expressed as the area occupied by the tissu of interest on the area of the chosen subepithelial tissu within the same biopsy specimen. As an example, in one study, the areas of the structures of interest were determined at a magnification of x200 with the aid of an eyepiece graticule containing 100 points, and the data were expressed as a percentage of the whole biopsy specimen area. The biopsy specimen area was calculated as follows: area (in square millimeters) = number of points counted x0.0016 [15]. Surface area may also be determined by an automated cell recognition system based on colour analysis. Quancoul# software (Quant'Image, 1997; Bordeaux, France) is a tool which calculates three independent criteria, i.e., optic density (OD), hue density (HD), hue (H) from the three primary colours i.e., red, green and blue [16] for its colour recognition. - RBM-Smooth muscle distance. As airway smooth muscle (ASM) increases in size and ASM cells migrate, the distance between an area stained by ASM bundles and the RBM is reduced. This distance can be determined by at least 10 measurements at 50 mm regular intervals for each section [14]. Overall remodeling scores: Most of the structural changes are not characteristic of one specific airway disease, but are shared by all airway diseases (Table 1 [2]). It may be tempting to adopt an overall semi-quantitative score summarizing the entire remodelling process. However, a specific weight should be atributed to each individual component. (Table Presented) Smooth muscle cell cultures: In asthmatic airways, recent reports indicate that the increased mass of ASM plays a critical role. ASM is the critical effector cell modulating airway tone - its contraction induces airway narrowing. Increased ASM mass is due to a simultaneous increase in size (hypertrophy) and number (hyperplasia) of ASM cells. Primary ASM cells can successfully be isolated from human airways for cell culture [17-19], thereby providing in vitro remodeling models. It has been shown that adult ASM cells are not only structural cells. They also contribute to bronchial inflammation by secreting a range of inflammatory mediators (secretory phenotype), recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, such as mast cells or T-lymphocytes. Such an increase has been related to a deposition of extracellular matrix proteins [20]. Chemokines have the ability to induce human ASM cells migration to the subepithelial area of the asthmatic airways and to increase their contractility in vitro [21]. ASM cell proliferation (proliferative phenotype) in severe asthma implicates a gallopamil-sensitive calcium influx and the activation of calcium-calmodulin kinase IV leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis through the activation of various transcription factors (PGC-1a, NRF-1 and mt-TFA). The altered expression and function of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump could play a role in ASM remodeling in moderate to severe asthma. Additionally, aberrant communication between an injured airway epithelium and ASM could also contribute to disease severity [22,23]. Studies of ASM cells in children remain extremely scarce. We have shown that stimulated non-asthmatic infant ASM cells may contribute to airway remodeling to a greater extent than adult ASM cells [24]. DNA synthesis in 10% fetal calf serum of infant ASMC was significantly enhanced (>5-fold increase vs. ITS control medium) compared to adults (2-fold increase). PDGF-AA induced a response of lesser magnitude: 2.6-fold increase in infants vs. 1.5- fold in adults (p < 0.05). Newer data suggests that a mitochondrial biogenesis related mechanisms may be involved, similar to adult asthmatics. All the above suggests that ASM cells may be prone to non-specific remodeling. Paediatric ASM cells also have the ability to synthetize inflammatory mediators and cytokines. TNFalpha-stimulated immature ASMC produce more LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (an IL-6 family neurotrophic cytokine)) mRNA and protein than adult ASMC [19]. The secretion of LIF by stimulated immature human ASM cells potentially contributes to neuroimmune airway inflammation and subsequent remodeling. Thus, ASM culture may help us to further understand the mechanisms of airway remodeling, the effect of current asthma treatments on airway remodeling, potential pharmacological targets for the treatment of airway remodeling in asthma, the mechanisms of airway remodeling, the effect of current asthma treatments on airway remodeling and the potential pharmacological targets for the treatment of airway remodeling in asthma [25]. Perspective(s): Further studies involving ASMC cultures from asthmatic children are warranted. The interaction between ASM cells and other structural (e.g. epithelial) and inflammatory cells should also be explored.","group":"g1","id":"a7665cc8-4388-4d49-9812-32d84fe825a9","_showDetails":true},"f90f6594-76c9-415d-aaaa-93f8bf8ffe06":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"613016806","title":"Intermediate respiratory care units (IRCU) in pediatric tertiary care hospitals","authors":["Braz M.","Nunes T.","Saianda A.","Ferreira R.","Pereira L.","Bandeira T."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["adult","cerebral palsy","child","chronic patient","clinical trial","cystic fibrosis","genetic disorder","human","information processing","*intensive care unit","lung dysplasia","major clinical study","neuromuscular disease","noninvasive ventilation","oxygen therapy","pediatric ward","*tertiary care center","tracheostomy"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"12","number":"Supplement 1","publisher":"W.B.

Objective(s): Description and characterization of chronic respiratory patients with technological dependence admitted in a Pediatric Respiratory Unit (PRU) from a tertiary care hospital in order to evaluate the organization and levels of service needed in respiratory units which treat or monitor these patients.

Respiratory technology care was distributed as shown in the table. Discussion and Conclusion(s): This study supports the burden of care needed in a respiratory pediatric unit of a tertiary care hospital. NIV (70%) was the most frequently used type of ventilation in consonance with the criteria defined for IRCU. Distinctly from adults, we included children on LTOT, being one third of the admissions. These are patients mainly with BPD, CF and neurological or syndromatic diseases, who are particularly demanding and unstable in pediatric ages.

The diagnosis of BPD is currently based on the need for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days after birth, and its severity is graded according to the respiratory support required at 36 postmenstrual weeks. BPD almost always occurs in neonates who are delivered at a gestational age of less than 30 weeks and who have a birth weight of less than 1500 g. These are about 1.5% of all newborns and BPD develops in about 20% of them. Today BPD is mainly a developmental disorder in which the immature lung fails to reach its full structural complexity. Longitudinal studies on children with BPD identified, at all ages, increased rates of chronic coughing and wheezing, a greater need to use inhaled asthma medications and a significant airflow obstruction. Children who have survived BPD and children with asthma share some clinical and functional characteristics, but available evidence suggests that the two obstructive lung diseases do not have the same underlying airway inflammation. Spirometric values reflecting airflow, such as FEV1, are consistently lower in survivors of BPD into adolescence and young adulthood than in controls born at term rising the concern that the chronic lung disease after premature birth may predispose to the development of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like phenotype with aging. This is an open question that only follow-up and lung function studies extended to middle-age and beyond will answer. Unfortunately, no pathologic data are available elucidating which structural and pathophysiological alterations underlie the clinical and functional pulmonary abnormalities seen at long-term in some subjects delivered prematurely. A relevant question is whether the long-term pulmonary consequences of prematurity and BPD essentially depend on a non-progressive reduction of the airway caliber, due to a stabilized, non-progressive structural damage of the airways, or instead also reflect an active airway disease. Chronic lung disease of prematurity can no longer be considered only a pediatric disease and also family doctors and chest physicians should be aware of this \"new\" Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.","group":"g1","id":"2f1d8c0c-33bc-4acc-8435-d5985eb7531a","_showDetails":true},"e062f8d5-154b-4628-b43e-155d8f04f426":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"613016270","title":"Role of human coronavirus in Brazilian hospitalized children with respiratory lower infection","authors":["Costa P.F.B.M.","Lima C.H.A.","Telles J.-N.","Vernet G.","Baccala G.P.","Siqueira M.A.M.T."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["adult","adult respiratory distress syndrome","artificial ventilation","Brazil","bronchiolitis","child","clinical examination","controlled study","diagnosis","emergency ward","exposure","extraction","France","hospitalization","*hospitalized child","human","*Human coronavirus NL63","Human respiratory syncytial virus","human tissue","hypoxemia","infant","institutional review","intensive care unit","lung dysplasia","lysis","major clinical study","nasopharyngeal aspiration","*nonhuman","physical examination","pneumonia","prematurity","preschool child","prevalence","public health","respiratory failure","*respiratory tract infection","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","symptom","wheezing","buffer","corticosteroid","nucleic acid","oxygen"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"12","number":"Supplement 1","publisher":"W.B.

These respiratory infections are mainly caused by bacteria and viruses. With the expansion of molecular diagnostics assays, human bocavirus (HBoV),human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Rhinovirus, human coronaviruses, and others viruses were discovered and easily detected in respiratory specimens compared with conventional methods such as viruses culture. Bronchiolitis(BVA) and Pneumonia(PNM) are frequent and constitute an important cause of hospitalization in Brazil and others countries in Latin America. An understanding of the Brazil epidemiology is crucial for identifying target groups and appropriate timing of public health preventive measures such as therapies. In this study, we aimed to investigate epidemiological of a Human coronavirus associated to a well defined clinical patients with lower respiratory infection. Materials, Patients and Methods: Patients: This is a substudy of an ongoing prospective brazilian investigation of respiratory tract infections in children and adults in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This study was approved by all participating institutional review boards. Samples: The specimens were collected from infants within the first 48 hours after admission and up to five days of clinical manifestation before admission. All the patients included were submitted to a clinical examination, case history and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA). Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acids detection: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were submitted to nucleic acid extraction using the NucliSENS EasyMAG platform (bioMe rieux, France), in combination with the NucliSENS magnetic extraction reagents (bioMe rieux, France) and NucliSENS lysis buffer (bioMe rieux, France). Result(s): A total of 217 children with well documented diagnosis of pneumonia (n = 53/217, 24.4%), bronchiolitis (n = 160/217, 73.3%) or ARDS (n = 4/217, 1.8%) admitted in the emergency room (n = 174, 80.2%) or ICU (n = 43, 19.8%). Only one agent was detected in 49% and more than one was detected in 31%. The negative samples represented 13, 8% of all NPA submitted. The most common virus detected were RSV. The Human Coronavirus was detected in 15/217 samples (7%). Of these, five were presented alone and in 10/15 codetection with other agents. Five children had diagnosis of BVA and two of these required admission to the intensive care unit. The median age was 31 months, ranging from 1 month to 144 months. The BVA cases occurred in children under 1 year. The average days of symptoms before admission was 4 days, all cases had wheezing on physical examination and respiratory insufficiency occurred in 3 children (all with BVA). Respiratory symptoms, hypoxemia and need for mechanical ventilation was not different in group Coronavirus positive in relation to other agents found. All 15 cases had used inhaled oxygen, systemic corticosteroids in six and in 2 cases needed mechanical ventilation. Prematurity was present in 3 cases and 2 children had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Discussion(s): In this study, we applied multiplex RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples for prospective evaluation of respiratory viruses associated with hospitalized with ALRI. HCoVNL63 was usually identified in younger children, primarily those less than 2 years of age, which could reflect greater susceptibility because of immunologic immaturity of young children.We analyzed the clinical characteristics of those with HCoV-NL63 infection with and without co-detection by another virus and there were no differences. Conclusion(s): Despite these limitations, this study compared prevalence, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of Human coronavirus in ALRI. There are few reports with this results.","group":"g1","id":"e062f8d5-154b-4628-b43e-155d8f04f426","_showDetails":true},"466b68f9-b69c-43d4-9d69-d508467097b1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72120979","title":"The role of the accessory type III transforming growth factor-beta receptors in the regulation of pulmonary vascular development","authors":["Niess G.","Michiels-Corsten M.","Seeger W.","Morty R."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*European","*society","apoptosis","human","lung","cell function","lung blood vessel","pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell","mouse","patient","lung hypoplasia","in vitro study","growth, development and aging","vascular smooth muscle cell","hyperoxia","laser capture microdissection","lung dysplasia","lung injury","electronystagmography","*transforming growth factor","*receptor","small interfering RNA","endoglin","broxuridine","protein","messenger RNA","transforming growth factor beta receptor 3"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"38","number":"SUPPL. 55\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"G.

Knockdown of TGFBR3 by siRNA in primary human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) increased PASMC proliferation (3fold; assessed by BrdU incorporation) in vitro, in a TGF-beta-independent manner. However, apoptosis rates of the PASMC were not affected by siRNA knockdown of TGFBR3. The siRNA knockdown of other TGF-beta receptors, ACVRL1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2 and ENG, did not impact TGF-beta-independent proliferation or apoptosis of PASMC. These data point to a novel, TGF-beta-independent role for TGFBR3 in regulating PASMC growth. This idea assumes importance considering that we have also observed perturbed expression of TGFBR3 in the lungs of neonatal mice with hyperoxia (85% O2)-induced lung injury, which results in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mRNA levels (assessed by quantitative real-time RTPCR) for tgfbr3 were downregulated (4.4-fold, p=0.003), while TGFBR3 protein levels were downregulated by 70%. Laser capture microdissection confirmed dysregulated expression of TGFBR3 in the pulmonary vasculature of the developing mouse lung. Taken together, these data suggest a role for TGFBR3 in vascular smooth muscle cell function which could lead to a dysregulation of TGF-beta signalling in the pulmonary vasculature, which in turn could contribute to the impaired pulmonary vascular growth and development associated with the lung hypoplasia observed in patients with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"466b68f9-b69c-43d4-9d69-d508467097b1","_showDetails":true},"88cb0e8c-7ff6-4e29-b279-5661a5d14c9f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"72117304","title":"Home mechanical ventilation in chronic respiratory diseases: An experience from a pediatric semiintensive respiratory care unit","authors":["Rossi F.P.","Pavone M.","Verrillo E.","Schiavino A.","Testa M.B.C.","Paglietti M.G.","Soldini S.","Cutrera R."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*artificial ventilation","*chronic respiratory tract disease","*intensive care unit","*European","*society","human","patient","child","follow up","spinal muscular atrophy","diseases","brain disease","noninvasive ventilation","cerebral palsy","home care","diagnosis","myopathy","lung dysplasia","sleep disordered breathing","girl","cystic fibrosis","congenital central hypoventilation syndrome","Prader Willi syndrome","brain tumor","female","congenital heart disease","genetic disorder","muscular dystrophy","respiratory tract disease","nursing","childhood"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"38","number":"SUPPL. 55\nSP  -","publisher":"European Respiratory Society","isbn":"0903-1936","address":"F.P.

The mechanisms by which excessive TGF-beta signaling inhibits alveolar septation are not known. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10 is a critical modulator of early lung development and in the saccular stage but its role in alveolar septation has not been defined. It has been shown that the FGF-10 promoter contains a TGF-beta response element. Objective(s): We hypothesized that excessive TGF-beta signaling in the newborn hypoxiainduced mouse lung inhibits alveolar septation via reduction of FGF- 10. Method(s): In vivo: Wilde type C57BL/6 were exposed to air or hypoxia (12% O2) from birth to two weeks (the critical period of lung development) and evaluated for FGF-10 and TGF-beta mRNA and protein. Inhibition of TGF-beta signaling was achieved by administration of TGF-beta neutralizing antibody (ID11) to WT mice or 20 ug/g ZnSO4 given intraperitoneally daily to DNIIR pups (an inducible dominantnegative mutation of the TGF-beta type II receptor) and exposed to hypoxia or air from birth to 14 days of age. In vitro: Newborn Lung Fibroblasts and Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cells (PMVEC) were exposed to air or hypoxia for 24 h. FGF-10 mRNA and protein were evaluated in cell lysates. Result(s): Hypoxia reduces FGF-10 mRNA in both in vivo (Fig. 1) and in vitro studies (Fig. 3). Pups receiving the TGF-beta neutralizing antibody (ID11) had increased FGF-10 and better lung development (Fig. 1). FGF-10 staining was not significantly decreased in DNIIR hypoxic mice compared to air control (Fig. 2). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that hypoxia-induced increased TGF-beta signaling may reduce FGF-10, which may contribute to impairment of lung development. Future experiments: Additional studies are in progress to inhibit FGF-10 signaling in vivo, to determine if FGF-10 is necessary for alveolar septation.","group":"g1","id":"f86fd0c2-a63c-44b6-bca4-7ccb8b97fb75","_showDetails":true},"173c4f20-bae6-44d0-88d2-7ce5fa192710":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71124585","title":"Oxidative stress and BPD","authors":["Saugstad O.D."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*oxidative stress","*perinatal care","human","pathogenesis","inflammation","newborn","oxygen toxicity","gene","hemolysis","diseases","newborn disease","adult","lung dysplasia","coworker","enzyme activity","prematurity","physiology","newborn period","retrolental fibroplasia","erythrocyte membrane","brain hemorrhage","artificial ventilation","leukomalacia","patent ductus arteriosus","perinatal period","necrotizing enterocolitis","lung","infant","respiratory burst","leukocyte","apoptosis","signal transduction","second messenger","gene expression","exposure","child","developmental stage","fibrosis","atelectasis","positive end expiratory pressure","oxygen radical","free radical","antioxidant","oxygen","hydrogen peroxide","alpha tocopherol","transcription factor","antiinfective agent","reactive oxygen metabolite","protein","steroid","surfactant"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"39","number":"SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co.

Immediately after the first description of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by Norwood et al in 1967 these authors linked the condition to oxygen toxicity. A decade earlier Rebecca Gerschman and her colleagues had introduced the free radical theory explaining oxygen toxicity and at the end of the 1960s oxidative stress per se was linked to neonatal disease, primarily hemolysis. The newborn erythrocyte membrane was shown to be less resistant to H2O2 than the adult one. Vitamin E was tested against a number of neonatal conditions, however, without good results. Around 1980 we started to speculate that oxidative stress and oxygen radicals may trigger a number of diseases in the newborn period. Free radical production theoretically could explain the pathogenesis of a wide variety of conditions in medicine. During the 1980s I coined the term \"oxygen radical disease of the newborn\" which implicated that ROP, BPD and some other conditions as necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage, have a common pathogenesis via free radicals but different manifestations due to which organ is mostly affected. Since then a large body of studies and literature has accumulated and it has been shown that oxidative stress is associated with these conditions as well as others such as periventricular leucomalacia and patent ductus arteriosus. A new momentum in the understanding of oxidative stress in the perinatal period was added when Frank and his coworkers from the midst of the 1980's showed that antioxidant enzyme activity in the lungs are low in fetal life indicating a lowered antioxidant defense in premature infants. 25 years ago it was also understood oxygen radicals affect the circulation in several organs, as well as the perinatal circulation, and therefore exerts physiological functions. It has been known since 1973 that oxygen radicals are important in antibacterial defense through oxidative burst of leukocytes. A further insight was gained when oxidative stress and inflammation were linked and it was understood that these two phenomena could be two sides of the same coin. The last years it has been better understood that oxidative stress may activate transcription factors which may transcribe genes that are related to inflammation, apoptosis, as well as oxidative stress. It is by now also clear that oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate signal transduction pathways, are implicated as second messengers activating protein cascades, and also control gene expression. Which genes are regulated by oxidative stress for instance in BPD has been studied and more such data will come. Clinically several studies indicate that BPD is reduced if SaO2 is controlled and kept relatively low. However antioxidants seem not to prevent BPD development. Some authors report a reduction in BPD. A less use of mechanical ventilation with more CPAP together with a more aggressive nutritional regime, and lowered oxygen exposure may all have contributed to such a reduction. It is clear that BPD changed character after introduction of antenatal steroids and postnatal exogenous surfactant. In addition, more immature children with a more primitive pulmonary developmental stage survived. These factors contribute to a change away from the \"old\" BPD characterized by fibrosis and atelectasis to the \"new\" BPD where arrest of alveolar growth is more prominent.","group":"g1","id":"173c4f20-bae6-44d0-88d2-7ce5fa192710","_showDetails":false},"08f39063-16e8-4b74-93bc-1919dbf7836d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Alterations in gene expression and DNA methylation during murine and human lung alveolar septation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2014-0160OC","authors":["Cuna, Alain","Halloran, Brian","Faye-Petersen, Ona","Kelly, David","Crossman, David K","Cui, Xiangqin","Pandit, Kusum","Kaminski, Naftali","Bhattacharya, Soumyaroop","Ahmad, Ausaf","Mariani, Thomas J","Ambalavanan, Namasivayam"],"date":"2015//","keywords":["Adult","Animals","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/em [Embryology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*DNA Methylation","Epigenesis, Genetic","Female","*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Humans","Male","Mice","*Pulmonary Alveoli/em [Embryology]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"53","number":"1","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25387348"],"address":"United States","abstract":"DNA methylation, a major epigenetic mechanism, may regulate coordinated expression of multiple genes at specific time points during alveolar septation in lung development. The objective of this study was to identify genes regulated by methylation during normal septation in mice and during disordered septation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In mice, newborn lungs (preseptation) and adult lungs (postseptation) were evaluated by microarray analysis of gene expression and immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). In humans, microarray gene expression data were integrated with genome-wide DNA methylation data from bronchopulmonary dysplasia versus preterm and term lung. Genes with reciprocal changes in expression and methylation, suggesting regulation by DNA methylation, were identified. In mice, 95 genes with inverse correlation between expression and methylation during normal septation were identified. In addition to genes known to be important in lung development (Wnt signaling, Angpt2, Sox9, etc.) and its extracellular matrix (Tnc, Eln, etc.), genes involved with immune and antioxidant defense (Stat4, Sod3, Prdx6, etc.) were also observed. In humans, 23 genes were differentially methylated with reciprocal changes in expression in bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with preterm or term lung. Genes of interest included those involved with detoxifying enzymes (Gstm3) and transforming growth factor-beta signaling (bone morphogenetic protein 7 [Bmp7]). In terms of overlap, 20 genes and three pathways methylated during mouse lung development also demonstrated changes in methylation between preterm and term human lung. Changes in methylation correspond to altered expression of a number of genes associated with lung development, suggesting that DNA methylation of these genes may regulate normal and abnormal alveolar septation.","group":"g3","id":"08f39063-16e8-4b74-93bc-1919dbf7836d","_showDetails":true},"7fe21558-c16e-410b-b880-521e9d8c4fb9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71124568","title":"New modalities of respiratory support in the preterm infant","authors":["Bancalari E."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*infant","*human","*prematurity","*perinatal care","*assisted ventilation","ventilator","patient","tidal volume","airway pressure","air conditioning","artificial ventilation","breathing rate","weaning","breathing","pressure support ventilation","gas","respiratory system","apnea","risk","endotracheal tube","hyperventilation","lung dysplasia","hypercapnia","lower respiratory tract","newborn","breathing pattern","sensor","oxygen therapy","runaway behavior","positive end expiratory pressure","cardiovascular effect","injury","intubation","extubation","nose breathing","therapy","respiratory distress syndrome","oxygen","water"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"39","number":"SUPPL. 1\nSP  -","publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co.

PATIENT TRIGGERED VENTILATION (PTV) The aim of PTV is that each mechanical breath be triggered by the infant's own inspiratory effort achieving synchronization between the patient and the ventilator. Different signals have been used for triggering the ventilator but currently the most common sensors are those detecting flow. During PTV the infant determines his/her own respiratory rate and tidal volumes are generated with lower airway pressures than during non-synchronized ventilation. By eliminating asynchrony between patient and ventilator, PTV may reduce the risk of mechanical trauma and minimize the cardiovascular effects of positive pressure ventilation. PTV facilitates weaning and can shorten the duration of oxygen therapy and IPPV in preterm infants. Types of Patient Triggered Ventilation Synchronized IMV (S-IMV): During S-IMV the patient can trigger a preset number of mechanical breaths each minute and maintains spontaneous breathing during the intervals. The ventilator provides a back up rate if apnea occurs. The airway pressure and duration of inspiration are determined by the operator. Assist - Control (AC): During AC each inspiratory effort triggers the ventilator and is mechanically supported. The ventilator also provides a preset back up rate when apnea occurs. The airway pressure is determined by the operator while the inspiratory time can be set by the operator or in some ventilators it can be terminated when inspiratory flow falls to a predetermined level. Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV): This mode is similar to assist-control and the ventilator is triggered by each inspiratory effort but the inspiration is terminated when the flow delivered to the infant decreases to a predetermined level. This strategy can be used to unload the respiratory system with minimal interference with the spontaneous timing of the respiratory cycle. This method has been shown to facilitate weaning and reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates. Possible drawbacks of PTV The high mechanical respiratory rate generated during assist control or pressure support ventilation can result in gas trapping and higher mean airway pressure increasing the risk for baro or volutrauma. Irregular respiratory rate from the infant can result in larger fluctuations in PaO2 and PaCO2. The pneumotachographs used to trigger the ventilator add dead space and this may produce CO2 retention in the smaller infants. Low sensitivity may result in lack or delayed triggering while excessive sensitivity may cause autotriggering resulting in runaway mechanical rate, hyperventilation, and gas trapping. This occurs when there are large leaks around the endotracheal tube or there is water condensation in the ventilator circuit. OTHER MODALITIES: Volume Targeted Ventilation (VTV): Newer ventilators measure the volume delivered to the patient as well as the expired tidal volume and continuously adjust the peak inspiratory pressure to maintain a preset expired tidal volume constant. This mode allows a significant reduction in PIP when the infant is able to generate a preset tidal volume by his own. On the other hand, it increases airway pressure to maintain a constant tidal volume when the infant does not make enough effort or when the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system change. Nasal Ventilation: Noninvasive SIMV (N-SIMV) has been used as means of improving weaning success and avoiding mechanical ventilation.

We lack standardized reference data from a large normative population making applicability of research and clinical data difficult. Our objective was to evaluate the actual use of ILF testing worldwide and to query users regarding the indications, limitations and perceived clinical benefit of testing. Method(s): We created an English language 27-item questionnaire linked to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) websites to be completed by medical directors of ILF laboratories. The questionnaire collected demographic information, ILF testing indications, patient populations, equipment, reference data and perceived limitations. We contacted pediatric respirologists worldwide to complete the survey using distribution lists from the ATS/ERS Infant Preschool Lung Function Working Group and the ATS Pediatric Assembly. Result(s): 148 respondents completed the survey representing 117 individual institutions. Most respondents were from Europe and the United States (76%). 118 (80%) had the capability to perform ILF testing, which was performed for research only in 20%, clinical studies only in 23%, and both in 57% of labs. Sites performing research studies only did not respond to questions regarding clinical ILF testing. Most centers use commercially available ILF devices (67%) with 18 different reference data sets. The most common patient populations to undergo ILF testing were: cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, recurrent wheezing, and interstitial lung disease. The majority of labs (45%) reported performing 10-50 clinical studies/year. Starting a new therapy was the most common clinical intervention based on ILF results. There were many factors limiting referral for clinical ILF testing including: need for sedation, uncertainty regarding clinical impact of study results, time intensive nature of the procedure and lack of formal guidelines for interpreting the data. Conclusion(s): Clinical practice and laboratory standards vary significantly regardless of geographic location or equipment. Though most centers stated that there is clinical benefit in acquiring ILF data, sedation, effort and lack of formal guidelines limit the number of studies performed. Prospective collection of all internationally available ILF data in healthy infants would significantly advance our understanding of lung growth and development in early life and facilitate the generation of technique specific reference values.","group":"g1","id":"ba1ad100-a327-4b36-8645-6c3a9c3a8182","_showDetails":true},"c1a0aa41-1c8b-4530-a960-e33e758a418c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70849326","title":"Notch signaling in cord blood derived Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPC)","authors":["Balasubramaniam V.","Ryan S.L.","Nuanez B.","Baker C.D.","Abman S.H."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*umbilical cord blood","*endothelial progenitor cell","*society","hyperoxia","prematurity","exposure","lung dysplasia","flow cytometry","tissue repair","lung","phenotype","endothelium cell","chronic lung disease","population","ambient air","cell growth","Western blotting","injury","drug megadose","messenger RNA","protein","marker","oxygen","gamma secretase inhibitor","Jagged1"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"V.

EPCs play a role in tissue repair after injury and can be cultured from peripheral umbilical cord blood. Late outgrowth EPCs (ECFCs) are a heterogeneous population capable of self-renewal and exhibit an endothelial cell phenotype. We have shown that ECFCs from preterm infants exposed to hyperoxia have impaired growth. ECFC organization suggests involvement of intercellular signaling or lateral fate inhibition that is mediated by the Notch pathway. We hypothesize that Notch signaling is necessary in EPC growth and function. Method(s): ECFCs were isolated from the umbilical cord blood of term and preterm infants. Cells were characterized for endothelial markers by flow cytometry. Term and preterm ECFCs were plated at 50 % confluence and growth was assessed over 7 days in room air and 50% oxygen. Cell lysates were collected for protein and mRNA. Western blot analysis was performed for Notch1 & 2, Jag1 and Dll4. qPCR was performed on mRNA. Cell growth was measured in the presence and absence of gamma-secretase inhibitor (DAPT; 0.5 uM & 0.75 uM) to block Notch signaling. Result(s): Preterm ECFCs growth increased by 25% as compared to term ECFCs (p<0.01). Hyperoxia decreased preterm ECFCs number by 40% and had no effect on term ECFCs (p<0.05). Notch1, Jag1 and Dll4 protein was increased by 50%, 65% and 70%, respectively (p<0.01) in preterm ECFCs compared to term. Notch 2 was increased by 55% in term ECFCs as compared to preterm (p<0.01). Hyperoxia exposure decreased Notch1, Jag1 & Dll4 protein in preterm ECFCs. Hyperoxia increased Notch1 and Jag1 protein in term ECFCs. There was a 2.5-fold increase in Hes1 expression in preterm vs. term ECFCs. (p<0.01) Hyperoxia decreased Hes1 and Hey1 mRNA by 2.8 and 3.4-fold (p<0.01). In a dose dependent manner, high dose DAPT treatment decreased term ECFC growth by 76% and preterm ECFC growth by 50% (p<0.01) Conclusion(s): Notch signaling is increased in preterm ECFCs as compared to term ECFCs. Hyperoxia exposure decreases Notch signaling in preterm ECFCs, but increases Notch in term ECFCs. Inhibition of Notch signaling impaired growth of both term and preterm ECFCs. We conclude that Notch signaling is important in ECFC growth and that impaired Notch signaling may be involved in the impaired growth of preterm ECFCs with exposure to hyperoxia.","group":"g1","id":"c1a0aa41-1c8b-4530-a960-e33e758a418c","_showDetails":true},"353fdeab-4807-44b5-901b-9b31483bb540":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70848511","title":"Transcriptional profiling of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) tissue reveals changes in the IGF1 pathway and mast cell accumulation are associated with disease pathogenesis","authors":["Bhattacharya S.","Srisuma S.","Solleti S.K.","Krenitsky D.","Huyck H.L.","Gascon J.L.","Parnell V.","Metlay L.","Mariani T.J.","Pryhuber G.S."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*tissues","*mast cell","*pathogenesis","*society","gene","lung parenchyma","genome","human","airway","Student t test","disease marker","immunohistochemistry","diagnosis","morbidity","tissue structure","premature labor","death","DNA damage","blood","cell cycle regulation","meconium aspiration","lung disease","respiratory distress syndrome","DNA","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.

Although recent progress has been made in the identification of diagnostic and potentially mechanistic disease markers, particularly from airway washings or peripheral blood, we currently lack a thorough understanding of the cellular and molecular defects that underly disease processes. This lack of understanding restricts attempts to reduce its incidence and impact. Method(s): Lung tissue samples from 28 subjects (including 11 BPD and 17 non-BPD) were harvested within 6 hours of death, following a standardized protocol to retain tissue structure and molecular integrity. Whole lung tissue RNA from each sample was interrogated for genome-wide expression using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for pathway and network analyses of differentially expressed genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify pre-defined gene sets that were statistically significant between BPD samples and controls. Global validation of array-based differential expression was carried out using quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Result(s): A total of 159 genes met test criteria for differential expression (T-Test p <0.05 and Fold Change >= 2) between 11 BPD cases and 9 non-BPD controls (5 no lung disease, 3 mild RDS, 1 meconium aspiration), and were considered for pathways analysis. The top dysregulated canonical pathways in BPD involved cell cycle control associated with DNA damage, and immune-related signaling, consistent with prior knowledge of disease-related processes. Thirty-one of these 159 genes (~20%) could be linked through a single network with IGF1 as the central node. GSEA also identified multiple IGF1-related gene sets significantly associated (p<0.05) with BPD. We confirmed significant increases in IGF1 expression in our BPD tissue, similar to previous reports. When ranked for magnitude of effect, 3 of the 5 top genes (and 9 of the top 26 probe sets) were mast cell-specific. IHC confirmed increased accumulation of mast cell in BPD tissues, particularly within the lung parenchyma. Summary: We have generated a unique set of genome-wide expression profiling data from human BPD and age matched control lung tissue. Using standard pathways analysis approaches, we were able to identify previously known, as well as novel processes associated with disease pathogenesis. Further analysis of these data should significantly expand our knowledge of BPD, and may be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","group":"g2","id":"353fdeab-4807-44b5-901b-9b31483bb540","_showDetails":true},"1ab2e825-cb74-46bd-87c6-aca01e03432d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70848507","title":"Prenatal administration of rosiglitazone to rat pups does not alter the adult metabolic phenotype","authors":["Rehan V.K.","Sierra H.","Liu J.","Sakurai R.","Truong N.","Lee R.","Lee W.P.","Torday J.S."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*rat","*adult","*phenotype","*society","fetus lung maturity","plasma","lung","fatty acid synthesis","hybridization","agonist","insulin tolerance test","Sprague Dawley rat","skeletal muscle","liver","safety","mass spectrometry","body weight","lung dysplasia","fetus lung maturation","therapy","statistical significance","assay","glucose tolerance test","infant","mare","*rosiglitazone","insulin","deuterium oxide","glucagon","glucose","cholesterol","dexamethasone","deuterium","triacylglycerol","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma","marker","adipophilin","drinking water","troponin I","troponin","diluent","protein A"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"V.K.

However, its long-term safety has not been documented. Objective(s): To study the metabolic profiles of adult rats exposed prenatally to RGZ. Method(s): Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rat dams were administered either diluent, RGZ (0.3mg/kg), RGZ (3mg/kg), or dexamethasone (0.25mg/kg), intraperitoneally once daily x 2 doses, 24h apart, starting at embryonic day 18. At 11-12 wks of age, glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed after a 12h fast (glucose administered at 1g/kg intraperitoneally, and insulin administered at 1U/kg subcutaneously). De novo fatty acid synthesis was analyzed by deuterium incorporation [99.9% deuterated water (D2O)]. D2O was injected intraperitoneally once at a dose equivalent to 4% of body weight, followed by free access to drinking water containing 6% D2O for 7 days] and mass spectrometry analysis of plasma samples at 14 wks. At 15 wks, the animals were sacrificed and lungs, liver, skeletal muscle and fat were collected for Western hybridization for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a marker of lung maturity, and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), a key down-stream functional target of PPARgamma. Plasma was assayed for triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon and troponin-I. Result(s): Insulin and glucose tolerance tests were not different between the control and experimental groups. Deuterium incorporation studies showed no significant differences in de novo fatty acid synthesis, and Western hybridization showed equal expression of PPARgamma and ADRP. Similarly, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon and troponin-I assays revealed no significant differences among all 4 groups, (all p values > 0.05) Conclusion(s): Treatment with the PPARgamma agonist RGZ in early neonatal life does not alter developmental metabolic programming, and does not lead to an altered metabolic phenotype in the adult, further re-enforcing the safe use of PPARgamma agonists as a novel lung-protective strategy. We speculate that RGZ therapy is a safe, effective alternative to dexamethasone for accelerating lung maturation and in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the permature infant.","group":"g1","id":"1ab2e825-cb74-46bd-87c6-aca01e03432d","_showDetails":true},"70564d92-306a-4b75-b847-e83e8878d946":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70848266","title":"A polymorphism in manganese superoxide dismutase is associated with the presence and severity of lung disease in neonates","authors":["Hurley E.","Aland K.","Calo J.M.","Chhabra D.","Mendoza E.","Strassberg S.","Parton L.A."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*lung disease","*newborn","*society","allele","mitochondrion","lung dysplasia","asthma","lung cancer","risk factor","single nucleotide polymorphism","cardiomyopathy","wild type","neoplasm","diseases","necrotizing enterocolitis","prematurity","real time polymerase chain reaction","chromosome aberration","infant","supplementation","Caucasian","lung","health","baby","genotype","intestine necrosis","risk","*manganese superoxide dismutase","oxygen","enzyme","surfactant","antioxidant","genomic DNA","reactive oxygen metabolite","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"E.

Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is an important antioxidant enzyme, which is encoded by genomic DNA but functions in the mitochondria. Some have hypothesized having the T-allele for the rs4880 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the targeting sequence of the enzyme affects the efficiency of transport into the mitochondria. The T-allele has been linked to cardiomyopathy. The wild-type, C-allele has been linked to various cancers, neuronal disorders and asthma. Both alleles have been found to be associated with lung cancer. We hypothesize that having at least one copy of the C-allele of the rs4880 SNP increases the likelihood and severity of BPD. Method(s): DNA was isolated from buccal mucosal swabs (N=193). Infants were enrolled who weighed <1 kg at birth and had no congenital or chromosomal abnormalities. Real-time PCR discriminated alleles for the rs4880 SNP. BPD is graded by the need for oxygen at 36 weeks PMA. Mild BPD is need for supplemental oxygen at 28 DOL but no supplementation needed at 36 weeks PMA. Moderate BPD means FiO2 of <0.3 at 36 weeks PMA while severe means FiO2 is >0.3 at 36 week PMA. Result(s): We found near significant correlation for the presence and severity of BPD for subjects with the CC/CT allele compared to the TT-allele: (Table Presented) Caucasian subjects with at least one C-allele were more likely to have BPD (P=0.018) and if they do have BPD then it tended to be more severe (P=0.001). There was no similar correlation for nonwhite subjects. We also found significance for subjects requiring surfactant: CC vs. CT/TT (P=0.05). This is an indirect measurement of lung health in babies. Subjects with at least one copy of the C-allele received significantly more doses of surfactant: 1.34 vs. 1.05 (P=0.038). For secondary findings, we found subjects with CC genotype were more likely to have necrotizing enterocolitis, a condition in premature infants that results in intestinal necrosis (P=0.02). Conclusion(s): Subjects with at least one C-allele for the rs4880 SNP seem more susceptible to BPD. Moreover, if they have BPD, it is likely more severe. The rs4880 SNP is a candidate for inclusion in a potential genetic panel to screen neonates at risk for BPD.","group":"g1","id":"70564d92-306a-4b75-b847-e83e8878d946","_showDetails":true},"0ad3da88-4287-432a-99e0-f0eaa23422a4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70848255","title":"Sildenafil blocks myofibroblastic differentiation of neonatal lung mesenchymal cells in vitro and in vivo","authors":["Bentley J.K.","Popova A.P.","Linn M.J.","Lei J.","Goldsmith A.M.","Hershenson M.B."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*lung","*mesenchyme cell","*in vitro study","*society","myofibroblast","human","hyperoxia","mouse","model","membrane","agonist","lung disease","lung dysplasia","extracellular matrix","mesenchymal stroma cell","cell type","rat","fibrosing alveolitis","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","pulmonary hypertension","fibrin deposition","pneumonia","mortality","prematurity","immunofluorescence","immunocytochemistry","Western blotting","chronic lung disease","gene","gene expression","phosphorylation","*sildenafil","cyclic GMP","guanylate cyclase","actin","marker","lificiguat","8 (4 chlorophenylthio) cyclic GMP","phosphodiesterase inhibitor","smooth muscle actin","messenger RNA","elastin","natriuretic peptide type C","glycogen synthase kinase 3"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.B.

BPD lungs show greater numbers of alpha-actin-expressing myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts localize to fibrotic foci and are the main cell type responsible for extracellular matrix deposition and structural remodeling in fibrotic lung diseases. The cyclic guanosine 3',5' monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil attenuates hyperoxia-induced pulmonary inflammation, fibrin deposition, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, hypoalveolarization and mortality in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal rats, a model of BPD. Activation of soluble guanylate cyclase has also been noted to inhibit myofibroblastic differentiation in vitro. Objective(s): We hypothesized that sildenafil inhibits TGF-beta-induced myofibroblastic differentiation of human neonatal lung mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We also hypothesized that agents that activate membrane-bound or cytosolic guanylate cyclase potentiate the action of sildenafil. Design/Methods: MSCs were differentiated to myofibroblasts by the addition of TGF-beta or LiCl, an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta. In addition, we developed a mouse model of BPD by exposing 2 day-old mice to 75% O2 for 14 days. Gene expression was monitored by Illumina gene chip analysis, qPCR, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence. Result(s): TGF-beta treatment increased neonatal lung MSC mRNA expression of myofibroblast markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and elastin (ELN), whereas sildenafil lowered expression of these markers. Incorporation of alpha-actin into contractile filaments was also inhibited by sildenafil, particularly in the presence of a cGMP analog, 8- (4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine- 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cGMP), the membrane-bound guanlyate cyclase agonist C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), or the soluble guanylate cyclase agonist YC-1. The combination of sildenafil and 8-CPT-cGMP also blocked both TGF-beta- and LiCl-stimulated GSK-3beta phosphorylation. Finally, sildenafil treatment attenuated hyperoxia-induced myofibroblast differentiation in vivo. Conclusion(s): Sildenafil blocks human neonatal lung myofibroblastic differentiation in vitro and mouse lung myofibroblastic differentiation in vivo. The effect of sildenafil is potentiated by agents which increase cGMP. Sildenafil also appears to maintain GSK-3beta in a dephosphorylated state. Use of sildenafil and agents that raise cGMP may attenuate myofibroblastic differentiation in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"0ad3da88-4287-432a-99e0-f0eaa23422a4","_showDetails":false},"5c17231b-576a-4a69-8290-50374d45d668":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70848254","title":"Ambrisentan prolongs survival by attenuating pulmonary hypertension, fibrin deposition and right ventricular hypertrophy in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury","authors":["Wagenaar G.T.","De Visser Y.P.","Laghmani E.","Walther F.J."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*survival","*pulmonary hypertension","*fibrin deposition","*heart right ventricle hypertrophy","*lung injury","*society","model","hyperoxia","lung","vascularization","rat","injury","inflammation","lung dysplasia","macrophage","neutrophil","blood vessel","prematurity","chronic lung disease","arteriole","thickness","gene","histopathology","heart","newborn period","parameters","exposure","ambient air","adverse drug reaction","*ambrisentan","messenger RNA","amphiregulin","nonoxinol 9","endothelin 1","marker","plasminogen activator inhibitor 1","oxygen","chemoattractant","chemokine","interleukin 6","sodium chloride","vasoconstrictor agent","thromboplastin","endothelin receptor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"G.T.

Method(s): We determined the cardiopulmonary effects of ambrisentan in neonatal rats with hyperoxia-induced lung injury, a valuable model for premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Ambrisentan treatment was investigated in 2 models of experimental BPD: a prophylactic model, in which pups were continuously exposed to hyperoxia and treated daily with either saline or ambrisentan (20 mg/kg body weight/day; injected subcutaneously), and an injury-recovery model, in which pups were exposed to hyperoxia for 9 days, followed by 9 days of recovery in room-air and treatment with ambrisentan was started on day 6 of oxygen exposure and continued during the recovery period. Parameters investigated include survival, lung and heart histopathology, fibrin deposition, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in inflammation, coagulation and alveolar enlargement. Result(s): In the prophylactic model treatment with ambrisentan improved survival (p <0.01) by reducing lung fibrin deposition (3-fold, p <0.001) and medial wall thickness of small arterioles as a marker for PAH (1.7-fold, p <0.001), and preventing associated RVH (p <0.001). Treatment with ambrisentan did not have beneficial effects on alveolar enlargement (mean linear intercept and number of alveolar crests), vascularisation (blood vessel counts) and the pulmonary influx of macrophages and neutrophils. Ambrisentan decreased mRNA expression of amphiregulin, but did not have an effect on the differential expression of interleukin-6, chemokine-induced neutrophilic chemoattractant-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and tissue factor. In the injury-recovery model treatment with ambrisentan attenuated PAH and RVH (p <0.001), demonstrating that established PAH-induced RVH is still reversible in the neonatal period. Beneficial effects on reduced vascularisation and alveolarization were absent.

Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10), an important growth factor that regulates lung branching and alveolarization, is decreased in BPD. Since our laboratory has recently shown that, in a rat model, BPD can be prevented by PPARgamma agonists such as prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2 ), we hypothesized that PGJ2 up-regulates FGF-10 signaling. Objective(s): To determine the effects of FGF-10 on alveolar fibroblast differentiation and determine if PGJ2 blocks hyperoxia-induced changes in FGF-10 signaling. Method Used: To determine the effects of FGF-10 on alveolar fibroblast differentiation, both day 19 fetal rat lung fibroblasts and embryonic human lung fibroblasts (WI38 cells) were treated with FGF-10 (1, 10, 50, 100 ng/ml) for 24h. Following which, markers of fibroblast differentiation (PPARgamma, ADRP, SREBP1c, aP2, leptin and triolein uptake) were analyzed. In a separate set of experiments, neonatal Sprague Dawley rat pups were categorized in the following groups: normoxia (control, 21%O2), normoxia + PGJ2 (0.3mg/kg), hyperoxia (exposure to 95%O2 for 7d), hyperoxia + PGJ2 (0.3mg/kg). PGJ2 was administered intraperitoneally once daily. At the end of the experimental period, the pups were killed and protein extracted from whole lung samples. Using Western blotting, we probed for FGF-10, FGF receptor 2, PPARgamma, ADRP, leptin, fibronectin, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3. Result(s): FGF10-treated fibroblasts showed dose-dependent increases in markers of fibroblast differentiation. Under in vivo conditions, PGJ 2 blocked hyperoxia-induced decreases in FGF-10, PPARgamma, leptin and increases in FGF-receptor 2 and fibronectin levels. Furthermore, hyperoxia-induced changes in apoptotic markers (increases in Bax and cleaved caspase 3 and a decrease in Bcl-2) were also blocked by PGJ2 treatment. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate that hyperoxia-induced down-regulation of FGF-10 signaling and an increased apoptosis were blocked by PGJ2. We speculate a direct interaction between the FGF-10 and PPARgamma signaling pathways in the maintenance of alveolar growth and differentiation.","group":"g1","id":"a53a1c75-3bfd-437a-817d-f71602357dad","_showDetails":true},"7fa5d929-6aa8-4780-8eb2-6d2e42750f1b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70848251","title":"Hyperoxia decreases junctional proteins and promotes extracellular matrix in alveolar epithelial cells","authors":["Vyas-Read S.","Colvocoresses-Dodds J.","Gauthier T.W.","Brown L."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*extracellular matrix","*lung alveolus epithelium","*society","lung","exposure","lung dysplasia","prematurity","protein expression","ambient air","immunofluorescence","mouse","cell junction","immunoblotting","pathogenesis","phenotype","oxidative stress","lung injury","risk","down regulation","*protein","uvomorulin","messenger RNA","occludin","claudin 18","vimentin","smooth muscle actin","alpha smooth muscle actin","oxygen","fibronectin","collagen type 5","collagen type 1"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.

The down-regulation of junctional contacts between alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) is associated with a fibroproliferative response to lung injury. We examined how chronic hyperoxia exposure affects expression of junctional epithelial proteins and contributes to extracellular matrix expression. Method(s): To assess changes in the lungs of animals exposed to oxygen in vivo, C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to room air or hyperoxic conditions (85%) for 5 days and the harvested lung was analyzed by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. To specifically evaluate the effects of hyperoxia on type II AEC, RLE-6TN were cultured under control or hyperoxia conditions (85%) for 5 days and epithelial and mesenchymal proteins were evaluated by immunofluorescence and immunoblot. Result(s): The lungs of hyperoxia-exposed animals had 20% less E-cadherin and 40% less occludin mRNA when compared with controls (p=0.03). Whereas type II AEC cultured in room air expressed E-cadherin at cellular junctions, hyperoxia-exposed type II cells had minimal detectable E-cadherin protein and had 70% less claudin 18 protein expression. The lungs of hyperoxia-exposed animals had 1.8 times as much collagen Ialpha2, 2.1times as much collagen 5alpha2 (p=0.03), and 3.1 times as much fibronectin mRNA (p=0.01) as control animals. Alpha-smooth muscle actin, which was not detectable in the alveolar space of control animal lung, was expressed in the alveoli of hyperoxia-exposed animals. In culture, hyperoxia-exposed type II AEC expressed 3 times as much alpha-smooth muscle actin (p=0.002) and 1.9 times as much vimentin as controls (p=0.04). Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia exposure decreases normal alveolar junctional integrity and promotes extracellular matrix deposition in the type II AEC and in the mouse lung. A better understanding of the mechanistic relationship between oxidative stress, junctional protein expression and mesenchymal phenotype may have significant implications for preterm infants at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"7fa5d929-6aa8-4780-8eb2-6d2e42750f1b","_showDetails":true},"d7ad822d-a57e-4f58-9c07-9a56edc0998a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Foxm1 regulates resolution of hyperoxic lung injury in newborns.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2014-0091OC","authors":["Xia, Hongping","Ren, Xiaomeng","Bolte, Craig S","Ustiyan, Vladimir","Zhang, Yufang","Shah, Tushar A","Kalin, Tanya V","Whitsett, Jeffrey A","Kalinichenko, Vladimir V"],"date":"2015//","keywords":["Airway Remodeling","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Case-Control Studies","Cathepsin G/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Forkhead Box Protein M1","Forkhead Transcription Factors/ge [Genetics]","*Forkhead Transcription Factors/me [Metabolism]","Humans","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Infant, Newborn","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","*Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Lung Injury/pp [Physiopathology]","Macrophages/me [Metabolism]","Mice, Knockout","Myeloblastin/me [Metabolism]","Neutrophils/me [Metabolism]","Peroxidase/me [Metabolism]","Pneumonia/et [Etiology]","*Pneumonia/me [Metabolism]","Pneumonia/pa [Pathology]","Pneumonia/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"52","number":"5","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25275225"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Current treatments for inflammation associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) fail to show clinical efficacy.

Immunohistochemistry and RNA analysis were used to assess Foxm1 in lung tissue from hyperoxia-treated mice and patients with BPD. LysM-Cre/Foxm1(-/-) mice, in which Foxm1 was deleted from myeloid-derived inflammatory cells, including macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, were exposed to neonatal hyperoxia, causing lung injury and remodeling.

Increased Foxm1 expression was observed in pulmonary macrophages of hyperoxia-exposed mice and in lung tissue from patients with BPD. After hyperoxia, deletion of Foxm1 from the myeloid cell lineage decreased numbers of interstitial macrophages (CD45(+)CD11b(+)Ly6C(-)Ly6G(-)F4/80(+)CD68(-)) and impaired alveologenesis and lung function.

Case series describe early onset emphysema in young adults with BPD. Both diseases remain without effective therapy. Recent evidence suggest that lung angiogenesis promotes normal lung development and repair: we showed that VEGF preserves lung angiogenesis and alveolarization in experimental O2-induced BPD in newborn rats, a model of arrested alveolar growth. Combined VEGF+Angiopoietin 1 gene transfer corrects VEGF-induced vessel leakiness, highlighting the tightly orchestrated process of angiogenesis. The transcription factor HIF activates O2-sensitive genes, including angiogenic genes. By inducing the expression of not just a single, but a range of angiogenic factors in a coordinated fashion, HIF may orchestrate efficient and safe angiogenesis superior to VEGF. We hypothesized that disruption of HIF impairs alveolarization and HIF prevents irreversible alveolar destruction in O2-induced BPD. METHOD(S): HIF was blocked by using intratracheal dominant negative adenovirus (AdHif(dn)) at P4 during normal rat lung development. Experimental BPD was induced by exposing newborn rat pups from birth to 95% O2. In vivo intratracheal administration of AdHif was used to test HIF's therapeutic potential. RESULT(S): In vivo AdHif(dn) led to air space enlargement and arrested lung vascular growth, mimicking BPD. In experimental O2-induced BPD in newborn rats, the characteristic features of air space enlargement and loss of lung capillaries were associated with decreased lung HIF expression. Intratracheal administration of AdHif restored HIF, eNOS, VEGF, VEGFR2 and Tie2 expression and preserved alveolar and vascular growth in hyperoxic rats. CONCLUSION(S): HIF promotes normal alveolar development and may be a useful target to prevent arrested alveolar growth.","group":"g1","id":"6f2af7f7-8f25-4004-91c1-fc6811b008f8","_showDetails":true},"f46ce628-1571-4e35-85ca-399d54edefc8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70848007","title":"Characterization of human fetal airway smooth muscle cells: An in vitro model system for the developing airway","authors":["Hartman W.R.","Thompson M.A.","Prakash Y.","Pandya H.","Amrani Y.","Pabelick C.M."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*airway","*human","*model","*in vitro study","*society","*smooth muscle fiber","serum","cell proliferation","respiratory tract disease","assay","gestational age","diseases","lung dysplasia","trachea","hyperoxia","lung development","health care facility","medical research","ethics","lipid raft","agonist","fibroblast","examination","inflammation","newborn","prematurity","myosin heavy chain","histamine","vimentin","smooth muscle actin","ryanodine receptor","calcium","cyclodextrin","caffeine","protein","uvomorulin"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"W.R.

Calcium regulation was examined in cells in 96 well plates that were serum deprivation for 24h, 48 or 72h and loaded with fluo-4/AM. Serum-deprived fASM cells showed robust [Ca2+]i responses to 1 muM ACh and 10 muM histamine, that were only partially blunted by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Smaller, yet robust transient responses to 5 mM caffeine persisted in zero extracellular Ca2+. Depletion of lipid rafts with 10 mM methyl-beta-cyclodextrin substantially blunted [Ca2+]i responses to agonist. Immunoblots of fASM lysates showed substantial expression of smooth muscle actin and myosin heavy chain, vimentin and IP3 and ryanodine receptors (RyR), but absence of fibroblast specific protein and E-cadherin. Cellular proliferation, measured using CyQuant assay, was robust in serum (enhanced PCNA expression), but was minimal in serum-deprived cells, with sustained viability until 96h.

Platelet derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A), which solely signals through PDGF-receptor-alpha (PDGF-Ralpha) is required, although the relevant downstream targets of the receptor remain incompletely defined. We have evaluated the differential response to the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which is selective for PDGF-receptors and Abelson kinase (Abl, which are present) and ckit (which is absent) in LF. HYPOTHESIS: Diminished signaling through PDGF-Ralpha-mediated pathways regulates the decline in myofibroblasts, which accompanies alveolar septal thinning, and ensures more efficient alveolar gas-exchange. METHOD(S): Mice, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) regulated by the endogenous PDGR-Ralpha-promoter enabled spatial and temporal identification of PDGF-Ralpha gene expression using confocal microscopy and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). We compared PDGFRalpha-LF (GFP present, GFP+) to their non-expressing LF counterparts (GFP-) in these mice. Lung fibroblast sub-populations were quantified using FACS, and PDGF-Ralpha-expressing (GFP+) LF were enumerated using the optical fractionator. RESULT(S): Using FACS we observed that administering imatinib for 4 days reduced proliferation to 44 +/- 17 and 98 +/- 16 % (mean +/- SEM, p<0.05) in GFP+ and GFP- LF, respectively, compared to control mice that received no imatinib. Apoptotic LF comprised 17.7 +/- 1.2 and 7.7 +/- 0.2 % (p<0.01) of GFP- and GFP+ sub-populations, respectively and imatinib treatment rendered GFP+ LF as susceptible to apoptosis as GFP- LF. Using quantitative stereology we observed 5.2 +/- 0.2 and 3.9 +/- 0.3 x 107 GFP+ cells per lung in untreated and imatinib-treated mice, repectively (P<0.01). Imatinib significantly reduced the number of alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) producing, GFP+ LF, but it did not directly reduce alphaSMA-gene expression. Imatinib did not suppress PDGF-Ralpha gene expression in cultured LF but it reduced PDGF-A mediated Akt phosphorylation by 75%, potentially explaining the increase in apoptosis. Imatinib significantly diminished arithmetic mean alveolar wall thickness at posnatal day 14. CONCLUSION(S): Imatinib negated the survival advantage, diminished proliferation in GFP+ LF, and accelerated wall thinning implicating signaling through PDGF-receptors and/or Abl. This suggests that a reduction in PDGF-Ralpha signaling may facilitate septal thinning during alveolar maturation. CLINICAL APPLICATION: Our findings are relevant to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in which positive pressure ventilation interferes with myofibroblast depletion, septal thinning, and capillary maturation. They are also relevant to alveolar septal atrophy and apoptosis in pulmonary emphysema.","group":"g1","id":"859c26de-78e7-4e85-bc18-2c8af7619210","_showDetails":true},"3ee966b6-f743-4227-abbd-d11e7b50e261":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70847846","title":"Pulmonary fibroblast Thy-1 expression modulates elastin expression during alveolarization - In part via rhoa activation of JNK","authors":["Varisco B.M.","Hagood J.S.","Kaminski N.","Whitsett J."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*society","*fibroblast","homeostasis","lung alveolus wall","lung dysplasia","computer program","mouse","microarray analysis","phenotype","gene","culture medium","assay","hypothesis","immunoprecipitation","*elastin","messenger RNA","glycoprotein","glycosylphosphatidylinositol","phentermine","protein","metalloproteinase","protein lysine 6 oxidase"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"B.M.

The mechanisms that regulate this localization are unknown. Thy-1 is a glycophosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein critical to pulmonary fibroblast phenotype. Similar to pulmonary histological patterns seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the Thy-1 -/- mouse exhibits diffuse subepithelial deposition of elastin and impaired alveolar development. We have shown that pulmonary fibroblast Thy-1 expression increases at the onset of alveolarization and that the Thy-1 (+) fibroblast localizes to the alveolar septal base. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the Thy-1 (+) fibroblast plays a key role in the localization of the elastin band to the tip of the developing alveolar septum and that the genes that regulate this localization are targets of Thy-1 signaling pathways. Method(s): (a) Microarray analysis using an Agilent platform and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software was performed in triplicate on murine pulmonary fibroblasts sorted for Thy-1 expression. Conditioned serum free media of sorted fibroblasts was analyzed for elastin content using the Fastin assay kit (BioColor). (b) Pathway analysis of likely mechanisms by which Thy-1 influences elastin homeostasis was undertaken, and JNK activation by RhoA was deemed a likely pathway. Thus, immunoprecipitation and analysis of phospho-c-Jun (Cell Signaling) was performed to determine JNK activity. Result(s): (a) Thy-1 (-) fibroblasts expressed 83.8 fold more elastin mRNA and 2.83 fold more elastin protein (p=0.001) than Thy-1 (+) fibroblasts. Thy-1 (+) fibroblasts expressed 6.1 fold more matrix metalloprotease-9 and 2.2 fold less lysyl oxidase mRNA than Thy-1 (-) fibroblasts. (b) Pathway analysis revealed that activation of JNK was a likely mechanism by which Thy-1 was modulating elastin homeostasis. As Thy-1 signaling is known to activate RhoA, and RhoA is a well described activator of JNK, we hypothesized that Thy-1 was acting through JNK to alter elastin homeostasis. Phospho-c-Jun could be detected only in Thy-1 (+) fibroblasts. Conclusion(s): During alveolarization, pulmonary fibroblast Thy-1 expression is key to elastin localization. Thy-1 activation of RhoA and JNK appears important in this process. Further studies involving inhibition and activation of these pathways are needed to confirm their critical role in alveolar elastin homeostasis.","group":"g1","id":"3ee966b6-f743-4227-abbd-d11e7b50e261","_showDetails":true},"b29f95a5-fd74-49c9-afa2-51792e91cb3f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70847051","title":"Periostin secretion from lung-derived mesenchymal cells participates in fibrotic lung disease","authors":["Bozyk P.D.","Popova A.P.","Bentley J.K.","Linn M.J.","Hershenson M.B.","Moore B.B."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*secretion","*lung","*mesenchyme cell","*lung disease","*society","human","patient","immunohistochemistry","lung fibroblast","protein expression","lung fibrosis","DNA synthesis","hyperoxia","exposure","mouse","university","model","gene expression","lung dysplasia","open lung biopsy","adult","extracellular matrix","respiratory distress syndrome","United States","newborn","tracheal aspiration procedure","mesenchymal stroma cell","cell proliferation","fibroblast","animal model","tissues","*transcription factor RUNX2","messenger RNA","bleomycin","protein","elastin","broxuridine","receptor","ligand","DNA","fibronectin","alpha smooth muscle actin","collagen","scleroprotein","matrix protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.D.

The matricellular protein periostin bindsand stabilizes the extracellular matrix while acting as a ligand for cellsurface receptors. We hypothesizea role for mesenchymal cell-derived periostin in fibrotic lung disease. To test this, we analyzed periostin expression in two murine models of lung fibrosis(bleomycin, neonatal hyperoxic exposure) and tissue from patients with eitheridiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We also examined effects of periostin treatment on mesenchymal cell gene expression and proliferation. METHOD(S): Bleomycin was intratracheally administered to C57BL/6 mice. Two day-old C57BL/6 mice were exposed to hyperoxia for up to 21 days. Lung matrix protein expression was assessed by quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoflourescence. Lung mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were collected from tracheal aspirates of neonates intubated for respiratory distress syndrome. Adult lung fibroblasts from normal and IPF lungs were obtained by open lung biopsy at the University of Michigan. Perostin mRNA expression in mesenchymal cells from IPF and BPD patients was compared to normal controls. Murine lung fibroblasts were exposed to recombinant periostin and mRNA expression assessed. The effect of recombinant periostin on MSC DNA synthesis was measured by BrdU incorporation. Lung periostin protein expression from patients with IPF or BPD was compared tonormal lung by immunohistochemistry. BPD lung samples were provided by GSPryhuber, University of Rochester. RESULT(S): Following bleomycin or hyperoxia exposure, qPCRshowed a significant increase in murine periostin mRNA. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased deposition of periostin protein in fibrotic foci of both models. Bleomycin lungs demonstrated increase of periostin, and co-localization with type I collagen, elastin and alpha-smooth muscle actin by immunoflourescence. Recombinant periostin caused significant and dose-dependent increases in murine lung fibroblast Col1A, elastin, and fibronectin mRNA expression. Recombinant periostin also increased DNA synthesis in neonatal MSCs. Compared to control cells, periostin mRNA expression was over 3-fold higher in IPF fibroblasts (p<0.005) and over 6-fold greater in neonatal lung MSCs (p<0.005). Finally, IPF and BPD lungs showed more periostin protein accumulation than normal controls by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION(S): We show in two animal models that periostin expression is increased in fibrotic lung disease.

We have isolated mesenchymal stromal cells from tracheal aspirates of premature infants undergoing mechanical ventilation. These cells differentiate to myofibroblasts under the influence of autocrine TGF-beta. Isolation of stromal cells from tracheal aspirates increases the relative risk of developing BPD over 20-fold, suggesting that these cells play a role in BPD pathogenesis. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is a constitutively-active kinase which phosphorylates beta-catenin, targets it for degradation, thereby preventing beta-catenin-mediated expression of myofibroblast genes including alpha-actin, collagen type I, Cyr61 and fibronectin. GSK-3beta phosphorylation inactivates it, allowing beta-catenin to accumulate in the cell, translocate to the nucleus, and activate gene expression. Objective(s): We hypothesized that myofibroblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells is accompanied by GSK-3beta phosphorylation and beta-catenin accumulation, and that similar events occur in the lungs of infants with BPD and hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice, a model of BPD. Method(s): Mesenchymal stromal cells were isolated from neonatal tracheal aspirates and treated with TGF-beta1, SB216763 or LiCl (GSK-3beta inhibitors). Selected cultures were transfected with a lentivirus encoding non-degradable beta-catenin (DELTAN beta-cat). Two day-old mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 days. Lung tissue from hyperoxic mice and human infants with BPD (University of Rochester Neonatal Lung Biorepository) were examined. Gene expression was analyzed by qPCR, immunoblot, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. Result(s): TGF-beta1 treatment increased neonatal lung mesenchymal stromal cell expression of a-actin, elastin and collagen I, consistent with myofibroblastic differentiation. TGF-beta1, LiCl and SB216763 increased phospho-GSK3beta content and beta-catenin nuclear localization. Transfection with DELTAN beta-cat was associated with increased nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and alpha-actin expression. Lungs of hyperoxia-exposed mice showed hypoalveolarization and alveolar wall thickening comprised of a-actin-, phospho-GSK-3beta-and beta-catenin-positive myofibroblasts. Flow cytometry of plastic-adherent cells from lungs of hyperoxia-exposed mice showed an increase in cells co-expressing high levels of alpha-actin, phospho-GSK-3beta and beta-catenin. Finally, lung tissue from babies with BPD showed thickened alveolar walls with clusters of alpha-actin-, phospho-GSK-3beta- and beta-catenin-positive myofibroblast-like cells. Conclusion(s): TGF-beta1 stimulates myofibroblastic differentiation, GSK-3beta phosphorylation and beta-catenin accumulation in cultured neonatal lung mesenchymal stromal cells. GSK-3beta inhibition and beta-catenin overexpression are sufficient for stromal cell myofibroblastic differentiation. Hyperoxia is associated with GSK-3beta phosphorylation, accumulation of beta-catenin and myofibroblastic differentiation of alveolar interstitial cells. GSK-3beta and beta-catenin represent molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"6eaa6dc2-ee3a-4875-86b3-725a73447308","_showDetails":true},"94a39910-c134-47e8-82ed-befb7a6a3727":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70845622","title":"Existence, functional impairment and therapeutic potential of endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) in oxygen-induced arrested alveolar growth","authors":["Alphonse R.","Vadivel A.","Waszak P.","Fung M.","Coltan L.","Eaton F.","Yoder M.C.","Thebaud B."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*colony forming cell","*society","*functional disease","lung","hyperoxia","rat","lung disease","angiogenesis","in vitro study","human","therapy","mouse","umbilical cord blood","lung function","pulmonary hypertension","injury","emphysema","lung dysplasia","supplementation","lung development","newborn","model","ambient air","endothelial progenitor cell","stem cell","morbidity","pulmonary artery","acceleration","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","*oxygen","matrigel","growth factor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"183","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"R.

Both conditions currently lack effective therapy. There is growing evidence that angiogenic growth factors, via promoting lung vasculogenesis, actively support alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance throughout postnatal life. However, the likely role of vascular progenitor cells (endothelial progenitor cells, EPCs) in lung growth and maintenance is unknown. OBJECTIVE(S): In this study, we examine the role of ECFCs, an EPC subtype capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation, during lung development and repair. We hypothesize that ECFC-driven angiogenesis contributes to normal lung alveolar growth and ECFC supplementation restores disrupted alveolar development in hyperoxia-induced BPD. METHOD(S): In vitro, we assessed the proliferative, clonogenic and vessel forming potentials of lung ECFCs isolated from newborn rats housed in 95% O2 (rat BPD model) vs. normoxic (room air) controls. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) ECFCs was assessed in immunocompromised rag-/- mice exposed to 85% O2 from Postnatal day- (P) 5 to 14 and sacrificed at P28. RESULT(S): ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic lungs proliferated less rapidly when cultured in vitro for 3 weeks. More strikingly, ECFCs from the hyperoxic group showed decreased clonogenic capacity (percentage of single ECFC capable of generating colonies after 14 days) and formed fewer endothelial networks in matrigel. Intra-jugular administration of hUCB-ECFCs on P14 improved lung function and preserved alveolar development in hyperoxia-exposed mouse pups. ECFC therapy also attenuated pulmonary hypertension, a co-morbidity commonly associated with severe BPD, assessed by improved pulmonary artery acceleration times and decreased right ventricular hypertrophy. CONCLUSION(S): Impaired ECFC function in hyperoxia-exposed rat pups could in part contribute to arrested alveolar growth in BPD. hUCB-derived ECFC may offer a new therapeutic avenue for lung diseases characterized by alveolar injury.","group":"g1","id":"94a39910-c134-47e8-82ed-befb7a6a3727","_showDetails":true},"c4778bdb-4be3-4b07-851e-d4bad84aff58":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70784016","title":"The caffeine for apnea of prematurity (CAP) trial: Outcomes at 5 years","authors":["Schmidt B.","Anderson P.J.","Doyle L.W.","Dewey D.","Grunau R.","Asztalos E.","Davis P.G.","Tin W.","Moddemann D.","Solimano A.","Ohlsson A.","Barrington K.","Roberts R.S.","Investigator C.A.P."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*newborn apnea","*society","therapy","human","infant","child","disability","survival","death","risk","motoneuron","cognition","safety","school","motor development","data base","follow up","birth weight","lung dysplasia","hearing","parent","Child Behavior Checklist","Wechsler intelligence scale","Gross Motor Function Classification System","health","*caffeine","placebo"],"journal":"Paediatrics and Child Health","language":"English","volume":"16","number":"SA","publisher":"Churchill Livingstone","isbn":"1751-7222","address":"B.

Caffeine-treated infants had a significantly decreased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (N Engl J Med 2006;354:2112), as well as an improved rate of survival without neurodevel- opmental impairment at 18 to 21 months corrected age (N Engl J Med 2007;357:1893). Objective(s): To reassess the CAP trial participants at a corrected age of 5 years in order to estimate more accurately the long-term effects of neonatal caffeine therapy, with particular emphasis on cognitive, behavioural and motor development. Design/Methods: The main outcome at age 5 years is a composite of death or survival with disability in at least one of 6 domains: cognition, neuromotor function, behavior, vision, hearing, and general health. Standardized tests included a thorough history and physical exam, application of the Gross Motor Function Classification System, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III), and the Child Behavior Checklist Parent Form. Result(s): All but 4 of the original study centers participated in this extended follow up. These 4 centers enrolled a total of 74 infants, leaving 1932 children eligible for inclusion in the present study. As of November 23, 2010, vital status has been ascertained for 1800 children or 93% of the eligible cohort and adequate data for the composite outcome of death or disability have been received at the data center for 1636 children (85%). The last two assessments are booked for early December 2010 and the database will be declared closed in early 2011. The final analyses will be completed by the end of April 2011. Conclusion(s): To date, the CAP trial has shown that the benefits of caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity outweigh any potential risks up to a corrected age of 18 to 21 months. However, several important potential long-term consequences of caffeine therapy may not become apparent until the study cohort reaches pre-school age. The present analysis will confirm or refute the longer-term safety of caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity.","group":"g1","id":"c4778bdb-4be3-4b07-851e-d4bad84aff58","_showDetails":true},"fcfecb13-37c9-4b01-a057-f25ce05b428a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70757488","title":"VEGF family growth factor ratio is abnormal in bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Bilko S.J.","Xiang L.","Liu L.","Lloyd P.G."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","pathogenesis","lung","prematurity","gene expression","Western blotting","rat","oxygen therapy","chronic lung disease","*growth factor","*vasculotropin","vasculotropin A","protein","messenger RNA"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"25","number":"Meeting Astracts\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"0892-6638","address":"S.J.

PLGF is a VEGF-family growth factor which can heterodimerize with VEGF-A and modulate VEGF-A signaling. Thus, changes in relative expression of VEGF-A and PLGF may be physiologically relevant. It is unknown if PLGF levels are altered in BPD. Thus, our goal was to determine whether the PLGF:VEGF ratio is altered in experimental BPD. We hypothesized that PLGF would increase, leading to a higher PLGF:VEGF ratio. To induce BPD, 3 d old neonatal rats were exposed to 95% O2 for 10 d. PLGF mRNA increased to 3.38 +/- 0.58 fold of control in BPD lungs (p<0.01), whereas VEGF-A mRNA decreased to 0.48 +/- 0.03 fold of control (p<0.01, N=3/group). Western blot confirmed reduced VEGF-A protein in BPD lungs (50% of control; p<0.05, N=5 control, 3 BPD). Surprisingly, PLGF protein was also slightly reduced, to 72% of control (p<0.05). However, the PLGF:VEGF ratio was mildly elevated in BPD (to 136% of control), due to the proportionally larger decrease in VEGF. Further studies are needed to determine whether this change in the PLGF:VEGF ratio contributes to the pathogenesis of BPD, and to characterize potential post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate PLGF protein levels independently of gene expression.","group":"g1","id":"fcfecb13-37c9-4b01-a057-f25ce05b428a","_showDetails":true},"1a2844d4-2636-4cd7-a5bf-6de7ac36dff6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70753764","title":"Maternal DHA supplementation attenuates newborn hyperoxia-induced lung developmental deficits into early adulthood","authors":["Rogers L.K.","Dingess K.","Velten M.","Heyob K.","Valentine C.J."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*newborn","*hyperoxia","*lung","*adulthood","*supplementation","diet","lung function","mouse","tissues","mare","prematurity","exposure","lung dysplasia","newborn period","Western blotting","lung development","ambient air","inflammation","compliance (physical)","hypothesis","nursing","lung disease","protein","acid"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"25","number":"Meeting Astracts\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"0892-6638","address":"L.K.

After birth, the pups were exposed to >85%O2 or room air (RA) for 14 days, then returned to standard diets and RA until 28 days.

Oxidative stress is strongly related to major neonatal morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity and periventricular leucomalacia. Early amino acid administration (AA) is known to increase glutathione (GSH) concentration, the main intracellular antioxidant, in preterm infants.1 We hypothesized that additional energy (provided via intravenous lipids), results in a further upregulation of anti-oxidant defense mechanism via increased GSH synthesis rates. Method(s): Preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks) were randomly assigned to receiving AAs (2.4 g/kg/d) or AAs and lipids (2 g/kg/d) from birth onwards. On day 2, infants received a primed, continuous infusion of [U-1C]glycine, a precursor for GSH synthesis, to determine fractional synthesis rate (FSR) using mass spectrometry. Absolute synthesis rate was calculated from the FSR and erythrocyte GSH concentration. Data of this ongoing trial are presented as median (min-max).

To investigate mechanisms of MV development and repair we have developed a novel method of ventilating fetal sheep to induce injury in the very immature lung. Brief MV (2 h) alters lung morphology within 24 h of MV but resolves without further treatment within 15 days. Our aim was to identify the mechanisms underlying repair of the immature lung following MV. Method(s): Pregnant sheep at 110 d and 125 d gestational age (DGA; term is ~147DGA) underwent aseptic, recovery surgery to exteriorise the fetal head and chest. The fetal trachea was intubated and the lungs ventilated for 2 h with an injurious ventilation protocol (PEEP = 0 cmH2O, PIP = 40 cmH2O, Vt = ~5 mL/kg, n = 6). Ewes and foetuses remained healthy until necropsy, performed 24 h later. Unventilated sham-operated foetuses were controls (n = 6). Gene expression was measured by qRT-PCR. Result(s): There was no difference in the relative mRNA levels of early response genes (CTGF, CYR-61, and EGR-1) and inflammatory genes (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFalpha) between control and ventilated lungs at both the saccular and early alveolar stages of development. Conclusion(s): We conclude that repair processes, commencing with normalisation of early response and inflammatory gene expression, occur in the very immature lung within 24 h of brief, injurious, MV.","group":"g1","id":"0e74de45-b7b9-42b7-915b-46e6f7068a2c","_showDetails":true},"c1a0ed95-de0b-4847-9712-632cc9d398db":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70646789","title":"Alveolar growth abnormalities: Not just BPD","authors":["Metwalli Z.","Guillerman R."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*radiology","human","patient","infant","trisomy 21","pulmonary hypertension","child","respiratory failure","gene mutation","lung transplantation","Tertiary (period)","lung dysplasia","radiologist","pathologist","emphysema","pathology","data base","morbidity","idiopathic disease","pediatric hospital","thorax","imaging","lung biopsy","lung","transplantation","glycogen storage disease","hyperinflation","cyst","pulmonary artery","follow up","prematurity","congenital heart disease","filamin A","glass"],"journal":"Pediatric Radiology","language":"English","volume":"41","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Springer Verlag","isbn":"0301-0449","address":"Z.

In infants and children without BPD, radiologists and pathologists can misdiagnose alveolar growth abnormalities as emphysema. To promote appropriate recognition, we present the imaging findings of the largest known series of alveolar growth abnormalities in infants and children without a history of BPD. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with alveolar growth abnormalities over a 9-year period (2000-2009) at a tertiary children's hospital were identified from a pathology database. The chest CT exams and clinical charts were retrospectively reviewed. Preterm patients with BPD were excluded from analysis. Result(s): Alveolar growth abnormalities were diagnosed in 12 near- or full-term patients (age 6 days-4 years) by lung biopsy or following lung transplant. Associated abnormalities included trisomy 21 in 2 (17%), pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis in 2 (17%) and filamin A gene mutations in 2 (17%). All but one patient (92%) had structural cardiac abnormalities. CT findings included lobular architectural distortion in 7 (58%), intralobular hyperlucency in 6 (50%), ground glass opacities in 6 (50%), and coarse perilobular interstitial thickening in 4 (33%). Additional findings of multilobar hyperinflation were noted in 2 patients with filamin A gene mutations and subpleural cysts in 2 patients with trisomy 21. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 10 patients (83%), but not always associated with pulmonary artery enlargement on CT. Three patients were lost to follow-up, and 7 of the remaining 9 developed refractory respiratory insufficiency (2 requiring lung transplantation). Conclusion(s): Alveolar growth abnormalities can occur in near- and full-term patients as a primary idiopathic disorder or in association with congenital heart disease and certain genetic conditions. Appropriate recognition is important due to the high morbidity including pulmonary hypertension and refractory respiratory insufficiency that may require lung transplantation.","group":"g1","id":"c1a0ed95-de0b-4847-9712-632cc9d398db","_showDetails":true},"22e8f470-878a-44c7-86f4-2082b534afa8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70641674","title":"The role of eosinophil in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Rha Y.","Kim S.","Kim M.","Choi S."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*eosinophil","*clinical immunology","*allergy","*lung dysplasia","*prematurity","respiratory distress syndrome","serum","urine","patient","blood","human","eosinophil count","pH","arterial gas","blood gas analysis","statistical significance","wheezing","immunity","inflammation","neutrophil","macrophage","pathogenesis","artificial ventilation","eosinophil cationic protein","eosinophil protein X","lung surfactant","marker"],"journal":"Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","language":"English","volume":"66","number":"SUPPL. 94","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","isbn":"0105-4538","address":"Y.

Recent studies suggested that eosinophil has relevance to innate immune defense and inflammatory process in early life. While the activation of neutrophil and macrophage in pathogenesis of BPD are rather well studied, very few studies have addressed the possible participation of eosinophil. We hypothesized that eosinophil may be involved in early phase of BPD. Method(s): Preterm infants were recruited consecutively and grouped to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or non-RDS. RDS group was divided to BPD or non- BPD group then. We investigated blood eosinophil, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil protein X (EPX), and urine EPX to determine the relationship between eosinophil activation and BPD in premature infants prospectively. The eosinophil count, serum ECP/ EPX and urine ECP/ EPX were compared. Spearman rank test was used to analyze the correlation between serum, tracheal and urine ECP. Result(s): Among total 43 patients recruited, 13 patients were treated with pulmonary surfactant and mechanical ventilation for RDS. Six out of 13 patients were diagnosed with BPD. There were no difference of blood eosinophil, serum ECP, EPX, or urine EPX between RDS and non-RDS groups. Blood eosinophil, serum ECP, EPX, and urine EPX were higher in BPD group than non-BPD group which was not statistically significant. Interestingly serum EPX was significantly correlated with pH of arterial blood gas analysis which was done at discharge. (r = 0.441, P = 0.012).

In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that mice lacking the gene for CYP1A2 would display increased susceptibility to oxidative DNA damage in vivo in response to hyperoxia, compared to wild type (WT) mice. We also tested the hypothesis that tracheal aspirates of premature infants who develop BPD will display higher levels of oxidative DNA adducts. Method(s): Twelve week-old male WT (C57BL/6J) mice or Cyp1a2-null mice were exposed to hyperoxia (greater than 95%O2) or room air for 24-72 h. In another experiment, tracheal aspirates from premature infants who received supplemental oxygen (6 BPD group and 5 non-BPD group) were used to measure oxidative DNA adducts 5 days after birth. Oxidative DNA lesions in lung or liver tissues of mice or human tracheal aspirates were determined by the 32P-postlabeling assay. Result(s): The Cyp1a2-null mice were more susceptible to lung damagethan similarly exposedWTanimals. OxidativeDNAadducts were augmented in the lungs of WT and Cyp1a2-null mice exposed to 72 h of hyperoxia, compared to room air controls, with Cyp1a2- null mice showing a greater degree of enhancement. In a pilot study using tracheal aspirates, the oxidative DNA lesions were significantly higher in the BPD group than the non-BPD group. The positive correlation between oxidative DNA adducts, and extent of lung injury suggests that oxidative DNA damage contributes to lung injury. Further studies could lead to the development of novel strategies for the prevention/treatment of BPD in infants.","group":"g1","id":"36e6ee21-caed-40a2-8611-be882aa88fd0","_showDetails":true},"cbb701ed-3c14-4f4b-bec7-eeb14bace187":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70582739","title":"Hyperoxic regulation of mitochondrial cell death via Trx2","authors":["Titus B.K.","Forred B.J.","Floen M.J.","Vitiello P.F."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*cell death","*society","hyperoxia","injury","protein expression","pathogenesis","mitochondrion","exposure","homeostasis","human","epithelium cell","cell line","lung dysplasia","chronic lung disease","newborn","pathology","respiratory epithelium","cell damage","death","oxidation reduction potential","*free radical","protein","thiol","oxygen","oxidoreductase","thioredoxin 2","protein bcl 2"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"51","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"B.K.

It is clear that oxidative injury to the developing respiratory epithelium is involved in BPD pathogenesis; however, not much is known about redox-dependent pathways that regulate respiratory cell injury and death. It has been previously shown that mitochondria are a critical target of oxidative injury and exhibit altered redox potentials resulting in activation of cell death pathways. the thiol oxidoreductase protein, thioredoxin-2 (Trx2), is regulates mitochondrial redox homeostasis and has been shown to regulate mitochondrial-dependent cell death through inhibition of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Previous studies demonstrate that hyperoxic cell death is dictated by interactions between anti-apoptotic (Bcl-XL, Mcl-1) and pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak) Bcl-2 family proteins. Therefore, these studies were aimed at understanding the role of Trx2 in mitochondrial cell death during hyperoxia. Human immortalized pulmonary epithelial cells (A549, H1299) were treated with 95% oxygen and analyzed for expression of Trx2 pathway and Bcl-2 family proteins. Hyperoxic exposure resulted in alterations in Bcl-2 family protein expression marked by increased Bcl-XL, Bax, and Bak and decreased Mcl-1 levels. Hyperoxic treatment induced expression of Trx2 and its respective thiol reductase, TrxR2. To test for functional associations between Trx2 and Bcl-2 proteins during hyperoxia, we generated a cell line with inducible expression of Trx2 and this is a major focus of ongoing investigations. Taken together, these studies show that mitochondria are a critical target of hyperoxic injury due to altered Trx2 and Bcl-2 family protein expression which may contribute to BPD pathogenesis.","group":"g1","id":"cbb701ed-3c14-4f4b-bec7-eeb14bace187","_showDetails":true},"6153a9d0-8457-4bd9-99fc-e4bf41b29bd8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70575123","title":"Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in the Canadian registry for synagis (CARESS)","authors":["Paes B.A.","Li A.","Lanctot K.L.","Mitchell I."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*register","*hospitalization","*Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus","human","infant","general aspects of disease","respiratory tract disease","length of stay","prophylaxis","season","congenital heart disease","Down syndrome","airway","immunocompromised patient","congenital malformation","cystic fibrosis","prematurity","hospital","infection","advisory committee","population","risk","data base","gestational age","morbidity","intubation","assisted ventilation","dysplasia","lung","respiratory syncytial virus infection","*palivizumab"],"journal":"Value in Health","language":"English","volume":"14","number":"7","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","isbn":"1098-3015","address":"B.A. Paes, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.908","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed12&NEWS=N&AN=70575123"],"abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Paediatric advisory committee guidelines recommend palivizumab prophylaxis for specific sub-populations of infants at high risk for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. However, effectiveness of palivizumab may vary across indications and countries. The objective of our study was to determine hospitalization rates for respiratory illness (RIH) and RSV-positive infections (RSVH) following prophylaxis and compare rates found in this study with other world-wide data from published registries. METHOD(S): Neonatal and demographic data were collected prospectively across 29 national sites as part of an established CAnadian REgistry for SynagiS (CARESS) database from infants who received >=1 dose of palivizumab during the 2005-2010 RSV seasons. Respiratory illness (RI) events were documented monthly. RESULT(S): The 7699 infants enrolled were premature (<=35 completed weeks gestational age, without any underlying medical illnesses; n=5237), had chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n=646), hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (n=766), or had other pre-existing conditions such as neuromuscular impairments, Down syndrome, pulmonary or airway malformations, immunocompromise or cystic fibrosis (n=1050). The overall RIH rate was 6.0%. Premature infants had a significantly lower rate (4.1%) than the other groups (range 8.7% -11.5%; B=-0.912, df=1, p=0.005). The overall RSVH rate was 1.47% with significant differences between groups (range 1.22% - 2.46%; chi2=22.606, df=3, p < 0.0005). Apart from hospital length of stay, morbidities differed significantly across the sub-groups during RSVH including number of ICU admissions and length of stay, number ventilated and duration of intubation, number requiring respiratory support and duration (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Hospitalization rates for RI events and RSV illness were different across the groups. Comparisons with other registries indicate that RSVH rates are in the lower range overall (range 1.3 -8.1%); however, comparisons are difficult to establish as most studies do not account for the varying lengths of observation that arise because infants are enrolled at different times during the RSV season.","group":"g1","id":"6153a9d0-8457-4bd9-99fc-e4bf41b29bd8","_showDetails":true},"990c98ef-355d-4924-8646-d227a48faf7d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70573153","title":"Role of oxidative stress biomarkers in prematurity related diseases","authors":["Tataranno M.L.","Perrone S.","Negro S.","Bellieni C.V.","Longini M.","Marzocchi B.","Proietti F.","Napoliello L.","Buonocore G."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*neonatology","*oxidative stress","*workshop","*prematurity","umbilical cord blood","newborn","blood level","risk","cell damage","perinatal period","promoter region","necrotizing enterocolitis","brain damage","patent ductus arteriosus","hypothesis","lung dysplasia","antioxidant","free radical","protein","iron","hydroperoxide"],"journal":"Journal of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"4","number":"3","publisher":"IOS Press","isbn":"1934-5798","address":"M.L.

Recently, we have demonstrated that hyperoxia exposure down-regulates microRNA (miR)-150 expression and concurrent induction of its target gene, GPNMB, in neonatal rat lungs. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble GPNMB (sGPNMB) promotes angiogenesis in the hyperoxic neonatal lungs. Wild-type (WT) or miR-150 knockout (KO) neonates, exposed to 95% O2 for 3, 6, and 10 days, were evaluated for lung phenotypes, GPNMB protein expression in the lungs, and sGPNMB levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Angiogenic effects of sGPNMB were examined both in vitro and in vivo. After a 6-day exposure, similar analyses were performed in WT and miR-150 KO neonates during recovery at 7, 14, and 21 days. miR-150 KO neonates displayed an increased capillary network, decreased inflammation, and less alveolar damage compared with WT neonates after hyperoxia exposure. The early induction of GPNMB and sGPNMB were found in miR-150 KO neonates. The recombinant GPNMB, which contained a soluble portion of GPNMB, promoted endothelial tube formation in vitro and enhanced angiogenesis in vivo. The increased capillaries in the hyperoxic lungs of miR-150 KO neonates appeared dysmorphic. They were abnormally enlarged in size and occasionally laid at subepithelial regions in the alveoli. However, the lung architecture returned to normal during recovery, suggesting that abnormal vascularity during hyperoxia does not affect postnatal lung development. GPNMB plays an important role in angiogenesis during hyperoxia injury. Treatment with GPNMB may offer a novel therapeutic approach in reducing pathologic complications in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"5624e42b-1b06-4ee5-a75e-f6db4320be22","_showDetails":true},"982c4af2-fae5-4764-874d-faea086734fe":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70524687","title":"Analysis of alveolar macrophage polarization following lung injury in premature neonates","authors":["Chan B.","Li A.","George R.","Groffen J.","Heisterkamp N.","Kwong K.","Ramanathan R.","Minoo P."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*polarization","*medical research","*prematurity","*lung alveolus macrophage","*lung injury","risk","newborn","human","female","pregnancy","fluorescence activated cell sorting","inflammation","infant","patient","clinical study","high risk population","death","lung","phenotypic plasticity","microenvironment","tissue repair","gene","tissue","lung dysplasia","tracheal aspiration procedure","inflammatory cell","marker","antibody"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"59","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"B.

Depending on the microenvironment, they undergo distinct polarization that either propagate inflammation, or alternatively promote tissue repair. Inflammation related genes are increased in M1-polarized cells; whereas, M2 polarized cells are important for tissue remodeling. No information is currently available onAM polarization in premature neonates at risk of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). The imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors leads to BPDin premature neonates;we speculate AM polarization may be perturbed in this paradigm.We examined polarization state of AM obtained from the tracheal aspirates (TA) of preterm neonates at risk for BPD. Methods Used: We obtained serial TA samples from a cohort of intubated premature infants. The neonates were in two groups: Group 1, infants born between 22 and 30 weeks gestation (High BPD risk). Group 2 included infants born between 31 and 36 weeks gestation (Low BPD Risk). The inflammatory cells were isolated and subjected to Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) using antibodies against specific surface markers. Anti-CD14 and Anti-CD163 were used to identify M1- and M2- polarized AM respectively. The patients' clinical data were also analyzed. Summary of Results: TA samples from 12 premature neonates were collected and analyzed. Among the subjects, only 5 neonates survived without BPD. FACS analysis was performed on 47 samples. The percentile of CD14- positive AM was highly variable in both High and Low BPD Risk groups. No differences were found between the two groups. The abundance of M1-polarized AM did not correlate with the risk for BPD or death. Interestingly in a small number of Group 2 neonates M2-polarized AM increased as a function of postnatal age. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze polarization of AM in the lungs of neonates at risk for BPD. The relationship between AM polarization and BPD appears complex. In the neonates examined, M1 polarization did not correlate with BPD risk. Additional studies are underway to elucidate the role of AM polarization in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"982c4af2-fae5-4764-874d-faea086734fe","_showDetails":true},"82213ea8-e6aa-460e-bdf3-3849c7071e58":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70524422","title":"Late surfactant increases surfactant protein (SP) levels in ventilated extremely low birthweight (ELBW) newborns","authors":["Keller R.L.","Merrill J.","Palermo L.","Truog W.","Steinhorn R.","Ryan R.","Eichenwald E.","Durand D.","Courtney S.","Black D.","Ballard P.","Ballard R."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*medical research","*newborn","*low birth weight","human","infant","prematurity","extremely low birth weight","survival","safety","immunoblotting","assay","tracheal aspiration procedure","male","ligation","bradycardia","morbidity","artificial ventilation","lung dysplasia","*surfactant","*protein","nitric oxide","calfactant"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"59","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"R.L.

Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (INO) increases survival without BPD (Ballard R, NEJM 2006,2007) but does not abolish surfactant dysfunction. We investigated the safety and efficacy of late doses of surfactant (calfactant) plus INO to improve surfactant composition in ventilated preterm infants. Methods Used: Randomized, blinded trial of ELBW (<= 1000g and 30 0/7 wk GA) ventilated at 73-14 d. Infants received INO plus 5 dose procedures of surfactant (SURF) or sham (CTRL). SP-B content (% of total protein) was quantified by immunoblot assay in large aggregate surfactant isolated from tracheal tracheal aspirate samples. 85 infants were enrolled; 48 were treated every 3-4 d (SURF n=28 and CTRL n=20) and the remainder were treated weekly after the first 2 doses. Summary of Results: Infants treated every 3-4 d that received SURF (vs. CTRL) were less mature (25.0 vs. 25.7 wks, P=0.05), and more likely male (68 vs. 40%, P=0.06). SP-B content at study entry was lower in SURF (1.06%) vs. CTRL (2.34%, P=0.05). Compared to baseline levels, SP-B content increased 0.69% (P=0.0003) and 0.05% (P=0.11) on days 1 and 2 after SURF; content decreased slightly in CTRL. The change in SP-B content on d 1 for treated infants was correlated with the mean levels of SP-B content (r=0.60, p=0.004), perhaps indicating enhanced SP-B degradation in deficient infants. There was no difference (SURF vs. CTRL) in PDA ligation (41 vs. 28%, P=0.37), NEC (11 vs. 15%) or IVH 3/4 (4 vs. 5%) after enrollment. 201 doses of surfactant were administered with adverse event frequency <= 2% (reintubation, or significant bradycardia or respiratory decompensation). Conclusion(s): Late surfactant increased SP-B content. Administration of late surfactant is well-tolerated and appears safe with regard to co-morbidities of prematurity.","group":"g1","id":"82213ea8-e6aa-460e-bdf3-3849c7071e58","_showDetails":true},"8cc415ad-65d4-4be8-b8d0-e84a4b27613a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70524419","title":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARGAMMA) agonist prostaglandin J2 blocks hyperoxia-induced decrease in pulmonary FGF-10 signaling","authors":["Sakurai R.","Chen A.","Torday J.","Rehan V."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*medical research","*hyperoxia","*agonist","fibroblast","lung","rat","exposure","lung dysplasia","human","model","lung fibroblast","down regulation","apoptosis","Sprague Dawley rat","*fibroblast growth factor 10","*peroxisome proliferator activated receptor","*prostaglandin","marker","leptin","fibronectin","caspase 3","fibroblast growth factor receptor 2","protein","receptor","growth factor","triolein"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"59","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"R.

Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10), an important growth factor that regulates lung branching and alveolarization, is decreased in BPD. On the other hand, our lab has recently shown in a rat model that BPD can be prevented by PPARGAMMA agonists such as prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2). How PGJ2 affects FGF-10 signaling is not known. The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of FGF-10 on alveolar fibroblast differentiation and determine if PGJ2 blocks hyperoxia-induced changes in FGF-10 signaling. Methods Used: To determine the effects of FGF-10 on alveolar fibroblast differentiation, both e19 (primary) fetal rat lung fibroblasts and human embryonic (WI38 cells) were treated with FGF-10 (1-100 ng/ml) for 24h. Following which, markers of fibroblast differentiation (PPARGAMMA, ADRP, SREBP1c, aP2, leptin and triolein uptake) were analyzed. In separate experiments, neonatal Sprague Dawley rat pups were categorized in the following groups: normoxia (control, 21%O2), normoxia + PGJ2 (0.3mg/kg), hyperoxia (exposure to 95%O2 for 7d), hyperoxia + PGJ2 (0.3mg/kg). PGJ2 was administered i.p. once daily. At the end of experimental period, the rat pups were sacrificed and protein was extracted from whole lung samples. UsingWestern blotting, we probed for FGF-10, and its receptor FGF receptor 2, PPARGAMMA, ADRP, leptin, fibronectin, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3. Summary of Results: FGF10-treated fibroblasts showed dose-dependent increases in markers of differentiation. Under in vivo conditions, PGJ2 blocked hyperoxia-induced decreases in FGF-10, PPARGAMMA, leptin and increases in FGF-receptor 2 and fibronectin levels. Furthermore, hyperoxiainduced changes in apoptotic markers (increases in Bax and cleaved caspase 3 and decrease in Bcl-2) were also blocked in the PGJ2-treated group. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate the down-regulation of FGF-10 signaling and increase in apoptosis on exposure to hyperoxia, both of which were blocked by PGJ2. We speculate a direct interaction between FGF-10 and PPARGAMMA signaling pathways in the maintenance of alveolar growth and differentiation (Grant support: NIH-HL55268, HL075405, HD058948, HD051857) and TRDRP (15IT-0250, 17RT-0170).","group":"g1","id":"8cc415ad-65d4-4be8-b8d0-e84a4b27613a","_showDetails":true},"dac27ce6-998d-4e67-9902-bb692af82507":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70524418","title":"Lung lipofibroblasts (LIFS) actively recruit, store and release retinoic acid in response to PGE2","authors":["Truong N.","Sakurai R.","Rehan V.","Torday J."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*medical research","*lung","secretion","lung fibroblast","kinetics","agonist","human","phospholipid synthesis","protein expression","atelectasis","storage","fibroblast","fetus lung","rat","adult","sensitivity and specificity","dose response","homeostasis","pathophysiology","respiratory distress syndrome","lung dysplasia","fibrosing alveolitis","emphysema","*prostaglandin E2","*retinoic acid","surfactant","lipid","fat droplet","phospholipid","protein","butaprost","prostaglandin","receptor","phloretin"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"59","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"N.

We have previously shown that the alveolar type II (ATII) cell increases PGE2 secretion when stretched, stimulating Lipid Droplet (LD) secretion from neighboring lipofibroblasts (LIFs) at PGE2 concentrations comparable to those produced by ATIIs in culture. Since RA is also stored in LIF LDs, we hypothesized that PGE2 would concomitantly stimulate RA and lipid secretion by LIFs, coordinating the release of ATII surfactant lipid substrate with RA, the latter being an agonist for both surfactant phospholipid synthesis and surfactant protein expression. Such a pleiotropic mechanism of RA action would coordinate surfactant phospholipid and protein production with alveolar distension, preventing atelectasis. Methods Used: Uptake, storage and release of RA by cultured fibroblasts was determined based on the kinetics of 3H-RA in cultured WI38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts, primary fetal rat lung fibroblasts and adult lung fibroblasts. Cells were treated with Prostaglandin E2 (5 x 10-7M), an agonist for the uptake and release of RA from LIFs. The sensitivity and specificity of the PGE2 effects on LIF RA kinetics were determined using time-course and dose-response curves in combination with the use of specific molecular inhibitors (phloretin) and stimulators (butaprost) of the PGE2 receptor. Summary of Results: LIFs actively recruit RA over a 1-2 hour period, and store it in lipid droplets. PGE2 (5 x 10-7M) caused release of RA, whereas baseline secretion was minimal. Conclusion(s): LIF uptake and release of RA is coordinately regulated by PGE2 signaling from ATII cells. This effect has novel implications for understanding the basis for alveolar homeostasis and pathophysiology, providing new molecular targets for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema.(Partially supported by grants from the NIH (HL-55268, HL-075405, HD058948, and HD-051857) and the TRDRP (14RT-0073, 15IT-0250, 17RT-0170).","group":"g1","id":"dac27ce6-998d-4e67-9902-bb692af82507","_showDetails":true},"edf13bfc-0c05-4215-a945-b3bb8ce15807":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70524417","title":"Prenatal administration of rosiglitazone to rat pups does not alter the adult metabolic phenotype","authors":["Sierra H.","Liu J.","Sakurai R.","Truong N.","Lee R.J.","Zhang G.","Lee P.W.","Torday J.","Rehan V."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*medical research","*phenotype","*adult","*rat","fatty acid synthesis","infant","human","Sprague Dawley rat","mare","insulin tolerance test","body weight","mass spectrometry","lung","liver","skeletal muscle","fetus lung maturity","plasma","glucose tolerance test","assay","statistical significance","therapy","fetus lung maturation","lung dysplasia","hybridization","*rosiglitazone","insulin","deuterium oxide","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor","dexamethasone","glucose","cholesterol","glucagon","triacylglycerol","diluent","drinking water","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma","marker","deuterium","adipophilin","troponin","troponin I"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"59","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"H.

At 11-12 wks of age glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed after a 12h fast (glucose administered at 1g/kg IP, and insulin administered at 1U/kg subcutaneously). de novo fatty acid synthesis was analyzed by deuterium incorporation (DI) [99.9% deuterated water (D2O)].

At 15 wks, the animals were sacrificed and lungs, liver, skeletal muscle and fat were collected for Western hybridization (WH) for PPARGAMMA (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) a marker of lung maturity, and ADRP (adipose differentiation-related protein) a key down-stream functional target of PPARGAMMA. Plasma was assayed for triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon and troponin-I. Summary of Results: Insulin and glucose tolerance tests were not different between any groups. DI showed no significant differences in de novo fatty acid synthesis, and WH showed equal expression of PPARGAMMA and ADRP. Similarly, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon and troponin-I assays revealed no significant differences among all 4 groups, (all p values > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Prenatal administration of RGZ does not alter the adult metabolic phenotype.

We showed that arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) deficient mice are more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury due to lack of expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A enzymes, which detoxify lipid hydroperoxides generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Omeprazole (OM), a proton pump inhibitor, used in humans with gastric acid related disorders is known to act via the AHR. Whether OM protects against hyperoxic lung injury is unknown. So, we hypothesized that OM protects against hyperoxic lung injury in vivo and in vitro via AHR. Methods Used: 1. In Vivo: Eight-week old wild type C57BL/6J (WT) and arylhydrocarbon receptor dysfunctional (AHRd) mice were treated i.p. with either OM (50 mg/kg) or corn oil (control) once daily for 5 days and exposed to room air or hyperoxia for 72 hours. AHR activation was assessed by pulmonary CYP 1A1 expression at the enzyme (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase assay) and protein (Western blot assay) levels. Lung injury, inflammation and oxidative stress were determined by histopathology and immunohistochemistry for neutrophils, macrophages, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, respectively. 2. In Vitro: H441(Human lung epithelial cells) cells were treated with either OM (10 or 50 HM) or dimethylsulfoxide (control) and exposed to room air or hyperoxia for upto 72 hours. ROS were detected using 2'-7'- dichorodihyrofluorecein diacetate and flow cytometry. Cell viability was measured by XTT assay. The experiments were repeated after transfecting the cells with siRNA to knockdown the AHR. Summary of Results: OM increased AHR activation and decreased hyperoxic lung injury, inflammation and oxidative stress in WT mice. In contrast, OM failed to protect against hyperoxic lung damage in AHRd mice. Likewise, in human lung epithelial cells; OM attenuated hyperoxia induced ROS and cell injury in the presence of AHR, and siRNA mediated knockdown of AHR decreased the protective effects of OM. Conclusion(s): OM protects against hyperoxic lung injury in vivo and in vitro by detoxifying ROS via AHR. Our data suggests that OM may be effective in the prevention and treatment of BPD in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"7994917c-e78e-43ec-a15d-c1a1740b8ac1","_showDetails":true},"bdb8b294-b3b0-4b15-a05b-775d640cf52b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70521751","title":"10 year update of growth in extremely low birthweight infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Theile A.R.","Radmacher P.","Anschutz T.","Adamkin D.H."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*infant","*human","*medical research","*lung dysplasia","*low birth weight","extremely low birth weight","postnatal growth","weight gain","weight reduction","birth weight","weight","diagnosis","risk","feeding","head circumference","growth disorder","nutritional support","medical record review","steroid","amino acid","protein"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"59","number":"2","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"A.R.

Methods Used: A retrospective chart review of 88 ELBW infants with BPD. Nutritional data, postnatal growth, and BPD severity were compared across 3 weight cohorts: 1) weight gain <=14 g/kg/day; 2) 14.1-16 g/kg/day; and 3) >=16.1 g/kg/day) as well as to our previous study. Summary of Results: Seventy-three percent of subjects grew at or above fetal rates. No differences were seen in postnatal steroid use, percent postnatal weight loss or days to return to birth weight across cohorts. The first 20-day amino acid intake (g/k/d) was higher with increasing weight gain and head circumference (HC) growth. There were less EUGR (extrauterine growth restriction) by Wt and HC for those ELBW infants with BPD receiving higher amounts of protein that grew at or above fetal rate. There were less postnatal weight loss and earlier return to birth weight for ELBW infants with BPD over the past 10 years. Conclusion(s): Despite a diagnosis of BPD, improved nutritional strategies have contributed to better postnatal growth in infants at high risk for EUGR.

Long-term nutrition support is best achieved by gastrostomy tube (GT) which can be placed endoscopically (PEG) using bedside sedation or operatively under general anesthesia (GA). Controversy exists regarding the safest method of PEG placement in ill neonates who may be at particular risk of respiratory or airway complications relating to GA. To avoid such complications, bedside PEG placement with IV sedation has been utilized in our neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). This multidisciplinary approach emphasizes individualized patient assessment and the presence of a neonatologist for sedation and airway management. Patients/Methods: Charts of all infants who underwent bedside PEG in our NICUs from August 2006 to March 2010 were reviewed. Available demographic information, past medical history, nutritional status at time of procedure and up to one year after, procedure information (ASA scores, medications, respiratory status), and short- and long-term outcomes were collected and analyzed. Result(s): A total of 93 patients underwent bedside PEG placement during the review period. The mean age at placement was 17.4 weeks (2-60 weeks) with an adjusted gestational age of 48.4 weeks (17-84 weeks). The average weight at the time of the procedure was 4298 gm (2175-8040 gm). The patients had a number of underlying conditions including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (45%), genetic disease (26%), intraventricular hemorrhage (22%), and poor weight gain (20%). There were 18 ASA II, 52 ASA III, and 4 ASA IV patients. Mean total sedation dosing was fentanyl 3mcg/kg (2-10 mcg/kg) and midazolam 0.15 mg/kg (0.1-0.5 mg/kg). Per protocol, all patients received supplemental oxygen during the procedure with a majority of patients only requiring nasal cannula (63%). Five of the infants (6%) were electively intubated for PEG placement due to airway or other concerns. One procedure was aborted due to medical instability and was completed in the OR under GA. Feedings had returned to pre-PEG rates/volumes by a mean of 2.1 days (1- 15 days). There were 2 significant complications; one case resulted in a perforated viscus, and a second patient had pneumoperitoneum with respiratory distress. There was no mortality due to the PEG placement. Conclusion(s): Sedated bedside PEG placement in chronically ill neonates can be an effective and safe method of providing permanent enteral access. There were few serious complications, especially given the chronic medical acuity of this population, and the outcomes data appears comparable with other reported series. We believe that careful patient assessment and selection along with utilization of a multidisciplinary team are keys to successful utilization of sedated PEG placement in this special and fragile population of infants.","group":"g1","id":"2251e581-94e2-480b-b96a-2508c207feba","_showDetails":true},"79b0d2c0-27cc-4f66-b0eb-f2457827a645":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70383168","title":"Area under the reactance curve: Reference values and disease detection in children born preterm","authors":["Simpson S.J.","Sly P.D.","Franklin P.","Lombardi E.","Calogero C.","Palumbo M.","Hall G.L."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*child","*reference value","height","population","male","device","lung dysplasia","respiratory tract disease","linear regression analysis","diagnosis","oscillation","impedance","Belgium"],"journal":"Respirology","language":"English","volume":"16","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing","isbn":"1323-7799","address":"S.J.

The area under the reactance curve (AX) has been proposed to amplify clinically relevant signal by taking advantage of any shape change in the reactance (Xrs) curve below the resonant frequency. This study aimed to develop reference values for resistance (Rrs), Xrs and AX in a large healthy population of children, and determine if AX conferred any additional clinical benefit when examining disease in children born preterm. Methods Impedance spectra were obtained in 760 healthy children (335 male), aged less than 13 years and with height less than 160 cm using a commercial device (I2M, Chess Medical, Belgium). AX was calculated in 647 of these children between 6 Hz and the resonant frequency. Backwards stepwise linear regressions identified the best predictors of AX, and Xrs and Rrs at 8 Hz (Xrs8, Rrs8), and Z scores were generated. Z scores were calculated for 156 children born preterm, of which 87 received a neonatal diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Chi squared tests examined the difference in proportion of children born preterm (with and without BPD) with abnormal Z scores for each FOT variable. Results All FOT variables were predicted by height (p < 0.001) and sex. Mean (SD) Z scores for preterm children with and without BPD for Rrs8 (0.59 (0.88); 0.58 (1.03)), Xrs8 (1.05 (0.68); 0.61 (0.82)) and AX (0.84 (0.70); 0.51 (0.98)) were all significantly different (p < 0.001) from the healthy population.

Studies show the importance of proangiogenic factors for alveolarization, but the importance of antiangiogenic factors is unknown. We proposed that hyperoxia increases the potent angiostatin, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), in neonatal lungs, inhibiting alveolarization and microvascularization. Wild-type (WT) and PEDF(-/-) mice were exposed to room air (RA) or 0.9 fraction of inspired oxygen from Postnatal Day 5 to 13. PEDF protein was increased in hyperoxic lungs compared with RA-exposed lungs (P < 0.05). In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence identified PEDF production primarily in alveolar epithelium. Hyperoxia reduced alveolarization in WT mice (P < 0.05) but not in PEDF(-/-) mice. WT hyperoxic mice had fewer platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-positive cells per alveolus (1.4 +/- 0.4) than RA-exposed mice (4.3 +/- 0.3; P < 0.05); this reduction was absent in hyperoxic PEDF(-/-) mice. The interactive regulation of lung microvascularization by vascular endothelial growth factor and PEDF was studied in vitro using MFLM-91U cells, a fetal mouse lung endothelial cell line. Vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation of proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation was inhibited by PEDF. MFLM-91U cells exposed to conditioned medium (CM) from E17 fetal mouse lung type II (T2) cells cultured in 0.9 fraction of inspired oxygen formed fewer capillary tubes than CM from T2 cells cultured in RA (hyperoxia CM, 51 +/- 10% of RA CM, P < 0.05), an effect abolished by PEDF antibody. We conclude that PEDF mediates reduced vasculogenesis and alveolarization in neonatal hyperoxia. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia likely results from an altered balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors.","group":"g1","id":"940c7a11-3f86-421e-8fcd-7d4ce6aa16b3","_showDetails":true},"66dede58-25fb-432f-a95b-f30fb5490647":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70359528","title":"The role of eosinophil activation in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Choi S.","Rha Y."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["*eosinophil","*immunology","*prematurity","*allergic asthma","*lung dysplasia","respiratory distress syndrome","serum","urine","patient","blood","macrophage","pathogenesis","artificial ventilation","pH","arterial gas","blood gas analysis","statistical significance","wheezing","immunity","inflammation","neutrophil","eosinophil count","eosinophil cationic protein","eosinophil protein X","lung surfactant","marker"],"journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","language":"English","volume":"127","number":"2 SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Mosby Inc.","isbn":"0091-6749","address":"S.

Recent studies suggested that eosinophil has relevance to innate immune defense and inflammatory process in early life. While the activation of neutrophil and macrophage in pathogenesis of BPD are rather well studied, very few studies have addressed the possible participation of eosinophil. We hypothesized that eosinophil may be involved in early phase of BPD. METHOD(S): Preterm infants were recruited consecutively and grouped to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or non-RDS. RDS group was divided to BPD or non-BPD group then. We investigated blood eosinophil, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil protein X (EPX), and urine EPX to determine the relationship between eosinophil activation and BPD in premature infants prospectively. The eosinophil count, serum ECP/EPX and urine ECP/EPX were compared. Spearman rank test was used to analyze the correlation between serum, tracheal and urine ECP. RESULT(S): Among total 43 patients recruited, 13 patients were treated with pulmonary surfactant and mechanical ventilation for RDS. Six out of 13 patients were diagnosed with BPD. There were no difference of blood eosinophil, serum ECP, EPX, or urine EPX between RDS and non-RDS groups. Blood eosinophil, serum ECP, EPX, and urine EPX were higher in BPD group than non-BPD group which was not statistically significant. Interestingly serum EPX was significantly correlated with pH of arterial blood gas analysis which was done at discharge.

TIMPs reduce and modulate the activity of MMPs. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an endogenous nuclear protein released during chronic tissue damage, is a known inducer of MMP-9. We propose that adverse outcomes of premature infants are the consequence of intrauterine acute and chronic inflammatory processes involving MMP-9 and TIMP-1. This study was conducted to investigate the interaction between systemic acute (IL-6) and chronic (HMGB1) cytokines, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in neonates with prematurity-related adverse outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study in 226 consecutive preterm singleton neonates delivered in the presence (n=107, GA: median [IQR]: 27 [25-29] wks) or absence (n=119, GA: 31 [28-33] wks) of intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI). Amniocentesis was used to confirm or exclude IAI. Cord blood was obtained at birth for all cases. A composite end-organ damage indicator was computed based on the presence of either intraventricular hemorrhage (gr.3-4), necrotizing enterocolitis (gr.2-4), retinopathy of prematurity (gr.2- 4), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia and/or death. IL-6, HMGB1, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were evaluated by ELISA. Data were corrected for GA at birth and other variables as appropriate. RESULT(S): (1) In the absence of IAI,GAimpacted on MMP-9 (R=0.52, P< 0.001), TIMP-1 (R=0.17, P=0.02), IL-6 (R=-0.39, P< 0.001) and HMGB1 (R=-0.19, P< 0.02) levels; (2) IAI did not impact on the levels of the sought analytes; (3) IL-6 correlated with TIMP-1 (R=0.27, P< 0.001) while HMGB1 correlated with MMP-9 only (R=0.31, P< 0.001); (4) Newborns with at least one adverse outcome (n=75) had lower MMP-9 concentrations compared to unaffected infants (105 [56-201] vs. 129 [81-247] ng/mL, P=0.016). CONCLUSION(S): Our results point to a dissociation between the effect of acute and chronic inflammatory events on MMP-9 and TIMP-1 homeostasis. Targeting MMP-9 may reduce the incidence of adverse prematurity-related outcomes.","group":"g1","id":"bf104beb-46fc-46a7-95a0-fa2a33b244f2","_showDetails":true},"7e22130a-0217-49db-94b0-24f195dd7d16":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"361885962","title":"Role of pulmonary infection in the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity","authors":["Beeton M.L.","Maxwell N.C.","Davies P.L.","Nuttall D.","McGreal E.","Chakraborty M.","Spiller O.B.","Kotecha S."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["article","bacterium culture","*chronic lung disease/et [Etiology]","controlled study","DNA isolation","female","gene identification","human","infant","lung fluid","*lung infection","major clinical study","male","newborn","nonhuman","pathogenesis","polymerase chain reaction","priority journal","respiratory distress syndrome","stomach juice","Ureaplasma","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound]","RNA 16S/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*chronic lung disease of prematurity/et [Etiology]"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","language":"English","volume":"37","number":"6","publisher":"European Respiratory Society (4 Ave Sainte-Luce, Lausanne CH-1003, Switzerland)","isbn":"1399-3003","address":"S.

The aim was to study the predictive value of ETCOc and cytokine levels for long-term outcome. Methods This study comprised 105 very preterm infants (57 males, 48 females; gestational age range 25wks 5d-31wks 4d; birthweight 610-2100g) who were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit between 1 February and 31 December 2002. ETCOc, plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins (IL) 6 and 8, and malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation), were measured at days 1, 3, and 5 of life and related to outcome at 3years 6months of age (Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales). Results Of the 105 infants, 69 were eligible for follow-up (37 males; 32 females; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, n=12). ETCOc at 0 to 24hours was higher in infants with adverse outcome (Griffiths developmental quotient <85, n=15) compared with favourable outcome (2.7SD 0.7 vs 2.0SD 0.5; p<0.05). MDA and cytokines did not differ between groups. Regression analysis with bootstrapping of independent variables (gestational age, birthweight, ETCOc, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) showed that ETCOc was the only parameter that correlated with outcome. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of ETCOc for adverse outcome were 93% and 85% respectively. Interpretation Adverse neurodevelopmental outcome is associated with increased endogenous carbon monoxide. ETCOc less than 2.0ppm during the first day indicates a favourable outcome. © The Authors.

In contrast, exposure to moderate hyperoxia (60% O2) for 14 days does not completely arrest lung cell proliferation and is associated with parenchymal thickening. On the basis of similarities in lung architecture observed following either exposure to 60% O2, or pharmacological inhibition of physiological apoptosis, we hypothesized that exposure to 60% O2 would result in an inhibition of physiological lung cell apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the parenchymal thickening induced by exposure to 60% O2 was associated with decreased numbers of apoptotic cells, increased expressions of the antiapoptotic regulator Bcl-xL, and the putative antiapoptotic protein survivin, and decreased expressions of the proapoptotic cleaved caspases-3 and -7.

Study Design: At 117 days' gestation, fetal sheep (n = 16) received intraamniotic LPS (20 mg). hAECs were delivered at 0, 6, and 12 hours into the fetal jugular vein (n = 4), trachea (n = 4), or both (n = 4). Controls (n = 6) received equivalent administration of saline solution. Lungs were collected at 124 days. Result(s): Intraamniotic LPS caused pulmonary inflammation and altered lung structure and function. hAECs attenuated changes in lung function and structure that had been induced by LPS: lung volume, 40 cm H2O (P <.05, intravenous + intratracheal hAECs vs LPS), tissue-to-airspace ratio (P <.05, intravenous + intratracheal hAECs vs LPS), and septal crest density (P <.001, all hAEC groups vs LPS). Leukocyte infiltration of the lungs was not reduced by hAECs; however, inflammatory cytokines were reduced (tumor necrosis factoralpha, P <.01, vs LPS; interleukin-1b, P <.01, vs LPS; interleukin-6, P <.01 vs LPS). Surfactant protein A and C messenger RNA was increased by LPS, although this was not statistically significant (P >.05 vs control); there were significant increases in all hAEC-treated animals (surfactant proteinA, P <.05 vs LPS; surfactant proteinC, P <.01 vs LPS).

The expression of these modifiers of IL-6 activity during ventilator-induced inflammation remains poorly understood. Objective(s): To ascertain the expression pattern of IL-6, sIL-6R and sgp130 in response to mechanical ventilation in the preterm neonatal lung and define its relationship to associated markers of inflammation. Method(s): Inflammatory cell recruitment and expression of IL-6, sIL-6R, sgp130, IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were quantified in tracheal aspirate fluid collected over a 14-day period from preterm (125 days) baboons undergoing mechanical ventilation. Result(s): Over the period of ventilation, the ratio of agonistic IL-6/sIL-6R increased 4.3-fold between days 3 and 10-11 (p < 0.01) while the ratio of antagonistic sgp130/IL-6 decreased 2.6-fold over the same period (p < 0.05). Over the same period, the relative numbers of neutrophils compared to mononuclear cells shifted from an excess of 1.8 on day 1 to 0.6 on day 14 (p < 0.01). Both IL-8 and MCP-1 were elevated between days 1 and 10-11 of ventilation (p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): In the ventilated preterm baboon lung, expression of sIL-6R and dynamic modulation of sgp130 expression appear to modulate the activity and inflammatory potential of IL-6.

We aimed to study two known modulators of pulmonary vessels: endothelin-1 (ET-1) and L-arginine. We hypothesized that plasma concentrations of ET-1 and L-arginine could correlate with the severity of RDS. We prospectively studied 71 preterm infants (gestational age = 29 to 35 weeks) with and without RDS. We measured plasma ET-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and L-arginine by spectrophotometry. Infants who continued to require oxygen support or died by day of life 28 were considered to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). ET-1 concentrations were significantly higher in RDS infants (p = 0.039) than controls. Among infants with RDS, it was significantly higher in those who later developed BPD (p = 0.026). L-arginine was significantly lower in RDS infants (p = 0.001), but did not differ between BPD and non-BPD infants (p = 0.19). There was no correlation between L-arginine and ET-1 (r = 0.1, p = 0.41). The acute phase of RDS is associated with increased plasma concentrations of ET-1 and decreased L-arginine. Infants who later developed BPD had higher plasma ET-1 at birth. Concentrations of ET-1 and L-arginine did not correlate.

We tested the hypothesis that intra-amniotic IL-1alpha would induce pulmonary and systemic fetal inflammatory responses. Sheep with singleton fetuses were given an intra-amniotic injection of recombinant sheep IL-1alpha (100 mug) and were delivered 1, 3, or 7 days later, at 124 +/- 1 days gestation (n 5-8/group). A separate group of sheep were given two intra-amniotic IL-1alpha injections (100 mug dose each): 7 days and again 1 day prior to delivery. IL-1alpha induced a robust increase in monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and IL-8 protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. H2O2 secretion was increased in inflammatory cells isolated from lungs of IL-1alpha -exposed lambs upon LPS challenge in vitro compared with control monocytes. T lymphocytes were recruited to the lung. IL-1beta, cyclooxygenase-1, and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression increased in the lung 1 day after intra-amniotic IL-1alpha exposure. Lung volumes increased 7 days after intra-amniotic IL-1alpha exposure, with minimal anatomic changes in air space morphology. The weight of the posterior mediastinal lymph node draining the lung and the gastrointestinal tract doubled, inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOSII)-positive cells increased, and Foxp3-positive T-regulatory lymphocytes decreased in the lymph node after IL-1alpha exposure. In the blood, neutrophil counts and plasma haptoglobin increased after IL-1alpha exposure. Compared with a single exposure, exposure to intra-amniotic IL-1alpha 7 days and again 1 day before delivery had a variable effect (increases in some inflammatory markers, but not pulmonary cytokines).

Neonatal mice exposed to 14 days of hyperoxia develop BPD-like lung injury and PH. To determinne the impact of hyperoxia on pulmonary artery (PA) cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling in a murine model of lung injury and PH, neonatal C57BL/6 mice were placed in room air, 75% O2 for 14 days (chronic hyperoxia [CH]) or 75% O2 for 24 hours, followed by 13 days of room air (acute hyperoxia with recovery [AHR]) with or without sildenafil. At 14 days, mean alveolar area, PA medial wall thickness (MWT), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and vessel density were assessed. PA protein was analyzed for cGMP, soluble guanylate cyclase, and PDE5 activity. CH and AHR mice had RVH, but only CH mice had increased alveolar area and MWT and decreased vessel density. In CH and AHR PAs, soluble guanylate cyclase activity was decreased, and PDE5 activity was increased. In CH mice, sildenafil attenuated MWT and RVH but did not improve mean alveolar area or vessel density. In CH and AHR PAs, sildenafil decreased PDE5 activity and increased cGMP. Our results indicate that prolonged hyperoxia leads to lung injury, PH, RVH, and disrupted PA cGMP signaling. Furthermore, 24 hours of hyperoxia causes RVH and disrupted PA cGMP signaling that persists for 13 days. Sildenafil reduced RVH and restored vascular cGMP signaling but did not attenuate lung injury. Thus, hyperoxia can rapidly disrupt PA cGMP signaling in vivo with sustained effects, and concurrent sildenafil therapy can be protective.","group":"g1","id":"477fe5ee-9ba1-46eb-b0bc-b40a18f32453","_showDetails":true},"1b2adea2-3019-4647-86d7-eff59ec3e61b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"362480625","title":"Urinary N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide predicts severe retinopathy of prematurity","authors":["Czernik C.","Metze B.","Muller C.","Muller B.","Buhrer C."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["article","controlled study","creatinine urine level","diagnostic accuracy","disease association","disease severity","eye examination","female","gestational age","high risk infant","hospital discharge","human","infant","longitudinal study","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung dysplasia/th [Therapy]","major clinical study","male","morbidity","newborn","oxygen therapy","prediction","predictive value","prematurity","priority journal","prospective study","*protein analysis","*protein urine level","receiver operating characteristic","retina surgery","*retrolental fibroplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*retrolental fibroplasia/su [Surgery]","sensitivity and specificity","very low birth weight","*amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","oxygen/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","language":"English","volume":"128","number":"3","publisher":"American Academy of Pediatrics (141 Northwest Point Blvd, P.O.

Method(s): Progenitor cells were quantified by flow cytometry at birth in 36 neonates born <=28. weeks of gestation and at 36 postmenstrual weeks in 18 of them. Cells expressing the stemness markers CD34, CD133, or both were defined as circulating progenitor cells (CPCs). EPCs were defined as CPCs co-expressing the endothelial marker KDR. Result(s): Mean (SD) gestational age and birth weight of the infants studied were 26.2(1.5) weeks and 761.6(171.8) grams, respectively. EPC levels at birth did not differ between infants who subsequently developed BPD (n=9) and those who did not (n=24) [CD34+KDR+ EPCs: 81(34-41) vs 80(56-110), p=0.7] and were not correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation or O2-dependence, nor with the need of surfactant replacement. Infants with a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (n=22) had significantly lower EPC levels at birth than those with no PDA (n=11) [CD34+KDR+ cells: 47(34-92) vs 142(84.5-221), p=0.008]. Data from the 18 infants studied both at birth and at 36 postmenstrual weeks showed that, while CPCs sharply decline over time, levels of all EPCs phenotypes are preserved after delivery.

After maternal anesthesia and hysterotomy, the head and chest were exteriorized, and the fetus was intubated. While maintaining placental circulation, the fetus was ventilated for 15 min with a tidal volume escalating to 15 ml/kg using heated, humidified, 100% nitrogen. The fetus then was returned to the uterus, and tissue was collected after 30 min for evaluation of early markers of lung injury. Lambs receiving both surfactant and PEEP had increased dynamic compliance, increased static lung volumes, and decreased total protein and heat shock proteins 70 and 60 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with other groups. Ventilation, independent of PEEP or surfactant, increased mRNA expression of acute phase response genes and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA in the lung tissue compared with controls. PEEP decreased mRNA for cytokines (2-fold) compared with groups receiving no PEEP. Surfactant administration further decreased some cytokine mRNAs and changed the distribution of early growth response protein-1 expression. The use of PEEP during initiation of ventilation at birth decreased early mediators of lung injury.

However, the mechanisms by which these drugs improve the course of BPD are not completely known. Alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) is one of the major serine protease inhibitors in human plasma that has antielastase and antiapoptotic activities. Both activities of alpha1-AT are dependent on its reactive site loop (RSL), which is highly susceptible to oxidative inactivation. In this study, we investigated the elastase inhibitory activity of alpha1-AT in two different baboon models of BPD, the \"new BPD\" and the \"severe BPD\" models, and determined the effect of treatment with a catalytic antioxidant, Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP), on the elastase inhibitory activity of alpha1-AT in the severe BPD model. Our results demonstrate the presence of sufficient elastase inhibitory activity of the airway alpha1-AT in the new but not in the severe BPD model. Treatment of severe BPD group baboons with the catalytic antioxidant MnTE-2-PyP resulted in augmentation of the elastase inhibitory activity of alpha1-AT. These findings suggest that prevention of the oxidative inactivation of alpha1-AT may be one of the mechanisms by which antioxidant therapy improves the pulmonary outcomes in animal models of severe BPD.

We previously reported that MV-O2 of newborn mice increased lung elastase activity, causing elastin degradation and redistribution of elastic fibers from septal tips to alveolar walls. These changes were associated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta activation and increased apoptosis leading to defective alveolarizationandlung growtharrest, as seen in neonatal chronic lung disease. Objective(s): To determine if intratracheal treatment of newborn mice with the serine elastase inhibitor elafin would prevent MV-O2-induced lung elastin degradation and the ensuing cascade of events causing lung growth arrest. Method(s): Five-day-old mice were treated via tracheotomy with recombinant human elafin or vehicle (lactated-Ringer solution), followed by MV with 40% O2 for 8-24 hours; control animals breathed 40% O2 without MV. At study's end, lungs were harvested to assess key variables noted below. Measurements and Main Results: MV-O2 of vehicle-treated pups increased lung elastase and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity when compared with unventilated control animals, causing elastin degradation (urine desmosine doubled), TGF-beta activation (pSmad-2 tripled), andapoptosis (cleaved-caspase-3 increased 10-fold).Quantitative lung histology showed larger and fewer alveoli, greater inflammation, and scattered elastic fibers. Elafin blocked these MV-O 2-induced changes. Conclusion(s): Intratracheal elafin, by blocking lung protease activity, prevented MV-O2-induced elastin degradation, TGF-beta activation, apoptosis, and dispersion of matrix elastin, and attenuated lung structural abnormalities noted in vehicle-treated mice after 24 hours of MV-O2. These findings suggest that elastin breakdown contributes to defective lung growth in response to MV-O2 and might be targeted therapeutically to prevent MV-O2-induced lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"54e0c9f1-8179-4418-8f6b-bb4fd94655ca","_showDetails":true},"04c0b385-5be5-400c-96be-b9b3fd312532":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"362354748","title":"Stem cells and cell therapies in lung biology and lung diseases","authors":["Weiss D.J.","Bertoncello I.","Borok Z.","Kim C.","Panoskaltsis-Mortari A.","Reynolds S.","Rojas M.","Stripp B.","Warburton D.","Prockop D.J."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["acute lung injury/th [Therapy]","adult respiratory distress syndrome/th [Therapy]","adult stem cell","asthma","bioengineering","cancer stem cell","cell adhesion","cell homing","cell proliferation","cell transdifferentiation","chronic obstructive lung disease/th [Therapy]","clinical trial (topic)","conference paper","embryonic stem cell","endothelial progenitor cell","engraftment","hematopoietic stem cell","human","immune response","immunomodulation","inflammation","lung alveolus epithelium","*lung disease/th [Therapy]","lung dysplasia","*lung function","mesenchymal stem cell","multicenter study (topic)","multipotent stem cell","nonhuman","pathogenesis","phagocytosis","phase 1 clinical trial (topic)","phase 2 clinical trial (topic)","phenotype","pluripotent stem cell","pulmonary hypertension/th [Therapy]","randomized controlled trial (topic)","sepsis","*stem cell","*stem cell transplantation","tissue regeneration","tissue repair","totipotent stem cell","amniotic fluid stem cell","bronchioalveolar stem cell","bronchiolar stem cell","facultative progenitor cell","fibrocyte","obligate progenitor cell","transit amplifying cell","unipotent stem cell"],"journal":"Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society","language":"English","volume":"8","number":"3","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1943-5665","address":"D.J.

These are rapidly expanding areas of study that provide further insight into and challenge traditional views of the mechanisms of lung repair after injury and pathogenesis of several lung diseases. The goals of the conference were to summarize the current state of the field, discuss and debate current controversies, and identify future research directions and opportunities for both basic and translational research in cell-based therapies for lung diseases. This conference was a follow-up to two previous conferences held at the University of Vermont, \"Adult Stem Cells, Lung Biology, and Lung Disease\" sponsored by the NHLBI, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the University of Vermont College of Medicine, and the Vermont Lung Center in 2005 and \"Stem Cells and Cell Therapies in Lung Biology and Diseases sponsored by the NHLBI, Alpha-1 Foundation, American Thoracic Society, Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation, University of Vermont College of Medicine, and the Vermont Lung Center in 2007. Those conferences have been instrumental in helping to guide research and funding priorities (1, 2). Since the 2007 conference, investigations of stem cells and cell therapies in lung biology and diseases have continued to expand rapidly. However, there continue to be changes in focus and direction, particularly with respect to cell-based therapy approaches. Recent studies of immunomodulation and paracrine effects of adult stem and progenitor cells, notably adult mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow, adipose, and other tissues, have increasingly provided evidence of efficacy in animal models of acute and fibrotic lung injuries as well as in asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sepsis, and other lung diseases. Although the mechanisms of MSC effects in these models are not yet fully understood, growing evidence implicates both soluble mediators released by the MSCs as well as cell to cell contact of MSCs with different inflammatory and immune effector cells. These studies have recently been extended to human lung explant models, and it is anticipated that clinical investigations of initial safety and efficacy of MSCs in acute lung injury will occur in the near future. In parallel, a 6-month interim analysis of a current clinical trial in the United States assessing systemic administration of MSCs in patients with moderate to severeCOPDhas demonstrated safety and has yielded promising results with respect to efficacy. This trial has completed its 2-year observation period, and data is expected to be released in late 2010 or early 2011.Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can contribute to regeneration of diseased pulmonary vasculature, and two recent clinical investigations in China have suggested the efficacy of autologous bone marrow-derived EPC administration in both adult and pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension. A comparable trial of autologous EPC administration in pulmonary hypertension, the Pulmonary Hypertension: Assessment of Cell Therapy (PHaCET) trial, is ongoing in Canada. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells may also play roles in both acute lung injury and in fibrotic lung diseases. Engraftment of systemically or intratracheally administered cells remains a controversial issue. Although most available evidence argues against significant engraftment, publications and abstracts presented at the conference suggest that several newly investigated cell types, including those derived from placental tissues or novel cell populations derived from adult bone marrow, may demonstrate a more robust ability to engraft and participate in lung repair. Further, significant advances continue to be made in novel areas of investigation including increasing exploration of 3-dimensional culture systems and bioengineering approaches to generate functional lung tissue ex vivo and in vivo. This has culminated in the first successful clinical use of a bioengineered trachea. In parallel, several recent reports demonstrate the potential feasibility of using decellularized whole lungs as scaffolds for recellularization and subsequent implantation. These areas are predicted to be of intense investigation over the next several years. Comparably, progress continues in studies of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). Several groups have presented protocols for deriving definitive endoderm from either ESCs or iPS cultured in vitro and some have further demonstrated the ability to generate cellswith phenotypicmarkers of type 2 alveolar cells from either mouse or human ESCs. In addition, a recent study demonstrated the potential ability of type 2 alveolar epithelial cells, derived in culture from human embryonic stem cells, to engraft in lung and ameliorate experimentally induced lung injury in a rodent model. Nonetheless, many challenges remain to generating functional lung cells fromeither ESCs or iPS. One potentially fruitful area of investigation derives from the recently demonstrated generation of disease-specific iPS from tissue samples obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis, a-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and other genetic or acquired lung diseases. Significant progress continues to be made in investigations of local (endogenous) stem and progenitor cells residing in the lungs. Advances in lineage-tracing approaches and other techniques have provided important insights into understanding the identity and lineage expansion properties of previously identified putative endogenous progenitor populations and suggest an increasingly complex network of cellular repair after injury. However, the study of endogenous lung stem and progenitor cells remains complicated by the role of the specific microenvironmental niches in which these cells reside. Alteration of the niches with experimental protocols or removal of cells from the niches can change their identifying characteristics and biologic activities. One of the challenges continuing to face the field is to continue to devise more refined lineage tracing and other study mechanisms to define, characterize, and explore potential therapeutic and/or pathologic properties of endogenous lung progenitor cells. This includes studies of lung cancer stem cells, an area of increasing focus and high interest that remains incompletely understood. Another challenge is that most studies of endogenous progenitor cells continue to use mouse models. Correlative information in human lungs remains poorly defined. Acontinuing issue of confusion is that of terminology. Despite suggested guidelines from previous conferences and from other sources, precise definitions and characterizations of specific cell populations, notably the putative endogenous cell populations in the lung as well as mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial progenitor cells, are not agreed upon. The terms \"stem cell\" and \"progenitor cell\" are still used with varying degrees of clarity and precision by different investigators and in recent publications. This continues to complicate the comparison of different investigative approaches. A glossary of relevant working definitions applicable to the lung, originally presented in the report of the 2007 conference, is depicted in Table 1. This glossary does not necessarily reflect a consensus for the definition of each term and will undergo continuing revision as an overall understanding of the cell types and mechanisms involved in lung repair continue to be elucidated. Nonetheless, it is a useful framework. The first session, \"Endogenous Lung Progenitor Cells/Lung Cancer Stem Cells,\" following an overview of the field by Paul Simmons (University of Texas) and respective presentations by Susan Reynolds (National Jewish), Ed Morrisey (University of Pennsylvania), Barry Stripp (Duke), Majd Mouded (University of Pittsburgh), and Kerstin Sinkevicius (Boston Children's Hospital), reviewed the current state of knowledge of endogenous progenitor cell populations, mechanisms regulating their behavior, and their potential to initiate or augment repair. This included lessons learned from lung development, the role of the local microenvironmental niches, and consideration of lung cancer progenitor cells. Key points emphasized during this session were that stem cells are operationally defined not solely by their intrinsic developmental potential but by their interaction with the microenvironments in which they reside. Further, the stem cell niche is a dynamic \"temporal\" niche with the capacity to modify stem cell behavior/readout in different contexts. Moreover, stem cell-associated markers are not uniquely expressed by stem cells and are unreliable predictors of the \"stem\" or \"progenitor\" cell potential of isolated cells. Validation by functional assays and lineage-tracing studies, particularly when interrogating isolated cells where histomorphometric spatial and positional cues are lost, are increasingly valid and necessary.","group":"g1","id":"04c0b385-5be5-400c-96be-b9b3fd312532","_showDetails":true},"d6302566-719b-437a-80c5-c0ddec553489":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"360224819","title":"Granulocyte colony stimulating factor attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury by down-modulating inflammatory responses in neonatal rats","authors":["Jeon G.W.","Sung D.K.","Jung Y.J.","Koo S.H.","Choi S.H.","Chang Y.S.","Sin J.B.","Park W.S."],"date":"2011//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","antiinflammatory activity","article","attenuation","controlled study","drug effect","experimental model","histopathology","*hyperoxia","*inflammation/dt [Drug Therapy]","inflammation/dt [Drug Therapy]","Korea","lung alveolus wall","*lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","newborn","nick end labeling","nonhuman","perinatal period","rat","Sprague Dawley rat","upregulation","weight gain","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","myeloperoxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","protein p67/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor/dt [Drug Therapy]","*recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration]","*recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor/pd [Pharmacology]","reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","superoxide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","transforming growth factor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Yonsei Medical Journal","language":"English","volume":"52","number":"1","publisher":"Yonsei University College of Medicine (Shinchon dong 134, Seodaemoon ku, Seoul 120-752, South Korea)","isbn":"0513-5796","address":"W.

Alveolar division requires precise epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. However, few experimental models exist for studying how these cell-cell interactions produce changes in 3-dimensional structure. Here we report an epithelial-mesenchymal cell co-culture model where 3-dimensional peaks form with similar cellular orientation as alveolar structures in vivo. Co-culturing fetal mouse lung mesenchyme with A549 epithelial cells produced tall peaks of cells covered by epithelia with cores of mesenchymal cells. These structures did not form when using adult lung fibroblasts. Peak formation did not require localized areas of cell proliferation or apoptosis. Mesenchymal cells co-cultured with epithelia adopted an elongated cell morphology closely resembling myofibroblasts within alveolar septa in vivo. Because inflammation inhibits alveolar formation, we tested the effects of E. coli lipopolysaccharide on 3-dimensional peak formation. Confocal and time-lapse imaging demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide reduced mesenchymal cell migration, resulting in fewer, shorter peaks with mesenchymal cells present predominantly at the base. This epithelial-mesenchymal co-culture model may therefore prove useful in future studies of mechanisms regulating alveolar morphogenesis.","group":"g1","id":"9d67d224-3e08-4f03-8546-49939124a794","_showDetails":true},"fe3891dd-1744-480e-be0d-92c1bc53d6bf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"359945773","title":"Intra and interobserver reliability of the interpretation of high-resolution computed tomography on the lungs of premature infants","authors":["Boechat M.C.B.","de Mello R.R.","Dutra M.V.P.","da Silva K.S.","Daltro P.","Marchiori E."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["article","atelectasis/di [Diagnosis]","clinical evaluation","clinical practice","clinical research","controlled study","cross-sectional study","*fetus lung maturity","gestational age","*high resolution computer tomography","hospital discharge","human","image analysis","infant","interrater reliability","intrarater reliability","kappa statistics","length of stay","low birth weight","major clinical study","*prematurity"],"journal":"Sao Paulo Medical Journal","language":"Portuguese","volume":"128","number":"3","publisher":"Associacao Paulista de Medicina (E-mail: revistas@apm.org.br)","isbn":"1516-3180","address":"M.

The aim here was to evaluate the reliability of the interpretation of HRCT among very low birth weight premature infants (VLBWPI; < 1500 g). Design and setting: Cross-sectional study on intra and interobserver reliability of HRCT on VLBWPI. Method(s): 86 VLBWPI underwent HRCT. Two pediatric radiologists analyzed the HRCT images. The reliability was measured by the proportion of agreement, kappa coefficient (KC) and positive and negative agreement indices. RESULT(S): For radiologist A, the intraobserver reliability KC was 0.79 (confidence interval, CI: 0.54-1.00) for normal/abnormal examinations; for each abnormality on CT, KC ranged from 0.05 to 1.00. For radiologist B, the intraobserver reliability KC was 0.79 (CI: 0.54-1.00) for normal/abnormal examinations; for each abnormality on CT, KC ranged from 0.37 to 0.83. The interobserver agreement was 88% for normal/abnormal examinations and KC was 0.71 (CI: 0.5- 0.93); for most abnormal fndings, KC ranged from 0.51-0.67. CONCLUSION(S): For normal/abnormal examinations, the intra and interobserver agreements were substantial. For most of the imaging findings, the intraobserver agreement ranged from moderate to substantial. Our data demonstrate that in clinical practice, there is no reason for more than one tomographic image evaluator, provided that this person is well trained in VLBWPI HRCT interpretation. Analysis by different observers should be reserved for research and for difficult cases in clinical contexts.","group":"g1","id":"fe3891dd-1744-480e-be0d-92c1bc53d6bf","_showDetails":false},"b730f17d-f91e-44b2-8442-6f78b8e0a2c7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"359960960","title":"Adrenomedullin promotes lung angiogenesis, alveolar development, and repair","authors":["Vadivel A.","Abozaid S.","Van Haaften T.","Sawicka M.","Eaton F.","Chen M.","Thebaud B."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*angiogenesis","animal cell","animal experiment","animal model","apoptosis","arterial wall thickness","article","competitive inhibition","controlled study","density","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","in vivo study","*lung alveolus","lung blood vessel","lung capillary","*lung development","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","newborn","nonhuman","protection","protein expression","pulmonary artery","pulmonary hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]","pulmonary hypertension/pc [Prevention]","rat","real time polymerase chain reaction","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","*adrenomedullin/dv [Drug Development]","*adrenomedullin/dt [Drug Therapy]","*adrenomedullin/na [Intranasal Drug Administration]","*adrenomedullin/pd [Pharmacology]","*adrenomedullin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]","adrenomedullin receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","endothelial nitric oxide synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","hypertensive agent","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","unclassified drug","vasculotropin A/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*lung angiogenesis","adrenomedullin 22-25"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","language":"English","volume":"43","number":"2","publisher":"American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)","isbn":"1044-1549","address":"B.

Both are characterized by alveolar simplification andabnormal distal airspace enlargement due to arrested development or loss of alveoli, respectively. Both lack effective treatments. Mechanisms that inhibit distal lung growth are poorly understood. Adrenomedullin (AM), a recently discovered potent vasodilator, promotes angiogenesis and has protective effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Its role in the developing lung is unknown. We hypothesized that AM promotes lung angiogenesis and alveolar development. Accordingly, we report that lung mRNA expression of AM increases during normal alveolar development. In vivo, intranasal administration of the AM antagonist, AM22-52 decreases lung capillary density (12.4 +/- 1.5 versus 18 +/- 1.5 in control animals; P < 0.05) and impairs alveolar development (mean linear intercept, 52.3 +/- 1.5 versus 43.8 +/- 1.8 [P < 0.05] and septal counts 62.0 +/- 2.7 versus 90.4 +/- 3.5 [P < 0.05]) in neonatal rats, resulting in larger and fewer alveoli, reminiscent of BPD. This was associated with decreased lung endothelial nitric oxide synthase and vascular endothelial growth factor-A mRNA expression. In experimental oxygen-induced BPD, a model of arrested lung vascular and alveolar growth, AM attenuates arrested lung angiogenesis (vessel density, 6.9 +/- 1.1 versus 16.2 +/- 1.3, P < 0.05) and alveolar development (mean linear intercept, 51.9 +/- 3.2 versus 44.4 +/- 0.7, septal counts 47.6 +/- 3.4 versus 67.7 +/- 4.0, P < 0.05), an effect in part mediated by inhibition of apoptosis. AM also prevents pulmonary hypertension in this model, as assessed by decreased right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary artery medial wall thickness. Our findings suggest a role for AM during normal alveolar development. AM may have therapeutic potential in diseases associated with alveolar injury.","group":"g1","id":"b730f17d-f91e-44b2-8442-6f78b8e0a2c7","_showDetails":true},"bec369a6-03d5-405c-916b-d466261bf773":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"358910601","title":"N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide as a marker of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants","authors":["Joseph L.","Nir A.","Hammerman C.","Goldberg S.","Ben Shalom E.","Picard E."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["article","clinical article","controlled study","correlation function","disease severity","female","gestational age","human","*lung dysplasia/cn [Congenital Disorder]","*lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","lung dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","male","newborn","*prematurity","priority journal","protein analysis","protein blood level","respiratory distress","*amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","biological marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]","diuretic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"American Journal of Perinatology","language":"English","volume":"27","number":"5","publisher":"Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.","isbn":"1098-8785","address":"E.

It is clear that nutrition plays a roll in lung development of premature infant, but don't know exactly how nutrition can benefit this growth or how it can interference if it is wrong. Excessive amounts of fluids during the first days of life has been proposed as a promoting factor of BPD, but controlled trials have a high variability of designs and do not demonstrated this relation. Early and aggressive feeding has been proposed to prevent metabolic shock and induce better growth but again there are no data to support any effect decreasing BPD rate. Recent studies do not support this higher growth with earlier and higher protein administration. Intravenous lipids given very early after birth was proposed as a risk factor for death and morbidity, recent data support a beneficial effect of early-administrated intravenous are well tolerated. But high doses of Vitamin A given intramuscularly during the first weeks of life has demonstrated a benefit decreasing BPD in newborns with a birth weight of less than 1.000 grams. Other nutrients have demonstrated no effect in preventing the development of BPD. So even a close relation between nutrition and lung growth is proven, there are no well clinical trials in human designated to show how nutrition acts, being necessary more trials to better define how we can decrease chronic lung injuries in preterm newborns improving nutrition.","group":"g1","id":"429bdf31-1215-409f-ac14-d02cfe7dd158","_showDetails":false},"1f3a2730-e074-4ba2-8a46-1e8fb5feae26":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"354982836","title":"alpha-Phenyl-n-tert-butylnitrone attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury by down-modulating inflammation in neonatal rats","authors":["Chang Y.S.","Kim Y.J.","Yoo H.S.","Sung D.K.","Kim S.Y.","Kang S.","Park W.S."],"date":"2009//","keywords":["animal experiment","animal model","animal tissue","*antiinflammatory activity","article","controlled study","down regulation","enzyme activation","female","*hyperoxia","inflammation","lung alveolus","lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","*lung injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","newborn","nick end labeling","nonhuman","priority journal","rat","Sprague Dawley rat","upregulation","interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound]","messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","*n tert butyl alpha phenylnitrone/dt [Drug Therapy]","*n tert butyl alpha phenylnitrone/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration]","*n tert butyl alpha phenylnitrone/pd [Pharmacology]","oxygen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","protein p67/ec [Endogenous Compound]","reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","superoxide/ec [Endogenous Compound]","transforming growth factor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]"],"journal":"Experimental Lung Research","language":"English","volume":"35","number":"3","publisher":"Informa Healthcare (69-77 Paul Street, London EC2A 4LQ, United Kingdom)","isbn":"1521-0499","address":"W.

Method(s): A case-control cohort study was conducted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Singapore General Hospital on 221 VLBW infants born <34 weeks with birth weight <1,500g and received caffeine citrate for 2 weeks for treatment of apnea of pre-maturity. The demographic and clinical characteristics among study infants in the two groups were similar. The primary outcome measure is the total number of episodes of apnea, shallow breathing, bradycardia and desaturation over the first 2 weeks of caffeine therapy. Secondary outcome measures include i) frequency of shallow breathing, apnea, bradycardia and desaturation episodes, caffeine levels and reintubation rates; ii) evaluation of toxicity i.e. tachycardia, jitteriness and feed intolerance, and iii) evaluation of associated morbidity such as retinopathy of pre-maturity requiring treatment, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and grade 1 or 2 intraventricular haemorrhage. Result(s): The total number of episodes of shallow breathing, apnea, bradycardia and cyanosis (SABC) within the first week was significantly higher at 42.5 in half-dose vs 27 in recommended-dose caffeine (p<0.001). The difference is not significant in second week, when total shallow breathing, apnea, bradycardia and cyanosis (SABC) were 23.5 and 21 in half-and recommended-dose caffeine respectively (p=0.155). The total number of SBAC in 2 weeks was 73.5 vs 49 in half-dose and recommended-dose respectively (p=0.011). There was no difference in the incidence of side-effects, reintubation rate, or duration of caffeine in the two groups. There was no difference in rate of BPD or ROP in the two groups. Contrary to belief, there was a decrease in the incidence of feed intolerance in the recommended dose of caffeine p=0.006, odds ratio (95% CI) at 0.451(0.261-0.780). Conclusion(s): There is a clinically significant difference in apnea control in recommended Caffeine Citrate dose in the first week of life without significant increase in side-effects.

Since its approval for use in 1995 has been used increasingly and has helped with Neonatal Intensive Care Units (ICU) facilities the decline in infant mortality from this cause from 0.8 in 1994 to 0.1 per thousand live births in 2008. However, since the first clinical trial (CT) conducted in 1994 and a further comparative CT with Beractant made in Mexico, after more than 10 years of use is not aware of the effectiveness and frequency of adverse events associated with the use of the drug today. Material(s) and Method(s): As we set out to make a CT of pharmacovigilance (Phase IV) prospectively in 13 provinces and 17 neonatal ICU in the country. We included 259 newborns with SDRN to whom SURFACEN was applied at 100 mg / kg dose by tracheal instillation in one or more applications depending on the patient requirements. Results and discussion: The results show a rapid and sustained increase in arterial blood oxygenation index measured by PaO2/FiO2 almost immediately after applying the surfactant, the number of applications were 2.0 +/- 1 and the output indicators as ICU stay was 11.9 +/- 11.4 days, mechanical ventilation 7.1 +/- 8.9 days and mortality 19.7%. Most striking was the reduction of mortality to almost half compared with the previous EC and that was the cause SDRN only 13.7% of deaths. The observed complications were: late pneumonia 22.8%, ductus arteriosus reopening 13.9%, pneumothorax 12.4%, bronchopulmonary dysplasia 11.4%, other complications were below 7%. We conclude that survival is higher than in previous studies and tends to increase, most deaths are not caused by SDRN, oxygenation after treatment was comparable to that reported and is considered adequate and the complication rate is very similar the previous EC, other adverse events were related with the rapid increase in arterial blood oxygenation. Conclusion(s): In general SURFACEN has high effectiveness and safety and has contributed to the decline in infant mortality by SDRN in Cuba.","group":"g1","id":"9256408b-d894-429e-9b3f-65976f29e35a","_showDetails":true},"556e7952-2e79-4b85-8a35-761b633e6d87":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"71766566","title":"Activated protein C protects the developing lung from hyperoxia-induced lung injury","authors":["Nold-Petry C.A.","Veldman A.","Nold M.F.","Sands S.A.","Silas R.","Skuza E.M.","Stockx E.M.","Cohen G.","Joshi M.S.","Dinarello C.A.","Berger P.J."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*society","*hyperoxia","*lung injury","*lung","*infection","*autoimmune disease","*neoplasm","inflammation","mortality","ambient air","mouse","inhalation","lung dysplasia","subcutaneous drug administration","pneumonia","death","long term survival","lung development","fibrosis","infant","morbidity","side effect","baby","lung disease","cerebrospinal fluid","*cytokine","*activated protein C","*interferon","interleukin 6","interleukin 1","interleukin 5","colony stimulating factor 1","chemokine","protein C","oxygen","placebo","interleukin 10"],"journal":"Cytokine","language":"English","volume":"52","number":"1-2","publisher":"Academic Press","isbn":"1043-4666","address":"C.A.

BPD is a severe lung disease that affects babies born preterm. Apart from side-effect-prone glucocorticosteroids, no anti-inflammatory strategy is available, and considerable morbidity and mortality in affected infants cannot be prevented. Therefore, we set out to investigate the benefits of protein C in BPD. Newborn mice were exposed to room air or to 85% oxygen (hyperoxia). 10 control and 10 hyperoxia animals received daily subcutaneous injections with placebo, whereas 10 additional hyperoxia animals received 2 mg/kg activated protein C (aPC) daily. Compared to room air, inhalation of 85% oxygen resulted in up to over 30-fold increases in the levels of several cytokines, including IL-1alpha/beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-5, IL-17, and M-CSF as well as chemokines in the neonatal lung on day 2 of life. Treatment with aPC nearly completely abolished this inflammatory response, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines to near baseline/room air (e.g., IL-1alpha/beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, M-CSF, and chemokines 40 to 80% lower). IL-5 and IL-17 were also reduced (64%, 54%), whereas anti-inflammatory IL-10 was 2-fold increased. At day 28, IL-1alpha/beta, IL-6, MIP-1alpha, and TNFalpha were still 33 to 70% decreased. At this time point, we furthermore observed the histological changes characteristic of severe BPD, namely reduced alveolarization and increased fibrosis, in vehicle-injected animals after hyperoxia. aPC administration markedly improved lung development in hyperoxia, as assessed by a decrease in alveolar area by 55% and an increase in the number of alveoli by 35%. In a long-term survival study, mortality in the hyperoxia-placebo group was 75% after 2 months, whereas only 10% of the hyperoxia- aPC mice had died. These data suggest that aPC protects the developing lung from the detrimental effects of hyperoxia, including early death, by reducing lung inflammation; aPC may thus become a treatment option in BPD.","group":"g3","id":"556e7952-2e79-4b85-8a35-761b633e6d87","_showDetails":true},"522d891d-fa28-4ece-bf06-1935c839ef57":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70981844","title":"Epithelial-specific deletion of APC alters cell fate determination during lung development","authors":["Chan B.","Li A.","Li C.","Xing Y.","Li M.","Minoo P."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*cell fate","*lung development","*medical research","lung","epithelium cell","Western blotting","mutant","identity","polyp","prematurity","LoxP site","human","staining","cell proliferation","infant","airway","cell lineage","basal cell","lung dysplasia","Wnt signaling pathway","angiogenesis","neurosecretory cell","smooth muscle","attenuation","immunohistochemistry","morphogenesis","embryo","mouse","bronchiole","lung alveolus cell","tumor suppressor gene","catenin","marker"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"58","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"B.

Normal lung morphogenesis is interrupted, as evidenced by the attenuation of alveogenesis and vasculogenesis. The Wnt signaling pathway, mediated via beta-catenin, plays a key role in cell proliferation and cell fate determination during development. In the absence of Wnt signal, Adenomatous Polyosis Coli (APC) forms a destruction complex and inhibits beta-catenin activity. The role of APC in lung development is unknown. The current study was designed to address this knowledge gap by examining the consequences of inactivating the APC gene via a Cre-LoxP approach, specifically in lung epithelial cells. Methods Used: Nkx2.1 is a marker of lung epithelial cell identity. We used the Nkx2.1-cre to drive recombination in Apc flox/flox mice. Double-transgenic Nkx2.1-cre; Apc flox/flox embryos were sacrificed at different stages of development. The lungs were analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Summary of Results: APC is expressed in normal developing lungs. APC is co-localized with markers for smooth muscle, ciliated and neuroendocrine cells, but not Clara and basal cells. In mutant lung epithelial cells, immunoflourescent staining and western blot confirmed a significant decrease in APC and a commensurate accumulation of beta-catenin. Phenotypically, the Apc mutant lungs showed abnormal dilation of the distal airways and formation of polyps within the bronchioles. The polyps lacked both A-TUBULIN and NKX2.1 expression, which indicate the loss of lung epithelial cell lineage. Conclusion(s): Epithelial-specific deletion of APC leads to accumulation of beta-catenin and distinct phenotypic changes in developing lungs with loss of pulmonary cell identity. Further studies are underway to delineate the mechanism in which Apc controls lung development.","group":"g1","id":"522d891d-fa28-4ece-bf06-1935c839ef57","_showDetails":true},"9c421754-ba18-42cf-ab1a-dea1968f3006":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"A study of genes encoding cytokines (IL6, IL10, TNF), cytokine receptors (IL6R, IL6ST), and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and susceptibility to bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12881-014-0120-7","authors":["Huusko, Johanna M","Karjalainen, Minna K","Mahlman, Mari","Haataja, Ritva","Kari, M Anneli","Andersson, Sture","Toldi, Gergely","Tammela, Outi","Ramet, Mika","Lavoie, Pascal M","Hallman, Mikko","Andersson S","Janer C","Kari MA","Ketola I","Sankilampi U","Hallman M","Huusko JM","Karjalainen MK","Mahlman M","Marttila R","Ramet M","Tammela O","Lehtonen L","Lacaze-Masmonteil T","Gen-BPD Study Group"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20141101//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Case-Control Studies","Cytokine Receptor gp130/ge [Genetics]","*Cytokines/ge [Genetics]","Disease Susceptibility","Epistasis, Genetic","Genotype","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Interleukin-10/ge [Genetics]","Interleukin-6/ge [Genetics]","Linkage Disequilibrium","Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","*Receptors, Cytokine/ge [Genetics]","*Receptors, Glucocorticoid/ge [Genetics]","Receptors, Interleukin-6/ge [Genetics]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"BMC medical genetics","volume":"15","isbn":"1471-2350","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25409741"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease associated with very preterm birth. The major risk factors include lung inflammation and lung immaturity. In addition, genetic factors play an important role in susceptibility to moderate-to-severe BPD. In this study, the aim was to investigate whether common polymorphisms of specific genes that are involved in inflammation or differentiation of the lung have influence on BPD susceptibility., METHODS: Genes encoding interleukin-6 (IL6) and its receptors (IL6R and IL6ST), IL-10 (IL10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) were assessed for associations with moderate-to-severe BPD susceptibility. Five IL6, nine IL6R, four IL6ST, one IL10, two TNF, and 23 NR3C1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in very preterm infants born in northern Finland (56 cases and 197 controls) and Canada (58 cases and 68 controls). IL-6, TNF and gp130 contents in umbilical cord blood, collected from very preterm infants, were studied for associations with the polymorphisms. Epistasis (i.e., interactions between SNPs in BPD susceptibility) was also examined. SNPs showing suggestive associations were analyzed in additional replication populations from Finland (39 cases and 188 controls) and Hungary (29 cases and 40 controls)., RESULTS: None of the studied SNPs were associated with BPD nor were the IL6, TNF or IL6ST SNPs associated with cord blood IL-6, TNF and gp130, respectively. However, epistasis analysis suggested that SNPs in IL6ST and IL10 were associated interactively with risk of BPD in the northern Finnish population; however, this finding did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing and the finding was not replicated in the other populations., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the analyzed SNPs within IL6, IL6R, IL6ST, IL10, TNF, and NR3C1 were not associated with BPD. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the studied SNPs directly contribute to the cord blood protein contents.","group":"g1","id":"9c421754-ba18-42cf-ab1a-dea1968f3006","_showDetails":true},"9a7c4439-1b13-4f6c-843b-5731146444af":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70981839","title":"Late doses of surfactant in ventilated premature infants: A pilot study","authors":["Ballard R.","Keller R.","Merrill J.","Palermo L.","Truog W.","Steinhorn R.","Ryan R.","Eichenwald E.","Durand D.","Courtney S.","Black D.","Ballard P."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*infant","*human","*prematurity","*pilot study","*medical research","artificial ventilation","lung dysplasia","intubation","bradycardia","resuscitation","hospital","survival","newborn","gestational age","male","lung hemorrhage","procedures","pneumothorax","tracheal aspiration procedure","multicenter study","*surfactant","nitric oxide","calfactant","surfactant protein B"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"58","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"R.

Treatment with inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) increases survival without BPD (Ballard R, New Engl J Med 2006, 2007) but does not abolish surfactant dysfunction. We hypothesized that late doses of surfactant plus iNO would improve surfactant function and decrease occurrence of BPD. Methods Used: We enrolled infants <30 wk GA who required mechanical ventilation and were receiving iNO at 7-14 d in a multicenter, randomized, blinded pilot Trial Of Late SURFactant (TOLSURF) and treated with up to five additional doses of surfactant (Infasurf) or sham administration over 3 wk. Summary of Results: Between 2/08 and 6/09, 60 infants at 9 hospitals were enrolled with mean BWof 693 +/-114 g, GA of 25.4 +/- 1.3 wk, and 58% male. 7 infants (12%) died before 36 wk. 70% of the infants remained intubated and received all 5 doses per protocol. During 259 doses of study drug (or sham) only 4 (1.5%) infants had significant bradycardia, 4 required re-intubation and 1 infant required resuscitation. The mean respiratory severity score (RSS=MAP X FiO2) was 3.1 at study entry and decreased or was unchanged 2 h after each of 5 dosing procedures. There were no episodes of pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage or worsening of a PDA. Conclusion(s): We conclude that late administration of surfactant is safe and tolerated well by intubated premature infants.

Vitamin A, or retinoic acid (RA), acts via retinoic acid receptors alpha, A, and F (RARalpha, RARbeta and RARF, respectively) to effect gene transcription. The role of the RARs is vital for normal lung development as demonstrated by knockout mice. However, the effect of IUGR on RAR gene expression and retinoic acid levels has not been well elucidated.We therefore hypothesized IUGR would decrease RAR gene expression and serum retinoic acid levels, and would adversely affect lung architecture at critical stages of rat lung development. Methods Used: We used a vascular model of IUGR in the rat and measured mRNA and protein levels of RARalpha, RARbeta and RARF using standard methods. Measurements were performed at 3 ages - day 0 (D0), day 6 (D6) and day 21 (D21) of life. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate localization of RARs. High performance liquid chromatography was used to measure serum RA levels, and morphometric analysis was incorporated to assess quantitative architecture changes in the rat lung. Summary of Results: IUGR significantly decreased gene expression of RARalpha in both sexes and RARbeta in males only at D0, the saccular stage of rat lung development. At D6, the alveolar stage of rat lung development, IUGR significantly decreased mRNA levels of RARF without changing protein abundance. Contrary to our hypothesis IUGR actually increased gene expression of RARF at D21, a time of waning lung development. The noted changes in gene expression caused by IUGR occurred in the absence of any changes in serum levels of retinoic acid or RAR localization at D6 or D21, or quantifiable changes in lung architecture at D6. Conclusion(s): We conclude that IUGR decreases expression of RARalpha, RARbeta and RARF at critical stages of rat lung development and does so in the presence of normal serum retinoic acid levels. As hypothesized, affects of IUGR showed gender specificity, and males appear to be more adversely affected. We speculate that IUGR results in prenatal reprogramming, the effects of which alter retinoic acid signaling pathways.","group":"g1","id":"47c913cf-6900-4837-aa19-1e6b65a6eda5","_showDetails":true},"2a9cbfa8-f2cf-4182-bf3c-b0204c17d36a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70981539","title":"Intrauterine growth restriction decreases pulmonary TRPV4 expression","authors":["Zinkhan E.","Wang Y.","Brown A.","Fung C.","Joss-Moore L.","Lane R."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*prenatal growth","*medical research","female","mouse","lung edema","male","endothelium cell","pregnancy","lung dysplasia","lung","pump","human","hypothesis","risk","adult","uterus","retroperitoneum","placenta insufficiency","postnatal development","Western blotting","gender","prenatal exposure","cell function","lung development","messenger RNA","protein","thromboxane","vanilloid receptor 4"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"58","number":"1","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"E.

BPD is characterized by pulmonary edema with subsequent arrest of alveolar development. Activation of pulmonary endothelial cell transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels leads to pulmonary edema in adult mice. Despite the potential importance of TRPV4 in the development of pulmonary edema, little is known about how TRPV4 and expression changes during normal postnatal lung development. Further, whether IUGR affects the normal ontological pattern of TRPV4 remains unknown. We hypothesized that IUGR increases TRPV4 mRNA and protein levels. Methods Used: To test this hypothesis, murine IUGR was induced by implanting pumps to deliver 0.5% EtOH (control) or thromboxane in 0.5% EtOH at 2000ng/h into the retroperitoneum of female mice at day 13 of pregnancy to create placental insufficiency. Pups allowed to deliver at term and lungs harvested at day 0 (DOL 0), day 21 (DOL 21), or day 90 (DOL 90). Real time RT PCR used to determine the quantity of TRPV4 mRNA at each time point. Western blotting was used to quantify TRPV4 protein. Summary of Results: Results are presented as either DOL 0 relative to DOL 90 or IUGR relative to control, +/- standard error of the mean. Control TRPV4 mRNA and protein increased significantly from DOL 0 to DOL 90 in both males (400% +/- 100% mRNA and 285% +/- 59% protein) and females (420% +/- 100% mRNA and 417% +/- 52% protein). IUGR significantly decreased TRPV4 mRNA relative to control at DOL 0 in males (40% +/- 20%) and females (40% +/- 3%), and at DOL 21 in females (61% +/- 6%). At DOL 90 no statistically significant differences were seen in TRPV4 mRNA levels in IUGR mice. TRPV4 protein levels trended toward significant decrease in IUGR DOL 0 males (57% +/- 4%) with significant decrease in DOL 21 female IUGR mice (54% +/- 4%), and no change at DOL 90. Conclusion(s): TRPV4 mRNA and protein levels increase during normal postnatal development. IUGR decreases TRPV4 mRNA and protein levels in an age and gender specific manner. These findings are intriguing because they demonstrate that the prenatal environment alters TRPV4 expression. We speculate that by decreasing TRPV4 expression, IGUR alters endothelial cell function throughout development.","group":"g1","id":"2a9cbfa8-f2cf-4182-bf3c-b0204c17d36a","_showDetails":true},"ac17bdcc-6dec-4329-b339-46dc243164ed":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70981306","title":"Ureaplasma increases matrix metallopeptidase 9 in the fetal mouse lung","authors":["Fierro-Perez G.A.","Benjamin J.T.","Chaplin J.","Gebb S.A."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*mouse","*lung","*medical research","*Ureaplasma","explant","fetus lung","lung fibroblast","Ureaplasma infection","zymography","lung alveolus epithelium","extracellular matrix","prematurity","macrophage","infant","fibroblast","Ureaplasma parvum","lung dysplasia","phenotype","mesenchyme","real time polymerase chain reaction","branching morphogenesis","gene expression","cell line","airway","upregulation","risk factor","lung development","human","*matrix metalloproteinase","messenger RNA","collagenase","lipopeptide","gelatin","peptide"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"58","number":"2","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"G.A.

BPD is characterized by abnormalities in terminal airway branching and alveolarization. In the developing lung, collagenases Matrix Metallopeptidase's (MMP) 9 & 2 remodel the extracellular matrix scaffold thus allowing normal branching morphogenesis. We speculate that Ureaplasma alters collagenase expression in fetal lungs contributing to the BPD phenotype. To test this we hypothesized that Ureaplasma alters expression and activity of MMP9 and MMP2 in the fetal mouse lung. Methods Used: Lung explants were isolated from E15 mice and cultured with or without Ureaplasma parvum or Pam2CSK4, a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide with activity similar to the macrophage stimulatory activity of Ureaplasma. Primary fetal lung fibroblasts and a murine lung alveolar epithelial cell line (MLE-12) were cultured and treated with either Ureaplasma or the peptide. Gene expression was quantified using real time PCR. Activity of secreted MMP9 and MMP2 was measured using gelatin zymography. Summary of Results: Ureaplasma treatment resulted in a 6.7 fold increase in MMP9 mRNA expression in fetal mouse lung explants (P < 0.05). Pam2CSK4 also increased explant MMP9 mRNA expression compared to control (100ng/ml- 6 fold increase, 200ng/ml - 9 fold increase; P < 0.05). MMP2 mRNA expression was unaffected by either treatment. To test if both the fetal lung mesenchyme and the alveolar epithelium were involved in the up-regulation of explant MMP9, we cultured primary fetal lung fibroblasts and MLE-12 cells. Ureaplasma and Pam2CSK4 increased MMP9 mRNA expression in primary lung fibroblasts (50.2 fold increase, P < 0.05) but not in MLE-12 cells. In preliminary zymography experiments we have found MMP9 but not MMP2 secreted activity to be increased in explants and in fetal lung fibroblasts treated with Pam2CSK4 or Ureaplasma. This awaits confirmation in future experiments. Conclusion(s): In fetal mouse lung explants and cultured fibroblasts, Ureaplasma and Pam2CSK4 increase MMP9 mRNA expression. We speculate that increased MMP9 by altering extracellular matrix deposition and degradation may contribute to the altered lung development seen with antenatal Ureaplasma infections.","group":"g1","id":"ac17bdcc-6dec-4329-b339-46dc243164ed","_showDetails":true},"b159e24e-5ab2-47b4-b3dc-e0b19a681ff1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70981304","title":"Retinoids attenuate hyperoxia effects on newborn mouse lung","authors":["James M.L.","Ross A.C.","Bulger A.","Ambalavanan N."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*mouse","*lung","*medical research","lung development","newborn","lung function","prematurity","morphometrics","human","lung dysplasia","ambient air","supplementation","lung homogenate","infant","clinical trial (topic)","death","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","high performance liquid chromatography","*retinoid","cytokine","retinol","interferon","retinoic acid","messenger RNA","macrophage inflammatory protein 2","gamma interferon","protein"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","language":"English","volume":"58","number":"2","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"1081-5589","address":"M.L.

This gene expresses fibrillin, the major component of elastin associated microfibrils. As a result of this mutation a connective tissue disorder is manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes and cardiovascular system. The two most common cardiac lesions are mitral valve myxomatous degeneration and media cystic degenetation of the aorta. Patient(s): The infant was a female at the 31st week of gestation referred because of cardiomegaly associated with tricuspid and mitral dysmorphogenesis, leading to severe insufficiency detected on ultrasonogram. The child was born at 32nd week of gestation, needed resuscitation, persisted with respiratory discomfort and died on 2nd day of life. Autopsy examination revealed micrognathia and arachnodactyly. Cardiomegaly with concordant cardiac connections, soft and billowy mitral and tricuspid valves were observed. Right ventricle and atrium were dilated. In addition, ascending pulmonary artery showed a sacular dilatation. Histopathology revealed elastin fragmentation (cystic degeneration) of pulmonary artery media but not in aorta. Mitral and tricuspid valves showed myxomatous stromal degeneration. Other relevant findings were bilateral pneumonia, hyaline membrane disease and passive congestion of liver and spleen. A post-mortem diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was made. Conclusion(s): Marfan syndrome frequently affects aorta causing cystic media degeneration in adults. In this case report, authors suggest pulmonary artery hypertension caused by peculiar neonatal circulation, associated with bilateral pneumonia resulted in media lesions on pulmonary artery but not on aorta.","group":"g1","id":"62f00120-c248-4edb-839b-3d73dd0bc4c6","_showDetails":false},"42ab7f01-f109-434c-80f4-724e8ee21a1d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70844588","title":"Neonatal hyperoxia exposure augments respiratory syncytial virus disease in nrf2 deficient mice","authors":["Cho H.","Miller-DeGraff L.","Perrow L.","Yamamoto M.","Polack F.","Kleeberger S."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*exposure","*Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus","*virus infection","*mouse","*society","infection","genotype","epithelium cell","cell damage","adult","lymphocytic infiltration","antioxidant responsive element","lung lavage","pneumonia","lung dysplasia","rodent","adulthood","model","mucus","injury","wild type","inflammation","mucous cell","lipid peroxidation","acute lung injury","edema","lung","lung parenchyma","airway","metaplasia","cell vacuole","protein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"H.

Method(s): Adult Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) and wild-type (Nrf2+/+) mice exposed to hyperoxia (100% O2) or air at birth (P1-P3) were infected intranasally with RSV19 (1x106 PFU). Mice were sacrificed at 1 and 5 days post-RSV infection, and lung inflammation and injury was determined by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and histopathologic analysis. Result(s): Relative to air-exposed controls, pulmonary neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation induced by RSV infection (1 day) was heightened in Nrf2-/- mice exposed to O2, but not in Nrf2+/+ mice. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure resulted in early epithelial cell injury and lymphocytic infiltration after RSV infection (1 day), relative to air exposure, in both genotypes. However, Nrf2-/- mice displayed greater and extended epithelial and lymphocytic responses by 5 days post-RSV. Lung protein edema was not affected by either pre-exposure to hyperoxia or RSV infection in both genotypes. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure enhanced lipid peroxidation levels slightly in BAL cells from both genotypes, while RSV infection potentiated it only in Nrf2-/- mice at 5 days. Histopathologic analysis of lung tissues demonstrated that RSV caused marked mucous cell metaplasia only in Nrf2-/- mice, while neonatal hyperoxia suppressed this pathologic change in Nrf2-/- mice, probably due to epithelial cell injury and mucus hypersecretion. Nrf2-/- mice neonatally exposed to hyperoxia displayed more severe lymphocytic accumulation, alveolar vacuolization, and fibroproliferation at 5 days post-RSV, compared to similarly-exposed Nrf2+/+ mice. Conclusion(s): Results suggests that neonatal hyperoxia exposure enhances sensitivity to RSV disease in adulthood and Nrf2 deficiency boosts this response in mice.","group":"g1","id":"42ab7f01-f109-434c-80f4-724e8ee21a1d","_showDetails":true},"efb2ab83-76b7-402d-a529-03b7fd004f03":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70842813","title":"Changes in thoracic cage and lung mechanics secondary to hypophosphatasia and human recombinant enzyme replacement therapy","authors":["Rodriguez M.E.","Bober M.B.","Heinle R.","Zamora A.","Rogers K.","Davey L.","Li Puma A.","Locke R.","Shaffer T.","Chidekel A."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*human","*hypophosphatasia","*enzyme replacement","*society","*lung mechanics","ventilator","thorax wall","breathing mechanics","thorax","compliance (physical)","normal value","pneumonia","patient","deformity","lung function","bronchoscopy","mouse","tissues","model","clinical trial (topic)","infant","survival","lung dysplasia","mineralization","autosomal recessive disorder","oscillometry","bone","lung","tidal volume","therapy","tracheostomy","bone mineralization","muscle hypotonia","tracheomalacia","mechanics","dynamics","solid","septic shock","respiratory failure","ambient air","hospital","male","*recombinant enzyme","alkaline phosphatase","hybrid protein","antibiotic agent","mucolytic agent","oxygen"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.E.

In the perinatal lethal form, respiratory complications due to hypoplastic lungs and rachitic deformities of the thoracic cage are present. ENB-0040 is a bone-targeted, human recombinant TNSALP fusion protein that restored skeletal mineralization and survival in a mouse model of lethal HPP and is now undergoing clinical trials in infants with severe HPP. Description: A 2 week (w) old, 33w premature male was transferred to the NICU with the perinatal lethal form of HHP. He remained in ventilator dependent respiratory failure since birth due to chest wall insufficiency and hypotonia. A baseline chest film is shown (Figure 1A) and tracheostomy was performed at 7w of age; averaged respiratory mechanics measurements for the pt along with predicted normal values are given in figure 2: Compliance was reduced (25%) and resistance was greater (>400%) than predicted. Baseline noninvasive pulmonary function testing (NIPFT) showed that impulse oscillometry (IOS) measurements (resistance and reactance) were possible and systematic % of changes were seen at 4, 12 and 27w. Thoracoabdominal motion analysis (TAM) showed asynchrony with a phase angle of 163degree and 5% of rib cage contribution to tidal volume excursions was observed. ENB-0040 therapy was started in the third w of life. After 4 w, despite maximum care, the pt developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumonia and a bronchoscopy revealed tracheomalacia; changes were also seen in NIPFT. Antibiotics, bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory and mucolytic agents were utilized with good response. At 12 w on treatment, a consistent decrease in ventilator requirements (VR), improvement in lung function (Figure 2) and chest wall mechanics were observed and correlated with thoracic cage radiologic (Figure 1B) and metabolic findings. The pt was slowly weaned from VR and inspired oxygen and discharged from the hospital with a home ventilator on w 28 on room air. We were informed that the pt died in w 31 from bilateral pneumonia and septic shock. (Figure presented) Respiratory-Mechanics measurements at baseline (BL), 4 weeks (4w), 10 weeks (10w), 12 weeks (12w) and 27 weeks (27w) after ENB-0040. Solid line indicates averaged patient measurements. Dashed line indicates predicted normal values. Discussion(s): Measurable NIPFT changes in chest wall dynamics and respiratory mechanics using TAM and IOS were feasible and useful for therapeutic guidance of ENB-0040 treatment in this patient with rachitic deformities of the thoracic cage secondary to HPP. Based on preclinical results and the other limited clinical results, we speculate that ENB- 0040 may be a promising treatment for this perinatal form of HPP.","group":"g1","id":"efb2ab83-76b7-402d-a529-03b7fd004f03","_showDetails":true},"cb665dbc-ca24-48b2-82d5-ff4b282dd7c9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70842386","title":"Hyperoxia induced ROS generation and assessment of DNA damage and cell death in human bronchial epithelial cells","authors":["Panduri V."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*human","*DNA damage","*hyperoxia","*epithelium cell","*society","*cell death","exposure","electron microscopy","mitochondrion","gene","necrosis","autophagy","macromolecule","long term exposure","therapy","mitochondrial membrane potential","S phase cell cycle checkpoint","acute lung injury","confocal microscopy","lung dysplasia","imaging","assay","apoptosis","cell cycle","infant","lung disease","electron spin resonance","*DNA","superoxide","lipocortin 5","reactive oxygen metabolite","oxygen","cell nucleus DNA","cell DNA","hydrogen peroxide","lipid","caspase 3","nucleic acid","protein","adenosine triphosphate"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"V.

Prolonged exposure to high levels of oxygen >50% causes hyperoxic acute lung injury and in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, however the mechanism is still unclear. ROS generated by hyperoxia include superoxide radical and H2O2 which can damage cellular macromolecules like lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. DNA damage activates signaling pathways that can halt the cell cycle for subsequent repair or induce cells to undergo programmed cell death. The current study was designed to understand how cells respond to ROS induced DNA damage in response to hyperoxia and subsequent cell death in human bronchial epithelial cells. Method(s): Bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to 95% O2(1-48h) .ROS was measured by EPR, MitoSOXTM Red confocal imaging. A gene specific DNA damage was assessed by QPCR method. Annexin V and electron microscopy used to measure cell death. Result(s): Our results show that Beas2B cells exposed to hyperoxia for 1h released significant amounts of superoxide radical (O2 as -) measured by EPR. We measured the superoxide production in the mitochondria of the living cells with MitoSOXTM Red using confocal microscopy. Using a gene specific DNA damage assay based on quantitave PCR of large fragments, hyperoxia caused significantly increase in nuclear DNA damage by 2 hrs of exposure,(0.3/10kb).This lesion frequency increased to a maximum at 12 hrs to (1.5/10kb) and is consistent with a direct effect of reactive oxygen species attack upon DNA. Surprisingly, mitochondria suffered less DNA damage than the nucleus and showed (0.7 /10kb) at 12 hr. Exposure to hyperoxia led to S-phase arrest. Apoptotic features including Annexin V incorporation, and elevated caspase-3 activity, PARP cleavage were not readily observed in hyperoxia treated Bea2B cells in contrast to control cells. We further found that hyperoxia after 12h exposure decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSIm) that leads to decrease in ATP production which causes necrosis in bronchial epithelial cells. These trends were also repeated in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) but showing some evidence of autophagy occurrence in response to hyperoxia using electron microscopy. Conclusion(s): The results of this study support an association of nuclear DNA lesions with necrosis.","group":"g1","id":"cb665dbc-ca24-48b2-82d5-ff4b282dd7c9","_showDetails":true},"bded0198-70e2-4791-a5a1-f70c0ffafc0c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841607","title":"Thioredoxin interacting protein overexpression decreases hypoxia response element promoter activity in murine alveolar epithelial cells","authors":["Tipple T.E.","Rogers L.K.","Liu Y.","Nelin L.D.","Welty S.E."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*hypoxia","*DNA responsive element","*promoter region","*lung alveolus epithelium","*society","lung","mouse","ambient air","human","plasmid","epithelium cell","protein expression","hypothesis","lung development","lung dysplasia","Western blotting","cell culture","model","regression analysis","infant","analysis of variance","*thioredoxin interacting protein","luciferase","vasculotropin","hypoxia inducible factor","plasmid DNA","Renilla luciferin 2 monooxygenase","protein","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"T.E.

Previous data indicate that lung thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) and VEGF protein levels are inversely correlated in a newborn mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The present studies tested the hypothesis that a similar correlation exists between in utero and postnatal lung VEGF and Txnip protein expression and that Txnip overexpression decreases HRE promoter activity in mouse lung epithelial cells. METHOD(S): Lung Txnip and VEGF contents in E19 and 1 day-old mice were determined by western blot and a regression analysis was performed. MLE-12 cells were co-transfected with HRE-luciferase reporter, renilla-luciferase, and Txnip plasmid DNA and were cultured in 1% hypoxia or room air for 24 h. HRE-luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined. Data represent the results of 2-4 separate experiments and were analyzed by ANOVA. RESULT(S): VEGF contents were lower and Txnip protein levels greater in the lungs of 1 day-old newborn mice than in E19 mice and an inverse correlation between lung VEGF and Txnip protein levels was detected (n=18, R=-0.85, p<0.0001). HRE-luciferase activity was 9.7 times greater in MLE-12 cells exposed to hypoxia than in cells cultured in room air (n=22, p<0.001). In room air-exposed cells, HRE-luciferase activity was decreased by 17%, 23%, and 51% in cells transfected with 0.5, 1, and 2 mug Txnip plasmid DNA/well, respectively, compared to control-transfected cells (n=10-22, p<0.001). In hypoxia-exposed cells, HRE-luciferase activity was decreased by 9%,12%, and 35% in cells transfected with 0.5, 1, and 2 mug Txnip plasmid DNA/well, respectively, compared to similarly exposed control-transfected cells (n=16-22, p<0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Our data are consistent with Txnip-dependent regulation of VEGF production in the murine lung and Txnip-dependent regulation of HRE promoter activity in murine alveolar epithelial cells. Studies designed to elucidate the direct mechanism by which Txnip regulates HIF-dependent VEGF production are currently ongoing. Similar alterations of Txnip expression could alter lung VEGF expression in prematurely born human infants contributing to the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"bded0198-70e2-4791-a5a1-f70c0ffafc0c","_showDetails":true},"4066a5dd-3533-4f75-b802-55a39fde932a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023 to 2024>","title":"Bone Marrow Stromal Cell-Secreted Extracellular Vesicles Containing miR-34c-5p Alleviate Lung Injury and Inflammation in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Through Promotion of PTEN Degradation by Targeting OTUD3.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08820139.2023.2217854","authors":["He, Xiao","Kuang, Juan","Wang, Yijing","Lan, Guofeng","Shi, Xuekai"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230613//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Humans","Animals","Mice","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Lung Injury/th [Therapy]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","*Lung Injury","MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","MicroRNAs/me [Metabolism]","*MicroRNAs","Interleukin-13/me [Metabolism]","PTEN Phosphohydrolase/ge [Genetics]","PTEN Phosphohydrolase/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia","Interleukin-4","Interleukin-6/me [Metabolism]","Extracellular Vesicles/me [Metabolism]","*Extracellular Vesicles","Mesenchymal Stem Cells/me [Metabolism]","*Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Inflammation/me [Metabolism]","Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Immunological investigations","volume":"52","number":"6","isbn":"0882-0139","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med24&NEWS=N&AN=37310728"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the predominant chronic disorder in preterm neonates. This study explored impacts of miR-34c-5p carried by bone marrow stromal cells-secreted extracellular vesicles (BMSC-EVs) on BPD progression., METHODS: A BPD mouse model was established, followed by measurement of miR-34c-5p, OTUD3, and PTEN expression. EVs were isolated from BMSCs transfected with miR-34c-5p mimic or mimic NC and intratracheally injected into mice. CD31 and Ki67 expression was detected and the pathological changes of lung tissues and lung function indexes were observed for mice. A neonatal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC) model was developed with hyperoxia, followed by co-culture with extracted EVs and ectopic experiments for measurement of cell viability, migration, and angiogenesis. IL-4, IL-13, IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels were measured in cell supernatants and lung tissues. Dual-luciferase reporter, ubiquitination, Co-IP, and RIP assays were adopted to determine the relationship among miR-34c-5p, OTUD3, and PTEN., RESULTS: Lung tissues of BPD mice had downregulated miR-34c-5p expression and upregulated OTUD3 and PTEN expression. BMSC-EVs and BMSC-EVs-miR-34c-5p treatment improved lung injury and alveolar structure, decreased lung resistance and IL-4, IL-13, IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels, and elevated dynamic lung compliance in BPD mice, as well as enhanced proliferation, angiogenesis, and migration and restrained inflammation in HPMECs. Mechanistically, miR-34c-5p negatively targeted OTUD3 which restrained ubiquitination to promote PTEN protein stabilization. Upregulation of OTUD3 or PTEN negated the changes in the proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and inflammation of hyperoxia-treated HPMECs induced by BMSC-EVs-miR-34c-5p., CONCLUSION: BMSC-EVs-miR-34c-5p alleviated lung injury and inflammation in hyperoxia-induced BPD by blocking the OTUD3/PTEN axis.","group":"g1","id":"4066a5dd-3533-4f75-b802-55a39fde932a","_showDetails":true},"7cbfad43-a211-41b6-9796-1f5f09ee57c7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"[Yellow nail syndrome: two pediatric case reports].","journal":"Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annder.2014.06.026","authors":["Dessart, P","Deries, X","Guerin-Moreau, M","Troussier, F","Martin, L"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140820//","keywords":["Adolescent","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Child","Humans","Hydrops Fetalis/di [Diagnosis]","Infant, Premature, Diseases/di [Diagnosis]","Lymphatic Abnormalities/di [Diagnosis]","Lymphoscintigraphy","Male","*Yellow Nail Syndrome/di [Diagnosis]","Yellow Nail Syndrome/et [Etiology]"],"volume":"141","number":"10","isbn":"0151-9638","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25288066"],"address":"France","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Yellow nail syndrome (YNS) is a combination of specific nail dystrophy (yellowish or green nails, transverse ridging, increased curvature with \"a hump\" and distal onycholysis), lymphoedema and respiratory tract involvement (mainly bronchial hyper-responsiveness, recurrent pneumonia, bronchiectasis and pleural effusion), with or without sinusitis. This rare condition is most often seen in middle age. We report two pediatric cases., PATIENTS: A 9-year-old boy had 20 yellow nails and lymphedema of the lower and upper left limbs. He was born at 32 weeks of gestation. At birth, he had fetal hydrops with bilateral chylothorax. Since then, he presented bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In his first year of life, he had recurrent nasopharyngitis and serosal otitis. Lymphoscintigraphy was not performed. A 14-year-old boy had 10 yellow toenails and 2 yellow fingernails. He was born at 36 weeks of gestation with fetal hydrops. He had recurrent serosal otitis and asthma attacks. Lymphoscintigraphy showed lymphatic hypoplasia, especially of the left limbs., DISCUSSION: These two children have the classic triad of YNS, including yellow nails, lymphedema and respiratory tract involvement. Thirteen cases have been reported in children from birth to 10 years of age, three of whom were siblings, thus suggesting genetic predisposition. In most cases lymphoscintigraphy showed hypoplasia and/or ectasia of lymphatic vessels. These lymphatic abnormalities may be responsible for nail changes as seen in Turner's syndrome. The prognosis of YNS in adults may be serious because of the pulmonary tract involvement. However, it is not known in children., CONCLUSION: Yellow dystrophic nails in children may be associated with lymphedema and respiratory tract involvement, as in adults, and this condition should therefore be investigated in cases of YNS.

Supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) is also a risk factor for development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by airspace enlargement and respiratory insufficiency. How hyperoxia contributes to airspace enlargement in newborns is unknown. Alveoli form at secondary septal crests beginning at postnatal day 4 (P4) in mice. Orderly elastin deposition at these sites is essential for this process. We hypothesize that hyperoxia-induced macrophage protease expression impedes elastin deposition and impairs alveolar development. To address this hypothesis we exposed litters of C57BL/6 mouse pups (n = at least 5/group) to 95% oxygen (hyperoxia) or to room air for 11 days beginning at birth. We measured alveolar volume density and secondary septal crest density at P3, P7, P14 and P21. Hyperoxia significantly (p<0.05) decreased alveolar volume density from day 7 onward, and elastin-positive septal crest density at P14 and P21. Hyperoxia prominently induced MMP9 in airspace wall associated macrophages, and induced MMP12 expression in airspace macrophages as detected by immunohistochemistry. To address the role of MMP12 in hyperoxia-induced impaired alveolar development we exposed MMP12 deficient mice to hyperoxia or to room air for 11 days beginning at birth. We measured alveolar volume density and secondary septal crest density at P21. Both alveolar volume density and secondary septal crest density were protected at P21 in hyperoxia-exposed MMP12 deficient mouse pups compared to hyperoxia-exposed hyperoxia-exposed pups (p<0.05). These observations taken together support the hypothesis that MMP12 contributes to hyperoxia-induced airspace enlargement.","group":"g1","id":"54268d75-588f-46cf-8712-e57c9b390c20","_showDetails":true},"c103eb45-8cb7-4de2-95cc-7a1768b9c7af":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841604","title":"CD44 is required for TGFbeta signaling during hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and inhibition of alveolar development","authors":["Williams O.W.","Wang L.","Savani R.C."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*hypoxia","*pulmonary hypertension","*society","mouse","phosphorylation","lung","ambient air","gene expression","exposure","protection","lung dysplasia","lung homogenate","pulmonary artery","thickness","heart right ventricle hypertrophy","prevention","alpha smooth muscle actin","receptor","hyaluronic acid"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"O.W.

Since the hyaluronan receptor CD44 has been implicated in TGFs signaling, we examined the effects of hypoxia (12% vs. 21% O2 from birth to PN14) in neonatal CD44 (WT) and CD44 mice, as well as +/+ -/- the effects of CD44 deletion on potential TGFs signaling pathways. At PN14, hypoxia exposure of WT mice resulted in right ventricular hypertrophy, increased medial thickness of pulmonary arteries and decreased alveolarization. CD44-/- mice exposed to hypoxia were completely protected from these changes. Lung homogenates of hypoxia-exposed WT mice had a two-fold increase in active TGFs as compared to mice kept in room air. Surprisingly, CD44-/- mice kept in room air had elevated active TGFs at baseline and hypoxia exposure did not change this. In support of these results, hypoxia-exposed WT mice had a 2-fold increase in lung Smad2 phosphorylation, whereas CD44-/- mice kept in room air had elevated phospho-Smad2, with no further change after hypoxia. The lungs of hypoxia-exposed WT mice also had increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In contrast, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was impaired in the lungs of hypoxia-exposed CD44-/- mice, indicating a block in MAPK signaling. TGFs target gene expression (alpha-smooth muscle actin, alphaSMA) was increased in WT mice after hypoxia, but this increase was not seen in hypoxia-exposed CD44-/- mice. We conclude that hypoxia-stimulated changes in pulmonary hypertension and alveolarization require CD44. The defect in CD44-/- mice affording this protection from the effects of hypoxia is at the level of ERK phosphorylation. We speculate that Smad signaling is necessary but insufficient, whereas ERK1/2 signaling, which is regulated by CD44, is required for TGFs target gene expression. These data are potentially important for novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of PAH and BPD.","group":"g1","id":"c103eb45-8cb7-4de2-95cc-7a1768b9c7af","_showDetails":true},"6f459363-0899-4c2b-83c3-d89c9fb0aa36":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841598","title":"Maternal high fat diet upregulates transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta2) in the rodent lung","authors":["Hilvers P.","Piedimonte G.","Samsell L.","Walton C.","Scuri M."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*rodent","*lung","*society","*lipid diet","progeny","female","calorie","human","body weight","mother","pregnancy","body fat","maternal obesity","lactation","preeclampsia","blood","inflammation","premature labor","obesity","risk factor","stillbirth","resuscitation","lung fibrosis","mortality","asthma","adult","rat","diet","lung dysplasia","lung homogenate","cholesterol blood level","perinatal morbidity","respiratory tract disease","metabolic parameters","baby","serum","congenital disorder","upregulation","triacylglycerol blood level","lung disease","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","Apgar score","*transforming growth factor beta2","growth factor","high density lipoprotein cholesterol","protein","cytokine","glucose","virus protein V","fatty acid","high density lipoprotein"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"P.

Obesity is associated with low grade systemic inflammation as shown by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, including TGF-beta. Increased expression of TGF-beta, especially in preterm babies is considered a key factor in the development of respiratory diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we investigated whether high fat diet (HFD) during gestation and lactation affects the expression of TGF-beta in the lungs of 2 week-old rodent offspring. Upon confirmation of pregnancy, adult (12-week-old) female rats were started on a diet consisting of 60% calories from fat, while age-matched controls were fed a standard chow (16% calories from fat). Offspring (n=?) were nursed by their mothers until 14 days of age, at which time they were sacrificed and lungs were harvested. Protein concentrations of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 in lung homogenates were determined by ELISA. In addition, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and tryglycerides were measured in peripheral blood. TGF-beta2 was significantly increased in the lungs of offspring from HFD mothers compared to their age-matched controls (4.02+/-1.55 pg/mg protein vs 2.17+/-1.00 pg/mg protein respectively; n=7 for both groups; p<0.05) whereas TGF-beta1 was unaffected. Serum tryglycerides in HFD offspring were dramatically elevated compared to their age-matched controls (534.3+/-73.2 mg/100ml vs 266.2+/-48.4 mg/100ml respectively; p<0.05, n=6 and 4 respectively), while the other metabolic parameters were unchanged. Interestingly, weanlings from HFD mothers also showed lower body weight (27.8+/-0.2 grams vs 29.9+/-0.3 grams respectively; p<0.001, n=7 for both groups) but increased body fat expressed as a percentage of total body weight (0.55+/-0.04% vs 0.43+/-0.03 respectively; p<0.05, n=7 for both groups) compared to controls. In conclusion, HFD during gestation and lactation resulted in up-regulation of TGF-beta2 in the lungs of offspring. This effect was associated with a significant elevation of serum triglycerides and body fat whereas total body weight was decreased. Although still preliminary, these novel findings may indicate an association between maternal obesity, fatty acid abnormalities and increased expression of growth factors leading to the development of pulmonary disease early in life.","group":"g1","id":"6f459363-0899-4c2b-83c3-d89c9fb0aa36","_showDetails":true},"69f1dedf-ffe2-4e96-a921-323541f0caae":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841597","title":"Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) blockade modulates alveolarization in hyperoxic newborn mice","authors":["Degan S.","Subramaniam M.","Auten R.L.","Sunday M.E."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*mouse","*society","ambient air","low drug dose","drug megadose","lung","lung injury","baboon","prematurity","infant","hyperoxia","hypothesis","barotrauma","fibrosing alveolitis","model","host resistance","newborn","chronic lung disease","lung dysplasia","neurosecretory cell","histopathology","gene expression","injection","hedgehog","oxygen therapy","*gastrin releasing peptide","protein","defensin","PADGEM protein","antibody","nonoxinol 9","dectin 2","thrombospondin 1","sodium chloride","immunoglobulin G","loricrin","granzyme","thrombospondin 2","tenascin","chitinase"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.E.

Infants with BPD have increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells containing gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). We identified 2-fold higher GRP levels in preterm baboons and infants that later developed BPD. GRP blockade with antibody 2A11 abrogates lung injury and arrested alveolarization in 2 different baboon models of BPD. Conversely, newborn mice treated with exogenous GRP have diminished alveolar development. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that GRP blockade can modulate lung injury and development in mice. Newborn C57BL/6 pups were at room air or exposed to continuous 75% hyperoxia (HO) from postnatal day 1 (P1)-P18, given IP injections of 2A11 (5 or 0.2mug/kg), or MOPC21, negative control IgG (5 or 0.2mug/kg), or saline (PBS). At P18, lungs were harvested for histopathology and expression analysis using Affymetrix microarrays. Compared to pups at room air, HO-exposed pups given MOPC or PBS had higher mean linear intercepts (MLI) (P=0.001), indicating decreased septation. HO-exposed lungs given high-dose 2A11 had even larger alveoli than HO controls. However, with HO low-dose 2A11 (0.2mug/kg) improved alveolarization and reduced interstitial fibrosis. Room air pups given any dose 2A11 had more alveolar septation than control room air pups (P=0.03). Lung expression analysis (3-7 microarrays/group) compared room air vs. HO, high-dose vs. low-dose 2A11 or MOPC. High-dose 2A11+HO vs. HO+MOPC increased gene expression (FC>2, P<0.05) for host defense (IL-18, defensin-beta4), epithelial barrier function (repetin, loricrin, MUC5B), pro-inflammatory (CD68, granzyme-1, and P-selectin), but decreased tenascin-C and thrombospondin-2. Low-dose 2A11 increased expression (FC>2, P<0.05) of SP-A, PDGFR-alpha, Hedgehog-interacting protein and MMP3, and decreased expression (FC<0.5, P<0.05) of thrombospondin-1, chitinase 3-like-3, dectin-2beta, FcRgamma, TNFalpha-induced protein-2). In conclusion, low-dose 2A11+HO promotes alveolarization, with increased pro-developmental and decreased pro-inflammatory mRNAs. In contrast, high-dose 2A11+HO impairs alveolarization, with increased pro-inflammatory and few decreased developmental mRNAs. These observations suggest that some GRP is necessary for normal septation but blockade of excessive GRP in hyperoxic animals may promote alveolar formation.","group":"g3","id":"69f1dedf-ffe2-4e96-a921-323541f0caae","_showDetails":true},"f9579122-98b6-4614-8cf9-309f0ff6603b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841594","title":"Nuclear factor kappa B is an essential regulator of postnatal alveolarization by promoting angiogenesis","authors":["Alvira C.M.","Alastalo T.","Chen C.","Lyu S.C.","Cornfield D.N."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*angiogenesis","*society","in vitro study","lung development","gene","mouse","survival","endothelium cell","tube","assay","protein expression","homeostasis","prematurity","lung parenchyma","lung dysplasia","capillary tube","hypothesis","capillary density","lung capillary","chronic lung disease","cell survival","inflammation","lung","RNA interference","pathogenesis","*immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein","vasculotropin","protein","transcription factor","phosphotransferase","messenger RNA","gelatinase A","angiogenic factor","vasculotropin receptor 2","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"C.M.

However, the transcriptional regulators that determine alveolarization are unknown. While the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) plays a key role in regulating inflammation and cell survival, to this point, no role for NFkappaB has been demonstrated in lung development. We have previously shown that in vivo inhibition of NFkappaB signaling in neonatal mice results in larger and fewer alveoli, consistent with the alveolar simplification pathognomonic of BPD. This effect was associated with a reduction in pulmonary capillary density, therefore, we hypothesized that NFkappaB is an essential regulator of alveolarization by promoting angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis, neonatal mice were treated systemically with the NFkappaB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082 (BAY), or vehicle (PBS), and lung tissue was harvested at 8 and 24h for gene and protein expression analysis. Pulmonary endothelial cells (PEC) were isolated from neonatal mice using CD31 coated beads for determination of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) expression and used in assays to assess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated survival, proliferation, and in vitro tube formation. Inhibiting NFkappaB with BAY decreased VEGFR2 mRNA (p=0.005) and protein (p=0.007) expression in whole lung at 8h, and suppressed the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (p=0.006), both key angiogenic factors. Furthermore, NFkappaB blockade with BAY (2.5 and 5 muM) caused a dose dependent reduction of VEGFR2 gene (p<0.01) and protein (p<0.01) expression in PEC, impaired PEC survival at 24h (p<0.05) and blocked VEGF-mediated proliferation at 48h (p<0.001). Pretreatment of PEC with BAY (2.5 muM) for 4h prior to in vitro angiogenesis assays attenuated capillary tube and network formation at baseline, and prevented VEGF-mediated enhancement of tube formation (p<0.001). Finally, decreasing the expression of either of the principle activators of NFkappaB, inhibitory kappaB-kinase-alpha or -beta (IKK-alpha or IKK-beta) by RNA interference impaired in vitro angiogenesis (p<0.05). In summary, inhibition of NFkappaB disrupts postnatal alveolarization by decreasing genes critical for endothelial cell homeostasis. Taken together, our data demonstrate an entirely novel role for NFkappaB in promoting postnatal lung development by enhancing angiogenesis. We speculate that: (i) disruption of NFkappaB signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD; and (ii) that therapeutic strategies to enhance NFkappaB activity could enhance postnatal alveolarization.","group":"g1","id":"f9579122-98b6-4614-8cf9-309f0ff6603b","_showDetails":true},"d63ed482-2ee2-4bb4-94e9-6c94a5417c50":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841584","title":"Modulation of CC10 mrna expression in the immature lung","authors":["Hubert T.L.","Wu J.","Kimura K.","Higuchi S.","Eguchi S.","Shaffer T.H.","Wolfson M.R."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*lung","*society","*modulation","low drug dose","inflammation","human","lung parenchyma","lamb","Clara cell","respiratory distress syndrome","lung dysplasia","monitoring","therapy","airway","extracellular fluid","protection","negative feedback","antiinflammatory activity","*messenger RNA","complementary DNA","surfactant","secretory protein","beractant","protein","beta actin","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"T.L.

Progression from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been linked to acute, iatrogenic, inflammation. Recombinant human clara cell secretory protein 10 (rhCC10) administration, in conjunction with surfactant therapy (SFT), reduces inflammation in the immature ventilated lung compared to SFT alone. The effect of rhCC10 on endogenous CC10 expression in early development is unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of rhCC10 (Clarassance, Inc.) administration on endogenous CC10 expression in the preterm lamb with RDS. Design(s): 24 premature lambs (126 +/- 3 SE days) were instrumented for cardiopulmonary monitoring, delivered, paralyzed, and ventilated. Following baseline measurement, animals received SFT (Survanta, Ross Labs.; 100mg/kg) and then randomized to one of four groups (n=6/group): none; 0.5 mg/kg (low); 1.5 mg/kg (medium); or 5 mg/kg (highest) intratracheal rhCC10. After 4 hrs, the animals were deeply anesthetized, lung tissues were harvested and snap frozen. Ovine cc10 cDNA was cloned and sequenced (Genebank #FJ959385). RNA was extracted from lung tissue, and qPCR with the specific primers was used to measure cc10 expression normalized to beta-actin expression. Mean +/- SEM ; * p < 0.05 vs untreated ; degree p < 0.05 vs low dose. Result(s): No and low dose rhCC10 treatment had comparable levels of CC10 mRNA expression. CC10 mRNA expression in non-treated and low dose groups were greater (p < 0.05) than higher dose treated groups. There was no significant difference between the medium and highest dosed groups. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate a dose dependent effect of rhCC10 administration on CC10 mRNA expression during early development. While the mechanism of how rhCC10 lowers CC10 mRNA expression is unknown, we speculate that the higher doses of rhCC10 cause negative feedback either directly or indirectly by lowering inflammation. Further study is needed to determine optimal rhCC10 dosing, with respect to lung protection and endogenous CC10 production, and to quantify the effect of the SFT alone on CC10 mRNA expression during early development.","group":"g1","id":"d63ed482-2ee2-4bb4-94e9-6c94a5417c50","_showDetails":true},"a3dcd814-95b1-4101-9df7-9315a9ca8e2e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841583","title":"Tracheal aspirate wnt-related proteins lef-1 and beta-catenin, novel biomarkers of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Rehan V.K.","Sakurai R.","Dhar V.","Torday J.S."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*society","*tracheal aspiration procedure","infant","Western blotting","cell transdifferentiation","extubation","down regulation","very low birth weight","pathogenesis","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","artificial ventilation","myofibroblast","Wnt signaling pathway","upregulation","respiratory distress syndrome","protein content","fibroblast","interpersonal communication","*protein","*catenin","marker","lymphoid enhancer factor 1","parathyroid hormone","Wnt protein","receptor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"V.K.

This AIF-to-MYF transdifferentiation is characterized by down-regulation of the Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein/Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PTHrP/PPARgamma) signaling pathway and up-regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. We have previously reported decreased tracheal aspirate (TA) PTHrP levels in ventilated Very-Low-Birth-Weight Infants (VLBWIs) during the first week of life who later go on to develop BPD. However, there is no information on the levels of Wnt-related proteins in the TA of these infants. We hypothesized that Wnt protein content in the TA of ventilated VLBWI would correlate with the development of BPD. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty VLBWIs (BW 943 +/- 302 grams (mean +/- SD); GA 27 +/- 2 weeks; 10M:10F) ventilated for Respiratory Distress Syndrome were studied. The TAs were collected once daily during the first 3 days of life, or until extubation, whichever was earlier, and immediately frozen for subsequent analysis by ELISA and Western blot analysis for LEF-1 and beta-catenin, two key markers of Wnt activation. Levels of LEF-1 and beta-catenin were correlated with the probability of extubation at 1 wk of age, and with the later development of BPD, as defined by 02 requirement at 36 wk GA. Result(s): LEF-1 and beta-catenin levels, as determined by both ELISA and Western blot analysis, were significantly higher in infants who continued to be ventilated at 1 wk of age, and who later went on to develop BPD, compared to infants who were extubated by 1 wk of age and did not develop BPD. Conclusion(s): During the first 3 days of life, the TA levels of LEF-1 and beta-catenin, two key markers of Wnt activation, correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation needed and the later development of BPD in VLBWI infants. We conclude that in combination with the lower TA PTHrP content, higher Wnt-related proteins can be developed into sensitive and specific biomarkers to predict, diagnose, and monitor BPD in ventilated VLBWIs.","group":"g1","id":"a3dcd814-95b1-4101-9df7-9315a9ca8e2e","_showDetails":true},"8c9cc72c-0027-4330-874c-177ae53e39d9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841582","title":"Identification of candidate susceptibility genes for a murine model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Nichols J.","Gladwell W.","Cho H.","Wiltshire T.","Kleeberger S.R."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*model","*lung dysplasia","*society","*gene","phenotype","newborn","lung injury","haplotype","mouse","hyperoxia","exposure","inbred strain","mare","blood vessel injury","computer model","genetic model","heritability","assisted ventilation","prematurity","lung","injury","cell count","lung disease","liquid","genetics","neutrophil","epithelium cell","lavage","food","infant","quantitative trait locus","adult","lung development","pathogenesis","oxygen","oxidizing agent","protein","reactive oxygen metabolite"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"J.

In BPD, treatment often involves respiratory support with high oxygen levels and generation of ROS is an adverse consequence that has been associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Polymorphisms in a few candidate genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood. Understanding the role of genetics is critical to improving treatment strategies and reducing oxidant injury in developing lungs. Herein, we report a genetic model of hyperoxic lung injury including 30 neonate inbred strains of mice. The objective was to utilize haplotype association mapping of quantitative phenotypes to identify genes important to susceptibility of neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): Time-mated pregnant inbred mice were allowed to deliver spontaneously. During exposures, CFW dams we used for cross-fostering every 24hr. At postnatal day 1 (P1), neonates were pooled and reassigned to litters exposed to 100% O2 or air for 72hr. Dams were provided with food ad libitum. Following exposure, neonates were necropsied at P4 and bronchealveolar lavage fluid analysis (protein concentration, total cell counts, neutrophils, and epithelial cells) and histophathology were measured as disease phenotypes. All exposures were carried out at the NIEHS and approved by IACUC. Haplotype mapping of response phenotypes was done using SNPster. Result(s): The neonate inbred strains demonstrate lung injury following hyperoxia exposure. Significant inter-strain variation in hyperoxia response phenotypes was found, with broad-sense heritability estimates ranging from 47.2 to 58.6%. The most resistant strains to hyperoxic lung injury include 129S1/SvImJ and BALB/cByJ while C3H/HeJ and PWD/Ph mice are among the most susceptible. Haplotype association mapping studies identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs)with genes of interest for the disease phenotypes. Conclusion(s): Significant inter-strain variation in hyperoxia-induced disease phenotypes is consistent with a strong genetic contribution to disease. Interestingly, hyperoxia responses in neonate mice do not predict responses in adults of the same strain. Furthermore, through in silico haplotype mapping we have identified novel QTLs and candidate genes underlying susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury in this model of BPD that will provide important mechanistic insight.","group":"g3","id":"8c9cc72c-0027-4330-874c-177ae53e39d9","_showDetails":true},"0bd5d509-14ab-4947-8650-a8ca24ec4d77":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70841362","title":"Single nucleotide polymorphisms of superoxide dismutase in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Calo J.M.","Maramreddy H.","Fisher J.","Chhabra D.","Dwarakanath K.","Strassberg S.","Ali N.","Parton L.A."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*single nucleotide polymorphism","*pathogenesis","*lung dysplasia","*society","sepsis","parental consent","real time polymerase chain reaction","lung alveolus epithelium","aerobic metabolism","Student t test","genetics","hypothesis","infant","chi square test","statistical significance","gestational age","birth weight","exposure","extremely low birth weight","*superoxide dismutase","enzyme","superoxide","antioxidant","steroid","DNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"J.M.

Up-regulation of the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFbeta) superfamily signaling pathway has been associated with the development of BPD in multiple animal models and premature infants. Although it is known that TGFbeta signaling is mediated via three ligands, TGFbeta-1, 2, and 3, that serve overlapping yet specific functions in normal lung development, there is a lack of data describing how these ligands are affected by neonatal exposure to hyperoxia. We hypothesized that exposure to chronic hyperoxia would have differential effects on the expression of these ligands in the neonatal mouse lung. Method(s): Within 12hr of birth, C57/B6 wild-type mice were subjected to 21 consecutive days of continuous exposure to 85% oxygen (O2) or room-air (RA) as controls. At 21 days, lungs were either inflation-fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde at 30cm of H20 (for histological examination of distal airspace size and TGFbeta-isoform mRNA in-situ hybridization) or frozen and homogenized for protein electrophoresis (to quantify TGFbeta signaling via relative phospho-Smad 2/3 expression and BMP signaling via relative phospho-Smad 1/5/8 expression). Result(s): Exposure to 21 days of chronic hyperoxia resulted in an arrest of alveolar development with enlarged, simplified distal airspaces. TGFbeta-2 mRNA expression was increased in 85% oxygen-exposed mice compared to RA controls, with a punctuate pattern noted within the alveolar epithelium. TGFbeta-1 mRNA appeared to be equivalent between the two groups, and TGFbeta-3 mRNA was not present in either group. Whole lung homogenates revealed potentiation of TGFbeta signaling levels as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Smad2/3 protein (O2:RA increased 41%, p<0.001) and attenuation of BMP signaling levels as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 protein (O2:RA decreased 43%, p<0.05). Significantly, Periostin protein, a known down-stream effector of phospho-Smad 2/3 signaling, was increased in 85% oxygen-exposed mice compared to RA control lungs. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia-induced arrested alveolar development is associated with long-lasting enhancement of TGFbeta signaling and a gradual loss of BMP signaling. Further, the potentiation of TGFbeta signaling is mediated via increased TGFbeta-2 ligand expression. Future studies to delineate the spatio-temporal expression of TGFbeta-2 mRNA as well as the cell-specific targets of TGFbeta-signaling are needed, as this will be paramount to understanding the possible role of TGFbeta in the development of neonatal lung diseases.

Randomized controlled trials indicate VA supplementation decreases BPD and/or death. Vitamin A is metabolized into retinoic acid (RA), and we have previously demonstrated that a 10:1 molar combination of VA and RA (VARA) synergistically increases lung retinol content in newborn mice. Objective(s): To determine whether the biochemical synergistic effect of VARA translates into functional benefits in attenuating abnormal lung development and lung function in newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia. Method(s): Newborn C57BL/6 mice were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) or room air for 7 or 14 days and given vehicle or VARA every other day. Lung retinol content was measured by HPLC, lung function was assessed by flexiVent, and lung development was evaluated by radial alveolar counts and secondary septal crest density. Additionally, cytokines known to be involved in hyperoxic lung injury were evaluated by a qPCR array and by ELISA in lung homogenates. Result(s): VARA attenuated the hyperoxia-induced inhibition of alveolarization and improved lung function, with higher compliance and lower resistance (Figure), associated with increased lung retinyl ester stores. qPCR array analysis indicated hyperoxia increased mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein -2 (MIP-2alpha; Cxcl2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). VARA completely abrogated these changes in mRNA expression. VARA attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increases in MIP-2alpha and IFN-gamma protein, but did not change IL-1beta, MMP-9, and TNF-alpha protein amounts. Conclusion(s): The VARA combination improves lung development and function, and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in the newborn mouse model of hyperoxia exposure. Further studies are in progress to determine if reductions in MIP-2alpha and IFN-gamma mediate the beneficial effects of retinoids during hyperoxia exposure.

Ureaplasma are the most frequently isolated bacteria from the amniotic fluid (AF), placentas and cord blood of preterm infants. It is known that the developing fetus aspirates amniotic fluid, but it is not clear what effect exposure to AF contaminated with Ureaplasma has on the structural development of the lung, besides low grade lung inflammation and lung maturation after long term Ureaplasma exposure. Therefore, we hypothesized that Ureaplasma elicited an inflammatory response in the fetal lung shortly after Ureaplasma exposure, which may affect lung development. Method(s): Ovine singleton fetuses received an intra-amniotic injection of Ureaplasma parvum serovar 3, the most commonly isolated subspecies of Ureaplasma bacteria in preterm infants, or control media at 110, 117, or 121 days of gestation (GA), and were delivered by caesarian section at 124 days GA (term=150 days GA). Inflammation was assessed by cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and cord blood, total protein and IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels, immunohistochemistry and FACS for inflammatory cells, and elastin deposition for future alveolar growth in lung tissue. Result(s): There was a 3-fold increase in inflammatory cells in the lungs of fetuses that had been exposed to Ureaplasma. Neutrophils and monocytes were increased in the BAL after 3 and 7 days of exposure (p=0.02 and p=0.02 respectively). In lung tissue significant increases in myeloperoxidase positive cells after 3 days (p=0.03) and MHCII positive cells after 14 days of exposure (p=0.001) were observed. Interestingly, there was no increase in PU.1 (macrophage specific marker) or CD3 (T-lymphocyte marker) positive cells. In the posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, which drain the lung, CD3 positive cells increased in all Ureaplasma exposed animals (UP 3d p=0.02; UP 7d p=0.01; UP 14d p=0.03). With regard to lung structure, concentrated elastin depositions decreased on alveolar septae after 14 days of Ureaplasma exposure (p=0.001) in combination with a more diffuse, dysmorphic elastin expression throughout the alveoli. Conclusion(s): These results support the hypothesis that UP induced an acute inflammatory response in the fetal lung, being one of the sites of first contact with the contaminated amniotic fluid. Our findings show that a short term exposure to UP was sufficient to induce structural changes in elastin deposition, which may affect further alveolarization of the lung.","group":"g1","id":"382f7084-bd20-4d30-8255-2d53b854fb82","_showDetails":true},"566eaeda-bf42-4797-84a2-14823479728b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70839745","title":"Isolation of mesenchymal stem cells from tracheal aspirates of premature infants with respiratory distress is associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Popova A.P.","Bozyk P.D.","Linn M.J.","Goldsmith A.M.","Schumacher R.","Bentley J.K.","Filbrun A.","Hershenson M.B."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*mesenchymal stem cell","*tracheal aspiration procedure","*prematurity","*respiratory distress","*risk","*lung dysplasia","*society","infant","birth weight","gestational age","artificial ventilation","myofibroblast","risk factor","human","pathogenesis","monocyte","chronic lung disease","patient","oxygen therapy","lung","gender","adherent cell","culture medium","aspiration","ex vivo study","scatter factor","vasculotropin","smooth muscle actin","transforming growth factor"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"M.B.

Under the influence of transforming growth factor-beta, MSCs differentiate into alpha-smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are increased in the lungs of patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurely-born infants. Objective(s): We tested whether isolation of MSCs from tracheal aspirates of premature infants with respiratory distress during the first week of life would correlate with development of BPD. Method(s): Eighty-four infants born at gestational age less than 32 weeks requiring mechanical ventilation were studied. Aspirates were collected during routine suctioning and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in cell culture medium and plated. Adherent cells were grown to confluence. Cells of passage three were used for further analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Tracheal aspirates were obtained from 84 infants. MSCs were isolated from the tracheal aspirates of 56 infants; 28 infants showed no MSCs. There was no statistical difference in gestational age or birth weight between the 'MSC' and 'no MSC' groups. In the MSC group, 11 died and 25 developed BPD, as defined by a requirement for supplemental O2 at 36 wks post-conceptual age. In the 'no MSC' group, 6 infants died and 1 developed BPD. Accounting for the potential influences of gender, birth weight and gestational age, isolation of MSCs increased the adjusted relative risk of BPD over 31-fold (P=0.004). Birth weight was also a predictor of BPD (adjusted relative risk, 0.995, P=0.031). The MSC group showed significantly greater days of mechanical ventilation (MSC, 32+/-12; no MSC, 8+/-2; mean+/-SD, P<0.001) and supplemental O2 administration (MSC, 106+/-19; no MSC, 31+/-8; P<0.001). Finally, cultured MSCs produced significant levels (>5 ng/ml conditioned medium/day) of vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and monocyte chemotactic protein/CCL2 ex vivo. Conclusion(s): Isolation of tracheal aspirate MSCs predicts the development of BPD, suggesting that MSCs play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.","group":"g1","id":"566eaeda-bf42-4797-84a2-14823479728b","_showDetails":true},"4c37b7cb-4a6c-4c9e-a759-9ef7c68240f4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70839325","title":"Genome-wide expression analysis of human bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Bhattacharya S.","Gascon J.L.","Huyck H.L.","Srisuma S.","Metlay L.A.","Solleti S.","Mariani T.J.","Pryhuber G.S."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*human","*lung dysplasia","*society","*genome","female","prematurity","lung","gene","health care cost","sepsis","risk","gestational age","tissue structure","baby","tissues","autopsy","risk factor","gene expression","death","cluster analysis","patient","pregnancy","laboratory","RNA"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","language":"English","volume":"181","number":"1 MeetingAbstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","isbn":"1073-449X","address":"S.

More than 55,000 babies with increased risk of developing BPD are born each year, and an estimated annual health care cost of $26 billion. Due to the complexity of risk factors and limited availability of clinical samples, an understanding of this disease, its potential biomarkers and causal mechanisms are limited. Over the past decade, under an IRB-approved protocol, this laboratory has established a unique biorepository of autopsy tissue samples from human premature babies diagnosed with BPD and non-BPD controls. These lung samples are harvested within 6 hours, following a standardized protocol to retain tissue structure and molecular integrity. Data from this sample collection have been previously published. In order to discover novel BPD biomarkers, 28 of these samples were selected for genome-wide expression profiling, including 11 BPD and 9 control cases, matched for gestational age at birth and at death, as well as 4 cases with culture-positive, acute overwhelming sepsis. Each total lung RNA was demonstrated to meet quality standards and was then subjected to the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array. Normalized and background corrected data was extracted and non-informative probe sets were excluded. Cluster analysis of samples identified subgroups of patients, consistent with known clinical complications of prematurity. Preliminary analysis using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) identified novel genes with differential expression between BPD cases and non-BPD controls. Global validation of array-based expression data, demonstrated a significant correlation (p<0.05) with qPCR-based expression data for 16 of 20 genes analyzed. Also, consistent with previous reports, we were able to demonstrate a significant increase in IGF1 expression in BPD samples by qPCR. Additional ongoing analyses are aimed at identifying and validating novel disease biomarkers. These data will significantly expand our knowledge of gene expression patterns in BPD lungs, and may be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","group":"g2","id":"4c37b7cb-4a6c-4c9e-a759-9ef7c68240f4","_showDetails":true},"0cdea403-1c8f-4d09-b2fa-fd9de0ab1329":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70668202","title":"Inflammation through NFkappaB inhibits Sp1-mediated FGF-10 expression in developing lung","authors":["Carver B.","Plosa E.","Van Der Meer R.","Liu J.","Han W.","Blackwell T.","Prince L.S."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*lung","*society","*cytology","*inflammation","promoter region","CHO cell","fetus lung","plasmid","binding site","airway","patient","human","mutant","mesenchyme cell","DNA binding","consensus","mesenchyme","lung dysplasia","lung development","prematurity","morphogenesis","mouse","*fibroblast growth factor 10","carisoprodol","luciferase","DNA","interleukin 1","transcription factor Sp3","lipopolysaccharide","growth factor"],"journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","language":"English","volume":"21","number":"24\nSP  -","publisher":"American Society for Cell Biology","isbn":"1059-1524","address":"B.

Inflammation and NF-kB activation in the fetal lung inhibits airway morphogenesis and contributes to BPD. The mesenchymal growth factor FGF-10 is crucial for normal airway branching and is decreased in lungs of patients with BPD. We therefore hypothesized that NF-kB activation disrupts normal FGF-10 expression. We measured FGF-10 promoter activity using an FGF-10-luciferase reporter plasmid expressed in CHO cells. Plasmids expressing Sp1, Sp3, the NF-kappaB subunit RelA, and a constitutively active IKKbeta mutant (cIKKbeta) were co-transfected to measure effects on FGF-10 promoter activity. ChIP was performed on primary fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells. Sp1, and RelA were co-immunoprecipitated from CHO cells. Transfecting CHO cells with cIKKbeta inhibited FGF-10 promoter activity. The effects of NF-kappaB on the FGF-10 promoter did not appear to involve direct RelA:DNA binding, as deletion of a predicted NF-kappaB binding site in the FGF-10 promoter did not affect the ability of NF-kappaB to suppress FGF-10 expression. These data suggest that NF-kappaB may indirectly interfere with FGF-10 transcription. The FGF-10 promoter contains multiple consensus Sp1-binding sites, and overexpression of Sp1 strongly stimulated FGF-10 promoter activity. NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta treatment or cIKKbeta co-expression inhibited Sp1-mediated FGF-10 expression. Co-expression with the related transcription factor Sp3 also inhibited Sp1-mediated FGF-10 expression. Expression of Sp3 alone did not affect FGF-10 promoter activity. ChIP experiments showed that Sp1 constitutively occupies the FGF-10 promoter, while lipopolysaccharide treatment recruited RelA and Sp3 to the FGF-10 promoter. RelA co-immunoprecipitates with Sp1, suggesting a potential Sp1-RelA interaction. These data suggest that inflammatory signaling through NF-kappaB inhibits FGF-10 expression by disrupting normal Sp1-mediated FGF-10 promoter activity. NF-kappaB activation may therefore use a novel mechanism to disrupt a normal developmental expression program in the fetal lung mesenchyme.","group":"g1","id":"0cdea403-1c8f-4d09-b2fa-fd9de0ab1329","_showDetails":true},"a9fc75df-e474-471f-bfc3-b366e57401b4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70666201","title":"Effect of hyperoxia on lung epithelial cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition","authors":["Nguyen M.","Shapiro J.B.","King J.M."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*hyperoxia","*epithelial mesenchymal transition","*epithelium cell","*cell growth","*lung","*cytology","*society","lung injury","tight junction","wound healing","exposure","mouse","lung dysplasia","pathogenesis","extracellular matrix","turnover time","apoptosis","cell junction","model","cell motility","upregulation","prematurity","artificial ventilation","gelatinase B","ilomastat","proteinase","caspase 3","oxygen"],"journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","language":"English","volume":"21","number":"24\nSP  -","publisher":"American Society for Cell Biology","isbn":"1059-1524","address":"M.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a proteinase that plays an important role in ECM destruction and remodeling, is increased in lung injury following hyperoxia exposure in neonatal mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hyperoxia on proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and cell-cell junctions in a mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) model. We determined that in MLE-12 cells continuously exposed to hyperoxia, there was a decrease in proliferation and motility, and weakened tight junctions. In an effort to understand functional contributions to epithelial wound repair altered by hyperoxia, we showed that acute exposure to hyperoxia increases activity of MMP-9. Furthermore, inhibition of MMP-9 with GM6001 in hyperoxia-treated cells improved cell motility and strengthened tight junctions. We propose that the upregulation of MMP-9 by lung epithelial cells contributes to hyperoxic lung injury by restricting proper wound repair. However, inhibition of MMP-9 in hyperoxia-treated cells also significantly increased caspase-3 activity. This finding suggests that blocking MMP-9 activity using GM6001 may not be a valuable therapeutic approach in preventing BPD.","group":"g1","id":"a9fc75df-e474-471f-bfc3-b366e57401b4","_showDetails":true},"fbc68368-f407-4765-afd3-4905ef69fdf0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70543600","title":"Elevated Wnt-related tracheal aspirate proteins LEF-1 and -betacatenin predicts the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very-low-birth-weight infants","authors":["Rehan V.K.","Sakurai R.","Dhar V.","Torday J."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*tracheal aspiration procedure","*very low birth weight","human","infant","Western blotting","enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","fibroblast","myofibroblast","cell transdifferentiation","down regulation","upregulation","pathogenesis","birth weight","extubation","model","*catenin","*lymphoid enhancer factor 1","*protein","parathyroid hormone related protein","marker"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","language":"English","volume":"24","number":"Meeting Abstracts\nSP  -","publisher":"FASEB","isbn":"0892-6638","address":"V.K.

Though decreased tracheal aspirate (TA) PTHrP levels in ventilated Very-Low-Birth-Weight Infants (VLBWIs) during the first wk of life predict the later development of BPD, there is no information on the levels of Wnt-related proteins in the TA of these infants. Twenty ventilated VLBWIs (birth weight 943 +/- 302 g (mean +/- SD); GA 27 +/- 2weeks; 10M:10F) were studied. The TAs were collected once daily during the first 3 days of life, or until extubation, whichever was earlier, and immediately frozen for subsequent analysis by ELISA and Western blot for LEF-1 and beta-catenin, two key markers of Wnt activation. LEF-1 and beta-catenin levels, as determined by both ELISA and Western blotting, were significantly higher in infants who continued to be ventilated at 1 wk of age, and who later went on to develop BPD, compared to infants who were extubated by 1 wk of age and did not develop BPD.

Since the hyaluronan receptor CD44 regulates TGFbeta signaling, we examined the effects of hypoxia (12% vs. 21% O2) from birth to postnatal day (PN) 14 in neonatal CD44+/+ (WT) and CD44-/- mice. At PN14, hypoxia-exposed WT mice had right ventricular hypertrophy and decreased alveolarization. CD44-/- mice exposed to hypoxia were completely protected from these changes. Hypoxia-exposed WT lungs had increased active TGFbeta and phospho-Smad2 as compared to room air (RA) controls. Surprisingly, lungs from RA CD44-/- mice had elevated active TGFbeta and phospho-Smad2 at baseline and these were not altered by hypoxia. Compared to lungs from hypoxia WT mice, lungs from hypoxia CD44-/- mice had impaired ERK1/2 phosphorylation. After hypoxia, the TGFbeta target gene alpha-smooth muscle actin, was increased in WT, but not CD44-/- mice. We conclude that hypoxia-induced PH and decreased alveolarization require CD44 and ERK phosphorylation, and that Smad2 phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for TGFbeta signaling in this context. We speculate that CD44 may be a novel therapeutic target for PH and BPD.","group":"g1","id":"c11604d5-bb2b-46cd-8411-e177c8158bcc","_showDetails":true},"de57f2dd-79b9-4abd-8a26-4b04f7d1af63":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70179169","title":"Peculiarities of bronchial asthma treatment in pediatric patients with remote sequelae of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Besh L.","Matsyura O.","Akdis C.","Bohle B.","Bonadonna P.","Bonini S.","Calderon M.","Cecchi L.","Corrigan C.","Custovic A.","del Giacco S.","Durham S.","Eigenmann P.","Eng P.","Frew A.","Gevaert P.","Grattan C.","Hellings P.","Hoffmann-Sommergruber K.","Kalayci O.","Knol E.","Mari A.","Moreira A.","Moscato G.","Ollert M.","Pagani M.","Passalacqua G.","Powell R.","Raulf-Heimsoth M.","Roberts G.","Rueff F.","Scadding G.","Scharf C.","Schmid-Grendelmeier P.","Schwarze J.","Smith H.","Virchow J.C.","Wardlaw A.","Werfel T."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*asthma","*patient","*lung dysplasia","*clinical immunology","*allergy","newborn period","child","therapy","pediatrics","artificial ventilation","thorax radiography","radiodiagnosis","control group","drug megadose","inhalation","antibiotic therapy","lung","respiratory system","medical technology","intensive care","survival","body weight","dysplasia","prematurity","anamnesis","physical examination","serum","follow up","glucocorticoid","chlordiazepoxide","immunoglobulin A","immunoglobulin M","immunoglobulin G","immunoglobulin E","bronchodilating agent"],"journal":"Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","language":"English","volume":"65","number":"SUPPL. 92","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","isbn":"0105-4538","address":"L.

There has been noticed higher incidence of complications resulting from a long-term assisted mechanical ventilation (MV) in the neonatal period. One of the most severe complications is broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Thus, delivery of adequate bronchial asthma (BA) treatment and organization of appropriate follow-up for pediatric patients with remote sequelae of BPD are urgent problems of contemporary medicine. The purpose of the work was to analyze the efficacy of BA treatment in children with remote sequelae of BPD. Study group: 64 children with bronchial asthma, aged 6 months to 9 years, who were provided MV in the neonatal period. Investigation was conducted in two groups of patients, consisting of 32 individuals each. Group I (study) included children with BPD development vs group II (control) that included ones without BPD. Selection was case-contol. Duration of BA treatment lasted 6 months, medical supervision - for 3 years. Method(s): Assessment of the patients included the following data: history-taking; family anamneses; full physical examination; routine clinical methods; immunological investigation (serum IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE); modified test with bronchial spasmolytic; chest X-ray examination. Efficacy of therapy was estimated before the treatment and on the 6th, 12th and 24th weeks of therapy. Result(s): During the treatment period incidence of BA exacerbations was higher in study group vs in control group. Patients of group I required administration of repeated courses of high doses of systemic and inhalation glucocorticoid drugs, antibiotic therapy and administration of cholinolithics. Control of the disease was achieved in 46.9% (15) group I and 65.6% (21) group II. Conclusion(s): (1) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not only neonatal but a general pediatric problem. (2) Causative-consequential relationship has been proved to exist between mechanical ventilation of lungs in the neonatal period and succeeding development of hyperreactivity of the respiratory tracts often clinically manifested by bronchial asthma. (3) Therapeutic protocol of bronchial asthma treatment in patients with and remote sequelae of bronchopulmonary dysplasia can be recommended for wide application in the clinical pediatric practice.","group":"g1","id":"de57f2dd-79b9-4abd-8a26-4b04f7d1af63","_showDetails":true},"6e829b86-cac0-403c-a758-692a9fbdb224":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70159906","title":"Association between HLA and susceptibility to bronchopulmonary dysplasia","authors":["Rocha G.","Proenca E.","Areias A.","Freitas F.","Lima B.A.","Alves H.","Guimaraes H."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*immunogenetics","*transplantation","*histocompatibility","*society","*lung dysplasia","gestational age","birth weight","allele","newborn","gene frequency","child","haplotype","gene","inflammation","HLA typing","lung injury","vascularization","lung","clinical study","Student t test","logistic regression analysis","risk factor","confidence interval","chronic lung disease","oxygen"],"journal":"Tissue Antigens","language":"English","volume":"75","number":"5","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","isbn":"0001-2815","address":"G.

BPD is the final result of a pulmonary inflammatory process and lung repair with impaired alveolarization and vascularization in response to a multi-factorial lung injury. To assess whether HLA alleles play a role in BPD susceptibility, we studied 156 preterm neonates (82 M/ 74 F) 'U 30 weeks gestational age and/ or 'U 1250 g birth weight, alive at 36 weeks gestational age. Detailed perinatal and clinical data were collected. HLA typing was performed by PCR-SSO. HLA allele frequencies where determined by direct counting for BPD (oxygen dependency at 36 weeks) and non- BPD groups. Comparison between BPD and no BDP groups was performed using t-test, IO2 test or Fisher's exact test and logistic regression as appropriate. Relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were also calculated as association measures. We diagnosed 27 (17%) children with BPD and 129 (83%) without BPD. Mean birth weight and gestational age were statistically different between BPD and no BPD groups (890.2g vs. 1077.6g; p < 0.01) and (26.8 wks vs. 28.6 wks; p < 0.01), respectively. We found increased frequencies in BPD group for the alleles: HLA-A*68 (RR = 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-4.6, P = 0.04), B*51 (RR = 1.9, 95%CI 1.1-3.3, P = 0.05), Cw*14 (RR = 2.8, 95%CI 1.4-5.6, P = 0.03), Cw*15 (RR = 2.8, 95%CI 1.5-5.1), DRB1*01(RR = 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-4.2). When we adjusted the allele frequencies for birth weight and gestational age, HLAA* 68, B*51 and Cw*14 remained statistically significant. Considering 2 loci haplotypes, B*51 -Cw*15 has a higher frequency in the BPD group (11.1% vs. 2.7% in non-BPD, RR = 2.88, 95%CI 1.5-5.5, P = 0.004). Our findings suggest an association between some HLA alleles or genes inside the MHC region and BPD susceptibility.","group":"g2","id":"6e829b86-cac0-403c-a758-692a9fbdb224","_showDetails":true},"fb12fed1-70fb-4922-921e-d5179dfbeb09":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"The role of nutrition in promoting growth in pre-term infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a prospective non-randomised interventional cohort study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-14-235","authors":["Gianni, Maria Lorella","Roggero, Paola","Colnaghi, Maria Rosa","Piemontese, Pasqua","Amato, Orsola","Orsi, Anna","Morlacchi, Laura","Mosca, Fabio"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140922//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dh [Diet Therapy]","*Energy Intake","*Enteral Nutrition/mt [Methods]","Female","*Food, Fortified","Humans","*Infant Formula","Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/gd [Growth & Development]","Linear Models","Male","*Milk, Human","Prospective Studies","Treatment Outcome","Weight Gain"],"journal":"BMC pediatrics","volume":"14","isbn":"1471-2431","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25241811"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pre-term infants who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at risk of postnatal growth failure. It has been reported that energy expenditure is higher in infants with BPD than in those without BPD. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether increasing the enteral energy intake of pre-term infants with BPD can improve post-natal growth., METHODS: This prospective, non-randomised interventional cohort study was designed to assess growth in 57 preterm infants with BPD (gestational age <32 weeks, birth weight <1500 g, and persistent oxygen dependency for up to 28 days of life) fed individually tailored fortified breast milk and/or preterm formula, and a historical control group of 73 pre-term infants with BPD fed breast milk fortified in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer and/or pre-term formula. Between-group differences in the continuous variables were analysed using Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney test; the discrete variables were compared using the chi-squared test. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the independent contribution of enteral energy intake to weight gain velocity., RESULTS: The duration of parenteral nutrition was similar in the historical and intervention groups (43.7 +/- 30.9 vs 39.6 +/- 17.4 days). After the withdrawal of parenteral nutrition, enteral energy intake was higher in the infants in the intervention group with mild or moderate BPD (131 +/- 6.3 vs 111 +/- 4.6 kcal/kg/day; p < 0.0001) and in those with severe BPD (126 +/- 5.3 vs 105 +/- 5.1 kcal/kg/day; p < 0.0001), whereas enteral protein intake was similar (3.2 +/- 0.27 vs 3.1 +/- 0.23 g/kg/day). Weight gain velocity was greater in the infants in the intervention group with mild or moderate BPD (14.7 +/- 1.38 vs 11.5 +/- 2 g/kg/day, p < 0.0001) and in those with severe BPD (11.9 +/- 2.9 vs 8.9 +/- 2.3 g/kg/day; p < 0.007). The percentage of infants with post-natal growth retardation at 36 weeks of gestational age was higher in the historical group (75.3 vs 47.4; p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the above findings, it seems that improved nutritional management promotes post-natal ponderal growth in pre-term infants with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"fb12fed1-70fb-4922-921e-d5179dfbeb09","_showDetails":true},"6f7aa400-f480-4405-8938-68803aba7746":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70127180","title":"Postnatal growth as a predictor of retinopathy of prematurity: A multivariate model","authors":["Nieto R.","Benitez A.","Dinerstein A.","Perez G.","Solana C."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*postnatal growth","*society","*retrolental fibroplasia","*model","patient","infant","lung dysplasia","multivariate analysis","prevalence","screening","cohort analysis","gestational age","birth weight","statistical analysis","sepsis","artificial ventilation","growth disorder","protein","oxygen"],"journal":"Pediatric Research","language":"English","volume":"67","number":"4","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","isbn":"0031-3998","address":"R.

Chorioamnionitis increases the risk and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns. It is not known whether the timing of exposure to inflammation in utero is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that chronic inflammation would augment the airway and vascular disruption that occur after exposure to infection at 55 days of gestation. Method(s): Pregnant ewes were given intra-amniotic injection of U.parvum serovar 3 or 6 at low (2 x 104 cfu) or high doses (2 x 107 cfu), or media (controls). Fetuses were delivered at 125 days (term = 150 days). Result(s): U.parvum was grown from the lungs of all exposed fetuses, and neutrophils and monocytes were increased in the airspaces. Lung mRNA expression of IL-1beta and IL-8, but not IL-6 were modestly increased in U.parvum exposed fetuses. U.parvum exposure increased surfactant and improved lung gas volumes indicating lung maturation. The changes in lung inflammation and maturation were independent of serovar or dose. Exposure to U.parvum did not change multiple indices of airspace or vascular development. Parenchymal elastin and collagen content were similar between groups. Expression of several endothelial proteins, and pulmonary resistance arteriolar media thickness were also not different between groups. Conclusion(s): We conclude that chronic exposure to U.parvum does not cause sustained effects on airspace or vascular development in premature lambs.

The SERT promoter has a length polymorphic region (SERT-LPR) with a long (L) and a short (S) allele. The S allele is said to lower the transcription rate of SERT, thus reducing gene activity, while the L allele provides high SERT gene activity. We hypothesize that 1) SERT function is unique to intact pulmonary endothelial cells (EC); 2) SERT plays a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling, ensuring proper adaptation to extrauterine life 3) SERT expression is defective in ACD/MPV lungs resulting in maladaptative vascular changes leading to lethal pulmonary hypertension. 4) Defective SERT expression is due to SERT promoter length polymorphism. Design(s): We studied 1) SERT EC specificity/sensitivity in tissue arrays of 4 autopsy lungs (4 days and 1, 5, and 11 years of age); 2) tcmporo-spatial expression of SERT in normal antenatal (all trimesters, n=17) and postnatal lungs (1 &10 years); 3) SERT expression in ACD/MPV lungs (n=12) and in lungs of patients with pulmonary hypertension of varied etiology (n=14) by immunohistochemistry. 4) SERT-LPR of ACD/MPV patients was assessed by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Result(s): SERT expression was observed only in pulmonary EC; no other organs showed EC positivity. Expression of EC SERT began at about 30 weeks gestational age, gradually increased to become strongly diffuse near term and continued at high level postnatally. ACD/MPV lungs showed no or very minimal EC SERT reactivity; SERT antibody diffusely marked pulmonary ECs in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n=5), congenital alveolar dysplasia (1), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (3). and primary pulmonary hypertension (5). Amplicon of SERT-LRP of all ACD/MVP lungs showed homozygosity for the L allele. Conclusion(s): SERT is a highly specific and sensitive EC marker of perinatal and adult lung. The late gestational expression peaking at birth implies that SERT plays a role in pulmonary vessel remodeling near term by lowering scrum serotonin level. Because of its defective expression, SERT may be a diagnostic marker for ACD/MPV and thus can be utilized in pediatric pathology practice. We tested SERT promoter length polymorphism as a possible explanation for the lack of SERT expression. All ACD/MPV patients had the L allele, excluding this possibility. Further studies of upstream regulators of SERT promoter region and mutational analysis of SERT gene may unravel key aspects of the pathomechanism that leads to ACD/MVP.","group":"g1","id":"af7af3cd-6ce0-4ce5-a42f-bae3eedc4b40","_showDetails":true},"4f3a3742-fe97-447c-8c1c-f61deeb96d41":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70494442","title":"Human amnion epithelial cells reduce ventilation-induced preterm lung injury","authors":["Hodges R.","Jenkin G.","Hooper S.","Miller S.L.","Allison B.","Lim R.","Wallace E.M."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*lung injury","*air conditioning","*epithelium cell","*amnion","*human","*gynecological examination","*society","fetus","female","lung alveolus cell","ewe","pregnancy","morphology","tissue","lung","model","cell therapy","prematurity","lung dysplasia","chronic lung disease","baby","adult","sheep","surgery","catheter","endotracheal tube","immunohistochemistry","fetus lung","collagen","elastin","surfactant protein C"],"journal":"Reproductive Sciences","language":"English","volume":"17","number":"3 SUPPL. 1","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc.","isbn":"1933-7191","address":"R.

Currently, there are no effective treatments. We have recently shown that amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) can repair adult lung injury. In this study we explored whether hAECs were able to reduce lung injury in a fetal sheep model of BPD. Method(s): Ewes with a singleton pregnancy underwent surgery at 105 days gestation for insertion of fetal catheters and a modified endotracheal tube. On 110 days the fetus was either ventilated in utero for 12 hours alone (IUV alone; n=4) or with administration of 30 million hAECs iv and ETT at both 3 and 6 hours (120 million cells total) (IUV+hAECs; n=5) or was not ventilated (control; n=4). Both ewe and fetus were killed 7 days later. Result(s): Compared to controls, IUV caused lung injury resembling BPD - increased mean+/-SEM tissue:airspace ratio (1.56+/-0.47 vs 0.23+/-0.03, P<0.001), increased collagen (22.9+/-2.5% vs 10.9+/-1%, P=0.009) and elastin (15.9+/-2.4% vs 4.5+/-1.2%, P=0.02) and reduced secondary septal crest (developing alveoli) number (2.6% vs 18.5%, P<0.001). In those fetuses receiving IUV+hAECs, dual label immunohistochemistry (CFSE and surfactant protein C) localised CFSE/SP-C positive cells in the lungs with morphology consistent with both type I and type II alveolar cells. Lung injury was reduced compared to IUV alone: tissue:airspace ratio (0.73+/-0.24, P<0.001), collagen (9.9+/-0.7%, P<0.01), elastin (7.8+/-1.2%, P=0.02) and normalised secondary septal crest number (9.6%, P<0.001) Figure 1. Lung morphology in control, ventilation alone and ventilation+hAEC ovine fetuses.

Haplotype analysis of the ABCA3 gene has identified a polymorphism which is significantly associated with respiratory distress and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Heterozygosity of ABCA3 mutations is also known to affect the severity of lung disease associated with other surfactant protein mutations. ABCA3 deficiency in humans and mice results in decreased phospholipid content, absence of surfactant and irreversible respiratory distress leading to death. ABCA3+/- (heterozygous for null allele) mice survive the neonatal period but have increased leukocyte count in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. As it is possible that loss of one functioning allele of ABCA3 translates into a change in lung phospholipid content, we investigated the phospholipid content of surfactant in ABCA3+/- mice. Method(s): The lung tissues of wildtype (WT) and ABCA3+/- adult as well as neonatal mice were investigated for phopsholipid content (nmol/mg wet weight) by mass spectrometry. In each group, lung tissues from mice were dissected and total lipids extracted. These were then resuspended in chloroform, and an aliquot taken for mass spectrometry analysis. Result(s): Total phospholipids were significantly lower in ABCA3+/- adult mice as compared to WT mice (36.5 vs. 38.1, p=0.03). As the predominant phospholipids in the surfactant are phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), these were further investigated. Dipalmitoylated PC (DPPC) was significantly lower in the BCA3+/- mice as compared to WT in both newborns (2.1+/-0.4 vs. 2.8+/-0.3, p=0.04) and adults (4.2+/-0.4 vs. 4.5+/-0.5; p=0.01). In adults, this difference was seen only in the female mice (females 4.1 vs. 4.7, p=0.01; males 4.2 vs. 4.2). Similarly, levels of PC 32:1 and PC 34:2 were significantly lower. A corresponding increase in PCs with long acyl chains was observed. Total PG was significantly decreased in the ABCA3+/- mice, both newborns and adults, with no difference observed between the sexes (p=0.01). Conclusion(s): ABCA3+/- status results in a decrease in total phospholipids, PC and PG in the lungs. In addition, a significant reduction in DPPC and PC 32:1 is observed. As DPPC is the major surface-active component in surfactant, we speculate that a significant decrease of DPPC might translate into a greater susceptibility to lung injury either due to external stimuli or due to prematurity. However, this needs to be investigated in further studies.","group":"g1","id":"303b8c1b-a619-40b8-ab31-0068ef51836f","_showDetails":true},"12508ee7-0e5c-4382-8b46-361de2f2c367":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70448559","title":"Glutathione reductase deficiency alters lung development in newborn mice","authors":["Luchsinger J.","Rogers L.K.","Locy M.L.","Hill C.L.","Velten M.","Nelin L.D.","Tipple T.E."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*mouse","*lung development","*society","lung","wild type","hyperoxia","phenotype","exposure","growth disorder","compensation","mouse mutant","knockout mouse","infant","adult","lung injury","lung dysplasia","hypothesis","ambient air","homogenate","Western blotting","human","analysis of variance","*free radical","*glutathione reductase","protein","thioredoxin","oxidoreductase","glutathione"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","language":"English","volume":"49","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","isbn":"0891-5849","address":"J.

Exposure of neonatal wild-type mice to 85% O2 results in a phenotype similar to that seen in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with lung growth arrest manifested by fewer and larger alveoli. However, the roles of the GSH and Trx systems in this pathologic phenotype are not well defined. The present studies tested the hypothesis that neonatal GR-KO mice exposed to 85% O2 would not exhibit the BPD phenotype following hyperoxia exposure. Within 24 h of birth, wild-type C3H/HeN and GR-KO mice were exposed to 85% O2 or were kept in room air (RA). Morphometric analyses were performed on lung sections from 14 d mice. Homogenates prepared from the lungs of 7 d mice were analyzed for Trx1 and Trx reductase-1 (TrxR1) contents by western blotting. Data (in arbitrary units) were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA with differences noted at p<0.05. Lung morphometric analyses of RA-raised animals indicated that 14 d GR-KO mice had statistically fewer and smaller alveoli than wild-type C3H/HeN mice. GR-KO mice exposed to 85% O2 exhibited much less severe growth arrest than did hyperoxia-exposed wild-type controls. Lung Trx1 protein levels were greater in GR-knockout mice than in wild-type mice (31.0+/-2.8 vs 7.0+/-2.6) raised in RA but no differences in TrxR1 protein levels between strains were detected (6.3+/-0.4 vs 5.3+/-0.7). In contrast to wild-type animals, exposure of GR-KO mice to hyperoxia increased both Trx1 (49.5+/-5.5) and TrxR1 (12.0+/-0.7) lung protein levels. Our data indicate that GR is necessary for normal lung development. Interestingly, GR deficient mice exhibit less severe hyperoxia-induced lung phenotypic alterations. Increases in Trx1 and TrxR1 protein levels in the lungs of GR-KO mice suggest compensation for GR deficiency by the Trx system. We speculate that the Trx system may protect against the effects of hyperoxia on lung development in prematurely born human infants.","group":"g1","id":"12508ee7-0e5c-4382-8b46-361de2f2c367","_showDetails":true},"5f2a54ce-c711-4a81-8527-62af75276fc2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70388773","title":"Pregnancy in women with portal vein thrombosis (PVT): Results of a multicentric european study on maternal and foetal management and outcome","authors":["Hoekstra J.","Seijo S.","Rautou P.-E.","Ducarme G.","Luton D.","Alijotas-Reig J.","Condat B.","Garcia-Pagan J.C.","Janssen H.L.","Valla D.","Casellas-Caro M."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*pregnancy","*female","*liver","*liver disease","*portal vein thrombosis","anticoagulation","patient","bleeding","prophylaxis","premature labor","HELLP syndrome","infant","diagnosis","portal vein obstruction","fetus outcome","France","Netherlands","Spain","mesenteric vein","varicosis","antiphospholipid syndrome","ascites","spleen infarction","univariate analysis","prognosis","thrombocyte","spontaneous abortion","deep vein thrombosis","contraception","death","portal hypertension","vein occlusion","obstruction","gene mutation","term birth","emergency surgery","congenital malformation","hyaline membrane disease","necrotizing colitis","fetus","mother","cesarean section","genital bleeding","vaginal delivery","myeloproliferative disorder","nitrogen 13","blood clotting factor 5 Leiden","estrogen","prothrombin","low molecular weight heparin","protein S"],"journal":"Hepatology","language":"English","volume":"52","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Ltd","isbn":"0270-9139","address":"J.

Aim(s): To assess maternal and fetal outcome of pregnancies in women with known PVT. Method(s): Retrospective European multicenter analysis of pregnancy in women with chronic PVT seen between 1986 and 2010. Pregnancies occurred 6 months or more after PVT diagnosis. Result(s): 23 women, median age 32 years (20-45) had 42 pregnancies (France n=16, Netherlands n=13, Spain n=13). Median duration between PVT diagnosis and pregnancy was 54 months (7 to 370 months). Twenty-one women had portal vein obstruction, including 8 with mesenteric vein (MV) obstruction; 2 left or right portal vein obstruction, including 1 with MV obstruction. Fifteen had oesophageal varices, which had ruptured in 9.Four had myeloproliferative disorder, 7protein S or C deficiency, 3 antiphospholipid syndrome, 1 factor V Leiden and 1 prothrombine gene mutation. Low molecular weight heparin (LWMH) was started before gestation-week 5 in 14 pregnancies; and after week 6 in 13. No LMWH was given during 15 pregnancies. Median duration of gestation was 36 weeks (range 6-39 weeks). Eight fetuses were lost before week 20. There were 2 very preterm birth at week 24-25; 19 moderately preterm birth (at 32-36 weeks); and 13 term birth (after week 37). One infant underwent emergency surgery for a cardiac malformation; another infant had hyaline membrane disease, and necrotic colitis, both with favourable outcome. Two mothers had HELLP syndrome at week 24 and 33 respectively. There were 3/17 parietal bleeding after caesarean sections, and 1/17 genital bleeding after vaginal deliveries. Two oesophageal variceal bleedings occurred, in the absence of primary prophylaxis, at week 18 and 38 respectively. Three had ascites during pregnancy. Post-partum splenic infarction occurred once without anticoagulation. In univariate analysis, significant prognosis factors for unfavourable outcome of pregnancy were high platelets (253 +/- 140 vs 220+/-78 (p=0.017), past history of spontaneous abortion or deep vein thrombosis (p=0,042) and past oestrogen contraception (p=0,008). There were no deaths. Conclusion(s): In chronic PVT patients, who become pregnant, foetal outcome is generally favourable and maternal outcome is good. Variceal bleeding is rare. HELLP syndrome seems more common than expected. Thrombotic events can occur postpartum in the absence of anticoagulation. Therefore, intensified prophylaxis for portal hypertension, close surveillance for HELLP, and brief anticoagulation interruption around delivery may reduce the rate of bleeding and thrombotic complications in these patients.","group":"g1","id":"5f2a54ce-c711-4a81-8527-62af75276fc2","_showDetails":true},"7e10a13b-f8b6-4724-9b94-7368a5258be2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70367624","title":"Healthcare utilisation and cost of care at school age related to home oxygen status during infancy","authors":["Greenough A.","Alexander J.","Chetcuti P.","Lenney W.","Shaw N.","Boorman J.","Turner J."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*health care utilization","*school","*infancy","*college","*child health","*pediatrics","child","lung function","newborn intensive care","drug therapy","intensive care unit","general practitioner","outpatient","hospital admission","publication","coughing","wheezing","cold air","prescription","follow up","lung dysplasia","morbidity","gestational age","parent","questionnaire","hospital","*oxygen"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"95","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"A.

Method(s): One hundred and sixty children, median gestational age 27 (range 22-31) weeks, cared for on four tertiary neonatal intensive care units were examined. Sixty five of them had received supplementary oxygen when discharged home from the NICU (home oxygen group). A parent completed respiratory questionnaire was administered and lung function measurements (including assessment of bronchial hyper-responsiveness) were undertaken when the children were eight years old. Healthcare utilisation during years five to seven was assessed by examining hospital and general practitioner records to identify all hospital admissions, out-patient and general practitioner attendances and medication prescribed; whether the healthcare utilisation was related to respiratory problems was noted. The cost of care was calculated using the National Scheme of Reference Costs (2003) and medication costs calculated using the British National Formulary prices. Result(s): No child was oxygen dependent at school age. There were no significant differences in cough or wheeze or in the baseline lung function results between the two groups, but there was tendency for more of the home oxygen group to respond to a cold air challenge (p=0.0596). The home oxygen group had more out-patient attendances (p=0.0168), particularly for respiratory related problems (p=0.0032), with greater associated costs of care (p=0.0186, p=0.0030 respectively). In addition, their cost of care for prescriptions (p=0.0409) and total respiratory related cost of care (p=0.0354) were significantly greater that that of the non-home oxygen group. Conclusion(s): Children with BPD who required supplementary oxygen at home after discharge from the NICU have increased healthcare utilisation and associated cost of care at school age. These results emphasise such prematurely born children need ongoing follow up beyond when they cease to require home oxygen.","group":"g1","id":"7e10a13b-f8b6-4724-9b94-7368a5258be2","_showDetails":true},"c05f9cdf-5615-41b4-a356-046ddcd2729f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70367555","title":"Deaths in preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation: clinico-pathological diagnoses and trends over 2 decades","authors":["Hearns R.","Berrington J.","Bythell M.","Wright C.","Embleton N."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*death","*prematurity","*pregnancy","*college","*diagnosis","*child health","*pediatrics","population","infection","infant","data base","immaturity","hyaline membrane disease","congenital malformation","enterocolitis","morbidity","birth weight","case study","mortality","survival","prevalence","newborn morbidity","perinatal mortality","child death"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","language":"English","volume":"95","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","isbn":"0003-9888","address":"R.

It is important to accurately document these changes, and identify current patterns, in order to inform research and development priorities. Objective(s): To ascertain the major causes of death in preterm infants using a population based database, and to determine any changes over the last two decades. Design/Methods: The authors used the Perinatal Mortality Survey-a large population based database to obtain information on all infant deaths among those live born between 24 and 31 weeks gestation between 1988 and 2008. Clinico-pathological diagnoses for the major morbidities were hyaline membrane disease, pulmonary immaturity (immaturity making sustained ventilatory support impossible), malformations (genetic or structural), infection (including ante-, intra-, and postpartum) and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Infants were subdivided into those born extremely (24-27 weeks) and very (28-31 weeks) preterm, and into three 7-year cohorts 1988-1994, 1995-2001 and 2002-2008. Result(s): There were 1504 deaths in live born preterm infants <32 weeks gestation with median gestation 26 weeks (IQR 3w), median birth weight 880 g (IQR 469g) and median age at death 3 days (IQR 14 days). There was a major decrease in respiratory deaths especially in those born at 28-31 weeks, and a significant increase in the relative importance of deaths from NEC and infection especially in those born at 24-27 weeks. Conclusion(s): This is one of the largest published population based case series of mortality in preterm infants. This shows a large overall decrease in deaths in infants born preterm, differential trends between extremely and very preterm infants, and the increasing importance of deaths due to NEC and infection.

With the improved survival of extremely preterm infants the incidence of BPD has increased. Currently there is only limited information on the health of BPD survivors who have reached adulthood. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to examine current empirical research on adult survivors of BPD. Methods Six electronic databases were searched between 1950 and February 2010 (Medline, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Plus) and Web of Knowledge. Studies were independently screened and were only included if they related to the assessment of outcome measures in adult survivors of BPD. From a total of 1453 search results, 14 eligible studies were included in the review. Data on methodological design and findings were extracted from each included study; in addition the methodological quality of each study was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Result(s): 14 cohort studies met the review criteria. 12 scored highly on the CASP checklist, with a score > 10 out of 12. No study scored less than 7. Nine studies included a control group and only four studies in total had a singular focus on BPD outcomes. Six controlled studies found differences between the groups on respiratory symptoms. 11 studies carried out lung function testing and found evidence of airflow obstruction. Of these, one study found no difference between preterm and controls. However, there were only seven adults who were born preterm with BPD in this study. Five studies in total examined radiographical outcomes, and all found evidence of abnormalities. Those with moderate-severe BPD were found to be most affected compared to mild BPD subjects. Conclusions The effects of BPD on pulmonary function do not diminish over time. This may reflect issues related to means of testing, differing definitions and classification of BPD, and the adaptation of individuals to their circumstances over time.","group":"g1","id":"d330986c-cd79-46c1-beb8-0480360166c3","_showDetails":true},"9fda6c2d-7538-4845-9a31-48ff07221482":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Cord blood fibroblast growth factor-10 as a possible predictor of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/NPM-1476613","authors":["Mohamed, Walid A","Aseeri, Mohamed A"],"date":"2014//","keywords":["Biomarkers/bl [Blood]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","Early Diagnosis","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Female","*Fetal Blood/ch [Chemistry]","*Fibroblast Growth Factor 10/bl [Blood]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/bl [Blood]","Infant, Premature, Diseases/di [Diagnosis]","Infant, Premature, Diseases/mo [Mortality]","Male","Predictive Value of Tests","Prognosis","Prospective Studies","Saudi Arabia"],"journal":"Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine","volume":"7","number":"2","isbn":"1878-4429","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25104125"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) levels in cord blood as a possible predictor of the subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 269 preterm (<=32 weeks gestation) infants (76 infants developed BPD and 193 had no BPD) were enrolled.

It is associated with airway inflammation (CD4 T-lymphocytes, B-cell lymphoid aggregates, macrophages, eosinophils and, in adults, neutrophils) and airway wall remodelling (airway wall thickening, principally increased airway smooth muscle and deposition of collagen below the basement membrane, with minor encroachment on the airway lumen). It is not associated with a prominent effect on the lung parenchyma. The cause(s) of asthma remains unknown and the severity of disease remains largely constant. COPD is diagnosed with a spirometer and is defined as a fixed reduction in FEV1, relative to FVC. When caused by cigarette smoke it is associated with airway inflammation (CD8 T-lymphocytes, B-cell lymphoid aggregates, macrophages and neutrophils) and airway remodelling (mild increase in airway wall thickness including airway smooth muscle with encroachment on the airway lumen) and tissue destruction (emphysema and loss of small conducting airways). The severity of COPD increases with age and continued exposure to irritants. COPD has many causes including smoking cigarettes, burning of biomass fuels, asthma and early life respiratory illness and exposures (viral infections, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). As a group, patients with asthma have reduced lung function, in relation to disease severity, and may have a slightly increased rate of decline in lung function. Patients with asthma who smoke have reduced lung function and an accelerated decline in lung function. Apart from stopping smoking there is no current treatment that can improve the rate of decline in lung function in patients with asthma or COPD. Therefore prevention, early intervention and uncovering the unknown environmental and genetic contributions to airway diseases remain critical.","group":"g1","id":"7096fb09-0c8c-4c22-a868-2cc73fd4e871","_showDetails":false},"fded4ca6-5148-47f2-bb40-2b0f6f0f5afe":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70309846","title":"HLA and bronchopulmonary dysplasia susceptibility","authors":["Rochaa G.","Guimaraesa H.","Proencab E.","Areiasb A.","Freitasc F.","Limac B.","Rodriguesd T.","Alvesc H."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*lung dysplasia","*health care organization","newborn","allele","gestational age","logistic regression analysis","risk factor","confidence interval","gene frequency","human","clinical study","HLA typing","Student t test","Fisher exact test","birth weight","leukocyte antigen"],"journal":"Early Human Development","language":"English","volume":"86","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","isbn":"0378-3782","address":"G.

Up-regulation of the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFbeta) superfamily signaling pathway has been associated with the development of BPD in multiple animal models as well as premature infants. Although it is known that TGFbeta signaling is mediated via three ligands, TGFbeta-1, 2, and 3, that serve overlapping yet specific functions in normal lung development, there is a lack of data describing how these ligands are affected by neonatal exposure to hyperoxia. We hypothesized that exposure to chronic hyperoxia will have differential effects on the expression of these isoforms in the neonatal mouse lung. Method(s): Within 12 hr of birth, C57/B6 wild-type mice were subjected to 21 consecutive days of continuous exposure to 85% oxygen (O2) or room-air (RA) as controls. At the end of the study period, lungs were pressure-fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (for examination of distal airspace size and TGFbeta-isoform mRNA in-situ hybridization) or frozen and homogenized for protein electrophoresis (to quantify TGFbeta signaling via relative phospho-Smad 2/3 expression). Result(s): Exposure to chronic hyperoxia resulted in an arrest of alveolar development with enlarged, simplified distal airspaces. TGFbeta-2 mRNA expression was increased in 85% oxygen-exposed mice compared to RA controls, with a punctuate pattern noted within the alveolar epithelium. TGFbeta-1 mRNA appeared to be equivalent between the two groups, and TGFbeta-3 mRNA was not present in either group. There was potentiation of TGFbeta signaling levels as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Smad2/3 protein (O2:RA increased 41%, p<0.001). Significantly, Periostin protein, a known down-stream effector of phospho-Smad 2/3 signaling, was increased in 85% oxygen-exposed mice compared to RA control lungs. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia-induced arrested alveolar development is associated with long-lasting enhancement of TGFbeta signaling. Further, we show that the potentiation of TGFbeta signaling is mediated via specifically increased TGFbeta-2 ligand expression. Future studies to delineate the spatio-temporal expression of TGFbeta-2 mRNA as well as the cell-specific targets of TGFbeta-signaling are needed, as this will be paramount to understanding the possible role of TGFbeta in the development of neonatal lung diseases.","group":"g1","id":"01c44f79-872b-49ee-ade6-a92d4d320d54","_showDetails":true},"2b435422-04ed-4085-90e4-fe39071606ef":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70236126","title":"The Forgotten Majority - Late preterm infants and their vulnerability to lung disease","authors":["Colin A.A."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*prematurity","*airway","*morbidity","*pulmonology","*functional residual capacity","*lung disease","*lung dysplasia","*airway conductance","infant","gestational age","risk","lung function","lung","lung volume","thorax wall","hospitalization","lung development","gas exchange","child","infection","respiratory system","mortality","hospital","bronchiolitis","death","growth, development and aging","expiratory flow","hospital readmission","population","respiratory tract disease","follow up","lung alveolus wall","longitudinal study","adulthood","adult","lifespan","sacculus","chronic obstructive lung disease","live birth","hospital discharge","newborn morbidity","risk factor","infant mortality","pathogenesis","Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus","outpatient","newborn","United States","human","continuous process","maturation","gas","capillary","breathing","lung compliance","fatty acid desaturation","bronchus","airway resistance","total lung capacity","pregnancy","maturity","hyperoxia","uterus","environment","hypothesis","premature labor","adverse drug reaction","compression","forced vital capacity","muscle contraction"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","language":"English","volume":"11","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"W.B.

Infants 34-36 weeks gestational age (wGA) comprise approximately 71% of all preterm births (in 2007 approximately 390,000 live births) [1]. Infants of this gestational age termed \"late preterm\" are often considered to be as physiologically and metabolically mature as term infants, and therefore at low risk for morbidity and mortality. The resulting early discharge from hospital may be a factor in an increased overall risk of re-hospitalization [2]. A growing body of literature has documented the broad range of complications that late preterm infants may experience [3]. They have a higher risk of developing a large array of medical complications, and mortality rate for late preterm infants are 3-5 fold higher than that for term infants. Each weekly reduction in estimated gestational age at birth was found to be associated with increased morbidity before hospital discharge and higher rates of hospital readmission in the first months of life [2]. A study involving 377,638 term and 26,170 late preterm (34-36 wGA) infants showed that 22.2% of the late preterm vs. 3.0% of term infants had newborn morbidity during their birth hospitalization. Preterm infants born at 34 wGA had 20-fold (relative risk [RR]: 20.6) and at 35wGA had 10-fold (RR: 10.2) higher risk of morbidity compared with infants born at 40wGA. Relative morbidity increased approximately 2-fold with every week of decreasing gestational age earlier than 38wGA [4]. A recent review on the respiratory consequences of preterm birth suggests that many adverse respiratory consequences of preterm birth are likely the result of persistent pulmonary structural abnormalities [5]. Retrospective analyses of records of infants born to US residents showed higher infant mortality rates in 34-36wGA infants compared with term infants [6]. All forms of respiratory morbidity affect late preterm infants at a higher rate than infants of more advanced gestational age, but in particular preterm infants (33-36wGA) who are outside of the typical bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) age range are highly susceptible to infection by such pathogens as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Boyce et al. [7] showed that infants born at 33-36wGA had similar rates of admission to the hospital for RSV infection as infants <33wGA, and that there were substantially higher rates of admission in these 2 populations compared with term infants. In other studies infants 33-35wGA had hospital outcomes that were similar to or worse than those of infants <=32wGA, whether RSV infection was confirmed or they were hospitalized for nonspecific bronchiolitis. After RSV-hospitalization infants 32-36wGA experienced rehospitalization rates twice as high, hospital stays 3 times as long, and outpatient visits twice as frequent as infants of similar gestational age who were not hospitalized for RSV [8]. Prematurity was also associated with an increased risk of bronchiolitis-associated death. The odds ratio for death related to RSV in 32-35wGA compared with full-term infants was approximately 5 [9]. The mechanisms explaining the morbidity in infants 34-36wGA are at least in part related to physiologic deficiencies related to their stage of lung development. Stages of lung development: Early growth and development of the human lung is a continuous process that is highly variable between individuals and has traditionally been divided into 5 stages. Premature infants are predominantly born in the saccular stage (28-36wGA) that precedes the final alveolar stage [10]. The saccular period, is a transitional phase before full maturation of alveoli occurs characterized by an increased number of primitive alveoli (saccules) that become gradually more effective as gas exchangers and may be sufficient in number and quality to sustain life in the preterm infant. The alveolar walls are more compact and thick than the final thin walls of alveoli and include an immature capillary system that is capable of carrying out the function of gas exchange and also fully matures in the alveolar phase. Mature alveoli are not uniformly present until 36wGA [10]. These structural changes not only affect gas exchange but have profound effects on the mechanical properties of the lung and hence the respiratory system as a whole. Impaired maintenance of FRC due to chest wall compliance, deficient airway tethering, and small lung volumes: The physiologic consequences of this early birth are that maintenance of a stable and adequate functional residual capacity (FRC) that secures stable gas exchange is impaired. FRC is determined by the balance between the opposing forces of the chest wall and lung and is thus a direct function of their respective mechanical properties. In early life, a compliant chest wall offers little outward recoil to the respiratory system and thus the elastic characteristics of the respiratory system approximate those of the lung with a tendency to decrease to lower lung volumes. Only within the first 2 years of life is this vulnerability corrected as the chest wall stiffens. To circumvent this limitation, infants actively elevate their FRC by modulating expiratory flow using laryngeal braking during tidal expiration and by maintaining inspiratory muscle activity into the expiratory phase. In addition they initiate inspiration early within the expiratory phase. Thus it is reasonable to assume that breathing with an overly compliant chest wall, high lung compliance, and reduced number of air-containing units is a challenge for infants delivered before term. The challenge of maintaining an FRC that permits stable gas exchange is likely compounded in the premature infant by apneic events, which have been shown to drive the system to critically low lung volumes and result in rapid desaturation. An additional crucial mechanism that secures airway patency and thus adequate maintenance of FRC is airway tethering. Tethering depends on a complex mesh-like elastic network within the alveolar walls that transmits tension from the pleural surface and exerts a circumferential pull on individual bronchi. Thus, tethering couples lung volume changes with airway caliber. Tethering of airways is less effective in infants born prematurely because alveolarization and the associated development of the parenchymal elastic network are still in the saccular stage of development at 32-36 wGA. The effect of reduced tethering is decreased airway stability, increased tendency to closure, increased airway resistance, and, ultimately, a tendency to collapse alveolar units in the lung periphery. Total lung volume undergoes rapid changes during the last trimester of gestation. At 30wGA, the lung volume is only 34% of the ultimate volume at mature birth, and at 34 weeks only reaches 47% of the final volume at maturity. This change parallels a marked thinning of air space walls associated with a dramatic increases in air space surface area from 1.0-2.0m2 at 30-32wGA, to 3.0-4.0m2 at term. These volume changes likely have direct mechanical implications in reducing the vulnerability caused by a low and unstable FRC. Altered lung development and function in association with preterm (30-36 wGA) birth: It is now recognized that postnatal hyperoxia plays a key role in the development of BPD. Premature birth interrupts normal in utero lung development and results in an early transition from the hypoxic intrauterine environment to a comparatively hyperoxic atmospheric environment. There is increasing evidence to support the hypothesis that preterm delivery, even in the absence of any neonatal respiratory disease, may have adverse effects on subsequent lung growth and development, and that these alterations may persist during the first 5 years of life and possibly beyond. Using pulmonary function testing a number of studies have shown a direct association between premature birth and altered pulmonary function. These studies demonstrated reduced expiratory flows in premature infants of varying gestational ages, but born without clinical lung disease. Most convincing was a recent study using the raised volume rapid thoracic compression technique [11]. In this study healthy preterm infants (mean, 33.4wGA) were studied at 8 weeks and had reduced airway flows in the presence of normal forced vital capacity compared with term infants. In a follow-up analysis, the reduced flows did not normalize in these children by 16 months of age, thus demonstrating a lack of \"catch-up\" growth in airway function [12]. The long-term significance of reduced airway function early in life has recently been emphasized in a longitudinal study involving a large group of non-selected infants who had participated in the Tucson Children's Respiratory study [13]. In this study Stern et al. showed that infants whose pulmonary function was in the lowest quartile also had pulmonary function in the lowest quartile through the years of follow-up until early adulthood. These findings in a normal unselected population, suggest that the level of pulmonary function in early life tracks and changes little with growth. Weiss and Ware [14] suggest that deficits in lung function during early life, especially if associated with lower respiratory illnesses, increase the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in late adult life. Of particular importance in this context may be the role played by RSV, which affects most children during their first year of life. Conclusion(s): Long term prospective data are needed to elucidate the lifetime impact of birth in the late preterm stage and the consequences of the morbidities associated with such birth.","group":"g1","id":"2b435422-04ed-4085-90e4-fe39071606ef","_showDetails":true},"a8bf823e-31a6-4b0f-a709-4a8457445c49":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70201248","title":"Complications of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Conclusion(s): Antenatal dexamethasone therapy must be taken into account while interpreting the results of serum PCT and IL-8 testing and may promote an increased incidence of NEC, bleeding and BPD in premature infants with EONS.","group":"g1","id":"71b947de-920e-4ba9-84dd-edff12284fa7","_showDetails":false},"e2835103-a3dc-407f-9320-7be728c33c28":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Ascorbylperoxide from parenteral nutrition induces an increase of redox potential of glutathione and loss of alveoli in newborn guinea pig lungs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.05.002","authors":["Elremaly, Wesam","Mohamed, Ibrahim","Mialet-Marty, Tiphaine","Rouleau, Therese","Lavoie, Jean-Claude"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140520//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Ascorbic Acid/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]","Ascorbic Acid/to [Toxicity]","Caspase 3/me [Metabolism]","*Glutathione/me [Metabolism]","Guinea Pigs","Hydrogen Peroxide/to [Toxicity]","Interleukin-6/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","NF-E2-Related Factor 2/me [Metabolism]","NF-kappa B/me [Metabolism]","Oxidation-Reduction/de [Drug Effects]","Oxidative Stress/de [Drug Effects]","Parenteral Nutrition","*Peroxides/to [Toxicity]","Prostaglandin D2/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]","Prostaglandin D2/an [Analysis]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"Redox biology","volume":"2","isbn":"2213-2317","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25009773"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is one of the main complications associated with extreme prematurity. Oxidative stress is suspected to be a trigger event of this lung disease, which is characterized by impaired alveolar development. Peroxides, mainly ascorbylperoxide and H2O2, are known contaminant of parenteral nutrition. We hypothesize that these oxidant molecules induce bronchopulmonary dysplasia development. The aim was to determine if the infusion of ascorbylperoxide, whether in presence or absence of H2O2, is associated with oxidative stress, apoptosis and loss of alveoli in the lungs of newborn guinea pigs., METHOD: Three-day-old guinea pigs received parenteral solutions containing 0, 20, 60 or 180 microM ascorbylperoxide in the presence or not of 350 microM H2O2 (concentrations similar to those measured in parenteral nutrition). After 4 days, the lungs were collected for determination of glutathione's redox potential, caspase-3 activation (an apoptosis marker), alveolarization index (by histology), activation of Nrf2 and NF?B (biological markers of oxidative stress), and IL-6 and PGJ2 levels (markers of NF?B activation). Groups were compared by ANOVA, p < 0.05., RESULTS: Loss of alveoli was associated with ascorbylperoxide in a dose-dependent manner, without an influence of H2O2. The dose-dependent activation of caspase-3 by ascorbylperoxide was lower in the presence of H2O2. Ascorbylperoxide induced an increase of redox potential in a dose-dependent manner, which reached a plateau in presence of H2O2. Nrf2 and NF?B were activated by H2O2 but not by ascorbylperoxide., CONCLUSION: Results suggest that ascorbylperoxide, generated in parenteral nutrition, is involved in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, independently of the increase of the redox potential. This study underlines the importance of developing a safer formulation of parenteral nutrition.","group":"g1","id":"e2835103-a3dc-407f-9320-7be728c33c28","_showDetails":true},"bf159bcf-5640-4b46-b63e-0a19e7732b36":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70200584","title":"Nutritional assessment of children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia until the fourth year of age","authors":["Moreno R.A.","Ceccon M.E.J.","Falcao M.C.","Redondo A.C."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*child","*lung dysplasia","*perinatal care","*nutritional assessment","prematurity","nutritional status","general aspects of disease","congenital infection","weight","nutritional deficiency","head circumference","World Health Organization","gestational age","respiratory function","follow up","growth, development and aging","dysplasia","congenital malformation","genetic disorder","questionnaire"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"R.A.

The aim of the study was to analyze the nutritional state until the 4th year of age in premature children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Material(s) and Method(s): The study encloses children born prematurely with BPD, who had regular medical visits until the 4th year. The children were excluded presented beyond the bronchopul-monary dysplasia congenital malformations, genetic syndromes, congenital infections or neurological illnesses. They had monthly medical visits in the 1st year of life, every 3 months during the 2nd, and every 6 months until complete 4 years. In each visit, they had the weight, length, and head circumference measurements, and alimentary questionnaire. For the anthropometric data, the correction of the prematurity was applied. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: Thirty children were studied who had filled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ten children (33%) born with gestational age lesser than 28 weeks. In relation to the growth, using the curves of the WHO (2006), only 20% of the sample placed below of the Z score 73 at the 4th year of age. Conclusion(s): The bronchopulmonary dysplasia causes innumerable alterations in respiratory function, nutritional status, and neurological development. It is extremely important that these children have a differentiated follow-up, in order to precociously detect the growth and development alterations, and to prevent and/or minimize the sequels of this sever illness.","group":"g1","id":"bf159bcf-5640-4b46-b63e-0a19e7732b36","_showDetails":true},"7ac22ea8-fc48-43b9-97f2-0b06682748e8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70200246","title":"Antenatal inflammation influences caveolin expression and associated cellular signalling pathways in preterm lungs","authors":["Kunzmann S.","Speer C.P.","Yang Y.","Jobe A.H.","Uhlig S.","Kramer B.W."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*lung","*inflammation","*perinatal care","protein expression","phosphorylation","down regulation","vascularization","modulation","upregulation","chorioamnionitis","airway","sheep","premature labor","pregnancy","lung dysplasia","*caveolin","endotoxin","messenger RNA","sphingomyelin","acivicin","STAT3 protein","sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase","heme oxygenase 1","sodium chloride","ceramide","carbon 14"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"S.

In lungs, caveolins (Cav) have been implicated in airway-and vascular remodelling by modulating signalling pathway like the Stat- and Smad-signalling pathway and influencing activity of sphingomyelinase(aSMase) and heme oxygenase 1(HO-1). We asked whether CA-associated antenatal inflammation affects Cav-1 expression in preterm lungs and alters Smad- and Stat-signalling, and activity of aSMase and HO-1. Material(s) and Method(s): Fetal sheep were exposed to 4 mg of intra-amniotic (IA) endotoxin or saline for 2, 7, or 2 + 7 days before preterm delivery at 125 days gestation (full term= 150 days). Expression of Cav-1, HO-1, ceramide, and phosphorylation of Smad's and Stat's were evaluated by RT-PCR, WP, or IH. aSMase activity was measured by using 14C-labelled sphingomyelin. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: IA endotoxin decreased lung Cav-1 mRNA and protein expression in the LPS exposed groups, with a maximum decrease of Cav-1 mRNA of 60% and of Cav-1 protein expression of 75% in the 2 days exposed group. Decreased Cav-1 levels were associated with elevated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and Stat3. Pulmonary aSMase activity (38-fold) and HO-1 expression (7.3-fold) were elevated in the 7 days LPS exposed group. Conclusion(s): The antenatal inflammation-induced down-regulation of pulmonary Cav-1 expression may contribute to impaired lung alveolarization and vascularization in BPD by modulation of the Smad-and Stat-signalling pathways, up-regulation of the HO-1, and increasing aSMase activity.","group":"g1","id":"7ac22ea8-fc48-43b9-97f2-0b06682748e8","_showDetails":true},"2786f17f-6a5e-4443-a336-ea74e61c6f5e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase","accession":"70200167","title":"Antenatal steroids and antioxidant enzyme activity in preterm infants","authors":["Vento M.","Escrig R.","Izquierdo I.","Escobar J.","Arduini A.","Sastre J.","Asensi M.A."],"date":"2010//","keywords":["*perinatal care","*prematurity","*enzyme activity","oxidative stress","antioxidant activity","female","retrolental fibroplasia","supplementation","boy","gender","survival","newborn","umbilical cord blood","cohort analysis","oxidation","artificial ventilation","lung dysplasia","brain hemorrhage","*steroid","*antioxidant","enzyme","glutathione","DNA","protein","tyrosine","phenylalanine","oxygen","glutathione disulfide"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","language":"English","volume":"23","number":"SUPPL. 1","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","isbn":"1476-7058","address":"M.

We aimed to establish an association between antenatal steroids and antioxidant activity and postnatal oxidative stress. In a prospective cohort study, extremely preterm neonates receiving antenatal steroids (CORT) or not (NOCORT) were enrolled. An association between antenatal steroids and activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione cycle enzymes in cord blood was found. In addition, reduced oxidative stress (GSH = GSSG ratio, CORT vs. NOCORT, 35.6812.20 vs. 28.389.92; p <0.01) and, decreased oxidation of proteins (ortho-tyrosine = phenylalanine ratio, CORT vs. NOCORT, 8.662.45 vs. 12.554.41; p <0.01) and DNA (8oxodG = 2dG ratio, CORT vs. NOCORT, 6.732.18 vs. 9.533.83; p <0.01) also was found. Antenatal steroids were associated with reduced oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, and conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intra-periventricular hemorrhage, or retinopathy of prematurity. The maximal effectiveness was when steroids were administered 2-4 days before delivery. Female preterm infants had less oxidative stress and increased antioxidant activity and better clinical outcomes than did male infants, independent of receiving or not antenatal steroids. Antenatal steroids are accompanied by a reduction in postnatal oxidative-stress-derived conditions and increased antioxidant enzyme activity.
