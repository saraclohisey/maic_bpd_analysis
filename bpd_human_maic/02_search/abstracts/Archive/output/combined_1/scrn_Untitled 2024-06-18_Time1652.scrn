Children and young adults (ages 1-18 years) in these analyses were born between 2003 and 2021. Data were recorded by the August 31, 2021, data-lock date and were analyzed between October 2021 and October 2022., Exposures: Premature birth (<37 weeks' gestation)., Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was health care utilization related to COVID-19 concerns (hospitalization, in-person clinic or emergency department visit, phone or telehealth evaluations). Individuals born preterm vs term (>=37 weeks' gestation) and differences among preterm subgroups of individuals (<28 weeks', 28-36 weeks' vs >=37 weeks' gestation) were assessed. Generalized estimating equations assessed population odds for health care used and related symptoms, controlling for maternal age, education, and psychiatric disorder; offspring history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or asthma; and timing and age at COVID-19 questionnaire completion., Results: Data from 1691 children and young adults were analyzed; among 270 individuals born preterm, the mean (SD) age at survey completion was 8.8 (4.4) years, 151 (55.9%) were male, and 193 (71.5%) had a history of BPD or asthma diagnosis. Among 1421 comparison individuals with term birth, the mean (SD) age at survey completion was 8.4 (2.4) years, 749 (52.7%) were male, and 233 (16.4%) had a history of BPD or asthma. Preterm subgroups included 159 individuals (58.5%) born at less than 28 weeks' gestation. In adjusted analyses, individuals born preterm had a significantly higher odds of health care utilization related to COVID-19 concerns (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.38) compared with term-born individuals; similar differences were also seen for the subgroup of individuals born at less than 28 weeks' gestation (aOR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.40-3.29). Maternal history of a psychiatric disorder was a significant covariate associated with health care utilization for all individuals (aOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17-1.78)., Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that during the COVID-19 pandemic, children and young adults born preterm were more likely to have used health care related to COVID-19 concerns compared with their term-born peers, independent of a history of BPD or asthma. Further exploration of factors associated with COVID-19-related health care use may facilitate refinement of care models.","group":"g1","id":"faaa6691-4432-4825-9cd7-be226467cc99","_showDetails":true},"cc69c22c-f394-44d1-afa2-f2a5de6140de":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Development of a peripheral blood transcriptomic gene signature to predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00250.2022","authors":["Moreira, Alvaro","Tovar, Miriam","Smith, Alisha M","Lee, Grace C","Meunier, Justin A","Cheema, Zoya","Moreira, Axel","Winter, Caitlyn","Mustafa, Shamimunisa B","Seidner, Steven","Findley, Tina","Garcia, Joe G N","Thebaud, Bernard","Kwinta, Przemko","Ahuja, Sunil K"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20221206//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Humans","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Birth Weight","Transcriptome/ge [Genetics]","Artificial Intelligence","Infant, Premature","Gestational Age"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Combining artificial intelligence with gene expression data is a novel approach that may assist in better understanding mechanisms underpinning chronic lung disease and in stratifying patients at greater risk for BPD. The objective of this study is to develop an early peripheral blood transcriptomic signature that can predict preterm neonates at risk for developing BPD. Secondary analysis of whole blood microarray data from 97 very low birth weight neonates on day of life 5 was performed. BPD was defined as positive pressure ventilation or oxygen requirement at 28 days of age. Participants were randomly assigned to a training (70%) and testing cohort (30%). Four gene-centric machine learning models were built, and their discriminatory abilities were compared with gestational age or birth weight. This study adheres to the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. Neonates with BPD (n = 62 subjects) exhibited a lower median gestational age (26.0 wk vs. 30.0 wk, P < 0.01) and birth weight (800 g vs. 1,280 g, P < 0.01) compared with non-BPD neonates. From an initial pool (33,252 genes/patient), 4,523 genes exhibited a false discovery rate (FDR) <1%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting BPD utilizing gestational age or birth weight was 87.8% and 87.2%, respectively. The machine learning models, using a combination of five genes, revealed AUCs ranging between 85.8% and 96.1%. Pathways integral to T cell development and differentiation were associated with BPD. A derived five-gene whole blood signature can accurately predict BPD in the first week of life.","group":"g4","id":"cc69c22c-f394-44d1-afa2-f2a5de6140de","_showDetails":true},"064edd78-91e6-4b6d-b980-2ed29846fc97":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"PREDICTORS OF BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA DEVELOPMENT AND COMORBIDITIES OF PREMATURITY ASSOCIATED WITH RESPIRATORY SUPPORT TECHNIQUES IN PREMATURE NEONATES.","authors":["Sorokina, Olena Yu","Bolonska, Anna V"],"date":"2021//","keywords":["Aged, 80 and over","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Child","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Prospective Studies","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)","volume":"74","number":"7","isbn":"0043-5147","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34459774"],"address":"Poland","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze and identify risk factors for the development of moderate and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates in intensive care unit and during any kind of respiratory support., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: A simple retrospective-prospective blind controlled non-randomised study included 28-32 weeks of gestational age 122 newborns with respiratory distress syndrom, who were treated in the neonatal intensive care units of two medical institutions of Dnipro from 2016 to 2020. Among 122 children neonates were divided into two groups according to particularities of respiratory support, prior type of noinvasive ventilation and infusion volume per day. The uni-variate Cox regressions using clinical variables identified specific clinical variables associated with development of moderate and severe BPD, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, mortality rate (based on odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Then, significant clinical variables were used to build a multivariate Cox regression models. by backwards elimination of non-significant clinical variables. To estimate discriminative ability of comorbidities predictors we conducted ROC-analysis., RESULTS: Results: The patients with moderate and severe BPD significantly longer were mechanically ventilated and received O2 more than 30% in inhaled gas mixture, therefore every day of MV and/or additional oxygen >30% led to increase in probability of BPD development by 15% (p=0,01), AUC=0,78 (95% CI 0,66-0,89).

Other risk factors which we can manage include nutrition state, anemia and supplemental oxygen.","group":"g1","id":"064edd78-91e6-4b6d-b980-2ed29846fc97","_showDetails":true},"0264e1b8-4929-4a00-83de-262ff4ae2b4c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Transforming Growth Factor-induced Protein Promotes NF-kappaB-mediated Angiogenesis during Postnatal Lung Development.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0153OC","authors":["Liu, Min","Iosef, Cristiana","Rao, Shailaja","Domingo-Gonzalez, Racquel","Fu, Sha","Snider, Paige","Conway, Simon J","Umbach, Gray S","Heilshorn, Sarah C","Dewi, Ruby E","Dahl, Mar J","Null, Donald M","Albertine, Kurt H","Alvira, Cristina M"],"date":"2021//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Cell Movement","Colony-Stimulating Factors/me [Metabolism]","Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","*Extracellular Matrix Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Integrin alphaVbeta3/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*NF-kappa B/me [Metabolism]","*Neovascularization, Physiologic","Nitric Oxide/bi [Biosynthesis]","Premature Birth","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Sheep","*Transforming Growth Factor beta/me [Metabolism]","Mice"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"64","number":"3","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33264084"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Pulmonary angiogenesis is a key driver of alveolarization. Our prior studies showed that NF-kappaB promotes pulmonary angiogenesis during early alveolarization. However, the mechanisms regulating temporal-specific NF-kappaB activation in the pulmonary vasculature are unknown. To identify mechanisms that activate proangiogenic NF-kappaB signaling in the developing pulmonary vasculature, proteomic analysis of the lung secretome was performed using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. NF-kappaB activation and angiogenic function was assessed in primary pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) and TGFBI (transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein)-regulated genes identified using RNA sequencing. Alveolarization and pulmonary angiogenesis was assessed in wild-type and Tgfbi null mice exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia. Lung TGFBI expression was determined in premature lambs supported by invasive and noninvasive respiratory support. Secreted factors from the early alveolar, but not the late alveolar or adult lung, promoted proliferation and migration in quiescent, adult PECs. Proteomic analysis identified TGFBI as one protein highly expressed by the early alveolar lung that promoted PEC migration by activating NF-kappaB via alphavbeta3 integrins. RNA sequencing identified Csf3 as a TGFBI-regulated gene that enhances nitric oxide production in PECs. Loss of TGFBI in mice exaggerated the impaired pulmonary angiogenesis induced by chronic hyperoxia, and TGFBI expression was disrupted in premature lambs with impaired alveolarization. Our studies identify TGFBI as a developmentally regulated protein that promotes NF-kappaB-mediated angiogenesis during early alveolarization by enhancing nitric oxide production. We speculate that dysregulation of TGFBI expression may contribute to diseases marked by impaired alveolar and vascular growth.","group":"g1","id":"0264e1b8-4929-4a00-83de-262ff4ae2b4c","_showDetails":true},"86cd5ff7-a27d-453e-8142-f5ffbb408c18":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"The burden of hyaline membrane disease, mortality and its determinant factors among preterm neonates admitted at Debre Tabor General Hospital, North Central Ethiopia: A retrospective follow up study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249365","authors":["Minuye Birihane, Binyam","Alebachew Bayih, Wubet","Yeshambel Alemu, Abebaw","Belay, Demeke Mesfin","Demis, Asmamaw"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210330//","keywords":["Ethiopia/ep [Epidemiology]","Female","Follow-Up Studies","*Hospitals, General/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Humans","*Hyaline Membrane Disease/ep [Epidemiology]","Hyaline Membrane Disease/mo [Mortality]","Infant","Infant Mortality","Infant, Newborn","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal","Male","Pregnancy","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"16","number":"3","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33784349"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm newborn babies. Though, there are studies related to Hyaline membrane disease inclusive of all neonates, studies related to the burden among preterm neonates were limited. In addition, increasing neonatal mortality in Ethiopia could be related to increase in the burden of hyaline membrane disease among preterm neonates. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the burden of hyaline membrane disease, mortality and its associated factors among preterm neonate admitted at neonatal intensive care unit, North Central Ethiopia., METHODOLOGY: An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 535 preterm neonates admitted at neonatal intensive care unit from January 1, 2014-December 30, 2017. Data were entered into EPi-data 4.2.0.0 and transferred to STATA version 14 statistical software for statistical analysis. Binary logistic regression was used for the analysis. All variables with P-value < 0.25 during bi-variable analysis were considered for multivariable logistic regression. Level of statistical significance was declared at P value <=0.05., RESULTS: In the current study, proportion of hyaline membrane disease was 40% (95% CI; 35.8, 44.3) of which 49.5% died.

The incidence of hyaline membrane disease among preterm admissions was high. Preterm neonate born with gestational age of less than 34 weeks of age, asphyxiated newborns and newborn with birth weight of less than 1500 gram were predictors of hyaline membrane disease.

Our previous study revealed a defect in the autophagic flux in the lung tissues of neonatal rats with hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Moreover, there are few innovative treatments that can completely alter the course of BPD. The present study examined the expression of Syntaxin 17 (STX17), a protein necessary for autophagosome-lysosome binding, in alveolar type II (AT-II) epithelial cells of neonatal rats with BPD. Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly exposed to elevated O2 levels [fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), 0.8; model group] or normal room air (FiO2, 0.21; control group), and the expression levels of STX17, autophagy-related [Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3B (LC3B)-II, p62, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1)] and apoptosis-related (cleaved caspase3) mRNA and proteins were examined in lung tissues. Moreover, the expression levels of the aforementioned proteins were measured in isolated primary AT-II cells cultured in vitro under hyperoxic conditions in the presence or absence of pharmacological modulators of autophagy. Transmission electron microscopy identified that AT-II cell apoptosis and autophagosome aggregation were elevated in the lungs of BPD rats compared with control rats on postnatal day 7. STX17 mRNA and protein expression levels were decreased in lung tissue and isolated AT-II cells as early as postnatal day 3 in BPD rats, while the expression levels of LC3B-II, p62 and cleaved caspase3 were increased, reaching a peak on postnatal day 7. This early reduction in STX17 expression, followed by increased expression in autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins, was also observed in isolated AT-II cells exposed to hyperoxia in vitro. However, treatment with the autophagy inducers rapamycin or LiCl eliminated the hyperoxia-induced reduction in STX17, partially restored the autophagy flux and increased the survival of AT-II cells exposed to hyperoxia. Collectively, these results indicated that STX17 expression in AT-II cells was reduced in the early stages of BPD in neonatal rats and may be related to the subsequent hyperoxia-induced block in autophagic flux.","group":"g3","id":"5f9d9da8-d712-4443-93f5-39b2b4ba0ca3","_showDetails":true},"f6632182-d704-4886-8671-268f6ecccc93":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Surfactant-secreted phospholipase A2 interplay and respiratory outcome in preterm neonates.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00462.2019","authors":["De Luca, Daniele","Shankar-Aguilera, Shivani","Autilio, Chiara","Raschetti, Roberto","Vedovelli, Luca","Fitting, Catherine","Payre, Christine","Jeammet, Louise","Perez-Gil, Jesus","Cogo, Paola E","Carnielli, Virgilio P","Lambeau, Gerard","Touqui, Lhousseine"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200513//","keywords":["Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid","Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/ph [Physiology]","Male","Phospholipases A2, Secretory/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","*Phospholipases A2, Secretory/me [Metabolism]","Phospholipids","*Pulmonary Surfactants/me [Metabolism]","*Respiration"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

We hypothesize that this interplay is complex and the enzyme plays a relevant role in neonates needing surfactant replacement. We aimed to: 1) identify phospholipases A2 isoforms expressed in preterm lung; 2) study the enzyme role on surfactant retreatment and function and the effect of exogenous surfactant on the enzyme system; and 3) verify whether phospholipase A2 is linked to respiratory outcomes. In bronchoalveolar lavages of preterm neonates, we measured enzyme activity (alone or with inhibitors), enzyme subtypes, surfactant protein-A, and inflammatory mediators. Surfactant function and phospholipid profile were also tested. Urea ratio was used to obtain epithelial lining fluid concentrations. Follow-up data were prospectively collected. Subtype-IIA is the main phospholipase isoform in preterm lung, although subtype-IB may be significantly expressed. Neonates needing surfactant retreatment have higher enzyme activity (P = 0.021) and inflammatory mediators (P always <= 0.001) and lower amounts of phospholipids (P always < 0.05).

Supplemental oxygen and immature antioxidant defenses contribute to BPD development. Our group identified thioredoxin reductase-1 (TXNRD1) as a therapeutic target to prevent BPD. The present studies evaluated the impact of the TXNRD1 inhibitor aurothioglucose (ATG) on pulmonary responses and gene expression in newborn C57BL/6 pups treated with saline or ATG (25 mg/kg ip) within 12 h of birth and exposed to room air (21% O2) or hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 72 h. Purified RNA from lung tissues was sequenced, and differential expression was evaluated. Hyperoxic exposure altered ~2,000 genes, including pathways involved in glutathione metabolism, intrinsic apoptosis signaling, and cell cycle regulation. The isolated effect of ATG treatment was limited primarily to genes that regulate angiogenesis and vascularization. In separate studies, pups were treated as described above and returned to room air until 14 days. Vascular density analyses were performed, and ANOVA indicated an independent effect of hyperoxia on vascular density and alveolar architecture at 14 days. Consistent with RNA-seq analyses, ATG significantly increased vascular density in room air, but not in hyperoxia-exposed pups. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which TXNRD1 inhibitors may enhance lung development.","group":"g4","id":"2d11e512-fb0f-45e9-a089-9f37d20c894a","_showDetails":true},"69cf82e0-90b6-4084-8fd6-298b9cb88657":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Early angiogenic proteins associated with high risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension in preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00131.2019","authors":["Arjaans, Sanne","Wagner, Brandie D","Mourani, Peter M","Mandell, Erica W","Poindexter, Brenda B","Berger, Rolf M F","Abman, Steven H"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200122//","keywords":["Adult","*Angiogenic Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Biomarkers/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/et [Etiology]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/me [Metabolism]","*Infant, Extremely Premature/me [Metabolism]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","Prospective Studies","Proteomics/mt [Methods]","Vascular Diseases/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Objectives: To determine whether c-KIT+ EC progenitors stimulate alveologenesis in the neonatal lung. Methods: We used single-cell RNA sequencing of neonatal human and mouse lung tissues, immunostaining, and FACS analysis to identify transcriptional and signaling networks shared by human and mouse pulmonary c-KIT+ EC progenitors. A mouse model of perinatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury was used to identify molecular mechanisms that are critical for the survival, proliferation, and engraftment of c-KIT+ EC progenitors in the neonatal lung. Measurements and Main Results:  Pulmonary c-KIT+ EC progenitors expressing PECAM-1, CD34, VE-Cadherin, FLK1, and TIE2 lacked mature arterial, venal, and lymphatic cell-surface markers. The transcriptomic signature of c-KIT+ ECs was conserved in mouse and human lungs and enriched in FOXF1-regulated transcriptional targets. Expression of FOXF1 and c-KIT was decreased in the lungs of infants with BPD. In the mouse, neonatal hyperoxia decreased the number of c-KIT+ EC progenitors. Haploinsufficiency or endothelial-specific deletion of Foxf1 in mice increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of c-KIT+ ECs. Inactivation of either Foxf1 or c-Kit caused alveolar simplification. Adoptive transfer of c-KIT+ ECs into the neonatal circulation increased lung angiogenesis and prevented alveolar simplification in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia. Conclusions: Cell therapy involving c-KIT+ EC progenitors can be beneficial for the treatment of BPD.","group":"g4","id":"8ca641b8-7496-43d0-87a0-0b43b23866c6","_showDetails":true},"d5dc53ef-9d2e-4530-bf96-9b45b13b2a62":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Extracellular Vesicles Protect the Neonatal Lung from Hyperoxic Injury through the Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Reprogramming of Myeloid Cells.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202102-0329OC","authors":["Willis, Gareth R","Reis, Monica","Gheinani, Ali Hashemi","Fernandez-Gonzalez, Angeles","Taglauer, Elizabeth S","Yeung, Vincent","Liu, Xianlan","Ericsson, Maria","Haas, Eric","Mitsialis, S Alex","Kourembanas, Stella"],"date":"2021//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mt [Methods]","*Epigenesis, Genetic","*Extracellular Vesicles/tr [Transplantation]","Humans","*Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Mice","*Myeloid Cells/me [Metabolism]","Phenotype","Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine","volume":"204","number":"12","isbn":"1073-449X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34699335"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Rationale: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC)-small extracellular vesicle (MEx) treatment has shown promise in experimental models of neonatal lung injury.

Methods: MEx were isolated from the conditioned medium of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (HYRX, 75% O2) from birth and returned to room air at Postnatal Day 14 (PN14). Mice received either a bolus intravenous MEx dose at PN4 or bone marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDMy) pretreated with MEx.

Biodistribution and mass cytometry studies demonstrated that MEx localize in the lung and interact with myeloid cells. MEx restored the apportion of alveolar macrophages in the HYRX-injured lung and concomitantly suppressed inflammatory cytokine production. In vitro and ex vivo studies revealed that MEx promoted an immunosuppressive BMDMy phenotype.

Among others, the current treatment paradigm considers broad inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, a strategy that likely leads to collateral inhibition of signaling pathways that are critical for lung repair and regeneration. Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) and FGF10 signaling in the lung through FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) are involved in epithelial cell protection and renewal, and mutations in their corresponding genes in humans are linked to increased susceptibility to lung pathologies, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this report, we present data demonstrating significant upregulation of FGF7, FGF10, and FGFR2 in IPF and IPAH lungs compared with donor lungs. These ligands and their cognate receptor converged on the remodeled parenchyma and vasculature of IPF and IPAH lungs. Interestingly, the expression levels of FGFR1, which has been previously shown to play a pathological role in PH development, were not significantly changed in either disease state. Intriguingly, the expression levels of FGF7, FGF10, and FGFR2 were lower in IPF lung regions undergoing active remodeling, and inversely correlated with IPAH severity, indicating that increased expression might reflect lung repair rather than lung pathology, and warranting further research on the precise role of FGF signaling in pulmonary parenchymal and vascular remodeling.","group":"g1","id":"ea30df2c-6b4c-44cc-93cf-01bcdf60d5a4","_showDetails":true},"1443c5cb-e772-4883-afa8-d50a93a9d2c8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Lung microRNA deregulation associated with impaired alveolarization in rats after intrauterine growth restriction.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190445","authors":["Dravet-Gounot, Pauline","Morin, Cecile","Jacques, Sebastien","Dumont, Florent","Ely-Marius, Fabiola","Vaiman, Daniel","Jarreau, Pierre-Henri","Mehats, Celine","Zana-Taieb, Elodie"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20171229//","keywords":["Animals","Female","*Fetal Growth Retardation","Gene Expression Profiling","Male","*MicroRNAs/ge [Genetics]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"12","number":"12","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=29287116"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was recently described as an independent risk factor of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the main respiratory sequelae of preterm birth.

We identified 13 miRNAs with more than two-fold differential expression between control lungs and LPD-induced IUGR lungs. Validated and predicted target genes of these miRNAs were related to \"tissue repair\" at P10 and \"cellular communication regulation\" at P21. We predicted the deregulation of several genes associated with these pathways. Especially, E2F3, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle control, was expressed in developing alveoli, and its mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased at P21 after IUGR. Hence, IUGR affects the expression of selected miRNAs during lung alveolarization. These results provide a basis for deciphering the mechanistic contributions of IUGR to impaired alveolarization.","group":"g3","id":"1443c5cb-e772-4883-afa8-d50a93a9d2c8","_showDetails":true},"0099e849-a360-4f49-9816-bd9f062e3810":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Altered vasoreactivity in neonatal rats with pulmonary hypertension associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: Implication of both eNOS phosphorylation and calcium signaling.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173044","authors":["Dumas de la Roque, Eric","Smeralda, Gwladys","Quignard, Jean-Francois","Freund-Michel, Veronique","Courtois, Arnaud","Marthan, Roger","Muller, Bernard","Guibert, Christelle","Dubois, Mathilde"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20170224//","keywords":["Acetylcholine/pd [Pharmacology]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Calcium Signaling","Cells, Cultured","Female","Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/pp [Physiopathology]","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/en [Enzymology]","Muscle Contraction/de [Drug Effects]","Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/me [Metabolism]","Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/pa [Pathology]","Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/pp [Physiopathology]","Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/me [Metabolism]","*Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/me [Metabolism]","Phosphorylation","*Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Pulmonary Artery/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Artery/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Artery/pp [Physiopathology]","Rats, Wistar","Vasodilation","Vasodilator Agents/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"12","number":"2","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=28235094"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) consists of an arrest of pulmonary vascular and alveolar growth, with persistent hypoplasia of the pulmonary microvasculature and alveolar simplification. In 25 to 40% of the cases, BPD is complicated by pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) that significantly increases the risk of morbidity. In vivo studies suggest that increased pulmonary vascular tone could contribute to late PH in BPD. Nevertheless, an alteration in vasoreactivity as well as the mechanisms involved remain to be confirmed. The purpose of this study was thus to assess changes in pulmonary vascular reactivity in a murine model of BPD-PH. Newborn Wistar rats were exposed to either room air (normoxia) or 90% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 days. Exposure to hyperoxia induced the well-known features of BPD-PH such as elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary vascular remodeling and decreased pulmonary vascular density. Intrapulmonary arteries from hyperoxic pups showed decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine without any alteration of relaxation to the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside. This functional alteration was associated with a decrease of lung eNOS phosphorylation at the Ser1177 activating site. In pups exposed to hyperoxia, serotonin and phenylephrine induced exacerbated contractile responses of intrapulmonary arteries as well as intracellular calcium response in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC). Moreover, the amplitude of the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), induced by store depletion using a SERCA inhibitor, was significantly greater in PASMC from hyperoxic pups. Altogether, hyperoxia-induced BPD-PH alters the pulmonary arterial reactivity, with effects on both endothelial and smooth muscle functions. Reduced activating eNOS phosphorylation and enhanced Ca2+ signaling likely account for alterations of pulmonary arterial reactivity.","group":"g1","id":"0099e849-a360-4f49-9816-bd9f062e3810","_showDetails":true},"56278acf-b148-46f3-9e92-2ea39df600af":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2017 to 2019>","title":"Deep Illumina sequencing reveals differential expression of long non-coding RNAs in hyperoxia induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia in a rat model.","authors":["Cheng, Han-Rong","He, Shao-Ru","Wu, Ben-Qing","Li, Dong-Cai","Hu, Tian-Yong","Chen, Li","Deng, Zhu-Hui"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20171215//","journal":"American journal of translational research","volume":"9","number":"12","isbn":"1943-8141","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm4&NEWS=N&AN=29312522"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants is a predominantly secondary occurrence to intrauterine inflammation/infection and postpartum mechanical ventilation; The purpose of this study is to explore the biological roles of lincRNA in the pathogenesis of BPD., METHODS: Newborn rats were randomly assigned to hyperoxia (85% O2) or the control group: the normoxia group (21% O2). Lung tissues were collected on days 1-14. The BPD animal model was validated using HE staining, Masson staining, and real-time RT-PCR. Deep Illumina sequencing was used to reveal the differential expression of long non-coding RNAs in hyperoxia bronchopulmonary dysplasia rat models. KEGG and GO functions were predicted. Nine possible BPD-related target lincRNAs were verified by RTq-PCR., RESULTS: The histopathologic changes in lung tissues manifested as hyperaemia, edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation cell infiltration after continuous exposure to hyperoxia for 3 days, and became aggravated after 7 days of hyperoxic exposure. The above lung tissue inflammatory manifestations were alleviated and taken over by pulmonary interstitia hyperplasia and fibrocyte proliferation after 14 days of hyperoxic exposure. The expressions of lincRNA differed between the hyperoxia bronchopulmonary dysplasia model group and the normoxia group. 1175 different lincRNAs were detected in the hyperoxia group and the normoxia group, of which 544 were up-regulated and 631 were down-regulated. 673 moleculars related to GO functions were enriched, including cell location and biological process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that lincRNA was involved in 257 KEGG pathways. 9 lincRNA were validated in the sample, and the difference was statistically significant., CONCLUSION: LincRNAs were identified differently between the BPD model and the normoxia group. Many target genes were involved in the developmental process, including cell component biogenesis, biological regulation, transcription regulator, and translation regulator. The BPD might be caused by the activation of the pathways of the EMC-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cell cycle, and cell adhesion molecules. The present study provides new insight into the pathogenesis mechanism of BPD.","group":"g3","id":"56278acf-b148-46f3-9e92-2ea39df600af","_showDetails":true},"86d7216b-3c87-4690-b6b5-935e2428eb94":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"Blood Cytokine Profiles Associated with Distinct Patterns of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia among Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.03.058","authors":["D'Angio, Carl T","Ambalavanan, Namasivayam","Carlo, Waldemar A","McDonald, Scott A","Skogstrand, Kristin","Hougaard, David M","Shankaran, Seetha","Goldberg, Ronald N","Ehrenkranz, Richard A","Tyson, Jon E","Stoll, Barbara J","Das, Abhik","Higgins, Rosemary D","Das A","McDonald SA","Jobe AH","Laptook AR","Oh W","Rubin LP","Hensman AM","Fanaroff AA","Walsh MC","Newman NS","Siner BS","Donovan EF","Narendran V","Alexander B","Grisby C","Hessling J","Mersmann MW","Mincey HL","Cotten CM","Auten KJ","Hale EC","Wright LL","Yaffe SJ","McClure EM","Poindexter BB","Lemons JA","Appel DD","Herron DE","Wilson LD","Poole WK","Hastings BK","Zaterka-Baxter KM","O'Donnell Auman J","Schaefer SE","Stevenson DK","Van Meurs KP","Ball MB","Skogstrand K","Hougaard DM","Collins MV","Cosby SS","Finer NN","Rasmussen MR","Kaegi D","Arnell K","Demetrio C","Rich W","Bauer CR","Duara S","Everett-Thomas R","Papile LA","Lacy CB","Korones SB","Bada HS","Hudson T","Laptook AR","Salhab WA","Madison S","Kennedy KA","Morris BH","Akpa EG","Cluff PA","Franco CI","Lis AE","McDavid GE","Tate PP","O'Shea TM","Peters NJ","Konduri GG","Bara R","Muran G","Gettner P","Konstantino M","Poulsen J","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network"],"date":"2016//","accessDate":"20160423//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Case-Control Studies","*Cytokines/bl [Blood]","Female","Humans","Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/bl [Blood]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/et [Etiology]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"174","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=27117196"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To explore differences in blood cytokine profiles among distinct bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) patterns., STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated blood spots collected from 943 infants born at <=1000 g and surviving to 28 days on postnatal days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 for 25 cytokines. Infants were assigned to the following lung disease patterns: (1) no lung disease (NLD); (2) respiratory distress syndrome without BPD; (3) classic BPD (persistent exposure to supplemental oxygen until 28 days of age); or (4) atypical BPD (period without supplemental oxygen before 28 days). Median cytokine levels for infants with BPD were compared with the IQR of results among infants with NLD., RESULTS: The distribution of enrolled infants by group was as follows: 69 (NLD), 73 (respiratory distress syndrome), 381 (classic BPD), and 160 (atypical BPD). The remaining 260 infants could not be classified because of missing data (104) or not fitting a predefined pattern (156). Median levels of 3 cytokines (elevated interleukin [IL]-8, matrix metalloproteinase-9; decreased granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) fell outside the IQR for at least 2 time points in both infants with atypical and classic BPD. Profiles of 7 cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, C-reactive protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) differed between infants with classic and atypical BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Blood cytokine profiles may differ between infants developing classic and atypical BPD.

Some authors have considered malnutrition to be a major factor promoting BDP. The aim of our study was to examine the contribution of enteral and parenteral nutritional intake in the first 14 days of life to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in a sample of preterm infants., METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on all preterm infants born between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2013. The nutritional parameters compiled included the cumulative amount of fluids, calories, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids consumed. Statistical analysis of the data consisted of a descriptive analysis, Mann-Whitney pairwise comparison test and logistic regression., RESULTS: The total caloric intake in the infants studied was significantly lower in patients with subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (76.1 kCal/kg, 95% CI: 71.2-81.1 vs. 91.1 kCal/kg, 95% CI: 87.5-94.8).

Echocardiography was done to detect hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) and to evaluate left ventricular function at 2, 3, 5 and 7 d respectively after birth. On the basis of clinical symptoms and echocardiographic outcome, all the cases were divided into 3 groups: hsPDA group (n = 34), non-hsPDA (nhsPDA) group (n = 44) and non-PDA (nPDA) group (n = 27) to survey and compare general conditions, DA diameter, shunt direction, left ventricular function and complications., RESULT: The hsPDA group had smaller GA ((30. 5 +/- 2. 1) vs. (31. 6 +/- 1. 6) weeks, P = 0. 01) and greater proportion of pulmonary surfactant use and mechanical ventilation (2, 3, 5 d of birth) than the nhsPDA and the nPDA group (chi2 = 11. 62, 14. 95, 12. 73, 1:1. 59, P = 0. 00; 0. 00, 0. 01, 0. 01). Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated that the average length of stay (ALOS) was correlated with hsPDA (F =3. 52 and P =0. 03, OR 1. 03 and P =0. 02). The ALOS was longer in the hsPDA group than in the nhsPDA and the nPDA group ((39 +/-23)vs. (30 +/- 16)and(29 +/-13) d, P =0.02, 0.03). There was no significant.difference in rates of mortality/giving-up of treatment among the three groups (5. 9% (2/34)vs. 0 (0/44) and 3. 7% (1/27), chi2 = 5. 26, P = 0. 06). Diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure were significantly lower in the hsPDA group than in the other two groups (P all <0. 05) at 2, 3 and 5 days after birth and the pulse pressure was found significantly higher in the hsPDA group than in the nPDA group at 2 d after birth. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hsPDA was correlated significantly with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (chi2 =7. 34 and 7. 39, P = 0. 02 and 0. 02; OR = 3. 46 and 4. 01, P = 0. 04 and 0. 02). Premature infants with hsPDA had normal left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), although the cardiac output (CO) of left ventricle increased significantly(F = 6. 93, P <0. 01) within seven days of birth. There was no significant difference in cardiac hemodynamic parameters among closed group of hsPDA group, nhsPDA group and nPDA group simutaneously reexamined at 7th day after birth. The CO was extremely significantly different among premature infants who had different GAs and BWs. The lower the GAs and the BWs, the lower the value of CO(F =5. 16 and 14. 87, P all <0. 01). The DA diameter was reduced much more dramatically after ibuprofen treatment than before in hsPDA group(t = 5. 58, P <0. 01)., CONCLUSION: The GA, PS use and mechanical ventilation were probably associated with hsPDA. The mean blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were decreased and pulse pressure was increased in preterm infants with hsPDA that correlated significantly with ALOS, NRDS and BPD. In addition, increased CO values were found in hsPDA group. Oral ibuprofen administered to preterm infants for hsPDA at > 24 h of life promoted ductal closure.","group":"g1","id":"54236ef2-d037-45a5-b27d-b5c04772379c","_showDetails":true},"7bebcf3d-a802-44fa-884a-877b0d8c321c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Genes Encoding Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) and VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and Risk for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000381279","authors":["Mahlman, Mari","Huusko, Johanna M","Karjalainen, Minna K","Kaukola, Tuula","Marttila, Riitta","Ojaniemi, Marja","Haataja, Ritva","Lavoie, Pascal M","Ramet, Mika","Hallman, Mikko","Andersson S","Kari MA","Ketola I","Janer C","Tammela O","Sankilampi U","Lehtonen L","Gen-BPD Study Group"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150513//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Female","Gene Frequency","Genetic Variation","Genotype","Humans","Infant","*Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","*Infant, Extremely Premature","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/ge [Genetics]","Prospective Studies","*Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Neonatology","volume":"108","number":"1","isbn":"1661-7800","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=25998098"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the main consequences of prematurity, with notably high heritability. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and its main receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD., OBJECTIVE: To study whether common polymorphisms of the genes encoding VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 are associated with BPD., METHODS: In this association study, six tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNPs) for VEGFA and 25 tSNPs for VEGFR2 were genotyped in a prospectively collected, genetically homogeneous discovery population of 160 infants (44 infants with grade 2-3 BPD) born before 30 completed gestational weeks. The replication population of 328 infants included 120 cases of BPD., RESULTS: VEGFR2 SNP rs4576072 was associated with BPD grade 2-3 with a minor allele frequency in 23.9% of the cases compared to 9.1% in controls (p = 0.0005, odds ratio 3.15, 95% CI: 1.62-6.12) in the discovery population. This association was not observed in the more heterogeneous replication population., CONCLUSIONS: In line with the results of recent large-scale genetic studies, our findings indicate that common polymorphisms of the genes encoding VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 are not consistently associated with BPD. This finding does not rule out the involvement of VEGFA and VEGFR2 in BPD pathogenesis since, in addition to common variations within the gene region, other mechanisms also play important roles in the regulation of gene function.

Neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia develop a simplified lung structure that resembles BPD. Sustained activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and increased expression of protective target genes attenuate hyperoxia-induced mortality in adults. However, the effect of enhancing hyperoxia-induced NF-kappaB activity on lung injury and development in neonatal animals is unknown. We performed this study to determine whether sustained NF-kappaB activation, mediated through IkappaBbeta overexpression, preserves lung development in neonatal animals exposed to hyperoxia. Newborn wild-type (WT) and IkappaBbeta-overexpressing (AKBI) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (>95%) or room air from day of life (DOL) 0-14, after which all animals were kept in room air. Survival curves were generated through DOL 14. Lung development was assessed using radial alveolar count (RAC) and mean linear intercept (MLI) at DOL 3 and 28 and pulmonary vessel density at DOL 28. Lung tissue was collected, and NF-kappaB activity was assessed using Western blot for IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. WT mice demonstrated 80% mortality through 14 days of exposure. In contrast, AKBI mice demonstrated 60% survival. Decreased RAC, increased MLI, and pulmonary vessel density caused by hyperoxia in WT mice were significantly attenuated in AKBI mice. These findings were associated with early and sustained NF-kappaB activation and expression of cytoprotective target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. We conclude that sustained hyperoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation improves neonatal survival and preserves lung development. Potentiating early NF-kappaB activity after hyperoxic exposure may represent a therapeutic intervention to prevent BPD.

We evaluated the impact of two different rat models (nitric oxide synthase inhibition or protein deprivation) of IUGR on alveolarization, before, during, and at the end of this postnatal process. We studied IUGR rat pups of dams fed either a low protein (LPD) or a normal diet throughout gestation and pups of dams treated by continuous infusion of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or its diluent on the last four days of gestation. Morphometric parameters, alveolar surface (Svap), mean linear intercept (MLI) and radial alveolar count (RAC) and transcriptomic analysis were determined with special focus on genes involved in alveolarization. IUGR pups regained normal weight at day 21 in the two treated groups. In the LPD group, Svap, MLI and RAC were not different from those of controls at day 4, but were significantly decreased at day 21, indicating alveolarization arrest. In the L-NAME group, Svap and RAC were significantly decreased and MLI was increased at day 4 with complete correction at day 21. In the L-NAME model, several factors involved in alveolarization, VEGF, VEGF-R1 and -R2, MMP14, MMP16, FGFR3 and 4, FGF18 and 7, were significantly decreased at day 4 and/or day 10, while the various factors studied were not modified in the LPD group. These results demonstrate that only maternal protein deprivation leads to sustained impairment of alveolarization in rat pups, whereas L-NAME impairs lung development before alveolarization.

At baseline we measured hemogram, C-reactive protein and Fe profile. Subsequently, those with normal plasma hemoglobin (Hb) were not supplemented with Fe (Group A) and those with iron deficiency anemia or at risk of developing it (group B) were supplemented. We evaluated them 3 months later and, after supplementing all, at 4th month., RESULTS: Of 40 patients, median 30 months old (0.5 to 178), 60% were male, 80% eutrophic. Ventilation or oxygen were required in 45%. Diagnoses: 50% Chronic Lung Damage, 17.5% airway diseases, 10% Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, 7.5% Cystic Fibrosis and 13.5% other. At baseline 20% were anemic (mostly ferropenic) and 12.5% had an abnormal iron profile. At all, 25 children completed the study: in group A, serum ferritin decreased to 3(th) month (-22.9 +/- 30) and incremented to 4(th)month (+12.8 +/- 26) mug/L (p = 0.013), without difference in Hb.

Lungs were examined at 7 days, 10 weeks, and 8 months after birth., RESULTS: Gestational but not postnatal exposure to SS caused a typical BPD-like condition: suppressed angiogenesis [decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor, and CD34/CD31 (hematopoietic progenitor cell marker/endothelial cell marker)], irreversible hypoalveolarization, and significantly decreased levels of Clara cells, Clara cell secretory protein, and surfactant proteins B and C, without affecting airway ciliated cells. Importantly, concomitant exposure to SS and the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine during gestation blocked the development of BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Gestational exposure to SS irreversibly disrupts lung development leading to a BPD-like condition with hypoalveolarization, decreased angiogenesis, and diminished lung secretory function. Nicotinic receptors are critical in the induction of gestational SS-induced BPD, and the use of nAChR antagonists during pregnancy may block CS-induced BPD.","group":"g1","id":"9e3e362a-50ef-48e3-b2df-d462f25424d6","_showDetails":true},"dc5f4fb6-48bd-4aa7-a53e-3c8c31cc680a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Acute antiapoptotic effects of hydrocortisone in the hippocampus of neonatal rats.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.932339","authors":["Menshanov, P N","Bannova, A V","Bulygina, V V","Dygalo, N N"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20121213//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Apoptosis/de [Drug Effects]","*Apoptosis/ge [Genetics]","Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Blotting, Western","Caspase 3/bi [Biosynthesis]","Caspase 3/ge [Genetics]","DNA Fragmentation/de [Drug Effects]","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","Gene Expression/de [Drug Effects]","*Hydrocortisone/pd [Pharmacology]","RNA, Messenger/bi [Biosynthesis]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","Rats","bcl-2-Associated X Protein/bi [Biosynthesis]","bcl-2-Associated X Protein/ge [Genetics]","bcl-X Protein/bi [Biosynthesis]","bcl-X Protein/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Physiological research","volume":"62","number":"2","isbn":"0862-8408","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23234415"],"address":"Czech Republic","abstract":"Natural glucocorticoid hydrocortisone was suggested as a potent substitution for dexamethasone in the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates.

In the present study we determined cell-specific gene expression and cytokine release in response to glucocorticoids versus interleukin-10 (IL-10). Subsequently, we hypothesized that the insensitivity of MONOs to DEX was associated with a failure of the glucocorticoid receptor to translocate to the nucleus. PMNs and MONOs were isolated from umbilical cord blood at birth, and pretreated with PBS vehicle, IL-10 or glucocorticoids prior to endotoxin (LPS)-stimulation for 4 and 18h. Genome-wide gene expressions were determined by microarray and validated by RT-qPCR. Interleukin 8 release in cell culture supernatant was measured by ELISA. To examine the mechanism of monocyte insensitivity to glucocorticoids, nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor was determined by Western blots. MONOs had 6 times the number of genes changing expression with IL-10 compared to PMNs at 4h. DEX at the therapeutic level for neonates with BPD had no effect on gene expression in MONOs. The order of potency for inhibition of interleukin-8 release from MONOs was IL-10 >betamethasone >dexamethasone and hydrocortisone. Glucocorticoid potency in MONOs was directly related to glucocorticoid receptor translocation to nucleus.

Predisposing conditions for the development of serious RSV disease include preterm infants and those with cardiopulmonary illness, including congenital heart disease (CHD) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). No vaccine is currently approved for the prevention of RSV infection. It is recommended that children at high risk be prophylactically administered palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody that has been shown in a number of clinical studies to reduce hospitalization rates due to serious RSV infection. The objective of the current study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of palivizumab in preventing serious RSV disease in high-risk children in the Russian Federation. Children at high risk of serious RSV disease (ie, born at <= 35 wk gestational age and <= 6 mo of age, and/or aged <= 24 mo with BPD or hemodynamically significant CHD) were enrolled. Subjects were to receive 3 to 5 monthly injections of palivizumab 15 mg/kg (depending on the month of the initial injection) over the RSV season. The primary endpoint was RSV-related hospitalizations. Adverse events (AEs) were reported through 100 days following the final injection., RESULTS: One hundred subjects received >= 1 injection of palivizumab; 94 completed their dosing schedule. There were no RSV hospitalizations or deaths. Six of 7 subjects hospitalized for respiratory/cardiac conditions had an RSV test, which was negative in all cases. Three non-serious AEs (acute intermittent rhinitis and rhinitis, 1 subject; atopic dermatitis, 1 subject) were considered possibly related to palivizumab.

However, the mechanism of ETS1 in regulating BPD is still unclear., METHODS: Hyperoxia-induced A549 cells to simulate hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury. MTT assays and colony formation assays were performed to investigate the proliferation of A549 cells. Flow cytometry was carried out to quantify the apoptosis of A549 cells. The expression levels of ETS1 and TGM2 were quantified by qRT-PCR. The protein expression levels of ETS1, TGM2, beta-catenin, c-Jun and MET were measured by western blot. Overexpression of ETS1, overexpression of TGM2, overexpression of ETS1 with downregulation of TGM2 and overexpression of TGM2 with inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were performed to investigate the role of ETS1, TGM2 and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways in hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury., RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of cells in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, overexpression of ETS1 rescued the effect of hyperoxia on proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, overexpression of TGM2 participated in the regulation of hyperoxia-induced proliferation and apoptosis. ETS1 regulated hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway via TGM2., CONCLUSION: ETS1 ameliorates hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury through the TGM2-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

In premature infants weighed >1000 g, sonography was done in 7 days and 30 days of life respectively. If there is any conditions such as apnea, seizure, significant decrease in level of hemoglobin, increased head circumference, increased oxygen consumption, and other significant changes another sonography was done again. Exclusion criteria were cerebral malformations, metabolic disturbances, chromosomal anomalies, central nervous system infection, and genetic syndromes. Data was analyzed by SPSS ver 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA)., RESULTS: In this study 64 cases with IVH and without IVH were included. Mean of gestational age was 28.78 +/- 12.08. From neonates, 54.6% were boys and 45.4% were girls. Vaginal delivery and cesarean section was done in 56 (32.2%) and 118 (67.8%) cases respectively.

Haplotypes reconstruction showed that SOD1 (GG) decreased the risk of RDS, IVH and ROP; SOD2 (GT) increased the risk of BPD and decreased the risk of RDS, IVH, and ROP; SOD3 (TGC) decreased the risk of BPD and IVH; and CAT (CTC) decreased the risk of RDS., CONCLUSIONS: The study of SNPs or haplotypes reconstruction in genes involved in OS or scavenging activity may be helpful in identifying preterm newborns with a particularly high risk of morbidities, who may benefit from specific prevention strategies.","group":"g4","id":"c7f41eac-71df-49f0-8f66-cea6ee2ed6a6","_showDetails":true},"2c0cdff1-9077-4388-9c83-f5c0dbefd6a5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"[Expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 and vimentin in neonatal mice with bronchopulmonary dysplasia].","authors":["Chen, Kun","Jiang, Pu","Deng, Shixiong","Wang, Nian"],"date":"2012//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Hyperoxia","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Diseases/me [Metabolism]","Lung Diseases/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Nuclear Proteins/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1","*Transcription Factors/me [Metabolism]","*Vimentin/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","volume":"32","number":"8","isbn":"1673-4254","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22931601"],"address":"China","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), the type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII)-specific marker, and vimentin, the fibroblast-specific marker, in the lungs of neonatal mice with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and explore the pathogenesis of BPD., METHODS: Neonatal mice were exposed to hyperoxia to induce BPD, and pathological changes in the lung tissues were examined.

Oxygen toxicity may contribute to its pathogenesis. Vitamin A concentrations are lower in BPD infants which may result in a reduction of the antioxidant protection. It has been found to up regulate genes necessary for fetal lung growth and increase surfactant production in animal models and is also involved in the modulation of immunological and inflammatory responses by regulation of cytokine production. Retinoic acid plays a key role in lung development improving alveolar septation. Evidence exists that vitamin A supplementation for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, beyond that routinely given in multivitamin preparations, is associated with a reduction in death or BPD. So, parenteral administration of vitamin A to the newborn is one of the current recommended preventive therapies for BPD (number needed to treat 12; 95% CI: 6-94; The information on long-term neurodevelopmental status suggests no evidence of either benefit or harm. Estimates for cerebral palsy range from a number needed to treat of 11 to a number needed to harm of 33. Nowadays, it seems that administration of antenatal vitamin A to the mother in late pregnancy associated with neonatal supplementation can better prevent the development of BPD in areas of endemic vitamin A deficiency. The benefits, in terms of vitamin A status, safety and acceptability of delivering vitamin A in an intravenous emulsion compared with repeat intramuscular injections, the association of vitamin A prenatal and postnatal, as well as the effectiveness and safety of administered high dose vitamin A in ELBW infants await evaluation and should be assessed in further trials.","group":"g1","id":"72412cae-8fb3-4381-b6a8-6648e3a952bf","_showDetails":true},"cc50733d-b61d-407a-af12-78782aeba761":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"[Factors and neonatal outcomes associated with histologic chorioamnionitis after premature rupture of membranes in the preterms].","authors":["Xie, Ai-lan","DI, Xiao-dan","Chen, Xiao-ming","Hu, Ying-chun","Wang, Yu-huan"],"date":"2012//","keywords":["Adult","Birth Weight","*C-Reactive Protein/an [Analysis]","Chorioamnionitis/ep [Epidemiology]","*Chorioamnionitis/et [Etiology]","Female","*Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Newborn, Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","Leukocyte Count","Multivariate Analysis","*Oligohydramnios/ep [Epidemiology]","Pregnancy","*Pregnancy Outcome","Retrospective Studies","Risk Factors"],"journal":"Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi","volume":"47","number":"2","isbn":"0529-567X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22455741"],"address":"China","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors and neonatal outcomes associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA) in preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)., METHODS: From Jan. 2008 to Jun. 2011, 230 women with PPROM at 28 - 33(+6) weeks of gestation undergoing deliveries in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College were studied retrospectively. According to placental histopathologic findings, those patients were categorized into two groups, including 138 cases in histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA group) and 65 cases in non-chorioamnionitis (control) group. Age, parity, gestational age of PPROM and delivery, latency period, oligohydramnios, white blood cell (WBC) count and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level at admission and before delivery, the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), neonatal pneumonia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, early-onset neonatal sepsis, abnormal brain sonography findings and mortality were compared between two groups., RESULTS: (1) The incidence of HCA was 68.0% (138/203) in all 203 cases with PPROM. (2) The occurring ruptured membrane gestation in HCA group was (31.1 +/- 1.5) weeks, which were significantly earlier than (32.0 +/- 1.3) weeks in control group (P < 0.05).

There were no significant difference in patient's age, parity, WBC count and CRP at admission between two groups (P > 0.05). The latency period did not show significant difference between (140 +/- 116) hours in HCA group and (129 +/- 125) hours in control group (P > 0.05).

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been reported to be protective in the pathogenesis of diseases of inflammatory and oxidative etiology. Because HO-1 is involved in the response to oxidative stress produced by hyperoxia and is critical for cellular heme and iron homeostasis, it could play a protective role in BPD. Therefore, we investigated the effect of HO-1 in hyperoxia-induced lung injury using a neonatal transgenic mouse model with constitutive lung-specific HO-1 overexpression. Hyperoxia triggered an increase in pulmonary inflammation, arterial remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy that was attenuated by HO-1 overexpression. In addition, hyperoxia led to pulmonary edema, hemosiderosis, and a decrease in blood vessel number, all of which were markedly improved in HO-1 overexpressing mice. The protective vascular response may be mediated at least in part by carbon monoxide, due to its anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiapoptotic properties. HO-1 overexpression, however, did not prevent alveolar simplification nor altered the levels of ferritin and lactoferrin, proteins involved in iron binding and transport. Thus the protective mechanisms elicited by HO-1 overexpression primarily preserve vascular growth and barrier function through iron-independent, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory pathways.","group":"g1","id":"fa1545a8-e0f9-443a-8481-b2ad3faae094","_showDetails":true},"07d1e177-4221-4ded-95a0-7987d7219243":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"Human rhinoviruses in severe respiratory disease in very low birth weight infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-0583","authors":["Miller, E Kathryn","Bugna, Jimena","Libster, Romina","Shepherd, Bryan E","Scalzo, Paula M","Acosta, Patricio L","Hijano, Diego","Reynoso, Natalia","Batalle, Juan P","Coviello, Silvina","Klein, M Ines","Bauer, Gabriela","Benitez, Alicia","Kleeberger, Steven R","Polack, Fernando P"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20111226//","keywords":["Acute Disease","Bronchiolitis, Viral/vi [Virology]","Cohort Studies","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/vi [Virology]","*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]","*Respiratory Tract Infections/vi [Virology]","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","*Rhinovirus/ip [Isolation & Purification]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"129","number":"1","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22201153"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To assess incidence, burden of illness, and risk factors for human rhinoviruses (HRVs) in a cohort of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants., METHODS: A 2-year prospective cohort study was conducted among VLBW premature infants in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Nasal wash samples were obtained during every respiratory episode and tested for HRV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: Of 119 patients, 66 (55%) had HRV-associated ARIs. The incidence of HRV-associated ARI was 123 events per 100 child-years of follow-up. Of those infants experiencing an episode of bronchiolitis, 40% had HRV versus 7% with RSV. The incidence of HRV-associated bronchiolitis was 75 per 100 infant-years of follow-up.

In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal treatment of pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) with the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1 inducer, s-napthoflavone (BNF), will lead to attenuation of lung injury in newborns (delivered from these dams) exposed to hyperoxia by mechanisms entailing transplacental induction of hepatic and pulmonary CYP1A enzymes. Pregnant mice were administered the vehicle corn oil (CO) or BNF (40 mg/kg), i.p., once daily for 3 days on gestational days (17-19), and newborns delivered from the mothers were either maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O(2)) for 1-5 days. After 3-5 days of hyperoxia, the lungs of CO-treated mice showed neutrophil infiltration, pulmonary edema, and perivascular inflammation. On the other hand, BNF-pretreated neonatal mice showed decreased susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury. These mice displayed marked induction of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) (CYP1A1) and methoxyresorufin O-demethylase (MROD) (CYP1A2) activities, and levels of the corresponding apoproteins and mRNA levels until PND 3 in liver, while CYP1A1 expression alone was augmented in the lung. Prenatal BNF did not significantly alter gene expression of pulmonary NAD(P)H quinone reductase (NQO1). Hyperoxia for 24-72 h resulted in increased pulmonary levels of the F(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), whose levels were decreased in mice prenatally exposed to BNF. In conclusion, our results suggest that prenatal BNF protects newborns against hyperoxic lung injury, presumably by detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides by CYP1A enzymes, a phenomenon that has implications for prevention of BPD in infants.

The frequency estimates are very heterogeneous; in the population under two years the frequency of admission for bronchiolitis is between 1 and 3.5%, primary care consultations between 4 and 20% and emergency visits between 1 and 2%. The frequency of admissions for respiratory infection by respiratory syncytial virus in the risk population is: in premature infants < or =32 weeks of gestation between 4.4 and 18%, in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia between 7.3 and 42%, and in infants with congenital heart disease between 1.6 and 9.8%. The main risk factors are: prematurity, chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease and age less than 3-6 months at onset of the epidemic. Other factors are: older siblings or day care attendance, male gender, exposure to smoking, breastfeeding for less than 1-2 months and variables associated with lower socioeconomic status. Respiratory syncytial virus is the dominant etiological agent, constituting just over half the cases (median 56%; interval 27% to 73%). Other viruses implicated, in descending order of frequency, are rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza, enterovirus and bocavirus. In studies with genomic detection techniques, between 20 and 25% of cases the virus involved is not identified and between 9% and 27% of cases have viral co-infection. Although respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis shows more wheezing and retractions, longer duration of respiratory symptoms and oxygen therapy and are associated with lower use of antibiotics. This pattern is associated with the younger age of the patients and does not help us to predict the etiology. In general, the etiological identification is not useful for the management of patients. However, in young infants (<3 months) with febrile bronchiolitis in the hospital environment, conservative management may help these patients and avoid diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) participates in diverse biological processes, including cell migration, angiogenesis, and inflammation. The effect of SEMA3A on hyperoxic lung injury of neonatal rats with BPD was investigated in this study., METHODS: Neonatal rats with BPD were established through hyperoxia treatment. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to evaluate histopathological analysis in lung tissues. SEMA3A expression was assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assay. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated over-expression of SEMA3A (AAV-SEMA3A) was administrated into hyperoxia-induced rats, and apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were investigated by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA)., RESULTS: Hyperoxia-induced histopathological changes in lung tissue reduced alveolar number and enhanced alveolar interval and alveolar volume. SEMA3A was downregulated in lung tissue of hyperoxia-induced rats. AAV-SEMA3A injection attenuated hyperoxia-induced cell apoptosis in lung tissues by increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the enhanced levels of Interleukin (IL)-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in hyperoxia-induced rats were restored by AAV-SEMA3A injection by the downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) phosphorylation. AAV-SEMA3A injection also ameliorated histopathological changes in lung tissues of hyperoxia-induced rats by increasing the number of radial alveolar count and decreasing the volume of mean linear intercept. Besides, the protein expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation were reduced in hyperoxia-induced rats post-AAV-SEMA3A injection., CONCLUSION: Ectopical expression of SEMA3A suppressed hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and inflammation in neonatal rats, and ameliorated the histopathological changes through inactivation of ERK/JNK pathway.","group":"g3","id":"7f102d5a-48c4-4218-8204-b354c21a631b","_showDetails":true},"4ccc89dc-4b52-4dd5-9a14-e1c14e8c4ec8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Pulmonary effects of keratinocyte growth factor in newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00136.2009","authors":["Franco-Montoya, Marie-Laure","Bourbon, Jacques R","Durrmeyer, Xavier","Lorotte, Stephanie","Jarreau, Pierre-Henri","Delacourt, Christophe"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20090821//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis/de [Drug Effects]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cy [Cytology]","CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/ge [Genetics]","CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/me [Metabolism]","Cell Adhesion Molecules/ge [Genetics]","Cell Adhesion Molecules/me [Metabolism]","Cell Proliferation/de [Drug Effects]","DNA/me [Metabolism]","ErbB Receptors/ge [Genetics]","ErbB Receptors/me [Metabolism]","Female","*Fibroblast Growth Factor 7/pd [Pharmacology]","Gene Expression Regulation/de [Drug Effects]","Humans","*Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Lung/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","Phospholipids/me [Metabolism]","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein B/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Survival Analysis","Transforming Growth Factor alpha/ge [Genetics]","Transforming Growth Factor alpha/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

High levels of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a cell-cell mediator with pleiotrophic lung effects, are associated with low BPD risk. KGF decreases mortality in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rodents, a classic model of injury-induced impaired alveolarization, although the pulmonary mechanisms of this protection are poorly defined. These were explored through in vitro and in vivo approaches in the rat. Hyperoxia decreased by 30% the rate of wound closure of a monolayer of fetal alveolar epithelial cells, due to cell death, which was overcome by recombinant human KGF (100 ng/ml). In rat pups exposed to >95% O2 from birth, increased viability induced by intraperitoneal injection of KGF (2 microg/g body wt) every other day was associated with prevention of neutrophil influx in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), prevention of decreases in whole lung DNA content and cell proliferation rate, partial prevention of apoptosis increase, and a markedly increased proportion of surfactant protein B-immunoreactive cells in lung parenchyma. Increased lung antioxidant capacity is likely to be due in part to enhanced CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha expression. By contrast, KGF neither corrected changes induced by hyperoxia in parameters of lung morphometry that clearly indicated impaired alveolarization nor had any significant effect on tissue or BAL surfactant phospholipids. These findings evidence KGF alveolar epithelial cell protection, enhancing effects on alveolar repair capacity, and anti-inflammatory effects in the injured neonatal lung that may account, at least in part, for its ability to reduce mortality. They argue in favor of a therapeutic potential of KGF in the injured neonatal lung.","group":"g3","id":"4ccc89dc-4b52-4dd5-9a14-e1c14e8c4ec8","_showDetails":true},"c600deb1-bfb0-47c6-b008-6c74733075c0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Nitric oxide attenuates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in alveolar epithelial cells.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00475.2006","authors":["Vyas-Read, Shilpa","Shaul, Philip W","Yuhanna, Ivan S","Willis, Brigham C"],"date":"2007//","accessDate":"20070511//","keywords":["Actins/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Apoptosis/de [Drug Effects]","Biomarkers/me [Metabolism]","Collagen/bi [Biosynthesis]","*Epithelial Cells/cy [Cytology]","*Epithelial Cells/de [Drug Effects]","Epithelial Cells/en [Enzymology]","Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/de [Drug Effects]","Isoenzymes/ge [Genetics]","Isoenzymes/me [Metabolism]","Male","*Mesoderm/cy [Cytology]","*Mesoderm/de [Drug Effects]","*Nitric Oxide/pd [Pharmacology]","Nitric Oxide Synthase/ge [Genetics]","Nitric Oxide Synthase/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/cy [Cytology]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/en [Enzymology]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Stress Fibers/de [Drug Effects]","Stress Fibers/me [Metabolism]","Transforming Growth Factor beta1/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) to myofibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) attenuates ECM accumulation, enhances lung growth, and decreases alveolar myofibroblast number in experimental models. We therefore hypothesized that NO attenuates TGF-beta1-induced EMT in cultured AEC. Studies of the capacity for endogenous NO production in AEC revealed that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are expressed and active in AEC. Total NOS activity was 1.3 pmol x mg protein(-1) x min(-1) with 67% derived from eNOS. TGF-beta1 (50 pM) suppressed eNOS expression by more than 60% and activity by 83% but did not affect iNOS expression or activity. Inhibition of endogenous NOS with l-NAME led to spontaneous EMT, manifested by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and a fibroblast-like morphology. Provision of exogenous NO to TGF-beta1-treated AEC decreased stress fiber-associated alpha-SMA expression and decreased collagen I expression by 80%. NO-treated AEC also retained an epithelial morphology and expressed increased lamellar protein, E-cadherin, and pro-surfactant protein B compared with those treated with TGF-beta alone. These findings indicate that NO serves a critical role in preserving an epithelial phenotype and in attenuating EMT in AEC. NO-mediated regulation of AEC fate may have important implications in the pathophysiology and treatment of diseases such as IPF and BPD.","group":"g1","id":"c600deb1-bfb0-47c6-b008-6c74733075c0","_showDetails":true},"80daa429-3fca-438e-8153-c8dc5874b01b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Developmental differences in the responses of IL-6 and IL-13 transgenic mice exposed to hyperoxia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00434.2006","authors":["Choo-Wing, Rayman","Nedrelow, Jonathan H","Homer, Robert J","Elias, Jack A","Bhandari, Vineet"],"date":"2007//","accessDate":"20070330//","keywords":["Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/me [Metabolism]","Angiopoietin-2/ge [Genetics]","Angiopoietin-2/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/ge [Genetics]","Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Caspase 3/me [Metabolism]","DNA/me [Metabolism]","Gene Expression Regulation","Humans","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Infant, Newborn","*Interleukin-13/me [Metabolism]","*Interleukin-6/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/en [Enzymology]","Survival Analysis"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Furthermore, tracheal aspirate levels of IL-6 were significantly increased in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome who had an adverse outcome (bronchopulmonary dysplasia/death). In contrast to the protective effects in adults, there was no survival advantage to the NB IL-13 mice in hyperoxia.

We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of prolonged iNO therapy by studying survival, histopathology, fibrin deposition, and differential mRNA expression (real-time RT-PCR) of key genes involved in the development of BPD. iNO therapy prolonged median survival 1.5 days (P = 0.0003), reduced fibrin deposition in a dosage-dependent way up to 4.3-fold (P < 0.001), improved alveolar development by reducing septal thickness, and reduced the influx of leukocytes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hyperoxia on apoptosis and apoptotic gene expression in alveolar epithelial cells. Apoptosis was studied by TUNEL, electron microscopy, DNA size analysis, and caspase assays. Fas/FasL expression was determined by Western blot analysis and RPA. We determined that in MLE-12 cells exposed to hyperoxia, caspase-mediated apoptosis was the first morphologically and biochemically recognizable mode of cell death, followed by necrosis of residual adherent cells. The apoptotic stage was associated with a threefold upregulation of Fas mRNA and protein expression and increased susceptibility to direct Fas receptor activation, concomitant with a threefold increase of FasL protein levels. Fas gene silencing by siRNAs significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. In murine fetal type II cells, hyperoxia similarly induced markedly increased Fas/FasL protein expression, confirming validity of results obtained in transformed MLE-12 cells.

Animal-derived surfactants contain variable amounts of surfactant apoproteins, whereas the older-generation synthetic products contain only phospholipids and lack surfactant proteins (SPs). Both decrease morbidity and mortality rates associated with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) among preterm infants, compared with placebo. However, excess mortality rates have been observed with non-protein-containing synthetic surfactants, compared with the animal-derived products. Evidence suggests that synthetic surfactants consisting solely of phospholipids can be improved with the addition of peptides that are functional analogs of SPs. Lucinactant is a new synthetic peptide-containing surfactant that contains sinapultide, a novel, 21-amino acid peptide (leucine and lysine repeating units, KL4 peptide) designed to mimic human SP-B. It is completely devoid of animal-derived components., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the outcomes for premature infants treated with lucinactant and poractant alfa would be similar. Therefore, we compared lucinactant (Surfaxin; Discovery Laboratories, Doylestown, PA) with porcine-derived, poractant alfa (Curosurf; Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy) in a trial to test for noninferiority., METHODS: A total of 252 infants born between 24 and 28 weeks of completed gestation, with birth weights between 600 and 1250 g, were assigned randomly in a multicenter, multinational, noninferiority, randomized, controlled study to receive either lucinactant (n = 124) or poractant alfa (n = 128) within 30 minutes of life. The primary outcome was the incidence of being alive without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) through 28 days of age. Key secondary outcomes included death at day 28 and 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), air leaks, neuroimaging abnormalities, and other complications related to either prematurity or RDS. An independent, international, data and safety monitoring committee monitored the trial., RESULTS: The treatment difference between lucinactant and poractant alfa for survival without BPD through 28 days was 4.75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.3% to 16.8%) in favor of lucinactant, with the lower boundary of the 95% CI for the difference, ie, -7.3%, being greater than the prespecified noninferiority margin of -14.5%. At 28 days, 45 of 119 infants given lucinactant were alive without BPD (37.8%; 95% CI: 29.1-46.5%), compared with 41 of 124 given poractant alfa (33.1%; 95% CI: 24.8-41.3%); at 36 weeks PMA, the rates were 64.7% and 66.9%, respectively. The corresponding mortality rate through day 28 for the lucinactant group was lower than that for the poractant alfa group (11.8% [95% CI: 6.0-17.6%] vs 16.1% [95% CI: 9.7-22.6%]), as was the rate at 36 weeks PMA (16% and 18.5%, respectively). There were no differences in major dosing complications. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the incidences of common complications of prematurity, including intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 3 and 4) and cystic periventricular leukomalacia (lucinactant: 14.3%; poractant alfa: 16.9%)., CONCLUSIONS: Lucinactant and poractant alfa were similar in terms of efficacy and safety when used for the prevention and treatment of RDS among preterm infants. The ability to enhance the performance of a synthetic surfactant with the addition of a peptide that mimics the action of SP-B, such as sinapultide, brings potential advantages to exogenous surfactant therapy.","group":"g4","id":"febccaaf-6897-4f98-91e1-55bff7956ada","_showDetails":true},"dc8dbdcc-ffaa-45cb-9d4c-d1baedecf174":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"The safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-inflammatory effects of intratracheal recombinant human Clara cell protein in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/01.PDR.0000156371.89952.35","authors":["Levine, Carolyn R","Gewolb, Ira H","Allen, Kristen","Welch, Richard W","Melby, James M","Pollack, Simcha","Shaffer, Thomas","Pilon, Aprile L","Davis, Jonathan M"],"date":"2005//","accessDate":"20050317//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["*Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","*Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pd [Pharmacology]","Birth Weight","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Cohort Studies","Double-Blind Method","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Infant, Premature, Diseases/dt [Drug Therapy]","Inflammation","*Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung Injury","Male","Oxygen/me [Metabolism]","Placebos/me [Metabolism]","Random Allocation","*Recombinant Proteins/ch [Chemistry]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/th [Therapy]","Safety","Time Factors","*Trachea/de [Drug Effects]","Treatment Outcome","*Uteroglobin/ch [Chemistry]","*Uteroglobin/pk [Pharmacokinetics]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"58","number":"1","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=15774846"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Clara cell 10-kD protein (CC10) is a potent anti-inflammatory protein that is normally abundant in the respiratory tract.

The brain network changes that antecede the early development of CP in infants are not well characterized, and a better understanding may suggest new strategies for risk-stratification at term, which could lead to earlier access to therapies. Graph theoretical methods applied to diffusion MRI-derived brain connectomes may help quantify the organization and information transfer capacity of the preterm brain with greater nuance than overt structural or regional microstructural changes. Our aim was to shed light on the pathophysiology of early CP development, before the occurrence of early intervention therapies and other environmental confounders, to help identify the best early biomarkers of CP risk in VPT infants. In a cohort of 395 very preterm infants, we extracted cortical morphometrics and brain volumes from structural MRI and also applied graph theoretical methods to diffusion MRI connectomes, both acquired at term-equivalent age. Metrics from graph network analysis, especially global efficiency, strength values of the major sensorimotor tracts, and local efficiency of the motor nodes and novel non-motor regions were strongly inversely related to early CP diagnosis. These measures remained significantly associated with CP after correction for common risk factors of motor development, suggesting that metrics of brain network efficiency at term may be sensitive biomarkers for early CP detection. We demonstrate for the first time that in VPT infants, early CP diagnosis is anteceded by decreased brain network segregation in numerous nodes, including motor regions commonly-associated with CP and also novel regions that may partially explain the high rate of cognitive impairments concomitant with CP diagnosis. These advanced MRI biomarkers may help identify the highest risk infants by term-equivalent age, facilitating earlier interventions that are informed by early pathophysiological changes.

The incidence of ORD is reduced following antenatal treatment with betamethasone. Oxidant-mediated injury is characterized at the cellular level by peroxidation of lipid membranes. This results in the generation of malondialdehyde (MDA), which can be quantified indirectly by measurement of thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS). There is currently no effective way to quantify the risk for ORD. In this study, we analyzed the correlation of early urinary MDA and TBARS with prenatal betamethasone administration and with the development of ORD., METHODS: Preterm infants (<30 weeks gestation, n = 25) born at St. Peter's University Hospital were enrolled. Urine samples were collected during the first 10 days of life and stored at -70 degrees C for 0-21 days. TBARS were quantified by spectrophotometric assay, and malondialdehyde levels measured by HPLC. Subjects were screened for the subsequent development of ORD. Betamethasone administration was defined as one or more doses > or =24 h prior to delivery., RESULTS: Urinary MDA levels increased on days 2-3 and 5-10 relative to day 1 from birth. Maximal urinary MDA concentrations were significantly higher in the ORD group compared to controls, and there was a trend toward increased urinary TBARS in the presence of ORD. Infants receiving prenatal betamethasone demonstrated higher maximal urinary TBARS values during the first 10 days of life than control infants. The length of sample storage from 0 to 3 weeks at -70 degrees C did not significantly affect TBARS measurements., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated urinary MDA measurements in the first 10 days are correlated with the risk for ORD. Urinary TBARS concentrations, which are correlated with MDA measurements, can be quantified rapidly and are stable for short-term storage. Our findings suggest that urinary TBARS may be adaptable as a practical tool for assessing the risk for ORD in neonatal intensive care unit patients, allowing clinicians to optimize the use of preventive strategies. Antenatal betamethasone is associated with increased urinary TBARS in the first 10 days of life, indicating that the protective effects of corticosteroids are not mediated through reductions in oxidant-mediated lipid peroxidation.

Some of these products additionally act as autocrine growth factors. Increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells have been observed in several smoking-associated pediatric lung disorders such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, sudden infant death syndrome, and asthma. Disturbed pulmonary neuroendocrine function has been implicated in the etiology of this disease complex. One of the most common smoking-associated lung cancer types, small cell lung carcinoma, expresses phenotypic and functional features of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. We, as well as others, have shown that the release of the autocrine growth factors 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and mammalian bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide (MB/GRP) by cell lines derived from human small cell lung carcinoma or fetal hamster pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are regulated by a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor comprised of alpha(7) subunits. In radio-receptor assays, nicotine and the nicotine-derived carcinogenic nitrosamines NNNN. Binding of nicotine or NNK to the alpha(7) receptor resulted in calcium influx and overexpression and activation of the serine-threonine protein kinase Raf-1. In turn, this event lead to overexpression and activation of the mitogen activated (MAP) kinases extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and stimulation of DNA synthesis accompanied by an increase in cell numbers in fetal pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and small cell carcinoma cells. Exposure of fetal pulmonary neuroendocrine cells for 6 days to NNK caused a prominant up-regulation of Raf-1. Our findings suggest that chronic exposure to nicotine and NNK in pregnant women who smoke may up-regulate the alpha(7) nicotinic receptor as well as components of its associated mitogenic signal transduction pathway, thus increasing the susceptibilities of the infants for the development of pediatric lung disorders. Similarly, up-regulation of one or several components of this nicotinic receptor pathway in smokers may be an important factor for the development of small cell lung carcinoma.","group":"g1","id":"f4dabb1d-aa2d-42d5-af8e-5100585fb93a","_showDetails":true},"b281ee95-db5a-42c2-b9be-d01cf3b4c299":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Oxygen-induced metabolic changes and transdifferentiation in immature fetal rat lung lipofibroblasts.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1096-7192(02)00140-3","authors":["Boros, Laszlo G","Torday, John S","Paul Lee, Wai-Nang","Rehan, Virender K"],"date":"2002//","keywords":["Animals","*Cell Differentiation/ph [Physiology]","*Fetus/me [Metabolism]","Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","Glucose/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Lung/em [Embryology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Membrane Proteins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Membrane Proteins/ge [Genetics]","*Oxygen/me [Metabolism]","Perilipin-2","RNA/me [Metabolism]","Rats"],"journal":"Molecular genetics and metabolism","volume":"77","number":"3","isbn":"1096-7192","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=12409271"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Preterm infants lack adequate surfactant production and often require oxygen support for adequate oxygenation. Prolonged oxygen treatment leads to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease process characterized by the blunting of alveolarization and proliferation of myofibroblasts. In the present study, we investigated metabolic adaptive changes in cultured fibroblasts isolated from immature (d18) and near-term (d21), fetal rat lungs in response to normoxic (21%) and hyperoxic (95%) exposures. We used the [1,2-13C2]D-glucose tracer and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to characterize glucose carbon redistribution between the nucleic acid ribose, lactate, and palmitate synthetic pathways, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to assess adipose differentiation related protein (ADRP) mRNA expression in response to hyperoxic exposure. Exposure to hyperoxia at each passage caused decrease (*, p<0.05 vs. 21% O2) in ADRP mRNA expression in the d18 fibroblasts. This passage-dependent transdifferentiation is accompanied by a moderate (9-20%) increase in the synthesis of nucleic acid ribose from glucose through the non-oxidative steps of the pentose cycle. In contrast, d18 fibroblasts showed over an 85% decrease in the de novo synthesis of palmitate from glucose, while d21 fibroblasts showed a less pronounced 32-38% decrease in de novo lipid synthesis in hyperoxia-exposed cultures. It can be concluded from these studies that: (1) there is a maturation dependent sensitivity to hyperoxia; (2) transdifferentiation of flbroblast as demonstrated by changes in ADRP expression is accompanied by metabolic enzymes changes affecting ribose acid synthesis from glucose, and (3) hyperoxia specifically inhibits lipogenesis from glucose. Hyperoxia-induced metabolic changes thus play a key role in the transdifferentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and the pathogenesis of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"b281ee95-db5a-42c2-b9be-d01cf3b4c299","_showDetails":true},"7bde2f4f-156b-44c3-a7c7-c340d21d0449":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by curcumin in hyaline membrane disease (HMD).","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0024-3205(01)01398-4","authors":["Literat, A","Su, F","Norwicki, M","Durand, M","Ramanathan, R","Jones, C A","Minoo, P","Kwong, K Y"],"date":"2001//","keywords":["Adult","*Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pd [Pharmacology]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cy [Cytology]","Coculture Techniques","*Curcumin/pd [Pharmacology]","Cytokines/an [Analysis]","*Cytokines/bi [Biosynthesis]","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Humans","*Hyaline Membrane Disease/im [Immunology]","Infant, Newborn","*Inflammation/im [Immunology]","Lipopolysaccharides/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"Life sciences","volume":"70","number":"3","isbn":"0024-3205","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=12005259"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"Persistent expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease (CLD) in premature infants. Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the lungs of preterm newborns may result in the attenuation of CLD. Curcumin is a naturally occurring phenolic compound derived from the food spice tumeric with broad based in vitro anti-inflammatory properties. In this study lung inflammatory cells from preterm newborns at risk for the development of CLD were derived via modified broncho-alveolar lavage and stimulated ex vivo with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 ng/ml). Curcumin was added to these cultures at 0, 0.5 and 20 uM concentrations. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-8 protein was measured from the culture supernatants 12 hours post culture. For control, adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured under the same conditions. Both neonatal lung inflammatory cells and adult PBMC produced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. Curcumin produced significant inhibition of IL-1beta and IL-8 but minimal inhibition of TNFalpha expression by preterm lung inflammatory cells at 20 uM concentrations. Adult PBMC expression of IL-8 was significantly inhibited by curcumin at 20 uM concentrations. Therefore, curcumin inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-8) by lung inflammatory cells ex vivo. Pathways involved with curcumin regulation of these cytokines are developmentally intact and functional in premature infants. Curcumin may be effective as a therapeutic agent in the attenuation of CLD.","group":"g1","id":"7bde2f4f-156b-44c3-a7c7-c340d21d0449","_showDetails":true},"30e37266-eef6-45fa-b3e6-4fbb3d3d783c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Home oxygen therapy in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: assessment of parental anxiety.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0378-3782(01)00190-6","authors":["Zanardo, V","Freato, F"],"date":"2001//","keywords":["*Anxiety/px [Psychology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","Female","Gestational Age","Home Care Services","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","*Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","Parent-Child Relations","*Parents/px [Psychology]","Prospective Studies","Surveys and Questionnaires"],"journal":"Early human development","volume":"65","number":"1","isbn":"0378-3782","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11520627"],"address":"Ireland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: It is conceivable that a complicated recovery course in a high-risk premature infant managed at home generates apprehension and anxiety in parents., AIMS: We attempted to define the evolution of anxiety levels in a population of parents of low-birth-weight premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia enrolled in a prospective home O(2) therapy program., STUDY DESIGN: In the immediate pre-discharge [mean postnatal age 95 (45-158) days], a questionnaire (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y) was given to all parents of the premature infants [mean birth weight 1106 (0.610-1.770) kg; mean gestational age 27.1 (24-31) weeks] present for the discharge. Subsequently, the parents were assessed twice, initially after a week from the discharge of their infants and then at the end of the oxygen therapy phase [mean postnatal age 185 (60-361) days]. They included 10 mothers and 10 fathers, aged 33.5+/-0.5 and 37+/-0.2 years, respectively., RESULTS: Our results indicate that these parents present an increased state anxiety level upon hospital discharge of their oxygen-dependent premature infants, which decreases as the improvement of respiratory status and the cessation of oxygen-dependency become evident [mean+/-S.D. related to age (T) maternal values 47.1+/-7.0, 41.8+/-5.6, 39.1+/-4.7, respectively; mean+/-S.D. related to age (T) paternal values 42.2+/-8.5, 41.1+/-8.1, 40.5+/-8.2, respectively]. When assessed separately by parental gender, in the maternal group, state anxiety decreased significantly (ANOVA, p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that although neonatologists generally define the discharge of prematures with chronic lung disease based upon the acquired stabilization of vital parameters, in the oxygen-dependent group, they should also pay special attention to the emotional support of the parents who we have identified as being at increased risk for pre-discharge anxiety.","group":"g1","id":"30e37266-eef6-45fa-b3e6-4fbb3d3d783c","_showDetails":true},"7eb5ad2f-5c47-4a7c-80ec-d61011b998f0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Persistent atelectasis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","authors":["Peroni, D G","Boner, A L"],"date":"2000//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchoscopy","*Deoxyribonuclease I/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Diagnosis, Differential","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Male","Pulmonary Atelectasis/di [Diagnosis]","*Pulmonary Atelectasis/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Pulmonary Atelectasis/et [Etiology]","*Recombinant Proteins/tu [Therapeutic Use]"],"journal":"Paediatric respiratory reviews","volume":"1","number":"3","isbn":"1526-0542","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=15326731"],"address":"England","group":"g1","id":"7eb5ad2f-5c47-4a7c-80ec-d61011b998f0","_showDetails":true},"618496f5-adc3-4ed8-ad05-a015b2fbba86":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Dornase alfa in premature infants with severe respiratory distress and early bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jp.7200456","authors":["Reiter, P D","Townsend, S F","Velasquez, R"],"date":"2000//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Deoxyribonuclease I/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Expectorants/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/dt [Drug Therapy]","Male","*Recombinant Proteins/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/dt [Drug Therapy]","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association","volume":"20","number":"8 Pt 1","isbn":"0743-8346","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11190594"],"address":"United States","group":"g1","id":"618496f5-adc3-4ed8-ad05-a015b2fbba86","_showDetails":true},"2eb86e2d-9682-49f4-8d38-75fe97691965":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Bombesin-like peptide and receptors in lung injury models: diverse gene expression, similar function.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0196-9781(00)00294-1","authors":["Cullen, A","Emanuel, R L","Torday, J S","Asokananthan, N","Sikorski, K A","Sunday, M E"],"date":"2000//","keywords":["Animals","Bombesin/me [Metabolism]","Bombesin/pd [Pharmacology]","Dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","*Gastrin-Releasing Peptide/bi [Biosynthesis]","*Gastrin-Releasing Peptide/ph [Physiology]","Gene Expression","In Situ Hybridization","Lung/em [Embryology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Organ Culture Techniques","Oxygen/me [Metabolism]","*Papio/me [Metabolism]","Phosphatidylcholines/pd [Pharmacology]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Receptors, Bombesin/me [Metabolism]","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Time Factors","*Up-Regulation"],"journal":"Peptides","volume":"21","number":"11","isbn":"0196-9781","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11090916"],"address":"United States","abstract":"We previously demonstrated that bombesin-like peptide (BLP) mediates lung injury in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

A large, prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted to evaluate early nutritional support during the first week of life for preterm infants with a gestational age < 32 weeks and to verify nutritional risk factors related to BPD development., METHODS: A prospective multicenter cohort study of very preterm infants was conducted in 40 tertiary neonatal intensive care units across mainland China between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Preterm infants who were born at a gestational age < 32 weeks, < 72 h after birth and had a respiratory score > 4 were enrolled. Antenatal and postnatal information focusing on nutritional parameters was collected through medical systems. Statistical analyses were also performed to identify BPD risk factors., RESULTS: The primary outcomes were BPD and severity at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. A total of 1410 preterm infants were enrolled in this study. After applying the exclusion criteria, the remaining 1286 infants were included in this analysis; 614 (47.7%) infants were in the BPD group, and 672 (52.3%) were in the non-BPD group. In multivariate logistic regression model, the following six factors were identified of BPD: birth weight (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-0.99; p = 0.039), day of full enteral nutrition (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04; p < 0.001), parenteral protein > 3.5 g/kg/d during the first week (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25-2.17; p < 0.001), feeding type (formula: OR 3.48, 95% CI 2.21-5.49; p < 0.001, mixed feed: OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.36-2.70; p < 0.001; breast milk as reference), hsPDA (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.44-2.73; p < 0.001), and EUGR ats 36 weeks (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.91; p = 0.035)., CONCLUSIONS: A longer duration to achieve full enteral nutrition in very preterm infants was associated with increased BPD development. Breastfeeding was demonstrated to have a protective effect against BPD. Early and rapidly progressive enteral nutrition and breastfeeding should be promoted in very preterm infants., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR2000030125 on 24/02/2020) and in www.ncrcch.org (No. ISRCTN84167642 on 25/02/2020).

The exact prevalence and associations with perinatal risk factors are unknown. Minimal research has been performed in pre-school aged children, compared to school age. The primary aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of parent-reported behavioural and emotional problems at the age of two in children born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age and/or birth weight less than 1000 g. The secondary aim was to determine whether perinatal factors were associated with the behavioural and emotional outcome. Perinatal characteristics of 144 preterm-born children from the NeoLiFeS cohort were collected retrospectively. Of these children, 101 parents filled out a Childs Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) at the corrected age of two. The results of the CBCL tests were presented as Z-scores, a Z-score of 0 indicating the mean of behavioural scores in the norm population. A Z-score higher than zero indicates less behavioural problems than average, a negative Z-score indicates more problems. Associations between perinatal risk factors and CBCL-scores were analysed using linear regression analyses. Prevalences of clinically relevant CBCL scores were low, 4%, 2% and 5% for total score, internalizing score or externalizing score, respectively. Being part of a twin was associated with higher internalizing Z-scores, indicating less problems in emotional behaviour. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was associated with lower Z-scores in total and externalizing behaviour. In conclusion, in our cohort generally very few problems in behavioural and emotional outcome were reported at the age of two. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Although a gradual postmortem degradation should be taken into consideration, topological relationship of serum level seemed to be fairly stable (arterial> or =venous blood in most cases), indicating no evident influence of postmortem diffusion. Significant elevation of serum SP-A (76.7-250 ng/ml in left heart blood) was observed in hyaline membrane diseases from various causes independent of the postmortem intervals (<30 h). However, mean SP-A levels in postmortem heart blood were usually low in asphyxia including hanging, strangulation and choking (left, 25.5 ng/ml; right, 22.3 ng/ml), polytrauma (left, 13.1 ng/ml; right, 9.0 ng/ml) and stab wound to the neck (left, 34.1 ng/ml; right, 29.4 ng/ml).

RSV vaccines may be problematic in very young infants and newborns because of the relatively poor immunogenicity of most vaccine candidates to date. Passive immunization with human polyclonal intravenous immune globulin and humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the conserved fusion protein of RSV prevents severe RSV disease, although not necessarily viral infection. The humanized RSV monoclonal antibody is licensed for use in premature infants and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and is being evaluated in infants with cardiac disease. Another innovative approach to prevent RSV disease in young infants is maternal immunization with a vaccine such as the purified fusion protein vaccine. Such a vaccine could stimulate antibody response to RSV surface glycoproteins and potentially prevent RSV disease in the mother, while maternal antibodies produced could be passively transmitted across the placenta to the infant.

Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD., STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life., RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates., CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.","group":"g1","id":"bcbb2bdf-9ba4-4fe9-9874-e453b2f68aab","_showDetails":true},"28061159-71d4-4b99-b463-fd5bc1ed5cc5":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Immunogold EM localization of neurochemicals in human pulmonary neuroendocrine cells.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19970401)37:1<77::AID-JEMT8>3.0.CO;2-T","authors":["Stahlman, M T","Gray, M E"],"date":"1997//","keywords":["Bombesin/an [Analysis]","Calcitonin/an [Analysis]","Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide/an [Analysis]","Humans","Immunohistochemistry","Infant, Newborn","Lung/ch [Chemistry]","*Lung/cy [Cytology]","Microscopy, Immunoelectron","Neurosecretory Systems/ch [Chemistry]","*Neurosecretory Systems/cy [Cytology]"],"journal":"Microscopy research and technique","volume":"37","number":"1","isbn":"1059-910X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=9144624"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Antibodies against the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell peptides gastrin-releasing peptide (bombesin), calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have been labeled with colloidal gold spheres for immunocytochemical localization in human fetal and newborn lung tissue. In general, the presence and amount of immunolabeling increased with increasing gestational age, with only calcitonin appearing late in fetal life. The largest percentage of neuroepithelial body (NEB) cells labeled and the largest number of labeled dense core vesicles (DCV) were in infants with chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Serial ribbons allowed identification of more than one peptide in a single NEB cell. The use of two antibodies labeled with colloidal gold spheres of different sizes allowed the identification of two peptides in the same DCV. Quantification of relative amounts of labeled peptides was not possible, as the peptide labeling with the larger size gold sphere was consistently underestimated. Colocalization to the same DCV has been shown in humans for bombesin and calcitonin, calcitonin and CGRP, bombesin and CGRP and, by others for cholecystokinin (CCK) and serotonin. Colocalization of two or more peptides or an amine to a single DCV within the same cell implies simultaneous discharge by exocytosis. The action of the two (or more) substances might be in concert, perhaps with one acting in a paracrine fashion, and the second in an autocrine fashion. In this case, the second peptide or amine might have a regulatory function in the parent cell, influencing DCV storage or rate of release.","group":"g1","id":"28061159-71d4-4b99-b463-fd5bc1ed5cc5","_showDetails":true},"c0875e38-a799-4d7a-9164-12bb9fccbf95":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Biochemical, clinical, and morphologic studies on lungs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0496(199610)22:4<215::AID-PPUL1>3.0.CO;2-L","authors":["Cherukupalli, K","Larson, J E","Rotschild, A","Thurlbeck, W M"],"date":"1996//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/cl [Classification]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Case-Control Studies","Collagen/an [Analysis]","DNA/an [Analysis]","Desmosine/an [Analysis]","Humans","Hyaline Membrane Disease/me [Metabolism]","Hyaline Membrane Disease/pa [Pathology]","Hydroxyproline/an [Analysis]","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Lung/ch [Chemistry]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"22","number":"4","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=8905882"],"address":"United States","abstract":"We correlated clinical, biochemical, and morphologic findings in the lungs of 48 infants dying of either bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) to obtain a better idea of the disease process.

Nineteen of the 37 patients had tracheostomies because of chronic respiratory failure. We hypothesized that recurrent infections were most prevalent in infants whose IgG levels remained low at one year of age (persistent HG) and in infants receiving high doses of corticosteroids during the first year of life. We further hypothesized that the duration of HG was strongly correlated with the cumulative first year steroid dose. We also studied the response to intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy in this population of BPD infants. Our results showed an association between first year corticosteroid dose, duration of HG (r = 0.49, p < 0.003), and frequency of infections (r = 0.51, p < 0.001). We noted a relatively strong correlation between frequency of infections and duration of HG (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001). Twenty-four of 37 (65%) infants showed persistent HG and 49% had evidence of abnormal specific antibody production. Sixty-four percent of infants studied had reduced lymphocyte responsiveness to mitogen stimulation. Nineteen of 37 (51%) infants required IVIG for an average duration of 17.9 months due to recurrent infections. The average number of infections per year decreased from 10.6 to 2.8 (t = 12.32, p < 0.0001). There were no complications associated with IVIG therapy, but one infant died of bronchiolitis obliterans following heart-lung transplantation. Eight of 37 (22%) infants have persistent immunologic dysfunction requiring ongoing IVIG at four years or more of follow-up. We conclude that a substantial number of ill infants with BPD will have immune dysfunction characterized by persistently low IgG levels and reduced specific antibody responsiveness to protein antigens. We speculate that these findings are related to the cumulative dose of corticosteroids received in the first year of life and to the severity of underlying disease.","group":"g1","id":"3e5ec1e3-382a-4a57-835b-4d210166c93c","_showDetails":true},"f6903184-47b2-46e1-9cb6-39b838293f6b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Undetectable interleukin (IL)-10 and persistent IL-8 expression early in hyaline membrane disease: a possible developmental basis for the predisposition to chronic lung inflammation in preterm newborns.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/00006450-199606000-00007","authors":["Jones, C A","Cayabyab, R G","Kwong, K Y","Stotts, C","Wong, B","Hamdan, H","Minoo, P","deLemos, R A"],"date":"1996//","keywords":["Bronchoalveolar Lavage","Cytokines/ge [Genetics]","*Cytokines/im [Immunology]","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Humans","*Hyaline Membrane Disease/im [Immunology]","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Inflammation","Interleukin-1/ge [Genetics]","Interleukin-1/im [Immunology]","Interleukin-10/ge [Genetics]","Interleukin-10/im [Immunology]","Interleukin-2/ge [Genetics]","Interleukin-2/im [Immunology]","Interleukin-8/ge [Genetics]","Interleukin-8/im [Immunology]","*Lung/im [Immunology]","Polymerase Chain Reaction","RNA, Messenger","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/ge [Genetics]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/im [Immunology]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"39","number":"6","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=8725256"],"address":"United States","abstract":"We are interested in determining whether premature birth alters expression of counterregulatory cytokines which modulate lung inflammation.

We compared the expression of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines at the mRNA and protein level in the lungs of preterm and term newborns with acute respiratory failure from hyaline membrane disease or meconium aspiration syndrome. Four sequential bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained during the first 96 h of life from all patients. All patients rapidly developed an influx of neutrophils and macrophages.

We aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of Apocynin (Apo) on rat pups exposed to hyperoxia and inflammation. Forty-eight rat pups were randomly divided into 3 groups as hyperoxia (95% O2) + lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hyperoxia + LPS + Apo treated and control (21% O2). Rat pups in the Apo group received Apo at a daily dose of 40 mg/kg. Histopathological (Hematoxylin-Eosin, Masson trichrome), immunochemical (surfactant B and C protein staining) evaluations and biochemical studies incluiding, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), OSI (oxidant stress index), AOPP (advanced protein degradation product), Lipid hydroperoxide (LPO), 8-OHdG, NADPH oxidase activity (NOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-18, IL-6, caspase-1 and 3, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFR2), Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) activities were studied. After Apo treatment, AOPP, LPO, 8-OHdG, NOX, TOS, OSI levels decreased; SOD, CAT, GSH and TAS levels increased (P < 0.05). Apo reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines with reduction in NLRP3 inflammasome in addition to increased Nrf2 levels. Moreover, caspase-1 and 3 levels decreased with Apo (P < 0.05). Apo was found to provide preventive and therapeutic effects by reducing oxidant stress, blocking inflammation and increasing antioxidant status. Beyond anti-oxidative effects, Apo also have anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inducing Nrf2 as well. Therefore, Apo might be a potential option in the treatment of BPD. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Serum also was collected within 72 hours of birth, and placentas were examined for signs of inflammation., RESULTS: The mean PMN elastase-alpha 1-PI was significantly elevated (21.8 micrograms/mg albumin) in infants with a pulmonary emphysema syndrome like that designated by Wilson-Mikity compared either with those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (1.5 micrograms/mg albumin, P < .01) or those with respiratory distress syndrome in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia did not develop (2.3 micrograms/mg albumin, P < .01). Infants with pulmonary emphysema had a significantly elevated mean serum IgM and a high incidence of chorioamnionitis., CONCLUSIONS: The level of PMN elastase-alpha 1-PI was increased in the tracheal aspirates of newborns in whom pulmonary emphysema developed. Intrauterine inflammation may increase the level of PMN elastase in the fetal respiratory tract. This increase in PMN elastase-alpha 1-PI in fetal lung tissue may cause lung injury in utero, resulting in postnatal pulmonary emphysema consistent with the Wilson-Mikity syndrome following ventilation.","group":"g1","id":"c33ab6e0-d034-44bb-aeb1-be76e7f2313e","_showDetails":true},"babde892-52e3-491f-90d9-09444f4fe945":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy in premature infants: is it safe?.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-3468(92)90313-v","authors":["Melone, J H","Schwartz, M Z","Tyson, K R","Marr, C C","Greenholz, S K","Taub, J E","Hough, V J"],"date":"1992//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["*Ambulatory Surgical Procedures","Anesthesia Recovery Period","Anesthesia, General","Apnea/et [Etiology]","Bradycardia/et [Etiology]","Follow-Up Studies","Gestational Age","*Hernia, Inguinal/su [Surgery]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/su [Surgery]","Ligation","Monitoring, Intraoperative","Patient Discharge","Safety","Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"Journal of pediatric surgery","volume":"27","number":"2","isbn":"0022-3468","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=1564620"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Because postoperative apnea and bradycardia in premature infants following inguinal herniorrhaphy remains a concern, outpatient repair has not been recommended. We have been performing outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy in premature infants and the present study reviews our experience. Between 1985 and 1990, 1,294 outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphies were performed. Of this group 124 patients (9.6%) were identified as being premature (less than or equal to 36 weeks gestational age). Average ages were: gestational age 32.7 weeks (range, 24 to 36 weeks); postnatal age 12.6 weeks (range, 3 to 24 weeks); and postconceptional age (gestational plus postnatal) 45.3 weeks (range, 34 to 59 weeks). Twenty-two infants previously required ventilatory support, 11 patients had apnea/bradycardia, and 9 patients developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. General anesthesia (usually nitrous oxide and fluothane) was used in all patients and 75% underwent endotracheal intubation. The average operating room time was 40 minutes (range, 20 to 115 minutes) and the average recovery room time was 94 minutes (range, 30 to 240 minutes). There were no perioperative deaths. One patient became apneic immediately after extubation in the operating room. No further episodes were noted after 4 hours of observation. Another patient following discharge had a brief apneic episode at home while on an apnea monitor, which was relieved with gentle stimulation. Both patients had no further sequelae. Bradycardia to 80 beats/min was noted in two patients, and resolved spontaneously in the recovery room. Laryngospasm after extubation in the operating room occurred in two patients, one of whom required brief reintubation and the other resolved spontaneously. Two patients required postoperative ventilation: one was extubated in the recovery room and the other was hospitalized for 24 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","group":"g1","id":"babde892-52e3-491f-90d9-09444f4fe945","_showDetails":true},"a1cc6876-aa9e-4232-9aab-f8b7d341dd3f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Immune response to split-product influenza vaccine in preterm and full-term young children.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0264-410x(92)90156-e","authors":["Groothuis, J R","Levin, M J","Lehr, M V","Weston, J A","Hayward, A R"],"date":"1992//","keywords":["Antibodies, Viral/an [Analysis]","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Influenza Vaccines/im [Immunology]","Lymphocyte Activation","Prospective Studies","T-Lymphocytes/im [Immunology]"],"journal":"Vaccine","volume":"10","number":"4","isbn":"0264-410X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=1561829"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"Humoral and cellular immune responses to two doses of influenza antigens were measured in children 6-48 months of age.

To evaluate this concern, the authors reviewed a preexisting database comprising information obtained by trained personnel by chart review to investigate prospectively the frequency of the diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease and the use of mechanical ventilation before and during participation in a clinical trial of surfactant therapy during which such therapy was available exclusively through clinical trials. Major eligibility criteria for a randomized trial at the Medical University of South Carolina included mechanical ventilation and the diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease. Both the diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease and the use of mechanical ventilation increased between pre-surfactant and randomized trial periods (hyaline: 47.2% to 55.9%, P less than .05; ventilation: 55.6% to 66.3%, P less than .01).

Similarly the urinary 3-methylhistidine (3MH):creatinine ratio before and after the commencement of dexamethasone treatment in a group of preterm babies was measured. It was found that there was a substantial increase in 3MH excretion after dexamethasone: from a mean 3MH:creatinine ratio of 46 in the week before steroids to a mean ratio of 77 in the week after. As 3MH emanates almost exclusively from the breakdown of actin in skeletal muscle cell, this finding implies the loss of muscle tissue. It was also found that the babies were in less positive nitrogen balance after dexamethasone, to a degree which is significant relative to their protein reserves. The long term consequences of a period of increased catabolism are not yet known but the authors suggest caution in the use of dexamethasone, at least in babies with milder degrees of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in whom the ratio of benefit to risk may be less favourable.","group":"g1","id":"c5b24225-c6c0-49f7-850a-8468f783a910","_showDetails":true},"fcec7ecf-cccc-4ccb-9920-b79608dcac21":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 contributes to pulmonary oxygen toxicity in mice: role of leukocytes revised.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00566679","authors":["Wegner, C D","Wolyniec, W W","LaPlante, A M","Marschman, K","Lubbe, K","Haynes, N","Rothlein, R","Letts, L G"],"date":"1992//","keywords":["Animals","*Antibodies, Monoclonal/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Cell Adhesion Molecules/ph [Physiology]","Drug Evaluation, Preclinical","Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1","Lung Diseases/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Lung Diseases/th [Therapy]","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred BALB C","Neutrophils/de [Drug Effects]","*Oxygen/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/ae [Adverse Effects]"],"journal":"Lung","volume":"170","number":"5","isbn":"0341-2040","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=1355574"],"address":"United States","abstract":"In immature or injured lungs, impaired alveolar gas exchange forces the use of elevated levels of inhaled oxygen to maintain life.

In addition to regulating neutrophil diapedesis, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression is marked on inflamed alveolar epithelium, suggesting a role for ICAM-1 in oxygen-induced, neutrophil-mediated parenchymal damage. To test this, we evaluated the rat anti-mouse ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody YN1/1.7 in 2 protocols of oxygen-induced toxicity in adult, male Balb-c mice: greater than or equal to 95% O2 for 84 hr and greater than or equal to 95% O2 for 60 hr followed by 48 hr at 21% (ambient) O2.

In the milder 60 hr exposure protocol, YN1/1.7 completely blocked the oxygen-induced lung dysfunction (reductions in Crs and DLco). These results confirm the contribution of leukocytes in the pathogenesis of pulmonary oxygen toxicity and indicate that antagonism of ICAM-1 may provide a therapeutic approach to reducing hyperoxic lung injury and dysfunction.","group":"g1","id":"fcec7ecf-cccc-4ccb-9920-b79608dcac21","_showDetails":true},"57ecabef-7d02-4bc7-a02d-60e51cd8f015":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Antenatal Betamethasone Induces Increased Surfactant Proteins and Decreased Foxm1 Expressions in Fetal Rabbit Pups.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ijms.62286","authors":["Choi, Yong-Sung","Kim, Chae-Young","Chang, Hye Kyung","Lee, Young Joo","Chung, Sung-Hoon"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210725//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Anti-Asthmatic Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Betamethasone/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Female","*Forkhead Box Protein M1/me [Metabolism]","Maternal Exposure","Pregnancy","Prenatal Care","*Pulmonary Surfactants/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rabbits","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ge [Genetics]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Transcription, Genetic/de [Drug Effects]"],"journal":"International journal of medical sciences","volume":"18","number":"15","isbn":"1449-1907","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34522162"],"address":"Australia","abstract":"Introduction: Antenatal steroid improves respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants.

Fourteen mother rabbits were assigned to four groups to undergo a cesarean section. In groups 1, 2, and 3, preterm pups were harvested on day 27 of gestation. In group 4, term pups were harvested on day 31. Antenatal maternal intramuscular injection was performed in groups 2 (normal saline) and 3 (betamethasone). Using qRT-PCR and Western blot, mRNA transcription and protein expression of surfactant protein (SP) A, B, C, and Foxm1 were compared between the pups of those four groups. Results: Sixty two fetal rabbits were harvested. One-way ANOVA test showed higher mRNA transcription of SPs in groups 3 and 4 than groups 1 and 2. Significantly lower Foxm1 mRNA transcription and protein expression were observed in group 3 or 4 compared with group 1 or 2.

We have compared the pulmonary antioxidant enzyme responses of prematurely delivered rabbits (gestational d 29 of 32) and full-term rabbits to 48-72 h of hyperoxic exposure. We found that although full-term newborns exposed to greater than 90% O2 consistently showed elevated superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, the premature animals repeatedly failed to respond to hyperoxia with increased antioxidant enzyme activity levels. Consistent with the comparative antioxidant enzyme responses were the evidences of O2 toxicity in the two age groups.

The numbers of immunoreactive cells per millimeter airway epithelial length were counted and determined by morphometry. In lungs from the control group, BOM-immunoreactive (IR) solitary cells (SCs) were numerous at the bronchiolar level, and remained so for 4 to 7 months after birth. The number of CT-IR SCs increased markedly around term. At the bronchial level these cells continued to increase postnatally apparently in inverse proportion to the number of BOM-IR SCs in later childhood. The number of CGRP-IR SCs was high only during the neonatal period. 5HT-IR SCs were relatively few and showed no clear developmental change in number. No unequivocal ENK-IR SCs were observed in any case. BOM-IR neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) were observed more frequently than any other type of NEBs and remained relatively numerous throughout childhood. In lungs of infants with HMD/BPD, endocrine cells of all types except for ENK-IR cells were markedly increased in number during periods of regeneration, to the chronic stage. It is concluded that each of these types of pulmonary endocrine cell demonstrates a characteristic developmental pattern in distribution and frequency during infancy and childhood, probably reflecting the various functional roles of these cells in early life.

All had required mechanical ventilation, 36 suffered from hyaline membrane disease, 17 from atelectasis and three from pneumonia. Of these patients 37 developed broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The study included skin prick test, measurement of ciliary beat frequency, chest X-ray, whole-body plethysmography and histamine challenge. Eight patients suffered from recurrent pulmonary infections up to the age of 4 years. Eleven children had a positive skin prick test. Three suffered from allergic asthma and six from hay-fever. The family history of atopy in these premature infants was no different from that of the general population. Ciliary beat frequency was normal in all cases (frequency: 11.8 +/- 1.8 Hz). In 34 patients X-rays showed minimal changes (peribronchial thickening n = 6, mild emphysema n = 28). Pulmonary function was normal except for an increase of thoracic gas volume which was correlated to grade of BPD according to Northway. There was a significant correlation between oxygen-score and radiological stage of BPD (r = 0.7). Histamine challenge showed hyperresponsiveness in 53% of the children. Eight patients showed a threshold similar of mild asthma (less than 1000 micrograms histamine per ml). The degree of airway hyperreactivity was correlated to the grade of BPD (r = 0.7; p less than 0.01) and the oxygen-score (r = -0.63; p less than 0.05). The oxygen-score may be considered a predictor of hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary outcome in later childhood.","group":"g1","id":"b2a126dd-995b-4432-9a26-559bbcdc0c05","_showDetails":true},"5433725b-ce5e-4fc3-b29e-2a4fd6268b85":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Postnatal development of the cystic lung lesion of Down syndrome: suggestion that the cause is reduced formation of peripheral air spaces.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/15513819109064794","authors":["Gonzalez, O R","Gomez, I G","Recalde, A L","Landing, B H"],"date":"1991//","keywords":["Age Factors","Cell Division","Child","Child, Preschool","*Cysts/et [Etiology]","Cysts/pa [Pathology]","*Down Syndrome/co [Complications]","Down Syndrome/pa [Pathology]","Fetus/pa [Pathology]","Heart Defects, Congenital/co [Complications]","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Lung Diseases/et [Etiology]","Lung Diseases/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]"],"journal":"Pediatric pathology","volume":"11","number":"4","isbn":"0277-0938","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=1835001"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The incidence of small subpleural lung cysts was analyzed for autopsies of 98 patients with Down syndrome (DS): 9 fetuses or stillborns and 89 liveborns.

By 21 weeks of gestation, SA glycoproteins were detected in the fetal alveolar epithelium and within Clara cells. The staining increased in intensity and extent with advancing gestational age. Infants with HMD who survived less than 48 hours did not generally exhibit stainable material either within type II cells or secretions, but staining was often noted in Clara cells as well as focally beneath hyaline membranes. In infants surviving more than 48 hours, intense staining of hyaline membranes, alveolar secretions, proliferating alveolar type II cells, and Clara cells was evident. Immunoreactivity was intense in hypertrophic type II cells that formed a continuous alveolar epithelial lining in lungs with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Included in the population of infants with HMD were 15 infants with pulmonary hypoplasia. The lungs of these infants showed minimal staining for SA glycoproteins regardless of postnatal survival time.

The question of whether such an imbalance persists in BPD infants still requiring mechanical ventilation after 4 wk of life has not been previously addressed. We studied 14 infants still on mechanical ventilation at 4 wk of age: nine had BPD and five did not. Weekly (4 to 9 wk) serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were taken. alpha 1Pi and alpha-2-macroglobulin were measured in serum and BAL by immunoturbidimetric assay. BAL elastase activity was measured by cleavage of a synthetic substrate and expressed as ng of porcine pancreatic elastase equivalent. Infants with BPD had higher levels of serum alpha 1Pi and alpha-2-macroglobulin than those without BPD. In contrast, the corresponding BAL levels were either similar or even decreased (alpha 1Pi). Moreover, there was a 3-fold increase in elastase-1Pi imbalance expressed as the BAL ng of porcine pancreatic elastase equivalent/2 alpha 1Pi ratio. The role of nosocomial infections was evident in a subgroup of 11 infected BAL aspirates in BPD infants. In such cases we found a 3-fold increase in the BAL ng of porcine pancreatic elastase equivalent/alpha 1Pi ratio as compared to 35 noninfected BAL in BPD infants. These data suggest a persistent alveolitis with imbalance between elastase and proteinase inhibitors in prolonged severe BPD. Such an imbalance is, in part, explained by a local destruction and/or inactivation of alpha 1Pi. Our results also emphasize the increase in proteolysis with nosocomial pneumonia.","group":"g1","id":"5fd1a432-3040-4abe-861b-6c84a2810ea5","_showDetails":true},"c7821d2a-f506-4c25-b55c-97a30649f368":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"The effect of dexamethasone on chronic pulmonary oxygen toxicity in infant mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/00006450-198904000-00008","authors":["Ohtsu, N","Ariagno, R L","Sweeney, T E","Davis, L","Moses, L","Petriceks, R","Daehne, I","Bensch, K","Northway, W H Jr"],"date":"1989//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Chronic Disease","Collagen/an [Analysis]","DNA/an [Analysis]","Dexamethasone/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Dexamethasone/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Lung/an [Analysis]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Oxygen/ai [Antagonists & Inhibitors]","Oxygen/to [Toxicity]","Proteins/an [Analysis]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"25","number":"4","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=2726308"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The effect of dexamethasone (0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg/d given subcutaneously from d 14-18) was tested in infant mice continuously exposed from birth to either humidified air or 80% oxygen.

Associations between clinical and laboratory risk factors/biomarkers of BPD and CRM were explored., RESULTS: Of 86 subjects, 94% survived. Outcomes were available for 89% at 36-week PMA (BPD present in 42% of infants) and 72% at 6-12-month CGA (CRM present in 47% of infants). For the 54 infants with known outcomes for both BPD and CRM, diagnoses were discordant in 41%. BPD was associated with lower birthweight and birthweight Z-score for GA, lower Apgar scores, more surfactant doses, higher SNAPPE-II scores, highest Day 1 inspired oxygen concentration, Day 7 oxygen use, prolonged ventilatory support, bacteremia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and treated patent ductus arteriosus.

Patterns of plasma and urine lipid oxidation products differed in the two outcomes., CONCLUSION: In this hypothesis generating and exploratory study, BPD and CRM were associated with different risk factors/biomarker patterns. Concordance between these two outcomes was weak. Strategies for reducing CRM should be studied in cohorts identified by appropriate early risk factors/biomarkers.

Low molecular weight, hydrophobic, surfactant-associated protein (SAP), herein referred to as SAP 6-14, was distinguished from SAP-35, the major glycoprotein in mammalian surfactants (the 35,000 dalton glycoprotein A or apolipoprotein A) by amino acid composition, peptide mapping, and by resistance of SAP 6-14 to digestion by endoglycosidase F, collagenase, trypsin, and other proteases. The amino acid composition of SAP 6-14 was found to be highly enriched in leucine and other hydrophobic amino acids. The characteristics of protein isolated from bovine replacement surfactant extracts utilized for the treatment of hyaline membrane disease in humans were also studied. SAP 6-14 isolated from calf lung surfactant replacement extracts (CLSE) and surfactant-TA were found to be identical to SAP 6-14 isolated from ether/ethanol extracts of various mammalian surfactants. By contrast, SAP-35, the major surfactant-associated glycoprotein of molecular weight = 35,000, and other higher molecular weight proteins were not detected in significant quantities in the CLSE or surfactant-TA replacement surfactants, either by highly sensitive silver stain analysis or by immunoblot using monospecific antisera generated against bovine SAP-35. Biophysical studies of the CLSE replacement surfactant containing only SAP 6-14 and native phospholipids demonstrated full surface activity compared to natural lung surfactant. Dynamic surface tension lowering and adsorption properties of CLSE were essentially identical to those of freshly isolated bovine whole surfactant.

In addition to prematurity, mechanical ventilation itself can induce ventilator-induced lung injury leading to lifelong pulmonary sequelae. Besides conventional mechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) with tidal volumes below dead space and high ventilation frequencies is used either as a primary or rescue therapy in severe neonatal respiratory failure., METHODS AND RESULTS: Applying a high-resolution computational lung modeling technique in a preterm infant, we studied three different high-frequency ventilation settings as well as conventional ventilation (CV) settings. Evaluating the computed oxygen delivery (OD) and lung mechanics (LM) we outline for the first time how changing ventilator settings from CV to HFOV lead to significant improvements in OD and LM., CONCLUSION: This personalized \"digital twin\" strategy advances our general knowledge of protective ventilation strategies in neonatal care and can support decisions on various modes of ventilatory therapy at high frequencies.

Deaths tend to cluster in the summer months and January-February represent the lowest months of recorded fatalities. Analysis of the age at death, reflecting time course of the disease, revealed idential patterns for 1968 to 1970. The number of deaths was found to decline exponentially between the first and fourth 24-hour periods so that 92% of all deaths occurred by 4 days of age. Boys contributed more prominently to the death totals than girls with ratios from 1.62 to 1.76. Examination of mortality rates by race suggested that black permatures have a lower incidence of fatal HMD/RDS. In addition to nationwide figures, those of individual states were compared for three years. Generally, HMD/RDS mortality rates correlated with overall neonatal mortality statistics. Exceptions were observed, however, such as Illinois where low rates for the former coexist with relatively high neonatal death rates. These data respresent the first national mortality statistics for HMD and may prove useful in planning and providing intensive neonatal care.","group":"g1","id":"289d54eb-427e-4ce0-95e0-84743ddd66e9","_showDetails":false},"0e0e0902-7eeb-4791-955f-1ee9f6182b75":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1946 to 1979>","title":"Pulmonary mechanics in infants surviving severe neonatal respiratory insufficiency.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.1975.tb04381.x","authors":["Ahlstrom, H"],"date":"1975//","keywords":["Asphyxia Neonatorum/di [Diagnosis]","*Asphyxia Neonatorum","Birth Weight","Body Height","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Hyperventilation/di [Diagnosis]","Infant, Newborn","Male","Oxygen/bl [Blood]","Plethysmography, Whole Body","Positive-Pressure Respiration","Prognosis","Respiration","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/di [Diagnosis]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn","Respiratory Insufficiency/di [Diagnosis]","Time Factors","Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio","Ventilators, Mechanical"],"journal":"Acta paediatrica Scandinavica","volume":"64","number":"1","isbn":"0001-656X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med1&NEWS=N&AN=1090108"],"address":"Sweden","abstract":"Pulmonary mechanics was studied in 24 survivors of severe neonatal ventilatory insufficiency, 15 infants had idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), 6 recurrent severe apnoeic spells, and 3 postasphyxia syndrome.

One infant treated with CPAP via an endotracheal tube and given pure oxygen for a long time had gross abnormalities suggesting bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

S1P acts through G protein-coupled receptors, S1P1 through S1P5. Further, we noted that heterozygous deletion of S1pr1 ameliorated the HO-induced BPD in the murine model. The mechanism by which S1P1 signaling contributes to HO-induced BPD was explored., METHODS: S1pr1+/+ and S1pr1+/- mice pups were exposed to either room air (RA) or HO (75% oxygen) for 7 days from PN 1-7. Lung injury and alveolar simplification was evaluated. Lung protein expression was determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In vitro experiments were performed using human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) with S1P1 inhibitor, NIBR0213 to interrogate the S1P1 signaling pathway., RESULTS: HO increased the expression of S1pr1 gene as well as S1P1 protein in both neonatal lungs and HLMVECs. The S1pr1+/- neonatal mice showed significant protection against HO-induced BPD which was accompanied by reduced inflammation markers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. HO-induced reduction in ANG-1, TIE-2, and VEGF was rescued in S1pr1+/- mouse, accompanied by an improvement in the number of arterioles in the lung. HLMVECs exposed to HO increased the expression of KLF-2 accompanied by reduced expression of TIE-2, which was reversed with S1P1 inhibition., CONCLUSION: HO induces S1P1 followed by reduced expression of angiogenic factors. Reduction of S1P1 signaling restores ANG-1/ TIE-2 signaling leading to improved angiogenesis and alveolarization thus protecting against HO-induced neonatal lung injury. Copyright © 2021.

Platelet transfusions may reduce the bleeding risk in neonates, but are also associated with adverse short and long-term immune and inflammatory outcomes. A randomized trial of platelet transfusions in neonates found that transfusion was associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, unilateral/bilateral retinopathy, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Past work from our research team found that neonatal platelets expressed lower levels of mRNA for many immune related molecules compared to adult platelets. We therefore sought to determine whether the transfusion of adult platelets to neonates resulted in developmental immune dysregulation, with a focus on platelet and monocyte interactions. To explore the interactions between monocytes and platelets, we isolated monocytes from adult mouse bone marrow and co-incubated monocytes with adult (>8 weeks old) or neonatal mouse platelets (7 days old mice) and determined inflammatory and trafficking monocyte phenotypes by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. Monocytes treated with adult platelets had an increased inflammatory (Ly6C hi) and trafficking phenotype (CCR2 hi), while monocytes treated with neonatal platelets adopted an inflammatory, but not trafficking phenotype. As expected, adult platelets increased the expression of monocyte inflammatory (Nos2, Cxcl1, Ccl2) and trafficking (Ccr2) mRNA, while neonatal platelets also increased inflammatory mRNA expression, but did not increase Ccr2 expression. Adult platelets express more Selp (P-selectin) than neonatal platelets and P-selectin is a major mediator of platelet and monocyte interactions. We confirmed that adult platelets expressed more P-selectin protein compared to neonatal platelets, and found that blocking P-selectin decreased adult platelet induced CCR2 expression to levels similar to monocytes treated with neonatal platelets. Using a transwell chamber we assessed adult and neonatal platelet effects on monocyte migration towards the CCR2 ligand CCL2. Monocytes were treated with adult platelets had significantly greater monocyte migration compared to monocytes co-incubated with neonatal platelets. To model platelet transfusions in the setting of thrombocytopenia, we used 14d old thrombopoietin receptor knockout mice (TPOR-/-) that have low platelet counts, and infused adult or neonatal platelets. We observed a significant increase in inflammatory and trafficking monocytes in mice transfused with adult platelets compared to those transfused with neonatal platelets. Using an in vivo model of monocyte chemotaxis, mice were treated with CCL2 intraperitoneal after platelet transfusion. Adult platelet transfusions, but not neonatal, increased monocyte peritoneal trafficking to CCL2. These data provide comparative insights as to how adult and neonatal platelet transfusions regulate monocyte functions. Adult platelet transfusions to neonates are associated with an inflammatory and trafficking monocyte phenotype that is platelet P-selectin dependent and may have a major impact on neonatal platelet transfusion complications.","group":"g1","id":"b61256bc-c7fc-4980-8922-095d82257c05","_showDetails":true},"690a5444-610e-4a0b-957c-0d9075619e3e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Embase Classic <1947 to 1973> Part 1 of 2","accession":"291059917","title":"The relation of disseminated intravascular coagulation to hyaline membrane disease","authors":["Stahlman M."],"date":"1970//","keywords":["bleeding","death","*disseminated intravascular clotting","*hyaline membrane disease","patient","prematurity","blood clotting factor","hyalin"],"journal":"Biology of the Neonate","language":"English","volume":"16","number":"1-3","isbn":"0006-3126","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emcl1&NEWS=N&AN=291059917"],"abstract":"It is concluded that no useful generalization can be made about the coagulation status of patients with HMD.

After death the pressure volume characteristics of the lung were investigated and correlated with the estimation of pulmonary surfactant and the histological appearance of the lung. Infants dying with deficiency of pulmonary surfactant always had clinical respiratory distress, unless they were unable to make spontaneous respiratory efforts on which an assessment could be based, and hyaline membranes, dilatation of alveolar ducts, and atelectasis were always present in the lungs. Calculated right to left shunts were no greater at 4 hr of age in infants dying from hyaline membrane disease than in infants who died from other causes. Clinical respiratory distress was associated with a variety of conditions, and terminology is discussed. Normal pulmonary surface activity was found in infants who had hyaline membrane formation due to massive pulmonary hemorrhage or hydrops fetalis. Pulmonary surfactant was present in functionally significant amounts by the twenty fourth week of gestation in infants dying from illnesses other than hyaline membrane disease and increased in amount as term was approached. It is concluded that the state at birth of the mechanism responsible for the production of pulmonary surfactant is the crucial factor determining the development of hyaline membrane disease, and that this illness arises because the synthetic mechanism is so immature that it cannot supply the demand for surfactant or because it has been damaged by prenatal or intrapartum asphyxia, or because of the interaction of these 2 influences.","group":"g1","id":"d441c8a2-ebd6-4e51-8b2c-5be48ae9e074","_showDetails":true},"1d0e8100-0236-4bbb-a13d-f6415a86d959":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2020>","title":"Early diagnosis effects the prognosis in children with atypical wheeze.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.14744/TurkPediatriArs.2019.35467","authors":["Severcan, Ezgi Ulusoy","Demir, Esen","Gulen, Figen","Bilgin, Raziye Burcu Guven","Tanac, Remziye"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200923//","journal":"Turk pediatri arsivi","volume":"55","number":"3","isbn":"1306-0015","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm5&NEWS=N&AN=33061752"],"address":"Turkey","abstract":"AIM: Recurrent wheezing is a common problem in preschool children.It is classified into two groups because there can be many reasons for wheeze: typical and atypical. The aim of this study was to identify the general features of atypical wheezy children., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred two children who presented to our clinic between 2000 and 2015 for three or more wheezing attacks and were diagnosed as having an underlying disease such as bronchiectasis, foreign body aspiration, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital anomalies, and tuberculosis, were included in the study., RESULTS: In this study, 127 (42.1%) girls and 175 (57.9%) boys were evaluated. The diagnostic distribution of the patients was as follows: bronchopulmonary dysplasia (21.9%), bronchiolitis obliterans (16.6%), bronchiectasis (14.5%), bronchiolitis obliterans + primary immunodeficiency (12.3%), cystic fibrosis (10.3%), bronchiectasis + primary immunodeficiency (7.9%), recurrent aspiration pneumonia (3.6%) and foreign body aspiration (3.3%), and other diseases (9.6%). Mosaic oligemia, bronchiectasis, atelectasis, bronchiolectasis, and small airway disease were the most distinct findings on high-resolution lung tomography. When the patients were evaluated clinically, radiologically, and according to pulmonary functions after an average period of 40 months, it was seen that 9.2% deteriorated, 33.9% regressed, and 56.7% remained stable. Presentation to hospital after the first attack occurred earlier in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiolitis obliterans + primary immunodeficiency compared with patients with bronchiectasis, bronchiectasis + primary immunodeficiency, and cystic fibrosis. When presentation time and outcomes were evaluated, it was found that 63.4% of patients who presented to hospital early (0-6 months) and 7.5% of patients who presented late (after 5 years) had regression., CONCLUSION: Recurrent wheezy children must be promptly evaluated for an underlying disease.

In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that newborn mice lacking the Cyp1a1 gene would be more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than wild-type (WT) mice and that postnatal BNF treatment would rescue this phenotype by mechanisms involving CYP1A and/or NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) enzymes. Newborn WT or Cyp1a1-null mice were treated with BNF (10 mg/kg) or the vehicle corn oil (CO) i.p., from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 14 once every other day, while being maintained in room air or hyperoxia (85% O2) for 14 days. Both genotypes showed lung injury, inflammation, and alveolar simplification in hyperoxia, with Cyp1a1-null mice displaying increased susceptibility compared to WT mice. BNF treatment resulted in significant attenuation of lung injury and inflammation, with improved alveolarization in both WT and Cyp1a1-null mice. BNF exposed normoxic or hyperoxic WT mice showed increased expression of hepatic CYP1A1/1A2, pulmonary CYP1A1, and NQO1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, compared with vehicle controls. However, BNF caused greater induction of hepatic CYP1A2 and pulmonary NQO1 enzymes in the Cyp1a1-null mice, suggesting that BNF protects against hyperoxic lung injury in WT and Cyp1a1-null mice through the induction of CYP1A and NQO1 enzymes. Further studies on the protective role of flavonoids against hyperoxic lung injury in newborns could lead to novel strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of BPD. Copyright © The Author 2017.

Depending on centers, lipids were infused either separately or as all-in-one PN., RESULTS: In total, 590 infants born <30 weeks gestational age were included. At randomization, LE and LP groups did not differ clinically except for maximal FiO2 before 12 hours. The rate of BPD/death was not different between groups at 28 days (77% LP vs 72% LE, P = .16) or at 36 weeks corrected age (30% LP vs 27% LE, P = .55). Multivariate analysis showed no significant effect of photoprotection on BPD and/or death. The rate of BPD/death was significantly lower (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.93; P = .02) in infants receiving all-in-one PN vs those who received lipids separately., CONCLUSION: This study did not show significant beneficial effects of photoprotection. Since the decreased rate of BPD/death found with all-in-one PN relates to a center-dependent variable, this warrants further investigation.

Although macrophages are the key cells that initiate lung inflammation, less is known about lung macrophage phenotype and maturation. We hypothesized that fetal lung macrophages mature into distinct subpopulations during mouse development, and that activation could influence macrophage maturation. Expression of the fetal macrophage markers CD68, CD86, CD206, Ym1, fibrinogen-like protein 2, and indolamine-2, 3-dioxygenase was developmentally regulated, with each marker having different temporal patterns. Flow cytometry analysis showed macrophages within the fetal lung were less diverse than the distinctly separate subpopulations in newborn and adult lungs. Similar to adult alveolar macrophages, fetal lung macrophages responded to the TLR4 agonist LPS and the alternative activation cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Using a macrophage-specific constitutively active IkappaB Kinase transgenic model (IKFM), we demonstrated that macrophage activation increased proinflammatory gene expression and reduced the response of fetal lung macrophages to IL-4 and IL-13. Activation also increased fetal lung macrophage proliferation. Fetal IKFM lungs contained increased percentages of more mature, CD11b(low)F4/80(high) cells that also expressed higher levels of the alternative activation markers CD204 and CD206. Development of fetal lung macrophages into mature alveolar macrophages may therefore include features of both proinflammatory and alternative activation paradigms.

Immune globulin with a high titer of antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus may offer infants and young children at risk protection from this serious, common respiratory illness., METHODS: We studied 249 infants and young children (mean age, eight months) who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to prematurity (n = 102), congenital heart disease (n = 87), or prematurity alone (n = 60). Respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin was given monthly to some of these children in either a high dose (750 mg per kilogram of body weight; n = 81) or low dose (150 mg per kilogram; n = 79); 89 controls received no immune globulin. Group assignments were random. Assessments of respiratory illness and management were conducted without knowledge of the children's group assignments., RESULTS: There were 64 episodes of respiratory syncytial virus infection: 19 in the high-dose group, 16 in the low-dose group, and 29 in the control group. In the high-dose group there were fewer lower respiratory tract infections (7, vs. 20 in the control group; P = 0.01), fewer hospitalizations (6, vs. 18 in the control group; P = 0.02), fewer hospital days (43, vs. 128 in the control group; P = 0.02), fewer days in the intensive care unit (P = 0.05), and less use of ribavirin (P = 0.05). In the low-dose group there was a significant reduction only in the number of days in the intensive care unit (P = 0.03). Adverse events during the 580 infusions were generally mild and included fluid overload (in five children), oxygen desaturation (eight), and fever (six).

Results of clinical trials with MSCs for many disorders do not yet match the promising preclinical studies. A lack of specific criteria to define functionally distinct MSCs persists., OBJECTIVES: To determine and correlate single-cell UC-MSC transcriptomic profile with therapeutic potential., METHODS: UC-MSCs from five term donors and human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (HNDFs, control cells of mesenchymal origin) transcriptomes were investigated by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNA-seq). The lung-protective effect of UC-MSCs with a distinct transcriptome and control HNDFs was tested in vivo in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury in rats., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: UC-MSCs showed limited transcriptomic heterogeneity, but were different from HNDFs. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed distinct - progenitor-like and fibroblast-like - UC-MSC subpopulations. Only the treatment with progenitor-like UC-MSCs improved lung function and structure and attenuated pulmonary hypertension in hyperoxia-exposed rat pups. Moreover, scRNA-seq identified major histocompatibility complex class I as a molecular marker of non-therapeutic cells and associated with decreased lung retention., CONCLUSIONS: UC-MSCs with a progenitor-like transcriptome, but not with a fibroblast-like transcriptome, provide lung protection in experimental BPD. High expression of major histocompatibility complex class I is associated with reduced therapeutic benefit. scRNA-seq may be useful to identify subsets of MSCs with superior repair capacity for clinical application.","group":"g4","id":"fd070300-fd26-4cb1-8f3d-f45b1c8d7f73","_showDetails":true},"fe4e77cf-51d3-4974-87fc-2a76097886d2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print","title":"Epigenetic associations in HPA axis genes related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia and antenatal steroids.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41390-024-03116-4","authors":["Hodge, Kenyaita M","Zhabotynsky, Vasyl","Burt, Amber A","Carter, Brian S","Fry, Rebecca C","Helderman, Jennifer","Hofheimer, Julie A","McGowan, Elisabeth C","Neal, Charles R","Pastyrnak, Steven L","Smith, Lynne M","DellaGrotta, Sheri A","Dansereau, Lynne M","Lester, Barry M","Marsit, Carmen J","O'Shea, T Michael","Everson, Todd M","Smith PB","Newby LK","Jacobson LP","Catellier DJ","Gershon R","Cella D","Vaidya R","Obeid R","Rollins C","Bear K","Lenski M","Singh R","Msall M","Frazier J","Gogcu S","Montgomery A","Kuban K","Douglass L","Jara H","Joseph R","program collaborators for Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes"],"date":"2024//","accessDate":"20240313//","journal":"Pediatric research","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=medp&NEWS=N&AN=38480856"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common morbidity among very preterm infants, is associated with chronic disease and neurodevelopmental impairments. A hypothesized mechanism for these outcomes lies in altered glucocorticoid (GC) activity. We hypothesized that BPD and its treatments may result in epigenetic differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is modulated by GC, and could be ascertained using an established GC risk score and DNA methylation (DNAm) of HPA axis genes., METHODS: DNAm was quantified from buccal tissue (ECHO-NOVI) and from neonatal blood spots (ELGAN ECHO) via the EPIC microarray. Prenatal maternal characteristics, pregnancy complication, and neonatal medical complication data were collected from medical record review and maternal interviews., RESULTS: The GC score was not associated with steroid exposure or BPD. However, six HPA genes involved in stress response regulation demonstrated differential methylation with antenatal steroid exposure; two CpGs within FKBP5 and POMC were differentially methylated with BPD severity. These findings were sex-specific in both cohorts; males had greater magnitude of differential methylation within these genes., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BPD severity and antenatal steroids are associated with DNAm at some HPA genes in very preterm infants and the effects appear to be sex-, tissue-, and age-specific., IMPACT: This study addresses bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), an important health outcome among preterm neonates, and interrogates a commonly studied pathway, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The combination of BPD, the HPA axis, and epigenetic markers has not been previously reported. In this study, we found that BPD itself was not associated with epigenetic responses in the HPA axis in infants born very preterm; however, antenatal treatment with steroids was associated with epigenetic responses.

Emerging evidence suggests that regulatory T cells (Tregs) may confer protective effects on the vasculature. Knockdown of their transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), has been shown to promote vascular endothelial hyperplasia. However, the involvement of Tregs and IRF4 in the BPD pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the regulation of Tregs by IRF4 and elucidate its potential role in pulmonary vasculature development in a BPD mouse model., METHODS: The BPD model was established using 85% hyperoxia exposure, with air exposure as the normal control. Lung tissues were collected after 7 or 14 days of air or hyperoxia exposure, respectively. Haematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to assess lung tissue pathology. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) level, flow cytometry to quantify Treg numbers, and Western blot to assess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3), and IRF4 protein levels. We also examined the co-expression of IRF4 and FOXP3 proteins using immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence double staining. Furthermore, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock down the IRF4 gene and observed changes in the aforementioned indicators to validate its effect on pulmonary vasculature development in mice., RESULTS: Elevated IRF4 levels in BPD model mice led to FOXP3 downregulation, reduced Treg numbers, and impaired pulmonary vascular development. Knockdown of IRF4 resulted in improved pulmonary vascular development and upregulated FOXP3 level., CONCLUSION: IRF4 may affect the protective role of Tregs in the proliferation of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and pulmonary vascular development in BPD model mice by inhibiting the FOXP3 level.

The daily intake of calories, protein, fat and carbohydrates during the first week of life and evidence of inadequate weight gain (DELTAwt) until week 36 of gestational age (GA) were recorded. FEV1, FEF25-75 %, forced vital capacity (FVC) and the FEV1/FVC ratio were determined. The relations between these parameters were determined by regression analysis. Spirometric parameters were obtained for 141 children with a mean age of 9 years (95 % CI 7, 11); 69 of them (48.9 %) had presented wheezing episodes on more than three occasions. In addition, 60 (42.5 %) had a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Of these, n 40 (66.6 %) had a history of wheezing.

We examined whether male and female preterm infants differed in cortisol production and metabolism at 10 days post-partum., DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study included 36 preterm born infants (18 boys) with a very low birth weight (VLBW) (<1.500 g). At 10 days postnatal age, urine was collected over a 4- to 6-h period. Glucocorticoid metabolites were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Main outcome measures were: (1) cortisol excretion rate, (2) sum of all glucocorticoid metabolites, as an index of corticosteroid excretion rate, and (3) ratio of 11-OH/11-OXO metabolites, as an estimate of 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11B-HSD) activity. Differences between sexes, including interaction with Score of Neonatal Acute Physiology Perinatal Extension-II (SNAPPE II), sepsis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), were assessed., RESULTS: No differences between sexes were found for cortisol excretion rate, corticosteroid excretion rate or 11B-HSD activity. Interaction was observed between: sex and SNAPPE II score on 11B-HSD activity (P = 0.04) and sex and BPD on cortisol excretion rate (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSION: This study did not provide evidence for sex-specific differences in adrenocortical function in preterm VLBW infants on a group level. However, in an interaction model, sex differences became manifest under stressful circumstances. These patterns might provide clues for the male disadvantage in neonatal mortality and morbidity following preterm birth. However, due to the small sample size, the data should be seen as hypothesis generating.","group":"g1","id":"786883f8-f9c5-43cc-b95c-f3a9769f2a79","_showDetails":false},"b7e11bed-4d58-4964-a6ae-be5196bcc830":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2020>","title":"Neuroendoscopic lavage for the management of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in preterm infants: safety, effectivity, and lessons learned.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2020.2.PEDS2037","authors":["Tirado-Caballero, Jorge","Rivero-Garvia, Monica","Arteaga-Romero, Francisco","Herreria-Franco, Jorge","Lozano-Gonzalez, Angel","Marquez-Rivas, Javier"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200515//","journal":"Journal of neurosurgery.

Neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL) has been proposed as a suitable technique for the management of this pathology. The authors present their experience with 46 patients treated with NEL after germinal matrix hemorrhage, describe their technique, and analyze the outcomes., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients affected by grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) treated with NEL was performed. Nonmodifiable risk factors such as gestational age, weight at birth, modified Papile grade, and intercurrent diseases were reviewed. Safety analysis was performed, evaluating the incidence of postoperative complications. Effectivity was measured using radiological (frontal horn index and white matter injury), CSF biochemical (proteins, blood, and cellularity), and clinical variables. Permanent shunt rate and shunt survival were analyzed. The motor outcome was measured using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) at 18-24 months, and the neurocognitive outcome was evaluated according to the grade of adaptation to schooling., RESULTS: Forty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were treated with a single NEL in 21 cases, 2 lavages in 13 cases, and 3 lavages in 12 cases. The mean gestational age at birth was 30.04 weeks, and the mean weight at birth was 1671.86 g. Hyaline membrane disease was described in 4.8% of the cases, hematological sepsis in 43.47%, persistent ductus arteriosus in 23.9%, and necrotizing enterocolitis in 10.9% of the cases. Modified Papile grade III and IV IVHs were observed in 60.9% and 39.1% of the cases, respectively. Postoperative infection was diagnosed in 10 of the 46 cases, CSF leak in 6, and rebleeding in 3. The mean frontal horn index decreased from 49.54 mm to 45.50 mm after NEL. No white matter injury was observed in 18 of 46 patients, focal injury was described in 13 patients, and diffuse bilateral white matter injury was observed in 15 patients. All CSF biochemical levels improved after lavage. The shunt rate was 58.7%, and shunt survival at 1 year was 50%. GMFCS grades I, II, III, IV, and V were observed in 44.74%, 21.05%, 2.63%, 15.79%, and 15.79% of patients, respectively. Good neurocognitive results were observed in 53.3% of the cases., CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendoscopic lavage was a suitable alternative for the management of IVH in preterm infants in our series. Good motor and neurocognitive results were achieved by this technique, and the permanent shunt rate was reduced compared with historical controls.","group":"g1","id":"b7e11bed-4d58-4964-a6ae-be5196bcc830","_showDetails":true},"ea0f7685-f526-4c85-932d-c4606f7b0679":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Sociodemographic characteristics of children born to HIV-infected mothers in Western French Guiana.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2023.03.027","authors":["Aboubacar Ahidan, M R","Buende, S","Osei, L","Hcini, N","Elenga, N"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230329//","keywords":["Pregnancy","Humans","Child","Female","Infant, Newborn","Mothers","HIV Infections/co [Complications]","HIV Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","HIV Infections/dt [Drug Therapy]","*HIV Infections","Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/ep [Epidemiology]","*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious","Retrospective Studies","French Guiana/ep [Epidemiology]","Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/pc [Prevention & Control]"],"journal":"Journal of infection and public health","volume":"16","number":"6","isbn":"1876-0341","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=37054500"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: French Guiana is the French department most affected by HIV. The situation in Western French Guiana is complicated by the transborder context and isolation of many patients. This study aims to describe the epidemiological characteristics of children born to mothers living with HIV followed in Western French Guiana., METHODS: This was a retrospective and descriptive study. All children born to HIV-infected mothers between 2014 and 2018 were included. Data were collected using a survey sheet to generate an Excel database., RESULTS: We recorded 177 newborns exposed to maternal HIV, four of whom (2.26 %) were infected. The majority of women (87 %) were of foreign origin, and only 7 % had conventional health insurance coverage. The infection was discovered during pregnancy in 20 % of women. Overall 21.71 % of newborns were preterm and 22.5 % hypotrophic. All neonates had received antiretroviral prophylaxis for four weeks, either as monotherapy (AZT) (67.43 %) or triple therapy (AZT/3TC/NVP) (25.71 %). Twenty-two neonates had at least one neonatal illness: transient respiratory distress (9 cases), asphyxia (3 cases), hyaline membrane disease (8 cases), and there were two cases with birth defects: clubfoot (1 case) and heart disease (1 case). The follow-up rate at 24 months was 65 % and 35 % of cases were lost to follow-up. The most common biological anomalies were anemia (69.14 %), hyperlacticaemia (23 %), and neutropenia (9.14 %)., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of mother-to child transmission of HIV was high; a quarter of maternal infections were discovered during pregnancy. The mother's socio-economic situation was often precarious and follow-up interruptions common. Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Main exposure was a change in BMI z score from birth to 36 weeks corrected age grouped into quartiles of change. Association between DELTABMI z scores and BPD was assessed using generalized linear mixed models., RESULTS: Among 772 included infants, 51% developed BPD. From birth to 36 weeks CGA, the weight z score of infants with BPD decreased less than for BPD-free infants, despite a greater decrease in length z score and similar caloric intake resulting in increases in BMI z score (median [IQR], 0.16 [-0.64; 1.03] vs -0.29 [-1.03; 0.49]; P < 0.01). In the adjusted analysis, higher DELTABMI z score quartiles were associated with higher odds of BPD (Q3 vs Q2, AOR [95% CI], 2.02 [1.23; 3.31] and Q4 vs Q2, AOR [95% CI], 2.00 [1.20; 3.34])., CONCLUSION: Among preterm infants, an increase in BMI z score from birth to 36 weeks corrected is associated with higher odds of BPD., IMPACT: Preterm infants with evolving lung disease often experience disproportionate growth in the neonatal period. In this multicenter cohort study, increases in BMI z score from birth to 36 weeks CGA were associated with higher odds of BPD. Despite similar caloric intake, infants with BPD had a higher weight- but lower length-for-age, resulting in higher BMI z score compared to BPD-free infants. This suggests that infants with evolving BPD may require different growth and nutritional targets compared to BPD-free infants. Copyright © 2022.

Descriptive statistics and multi-level ordinary linear squares (OLS) regression were used to explore the association between perinatal and sociodemographic characteristics and PedsQL TM GCS scores. A mediation analysis that applied generalised structural equation modelling explored the association between potential mediators and PedsQL TM GCS scores., RESULTS: The multi-level OLS regression (fully adjusted model) revealed that birth at < 26 weeks' gestation, BPD status and experience of severe non-respiratory morbidity were associated with mean decrements in the total PedsQL TM GCS score of 0.35, 3.71 and 5.87, respectively. The mediation analysis revealed that the indirect effects of BPD and severe non-respiratory morbidity on the total PedsQL TM GCS score translated into decrements of 1.73 and 17.56, respectively, at < 26 weeks' gestation; 0.99 and 10.95, respectively, at 26-27 weeks' gestation; and 0.34 and 4.80, respectively, at 28-29 weeks' gestation (referent: birth at 30-31 weeks' gestation)., CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HRQoL is particularly impaired by extremely preterm birth and the concomitant complications of preterm birth such as BPD and severe non-respiratory morbidity.

Ciclesonide (CIC) is a sGC prodrug approved for asthma treatment that exhibits limited systemic side effects. Carboxylesterases enriched in the lower airways convert CIC to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist des-CIC. We therefore examined whether CIC would likewise activate GR in neonatal lung but have limited adverse extra-pulmonary effects, particularly in the developing brain. Neonatal rats were administered subcutaneous injections of CIC, DEX or vehicle from postnatal days 1-5 (PND1-PND5). Systemic effects linked to DEX exposure, including reduced body and brain weight, were not observed in CIC treated neonates. Furthermore, CIC did not trigger the long-lasting reduction in myelin basic protein expression in the cerebral cortex nor cerebellar size caused by neonatal DEX exposure. Conversely, DEX and CIC were both effective at inducing the expression of select GR target genes in neonatal lung, including those implicated in lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, CIC is a promising, novel candidate drug to treat or prevent BPD in neonates given its activation of GR in neonatal lung and limited adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Furthermore, since sGCs such as DEX administered to pregnant women in pre-term labor can adversely affect fetal brain development, the neurological-sparing properties of CIC, make it an attractive alternative for DEX to treat pregnant women severely ill with respiratory illness, such as with asthma exacerbations or COVID-19 infections.

Postnatal growth was assessed in two 5 years epochs: 2009-2013 (n = 4583) and 2014-2018 (n = 4558). Outcome was considered as severe, mild and no postnatal growth failure (PNGF). Morbidities included respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus and grades 3-4 intraventricular haemorrhage. Multinomial logistic regression analyses with the generalised estimating equation approach were applied., RESULTS: The study population composed 9141 infants. Of them, 2089 had at least one major morbidity and 7052 infants had none. In infants with no morbidities, 2.1% had severe PNGF, 23.7% mild PNGF and 74.2% had no PNGF, as compared to 13.6%, 43.9% and 42.5%, respectively, in infants with any major neonatal morbidity (p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Despite enormous advances in neonatal care, postnatal growth remains a challenge in VLBW infants, particularly in infants with major neonatal morbidities. Along with efforts to decrease morbidity, a more personalised plan and follow-up may be required in infants with major morbidities, given their high risk for diminished growth and potentially, adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

It primarily is seen in infants born prematurely. Approximately 95% of infants with BPD had a low birth weight (ie, less than 1,500 g). This condition affects pulmonary function throughout the life span. Many children with BPD develop asthmalike symptoms with recurrent wheezing beginning in the preschool-aged years. Complications include pulmonary hypertension, tracheomalacia, glottic damage, sleep apnea, and more frequent and/or severe respiratory infections. Measures should be taken to prevent respiratory infections in these patients. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by an autosomal recessive sequence variation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that results in mucus accumulation on cell surfaces. Mucus accumulation in the airways causes chronic cough, wheezing, recurrent infections, and progressive loss of lung function. Treatment includes clearance of mucus from the lungs and infection management. Complications and associated conditions include sinusitis, nutritional and gastrointestinal issues, dehydration, pancreatic insufficiency, and CF-related diabetes. All of these should be addressed. Most cases of CF are diagnosed via newborn screening and follow-up sweat tests. New CFTR modulators that improve CFTR protein function offer hope of improved longevity and quality of life for patients with specific CFTR sequence variants.","group":"g1","id":"8ce9e5f3-5cc7-4d6d-8092-02318db4bc18","_showDetails":true},"bdc41985-8a25-4108-aaf3-81752dfbcf68":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Prenatal indole-3-carbinol administration activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor-responsive genes and attenuates lung injury in a bronchopulmonary dysplasia model.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1535370220963789","authors":["Guzman-Navarro, Gabriela","Leon, Mario Bermudez de","Martin-Estal, Irene","Duran, Raquel Cuevas-Diaz","Villarreal-Alvarado, Laura","Vaquera-Vazquez, Anakaren","Cuevas-Cerda, Tania","Garza-Garcia, Karina","Cuervo-Perez, Luis Eduardo","Barbosa-Quintana, Alvaro","Perez-Saucedo, Jose Eduardo","Lara-Diaz, Victor J","Castorena-Torres, Fabiola"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20201104//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Cytokines/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Fibrosis","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","Hypoxia/co [Complications]","Hypoxia/ge [Genetics]","*Indoles/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Indoles/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Inflammation Mediators/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung Injury/co [Complications]","*Lung Injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Lung Injury/ge [Genetics]","Pregnancy","*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","*Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/me [Metabolism]","Weight Gain","Rats"],"journal":"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","volume":"246","number":"6","isbn":"1535-3699","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33148012"],"address":"England","abstract":"Hyperoxia-hypoxia exposure is a proposed cause of alveolar developmental arrest in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants, where mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress vulnerability are increased. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is one of the main activators of the antioxidant enzyme system that protects tissues and systems from damage. The present study aimed to determine if the activation of the AhR signaling pathway by prenatal administration of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) protects rat pups from hyperoxia-hypoxia-induced lung injury. To assess the activation of protein-encoding genes related to the AhR signaling pathway (Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, Ugt1a6, Nqo1, and Gsta1), pup lungs were excised at 0, 24, and 72 h after birth, and mRNA expression levels were quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays (RT-qPCR). An adapted Ratner's method was used in rats to evaluate radial alveolar counts (RACs) and the degree of fibrosis. The results reveal that the relative expression of AhR-related genes in rat pups of prenatally I3C-treated dams was significantly different from that of untreated dams. The RAC was significantly lower in the hyperoxia-hypoxia group (4.0 +/- 1.0) than that in the unexposed control group (8.0 +/- 2.0; P < 0.01). When rat pups of prenatally I3C-treated dams were exposed to hyperoxia-hypoxia, an RAC recovery was observed, and the fibrosis index was similar to that of the unexposed control group. A cytokine antibody array revealed an increase in the NF-kappaB signaling cascade in I3C-treated pups, suggesting that the pathway could regulate the inflammatory process under the stimulus of this compound. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that I3C prenatal treatment activates AhR-responsive genes in pup's lungs and hence attenuates lung damage caused by hyperoxia-hypoxia exposure in newborns.","group":"g3","id":"bdc41985-8a25-4108-aaf3-81752dfbcf68","_showDetails":true},"38b9021a-ba37-4384-8da0-f8ad10c6ec92":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Influence of perinatal complications on the development of a sample of 36-month-old premature infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2020.101507","authors":["Lopez-Hernandez, Angela Maria","Padilla-Munoz, Eva Maria","Duque-Sanchez, Cristina","Lanzarote-Fernandez, Maria Dolores"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20201201//","keywords":["Child","Child Development","Child, Preschool","Cognition","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases","Language Development"],"journal":"Infant behavior & development","volume":"62","isbn":"0163-6383","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33271470"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The lack of clear results in previous studies for this context makes us consider an exploratory study.

Hyperoxia has been used to mimic the disease in newborn rodents. The use of a second hit to induce systemic inflammation has been suggested as an added strategy to better mimic the inflammatory aspect of BPD. Here we report a novel 2 hit (2HIT) BPD model with in-depth characterization of the innate immune response, enabling mechanistic studies of therapies with an immunomodulatory component., METHODS: C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 85% O2 from postnatal day (P)1 to P7, and received postnatally (P3) Escherichia coli LPS. At various timepoints, immune activation in the lung and at the systemic level was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and gene and protein expressions., RESULTS: 2HIT mice showed fewer alveoli, increased lung compliance, and right ventricular hypertrophy. A transient proinflammatory cytokine response was observed locally and systemically. Type 2 anti-inflammatory cytokine expression was decreased in the lung together with the number of mature alveolar macrophages. Simultaneously, a Siglec-F intermediate macrophage population emerged., CONCLUSION: This study provides long-term analysis of the 2HIT model, suggesting impairment of type 2 cytokine environment and altered alveolar macrophage profile in the lung., IMPACT: We have developed a novel 2HIT mouse BPD model with postnatal LPS and hyperoxia exposure, which enables mechanistic studies of potential therapeutic strategies with an immunomodulatory component. This is the first report of in-depth characterization of the lung injury and recovery describing the evolution of the innate immune response in a standardized mouse model for experimental BPD with postnatal LPS and hyperoxia exposure. The 2HIT model has the potential to help understand the link between inflammation and impaired lung development, and will enable testing of new therapies in a short and more robust manner.","group":"g1","id":"83a46168-c0ef-4a08-aa05-eee6e1c4b100","_showDetails":false},"df97ae00-a203-44d7-abe9-d645e2bd9606":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Effect of targeted vs standard fortification of breast milk on growth and development of preterm infants (<= 32 weeks): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-020-04841-x","authors":["Seliga-Siwecka, Joanna","Chmielewska, Anna","Jasinska, Katarzyna"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20201123//","keywords":["Female","Food, Fortified","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","*Milk, Human","Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Weight Gain"],"journal":"Trials","volume":"21","number":"1","isbn":"1745-6215","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33225961"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Human milk is recommended for all very low birth weight infants.

The role and regulation of SDF-1 expression in preterm lungs, of potential relevance for MSC-based cell therapy for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal pattern of CXCR4/SDF-1 expression in lungs of extremely preterm infants at risk for BPD. Methods: Postmortem lung samples were collected from ventilated extremely preterm infants who died between 23 and 29 wks (\"short-term ventilated\") or between 36 and 39 wks (\"long-term ventilated\") corrected postmenstrual age. Results were compared with age-matched infants who had lived <12 h or stillborn infants (\"early\" and \"late\" controls). CXCR4 and SDF-1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy, and qRT-PCR analysis. Results: Compared with age-matched controls without antenatal infection, lungs of early control infants with evidence of intrauterine infection/inflammation showed significant upregulation of SDF-1 expression, localized to the respiratory epithelium, and of CXCR4 expression, localized to stromal cells. Similarly, pulmonary SDF-1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in long-term ventilated ex-premature infants with established BPD than in age-matched controls. The pulmonary vasculature was devoid of SDF-1 expression at all time points. Endogenous CXCR4-positive stromal cells were preferentially localized along the basal aspect of SDF-1-positive bronchial and respiratory epithelial cells, suggestive of functionality of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis. Conclusions: Incipient and established neonatal lung injury is associated with upregulation of SDF-1 expression, restricted to the respiratory epithelium. Knowledge of the clinical associations, time-course and localization of pulmonary SDF-1 expression may guide decisions about the optimal timing and delivery route of MSC-based cell therapy for BPD.","group":"g1","id":"a2a095b7-c850-4ab5-a2df-b216e01cfbc1","_showDetails":true},"8fa8f87e-8090-41fe-9f41-4f739af6c9ba":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"A complex of regional ecological and medico-social factors: evaluation of dysplastic dependent pathology of the bronchopulmonary system.","authors":["Barchan, Ganna","Demikhov, Oleksii","Cherkashyna, Lidiya","Shklyar, Anton","Dehtyarova, Iya","Demikhova, Nadiia"],"date":"2020//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Child","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Pregnancy","Prevalence","Risk Assessment","Risk Factors"],"journal":"Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego","volume":"48","number":"283","isbn":"1426-9686","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med17&NEWS=N&AN=32218407"],"address":"Poland","abstract":"Respiratory diseases are becoming one of the most widespread threats to the world's population. It is important to focus on new public health management mechanisms for the development and promotion of public health at the national and municipal levels. Dysplastic dependent pathology (DDP) of the bronchopulmonary system (BPS) is a group of diseases or conditions, which includes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), recurrent bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, obliterating bronchiolitis, interstitial lung disease. The formation of the risk of these diseases and pathological conditions is influenced by several (to date, almost unexplored) factors, among which are medico-social, regional ecological and other influential factors of periods of child development., AIM: The aim of the study was to substantiate evidence-based (clinically and statistically) algorithm for risk assessment by a set of regional ecological factors relevant for the assessment of the health of children with dysplastic dependent pathology of the bronchopulmonary system., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A personalized analysis of the existing factors in 252 children (with BPD and DDP BPS) of two administrative regions of Ukraine and 252 healthy children groups of comparison group was accomplished. While examining the regional-population characteristics of healthy and sick children, specially compiled expert-prognostic chart was used, that was completed for each child and included data on BPD or DDP BPS presence, and characteristics of the regional ecological clusters. Based on the study of the true prevalence of 30 possible risk factors, the most informative ones were identified, the prognostic value of which was used as criteria for the risk assessment of bronchopulmonary system disease in children. Based on the methodology of Wald's sequential analysis in the modification of E.V. Gubler a standardized threatometric (pathometric) tabular algorithm was compiled and an example of its application at the individual level was provided. The application of this algorithm allows to document the available significant risk factors and to identify individuals (and homogeneous territorially ontogenetic groups) with high risk of bronchopulmonary system diseases., RESULTS: The algorithm verification was carried out among children of two groups and was stated, that the error frequency of the first kind amounted to alpha=3,0%, while errors of the second kind (low risk with pathology was identified) beta=7,2%. Thus, the specificity of the prognostic algorithm is 92,8%, and its efficiency is 97,0%, which enables to recommend it as a stage of population monitoring., CONCLUSIONS: Prospects for further research on this issue are determined by the need to develop the algorithms for population and individual prognosis of bronchopulmonary system disease in the antenatal period and at the stages of postnatal ontogeny, considering other informative (medical, organizational, genealogical and anamnestic) factors.

We further estimate the cumulative incidence of major complications associated with BPD, differentiated by BPD severity and gestational age category., RESULTS: We find, on average, patients with BPD and resulting complications will incur over CAD$700,000 in lifetime health systems costs. We also find the average life expectancy of BPD patients to be moderately less than that of the general population and significant reductions in quality-adjusted life year due to major complications. Healthcare utilization and quality of life measures vary dramatically according to BPD severity, suggesting significant therapeutic headroom for interventions that can prevent or mitigate the effects of BPD for patients., CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds a significant expansion of existing evidence by presenting the lifetime burden of BPD based on key patient characteristics.

Methods: Thirty BPD infants were treated by dexamethasone. Among these cases, dexamethasone was significant effective in 10 cases, and no significant effective in 20 cases. These patients were divided into two groups as the significant effect (SE) group (n=10) and the non-significant effect (NE) group (n=20) according to the curative effect of dexamethasone. Fifteen non-BPD infants with gestational age and gender matching were selected as the control group. Plasma samples before and after dexamethasone treatment were collected from three infants chosen randomly from SEG for the data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis. ELISA was further used to detect the levels of differential proteins LRP1 and S100A8 in all individuals, including SE, NE and control groups. Results: DIA analysis results showed that after dexamethasone treatment, there were a total of 52 plasma proteins that showed significant differences, of which 43 proteins were down-regulated and 9 proteins were up-regulated. LRP1 and S100A8 were two plasma proteins that were significantly changed after dexamethasone treatment. Compared with the control group, plasma LRP1 was significantly increased in BPD. Interestingly, the plasma concentration of LRP1 in the NE group was significantly higher than that in the SE group. S100A8, as an indicator of plasma inflammation, was significantly higher in BPD than the control group. Unlike LRP1, there was no significantly difference between the SE and NE group (P=0.279) before dexamethasone treatment. Conclusion:  Elevated plasma LRP1 and S100A8 in BPD infants are two indicators that correlated with the efficacy of dexamethasone, and might be used as biomarkers for deciding the use of adjuvant corticosteroids therapy in the BPD.

Infants with BPD often have brain injury that leads to long-term neurodevelopmental impairment, but the underlying mechanisms that control BPD-induced neurodevelopmental impairment remain unclear. Our previous studies have shown that hyperoxia-induced BPD in rodents is associated with lung inflammasome activation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that hyperoxia-induced lung and brain injury is mediated by inflammasome activation, and that inhibition of caspase-1, a key component of the inflammasome, attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung and brain injury in neonatal mice. C57/BL6 mouse pups were randomized to receive daily intraperitoneal injections of Ac-YVAD-CMK, an irreversible caspase-1 inhibitor, or placebo during exposure to room air or hyperoxia (85% O2) for 10 days. We found that hyperoxia activated the NLRP1 inflammasome, increased production of mature IL-1beta, and upregulated expression of p30 gasdermin-D (GSDMD), the active form of GSDMD that is responsible for the programmed cell death mechanism of pyroptosis in both lung and brain tissue. Importantly, we show that inhibition of caspase-1 decreased IL-1beta activation and p30 GSDMD expression, and improved alveolar and vascular development in hyperoxia-exposed lungs. Moreover, caspase-1 inhibition also promoted cell proliferation in the subgranular zone and subventricular zone of hyperoxia-exposed brains, resulting in lessened atrophy of these zones. Thus, the inflammasome plays a critical role in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung and brain injury, and targeting this pathway may be beneficial for the prevention of lung and brain injury in preterm infants.","group":"g3","id":"4ebf1758-2393-4d4a-8f57-632cc25234c4","_showDetails":true},"7ad4f694-b6a1-4e18-b177-8af8b08195a0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Broad spectrum antibiotics in newborns increase multi-drug resistant infections.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1120009X.2018.1556832","authors":["Alonso-Ojembarrena, Almudena","Martinez-Diaz, Jose Vicente","Lechuga-Sancho, Alfonso Maria","Galan-Sanchez, Fatima","Lubian-Lopez, Simon Pedro"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190124//","keywords":["*Anti-Bacterial Agents/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Bacterial Infections/co [Complications]","Bacterial Infections/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mi [Microbiology]","Case-Control Studies","*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/de [Drug Effects]","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Male","Prognosis"],"journal":"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)","volume":"31","number":"2","isbn":"1120-009X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=30676292"],"address":"England","abstract":"Our objective was to determine if broad spectrum antibiotics (BSA) are associated with multi-resistant bacterial (MRB) infections in neonatal patients.

Very little is known about how this affects their quality of life, since no sensitive instrument is available to measure health-related quality of life in this population. In this study, a Dutch parent-proxy instrument was developed for this purpose., METHODS: A list of items was generated after literature search and interviews with both parents of patients and clinical experts. Clinically relevant items were selected with the clinical impact method and item analysis. Results of clinical tests to measure complications in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were correlated with these items to select the items that show construct validity. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to estimate internal consistency of the items in the final questionnaire., RESULTS: In total, 92 children and their parents and 7 clinicians participated. Of 130 identified items, 47 showed clinical relevance. Spirometry, the Child Behavior Checklist, mean arterial pressure, and body mass index were used to determine construct validity of 33 items. These items were structured within five domains: pulmonary complaints, school functioning, growth and nutrition, exercise and locomotion, emotional functioning and health care concerns. The questionnaire showed excellent internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha of 0.919., CONCLUSION: This study developed a disease-specific parent-proxy instrument to measure health-related quality of life in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia aged 4-8 years old, the BPD-QoL. All included items show construct validity and internal consistency reliability. Future research should focus on further validation and analysis of responsiveness and reliability.","group":"g1","id":"0d4311c7-0dce-4002-bc4a-409fa1ee9ee6","_showDetails":true},"424cac56-d6ce-413e-8e6d-a8dfc9f47680":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Elafin Treatment Rescues EGFR-Klf4 Signaling and Lung Cell Survival in Ventilated Newborn Mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2017-0332OC","authors":["Alejandre Alcazar, Miguel A","Kaschwich, Mark","Ertsey, Robert","Preuss, Stefanie","Milla, Carlos","Mujahid, Sana","Masumi, Juliet","Khan, Suleman","Mokres, Lucia M","Tian, Lu","Mohr, Jasmine","Hirani, Dharmesh V","Rabinovitch, Marlene","Bland, Richard D"],"date":"2018//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Apoptosis/de [Drug Effects]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Cell Survival","Cells, Cultured","*Elafin/pd [Pharmacology]","*ErbB Receptors/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Kruppel-Like Factor 4","*Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/me [Metabolism]","Longitudinal Studies","Mice","Mice, Inbred BALB C","Organogenesis","Pancreatic Elastase/me [Metabolism]","Protease Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","*Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","Signal Transduction"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"59","number":"5","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=29894205"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Mechanical ventilation with O2-rich gas (MV-O2) inhibits alveologenesis and lung growth. We previously showed that MV-O2 increased elastase activity and apoptosis in lungs of newborn mice, whereas elastase inhibition by elafin suppressed apoptosis and enabled lung growth. Pilot studies suggested that MV-O2 reduces lung expression of prosurvival factors phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (pEGFR) and Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). Here, we sought to determine whether apoptosis and lung growth arrest evoked by MV-O2 reflect disrupted pEGFR-Klf4 signaling, which elafin treatment preserves, and to assess potential biomarkers of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Five-day-old mice underwent MV with air or 40% O2 for 8-24 hours with or without elafin treatment. Unventilated pups served as controls. Immunoblots were used to assess lung pEGFR and Klf4 proteins. Cultured MLE-12 cells were exposed to AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor), Klf4 siRNA, or vehicle to assess effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and EGFR regulation of Klf4. Plasma elastase and elafin levels were measured in extremely premature infants. In newborn mice, MV with air or 40% O2 inhibited EGFR phosphorylation and suppressed Klf4 protein content in lungs (vs. unventilated controls), yielding increased apoptosis. Elafin treatment inhibited elastase, preserved lung pEGFR and Klf4, and attenuated the apoptosis observed in lungs of vehicle-treated mice. In MLE-12 studies, pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and siRNA suppression of Klf4 increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation, and EGFR inhibition decreased Klf4. Plasma elastase levels were more than twofold higher, without a compensating increase of plasma elafin, in infants with BPD, compared to infants without BPD. These findings indicate that pEGFR-Klf4 is a novel prosurvival signaling pathway in lung epithelium that MV disrupts. Elafin preserves pEGFR-Klf4 signaling and inhibits apoptosis, thereby enabling lung growth during MV. Together, our animal and human data raise the question: would elastase inhibition prevent BPD in high-risk infants exposed to MV-O2?","group":"g1","id":"424cac56-d6ce-413e-8e6d-a8dfc9f47680","_showDetails":true},"90a71a3e-f830-4ff1-8b84-29c748792504":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"[Morbidity in Prematurity Associated with Fetal Growth Restriction: Experience of a Tertiary Care Center].","journal":"Acta medica portuguesa","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.20344/amp.9599","authors":["Silva, Noemia Rosado","Oliveira, Joana","Berenguer, Alberto","Graca, Andre M","Abrantes, Margarida","Moniz, Carlos"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20181130//","keywords":["Adult","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","Case-Control Studies","Enterocolitis, Necrotizing/ep [Epidemiology]","Female","Fetal Growth Retardation/ep [Epidemiology]","*Fetal Growth Retardation","*Gestational Age","Humans","Incidence","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Infant, Small for Gestational Age","Male","Morbidity","Neonatal Sepsis/ep [Epidemiology]","Portugal/ep [Epidemiology]","Pre-Eclampsia","Pregnancy","Retinopathy of Prematurity/ep [Epidemiology]","Retrospective Studies","Risk Factors","Tertiary Care Centers/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]"],"volume":"31","number":"11","isbn":"0870-399X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=30521458"],"address":"Portugal","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Prematurity and low birth weight have been associated with increased neonatal morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate possible risk factors for prematurity associated with fetal growth restriction and being small for gestational age and to determine the incidence of morbidity in these two groups of infants., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective case-control study of newborns with gestational age of less than 32 weeks, with obstetric diagnosis of fetal growth restriction and with the clinical diagnosis of small for gestational age, admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary hospital for a period of six years., RESULTS: A total of 356 newborns were studied, with an incidence of 11% of fetal growth restriction and 18% of small for gestational age. Pre-eclampsia was the risk factor for gestation with higher statistical significance (47% vs 16%, p < 0.001) in small for gestational age newborns. There was also a higher incidence of mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia (66% vs 38%, p = 0.005), late sepsis (59% vs 37%, p = 0.003), retinopathy of prematurity (58% vs 26%, p = 0.003) and necrotizing enterocolitis (20% vs 9%, p = 0.005). Mortality was similar in all three groups., DISCUSSION: There were fewer newborn males diagnosed with fetal growth restriction during pregnancy compared to women. Significant differences were observed in the group of these infants regarding the occurrence of chorioamnionitis and pre-eclampsia in comparison to the control group. Newborns with fetal growth restriction and small for age had higher scores on clinical risk indices compared to the control group. In general, small for gestational age newborns had a higher incidence of morbidity than infants with fetal growth restriction and the control group., CONCLUSION: Advances in neonatal intensive care decreased mortality in preterm infants. However, there are still significant differences in the incidence of morbidity in newborns with growth compromise. The collaboration between obstetricians and neonatologists provides the basis for a correct clinical evaluation, early signaling and global intervention on these newborns, with a significant impact on short and long-term prognosis.","group":"g1","id":"90a71a3e-f830-4ff1-8b84-29c748792504","_showDetails":true},"04823180-0a8d-4ba4-8ad1-6785f789b43e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"A study of spectrum of pulmonary pathology and expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 during neonatal period.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_650_17","authors":["Das, Indranil","Das, Ram Narayan","Paul, Biswanath","Mandal, Bappa","Mukherjee, Suchandra","Chatterjee, Uttara"],"date":"2018//","keywords":["Autopsy","Female","Humans","Hyaline Membrane Disease/di [Diagnosis]","India/ep [Epidemiology]","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Newborn, Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","Infant, Newborn, Diseases/et [Etiology]","*Infant, Newborn, Diseases/mo [Mortality]","Infant, Newborn, Diseases/pa [Pathology]","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Lung/ah [Anatomy & Histology]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung Diseases/co [Complications]","*Lung Diseases/ge [Genetics]","Lung Diseases/mo [Mortality]","Lung Diseases/pa [Pathology]","Male","Pneumonia/di [Diagnosis]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Sepsis","*Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Indian journal of pathology & microbiology","volume":"61","number":"3","isbn":"0377-4929","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=30004050"],"address":"India","abstract":"CONTEXT: Neonatal period is the single most hazardous period of life. The major causes of neonatal death are prematurity and respiratory distress syndrome. We report a series of neonatal autopsies in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with special emphasis on pulmonary pathology. The spectrum of pathological changes in the lungs and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression was studied in detail with reference to its spatial distribution., AIMS: This study aims to analyze the causes of neonatal death with special attention to pulmonary pathology along with associated histopathological changes in lungs. We also evaluated the expression of TTF-1 at different levels of the airway., MATERIALS AND METHODS: After taking consent and anthropometric measurements, autopsy was performed. Weights of all organs were taken, and histological sections were examined under hematoxylin and eosin stain. TTF-1 immunostaining was done on lung sections. Localization of TTF-1 was evaluated at the intrapulmonary level of terminal bronchioles (TBs), distal bronchioles, and alveoli., RESULTS: We performed a series of 25 autopsies in neonates. In our series, most of the neonates were preterm (64%), had low birth weight (44%), and died within the first 7 days of life (80%). Majority (60%) of the neonates died due to pulmonary causes, followed by septicemia (24%), congenital anomalies (12%), and birth injury (4%). Among the respiratory causes, hyaline membrane disease (HMD) was diagnosed in maximum number of cases (32%), followed by pneumonia (12%) and pulmonary hemorrhage (12%). The TTF-1 expression in TBs, distal airways, and alveoli was significantly reduced or absent in cases of HMD compared to the control group., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that HMD is the most common cause of perinatal death among respiratory disorders, and in this disease, the expression of TTF-1 is significantly reduced in TBs, distal airways, and alveoli compared to the control group.","group":"g1","id":"04823180-0a8d-4ba4-8ad1-6785f789b43e","_showDetails":false},"02f9661b-5dcc-42da-b50f-32812b4fc7f6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Hyperoxia induces epigenetic changes in newborn mice lungs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.04.566","authors":["Bik-Multanowski, Miroslaw","Revhaug, Cecilie","Grabowska, Agnieszka","Dobosz, Artur","Madetko-Talowska, Anna","Zasada, Magdalena","Saugstad, Ola Didrik"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180423//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*DNA Methylation","*Disease Models, Animal","*Epigenesis, Genetic","Female","*Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Lung Injury/ge [Genetics]","*Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Signal Transduction"],"journal":"Free radical biology & medicine","volume":"121","isbn":"0891-5849","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=29698744"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Supplemental oxygen exposure is a risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Reactive oxygen species may damage lung tissue, but hyperoxia also has the potential to alter genome activity via changes in DNA methylation. Understanding the epigenetic potential of hyperoxia would enable further improvement of the therapeutic strategies for BPD. Here we aimed to identify hyperoxia-related alterations in DNA methylation, which could affect the activity of crucial genetic pathways involved in the development of hyperoxic lung injury. Newborn mice (n=24) were randomized to hyperoxia (85% O2) or normoxia groups for 14 days, followed by normoxia for the subsequent 14 days. The mice were sacrificed on day 28, and lung tissue was analyzed using microarrays developed for the assessment of genome methylation and expression profiles. The mean DNA methylation level was higher in the hyperoxia group than the normoxia group. The analysis of specific DNA fragments revealed hypermethylation of >1000 gene promoters in the hyperoxia group, confirming the presence of the DNA-hypermethylation effect of hyperoxia. Further analysis showed significant enrichment of the TGF-beta signaling pathway (p=0.0013). The hypermethylated genes included Tgfbr1, Crebbp, and Creb1, which play central roles in the TGF-beta signaling pathway and cell cycle regulation. Genome expression analysis revealed in the hyperoxia group complementary downregulation of genes that are crucial for cell cycle regulation (Crebbp, Smad2, and Smad3). These results suggest the involvement of the methylation of TGF-beta pathway genes in lung tissue reaction to hyperoxia. The data also suggest that hyperoxia may be a programming factor in newborn mice. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of vitamin D on hyperoxia-induced BPD and elucidate the underlying mechanisms., METHODS: Neonatal rats were exposed to either room air (control) or 75% O2 (hyperoxia) and intraperitoneally injected with vitamin D3. After 14 days, a histopathological examination was performed in the lungs of rats. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured by liquid chromatography-tandom mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS. Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) were measured by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The messenger RNA and protein levels of vitamin D receptor (VDR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis, respectively., RESULTS: Treatment with vitamin D3 increased serum 25OHD and upregulated VDR in lung tissues with or without hyperoxia. In addition, treatment with vitamin D3 attenuated alveolar simplification, increased VEGF and VEGFR2, and protected alveolar simplification induced by hyperoxia. Furthermore, treatment with vitamin D3 resulted in a decrease of IL-1beta and IFN-gamma and an increase of HIF-1alpha in lung tissues under hyperoxia conditions., CONCLUSION: Vitamin D exerts protective effects on hyperoxia-induced BPD in neonatal rats by regulating vitamin D-VDR signaling pathways.

The average scores for children with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia were compared across the fve domains of the scale. Associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were investigated for domains that showed signifcant diferences between the two groups. Associations between exposure and outcome were estimated via multivariate logistic regression., RESULTS:: There were no diferences in averages for the full-scale intelligence quotient, verbal intelligence quotient, performance intelligence quotient and general language composite domains. The processing speed quotient was the only domain that presented a signifcant diference between the two groups (P = 0.02). Among the children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, low full-scale intelligence quotient was observed in 28.1%. In the multivariate analysis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (odds ratio: 3.1; 95conf-dence interval: 1.1-8.7) remained associated with the outcome of processing speed quotient., CONCLUSION:: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was an independent risk factor for alteration of the processing speed quotient.","group":"g1","id":"3925fe87-fae9-46dd-afdf-e7df9d7c7a13","_showDetails":true},"30726b91-bea2-428b-9745-ac1d063f9db3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Inhibition of IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling prevents LPS-induced IL1beta expression without increasing apoptosis in the developing mouse lung.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pr.2017.182","authors":["McKenna, Sarah","Butler, Brittany","Jatana, Laurie","Ghosh, Sankar","Wright, Clyde J"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20170823//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Apoptosis/de [Drug Effects]","Cell Line","*I-kappa B Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Interleukin-1beta/ge [Genetics]","*Interleukin-1beta/me [Metabolism]","*Lipopolysaccharides/pd [Pharmacology]","Lung/cy [Cytology]","*Lung/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Macrophages/cy [Cytology]","Macrophages/de [Drug Effects]","Macrophages/me [Metabolism]","Mice","Mice, Inbred ICR","*NF-kappa B/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger","*Signal Transduction/de [Drug Effects]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"82","number":"6","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=28753596"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BackgroundThe pro-inflammatory consequences of IL1beta expression contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Selectively targeting Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling attenuates IL1beta mRNA expression in macrophages. Whether targeting IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling affects the anti-apoptotic gene expression, a known consequence of global LPS-induced NFkappaB inhibition, is unknown. Methods Macrophages (RAW 264.7, bone marrow-derived macrophage) were assessed for LPS-induced IL1beta mRNA/protein expression, anti-apoptotic gene expression, cell viability (trypan blue exclusion), and activation of apoptosis (caspase-3 and PARP cleavage) following pharmacologic and genetic attenuation of IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling. Expressions of IL1beta and anti-apoptotic genes were assessed in endotoxemic newborn mice (P0) with intact (WT), absent (IkappaBbeta KO), and attenuated (IkappaBbeta overexpressing) IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling. Results In cultured macrophages, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of LPS-induced IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling significantly attenuated IL1beta mRNA and protein expression. Importantly, targeting IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling did not attenuate LPS-induced expression of anti-apoptotic genes or result in cell death. In endotoxemic neonatal mice, targeting LPS-induced IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling significantly attenuated pulmonary IL1beta expression without affecting the anti-apoptotic gene expression. Conclusion Targeting IkappaBbeta/NFkappaB signaling prevents LPS-induced IL1beta expression without inducing apoptosis in cultured macrophages and in the lungs of endotoxemic newborn mice. Inhibiting this pathway may prevent inflammatory injury without affecting the protective role of NFkappaB activity in the developing lung.","group":"g1","id":"30726b91-bea2-428b-9745-ac1d063f9db3","_showDetails":false},"e93f1179-e5ba-4bbd-a22e-b1912fb98921":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Glucocorticoids Retain Bipotent Fibroblast Progenitors during Alveolar Septation in Mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2016-0376OC","authors":["McGowan, Stephen E","McCoy, Diann M"],"date":"2017//","keywords":["Adipocytes, Brown/cy [Cytology]","Adipocytes, Brown/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Cell Proliferation/de [Drug Effects]","Dexamethasone/pd [Pharmacology]","*Fibroblasts/cy [Cytology]","Fibroblasts/de [Drug Effects]","Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","*Glucocorticoids/pd [Pharmacology]","Green Fluorescent Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Lipid Droplets/de [Drug Effects]","Lipid Droplets/me [Metabolism]","Lipid Metabolism/de [Drug Effects]","Mice","Mifepristone/pd [Pharmacology]","Phosphorylation/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/me [Metabolism]","Signal Transduction","Smad Proteins/me [Metabolism]","*Stem Cells/cy [Cytology]","Stem Cells/de [Drug Effects]","Stem Cells/me [Metabolism]","Uncoupling Protein 1/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"57","number":"1","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=28530121"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Glucocorticoids have been widely used and exert pleiotropic effects on alveolar structure and function, but do not improve the long-term clinical outcomes for patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, emphysema, or interstitial lung diseases. Treatments that foster alveolar regeneration could substantially improve the long-term outcomes for such patients. One approach to alveolar regeneration is to stimulate and guide intrinsic alveolar progenitors along developmental pathways used during secondary septation. Other investigators and we have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha-expressing fibroblast subpopulations that are alternatively skewed toward myofibroblast or lipofibroblast phenotypes. In this study, we administered either the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (Dex) or the antagonist mifepristone to mice during the first postnatal week and evaluated their effects on cellular proliferation and adoption of alpha-smooth muscle actin and lipid droplets (markers of the myofibroblast and lipofibroblast phenotypes, respectively). We observed that Dex increased the relative abundance of fibroblasts with progenitor characteristics, i.e., containing both alpha-smooth muscle actin and lipid droplets, uncoupling protein-1 (a marker of brown and beige adipocytes), delta-like ligand-1, and stem cell antigen-1. Dex enhanced signaling through the Smad1/5 pathway, which increased uncoupling protein-1 in a lung fibroblast progenitor cell line. We conclude that glucocorticoid receptor manipulation can sustain fibroblast plasticity, and posit that targeting downstream glucocorticoid responsive pathways could steer fibroblast progenitors along more desirable regenerative pathways.","group":"g1","id":"e93f1179-e5ba-4bbd-a22e-b1912fb98921","_showDetails":true},"3cc7f4f4-700e-4a5e-948e-ef08ed58d2e4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Clara Cell Protein Expression in Mechanically Ventilated Term and Preterm Infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome and at Risk of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: A Pilot Study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/8074678","authors":["Guzman-Barcenas, Jose","Calderon-Moore, Antonio","Baptista-Gonzalez, Hector","Irles, Claudine"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20170411//","keywords":["Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","Pilot Projects","*Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/co [Complications]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/me [Metabolism]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/th [Therapy]","Uteroglobin/an [Analysis]","*Uteroglobin/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Canadian respiratory journal","volume":"2017","isbn":"1198-2241","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=28487624"],"address":"Egypt","abstract":"The aim of this pilot study was to determine Clara cell protein (CC16) concentration in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) fluid from full-term and preterm (<37 weeks' gestational age) neonates requiring respiratory support, having symptoms of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

The children's clinical data and residual blood samples obtained from the routine examination of 0, 7, 14 and 28 days of hospitalization were collected, and PBMCs were isolated and cryopreserved in -80DegreesCelsius refrigerator. Twenty children diagnosed with BPD were enrolled as a BPD group, and other sex-matched 20 children without BPD were randomly chosen as a non-BPD group. The children's clinical data were retrospectively analyzed, and SIRT1 expression in the PBMCs of each group was measured by Western blotting. Furthermore, the role of SIRT1 expression in the occurrence and development of BPD in premature infants was also analyzed.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in many human diseases. However, the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of BPD remains poorly understood. Here, we exposed neonatal C57BL/6J mice to 95% concentrations of ambient oxygen and established a mouse lung injury model that mimicked human BPD. Next, we compared lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles between BPD and normal lung tissues using a high-throughput mouse lncRNA + mRNA array system. Compared with the control group, 882 lncRNAs were upregulated, and 887 lncRNAs were downregulated in BPD lung tissues. We validated some candidate BPD-associated lncRNAs by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis in eight pairs of BPD and normal lung tissues. Gene ontology, pathway and bioinformatics analyses revealed that a downregulated lncRNA, namely AK033210, associated with tenascin C may be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to reveal differential lncRNA expression in BPD, which provides a foundation for further understanding of the molecular mechanism of BPD development.

Elastin deposition to the distal tips of the secondary septa is critical for elongation of the secondary septa. Alveolar myofibroblasts, which are thought to migrate to the septal tips during alveolarization, are mainly responsible for elastin production and deposition. Antenatal exposure to inflammation induces abnormal elastin deposition, thereby increasing the risk of developing BPD. Here, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased the expression of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) in an LPS-induced rat model of BPD and in LPS-treated human pulmonary epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). In addition, in vitro experiments suggested that LPS upregulated TGF-alpha expression via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) signaling. Increased TGF-alpha levels via its receptor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced lysyl oxidase (LOX) overactivation and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) activity inhibition of myofibroblasts. Similarly, in vivo LOX overactivation and inhibition of Cdc42 activity were observed in the lungs of LPS-exposed pups. LOX overactivation led to abnormal elastin deposition, and inhibition of Cdc42 activity disturbed the directional migration of myofibroblasts and disrupted elastin localization. Most importantly, the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib partially rescued LOX overactivation and Cdc42 activity inhibition, and improved elastin deposition and alveolar development in antenatal LPS-treated rats. Taken together, our data suggest that TGF-alpha/EGFR signaling is critically involved in the regulation of elastin deposition and represents a novel therapeutic target. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Previous genome-wide analysis studies in preterm infants indicate that pathways of miR 219-5p are important in infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Here we report a prospective cohort study of extremely preterm neonates wherein infants diagnosed with severe BPD expressed increased airway miR-219-5p and decreased platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha), a target of mir-219-5p and a key regulator of alveolarization, compared to post-conception age-matched term infants., RESULTS: miR-219-5p was highly expressed in the pulmonary epithelial lining in lungs of infants with BPD by in situ hybridization of human infant lungs. In both in vitro and in vivo (mouse) models of BPD, miR-219-5p was increased on exposure to hyperoxia compared with the normoxia control, with a complementary decrease of PDGFR-alpha. To further confirm the target relationship between miR-219 and PDGFR-alpha, pulmonary epithelial cells (MLE12) and lung primary fibroblasts were treated with a mimic of miR-219-5p and a locked nucleic acid (LNA) based inhibitor of miR-219-5p. In comparison with the control group, the level of miR-219 increased significantly after miR-219 mimic treatment, while the level of PDGFR-alpha declined markedly. LNA exposure increased PDGFR-alpha. Moreover, in BPD mouse model, over-expression of miR-219-5p inhibited alveolar development, indicated by larger alveolar spaces accompanied by reduced septation., CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that increased miR-219-5p contributes to the pathogenesis of BPD by targeting and reducing PDGFR-alpha. The use of specific miRNA antagonists may be a therapeutic strategy for preventing the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"c76d32cc-e2c5-4358-935d-4699d1ec87fc","_showDetails":true},"980b750b-34b0-43f4-bb6e-14397dd39d24":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Intussusceptive-like angiogenesis in human fetal lung xenografts: Link with bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated microvascular dysangiogenesis?.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/01902148.2015.1080321","authors":["De Paepe, Monique E","Chu, Sharon","Hall, Susan J","McDonnell-Clark, Elizabeth","Heger, Nicholas E","Schorl, Christoph","Mao, Quanfu","Boekelheide, Kim"],"date":"2015//","keywords":["Animals","Antigens, Neoplasm/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Carbonic Anhydrase IX","Carbonic Anhydrases/me [Metabolism]","Female","*Fetal Tissue Transplantation/ae [Adverse Effects]","Gene Expression","Heterografts","Humans","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Transplantation/ae [Adverse Effects]","Male","Mice","Mice, SCID","Microvessels/me [Metabolism]","*Microvessels/pa [Pathology]","Neovascularization, Pathologic/ge [Genetics]","*Neovascularization, Pathologic"],"journal":"Experimental lung research","volume":"41","number":"9","isbn":"0190-2148","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26495956"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Human fetal lung xenografts display an unusual pattern of non-sprouting, plexus-forming angiogenesis that is reminiscent of the dysmorphic angioarchitecture described in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

PFA was characterized by a complex network of tortuous nonsprouting vascular structures with low endothelial proliferative activity, suggestive of intussusceptive-type angiogenesis. There was no correlation between the occurrence of PFA and gestational age or time interval between delivery and engraftment. PFA was preferentially localized in the relatively hypoxic central subcapsular area. Microarray analysis suggested altered expression of 15 genes in graft regions with PFA, of which 7 are known angiogenic/lymphangiogenic regulators and 5 are known hypoxia-inducible genes. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed significant upregulation of SULF2, IGF2, and HMOX1 in graft regions with PFA., CONCLUSION: These observations in human fetal lungs ex vivo suggest that postcanalicular lungs can switch from sprouting angiogenesis to an aberrant intussusceptive-type of angiogenesis that is highly reminiscent of BPD-associated dysangiogenesis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung disease. Using a nonhuman primate model of choriodecidual infection, we sought to determine if differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with acute fetal lung injury. After inoculating 10 chronically catheterized pregnant monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) with either group B streptococcus (GBS) at 1 x 10(6) CFU (n = 5) or saline (n = 5) in the choriodecidual space, we extracted fetal lung mRNA and miRNA and profiled the changes in expression by microarray analysis. We identified 9 differentially expressed miRNAs in GBS-exposed fetal lungs, but of these, only miR-155-5p was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (P = 0.02). Significantly elevated miR-155-5p expression was also observed when immortalized human fetal airway epithelial (FeAE) cells were exposed to proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]). Overexpression of miR-155-5p in FeAE cells in turn increased the production of IL-6 and CXCL10/gamma interferon-induced protein 10, which are implicated in leukocyte recruitment but also in protection from lung injury. Interestingly, while miR-155-5p decreased fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) expression in a luciferase reporter assay, FGF9 levels were actually increased in GBS-exposed fetal lungs in vivo. FGF9 overexpression is associated with abnormal lung development. Thus, upregulation of miR-155-5p may serve as a compensatory mechanism to lessen the increase in FGF9 and prevent aberrant lung development. Understanding the complicated networks regulating lung development in the setting of infection is a key step in identifying how to prevent fetal lung injury leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

(2) Rate of delivery in tertiary hospital was 46.7% (77/165) and prenatal steroids exposure was found in 52.1% (86/165). None of the cases were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in delivery room. (3) Rate of infants who were transfered to the class III b neonatal ward within 12 hours after birth was 58.8% (97/165).

There has been a recent increased awareness that this group of babies has a higher incidence of morbidity as compared to term babies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term morbidities occurring in this group of babies managed in the neonatal unit at Singapore General Hospital (SGH)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was done of babies managed in the neonatal unit at SGH from January 2005 to December 2008. Maternal, perinatal and neonatal data were obtained from the departmental database. The outcomes of late preterm infants were compared with term infants., RESULTS: A total of 6826 babies were admitted. Ten percent (681 out of 6826) of babies were late preterm babies, making up 63% (681 out of 1081) of all preterm babies. Late preterm babies had significantly greater need for resuscitation at birth. They also had statistically significant increased risks of developing hyaline membrane disease (2.5% vs 0.1%), transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) (8.1% vs 1.7%), pneumonia (7.0% vs 2.8%), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (4.3% vs 1.1%), hypotension (0.7% vs 0%), apnoea (3.7% vs 0%), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (1.5% vs 0.3%), polycythaemia (2.2% vs 1.0%), anaemia (3.4% vs 1.2%), thrombocytopenia (3.2% vs 0.6%), hypoglycaemia (6.6% vs 1.7%), neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy (41.1% vs 12.2%) and sepsis (1.7% vs 0.6%)., CONCLUSION: Late preterm infants are indeed a vulnerable group of infants with significant morbidities that need to be addressed and treated. Despite their relatively large size and being almost term, the understanding that late preterm infants are not similar to term infants is important to both obstetricians and neonatologists.","group":"g4","id":"5dd3009e-577d-4bac-b969-9b29d6f6c7e0","_showDetails":false},"cc0bb226-13c8-4503-9f80-a780f25b7628":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Protective effects of melatonin therapy in model for neonatal hyperoxic lung injury.","authors":["Suleymanoglu, Selami","Cekmez, Ferhat","Cetinkaya, Merih","Tayman, Cuneyt","Canpolat, Fuat Emre","Kafa, Ilker Mustafa","Tanju, Asya","Arziman, Ibrahim Kursat","Fidanci, Muzaffer","Tunc, Turan","Sarici, Serdar Umit"],"date":"2014//","keywords":["*Acute Lung Injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","Acute Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","*Acute Lung Injury/pc [Prevention & Control]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Antioxidants/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Antioxidants/pd [Pharmacology]","Case-Control Studies","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Glutathione Peroxidase/me [Metabolism]","Melatonin/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Melatonin/pd [Pharmacology]","*Oxidative Stress/de [Drug Effects]","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Superoxide Dismutase/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Alternative therapies in health and medicine","volume":"20","number":"5","isbn":"1078-6791","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25141368"],"address":"United States","abstract":"CONTEXT: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common outcome of premature birth. Currently, no effective preventive therapy is available for BPD, but the major role of O2 toxicity in the development of BPD has gained attention, particularly for developing new antioxidants for prevention. The major protective mechanism of melatonin (MT) includes free-radical scavenging activity and activation of the cyclooxygenase-prostoglandin enzyme system., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of MT on cytoprotection and healing in a model of hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rats., METHODS: This is a case-control study design., SETTING: The study occurred at the Gulhane Military Medical Academy in Ankara, Turkey., INTERVENTION: A total of 60 newborn pups from dated, Sprague-Dawley, pregnant rats were divided equally into 3 groups as follows: (1) control group, (2) hyperoxia-exposed group, and (3) hyperoxia-exposed plus MT-treated group (MT group). Hyperoxia was performed by placing these pups in an oxygen chamber for 14 d during which oxygen was continuously delivered., OUTCOME MEASURES: At the end of the 14 d, lung specimens were collected and evaluation of the lamellar-body count and determination of histopathological scores were performed. Also, the activities of superoxide dysmutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed., RESULTS: The histopathological scores of the MT group were significantly lower than those of the hyperoxia-exposed group. The mean lamellar-protein and radial-alveolar counts in the MT group were found to be significantly higher than those of the hyperoxia-exposed group. Also, SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly higher and MDA levels were significantly lower in the MT group compared with the hyperoxia-exposed group., CONCLUSION: MT therapy was found to have a protective effect in a model for hyperoxic lung injury in neonatal rats. Therefore, the research team suggests that MT therapy may be used for prevention of BPD in preterm infants after confirmation of this data by future clinical studies.","group":"g1","id":"cc0bb226-13c8-4503-9f80-a780f25b7628","_showDetails":true},"97151e87-ad0c-4274-9ec7-1378bfba956c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"[Efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in premature infants with hypoxic respiratory failure].","authors":["Wei, Qiu-Fen","Pan, Xin-Nian","Li, Yan","Feng, Lin","Yao, Li-Ping","Liu, Gui-Liang","Meng, Dan-Hua","Xu, Jing","Guo, Xiao-Fang","Liu, Xian-Zhi"],"date":"2014//","keywords":["Administration, Inhalation","Blood Gas Analysis","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","Humans","*Hypoxia/co [Complications]","Incidence","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Nitric Oxide/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Respiratory Insufficiency/bl [Blood]","Respiratory Insufficiency/co [Complications]","*Respiratory Insufficiency/dt [Drug Therapy]"],"journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","volume":"16","number":"8","isbn":"1008-8830","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25140772"],"address":"China","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of low-concentration inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) among premature infants., METHODS: Sixty premature infants (gestational age <= 34 weeks) with HRF were randomized into NO and control groups between 2012 and 2013, with 30 cases in each group.

The role of the glutathione (GSH) system in lung development and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis has not been systematically investigated. The current study utilized GSH reductase-deficient (Gsr-KO) neonatal mice to test the hypothesis that early disruption of the GSH system negatively impacts lung development and hyperoxic responses. Lungs from wild-type (Gsr-WT) and Gsr-KO mice were analyzed for histopathology, developmental markers, redox indices, and transcriptome profiling at different developmental stages following exposure to room air or hyperoxia (85% O2) for up to 14 d. Lungs from Gsr-KO mice exhibited alveolar epithelial dysplasia in the embryonic and neonatal periods with relatively normal lung architecture in adulthood. GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were 50-70% lower at E19-PND14 in Gsr-KO lungs than in age-matched Gsr-WT. Differential gene expression between Gsr-WT and Gsr-KO lungs was analyzed at discrete developmental stages. Gsr-KO lungs exhibited downregulated cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoint genes at E19, as well as lung lipid metabolism and surfactant genes at PND5. In addition to abnormal baseline lung morphometry, Gsr-KO mice displayed a blunted response to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia caused a more robust upregulation of the lung thioredoxin system in Gsr-KO compared to Gsr-WT. Gsr-dependent, hyperoxia-responsive genes were highly associated with abnormal cytoskeleton, skeletal-muscular function, and tissue morphology at PND5. Overall, our data in Gsr-KO mice implicate the GSH system as a key regulator of lung development, cellular differentiation, and hyperoxic responses in neonatal mice. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Claudin (CLDN)-18.1, the only known lung-specific tight junction protein, is the most abundant claudin in alveolar epithelial type (AT) 1 cells, and is regulated by lung maturational agonists and inflammatory mediators. To determine the function of CLDN18 in the alveolar epithelium, CLDN18 knockout (KO) mice were generated and studied by histological, biochemical, and physiological approaches, in addition to whole-genome microarray. Alveolar epithelial barrier function was assessed after knockdown of CLDN18 in isolated lung cells. CLDN18 levels were measured by quantitative PCR in lung samples from fetal and postnatal human infants. We found that CLDN18 deficiency impaired alveolar epithelial barrier function in vivo and in vitro, with evidence of increased paracellular permeability and architectural distortion at AT1-AT1 cell junctions. Although CLDN18 KO mice were born without evidence of a lung abnormality, histological and gene expression analysis at Postnatal Day 3 and Week 4 identified impaired alveolarization. CLDN18 KO mice also had evidence of postnatal lung injury, including acquired AT1 cell damage. Human fetal lungs at 23-24 weeks gestational age, the highest-risk period for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a disease of impaired alveolarization, had significantly lower CLDN18 expression relative to postnatal lungs. Thus, CLDN18 deficiency results in epithelial barrier dysfunction, injury, and impaired alveolarization in mice. Low expression of CLDN18 in human fetal lungs supports further investigation into a role for this tight junction protein in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g3","id":"f5d4bd1f-996e-40a7-8c31-53ddd8f73849","_showDetails":true},"286aa711-8b3f-48bd-8de7-69e30ca5d337":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"[Effect of curcumin on bronchopulmonary dysplasia induced by 600 ml/L oxygen in neonatal rats].","authors":["Wei, Hong","Zhang, Yu","Liu, Wei","Zhang, Xiao-Ping","Feng, Li"],"date":"2014//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Curcumin/pd [Pharmacology]","*Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/me [Metabolism]","Interleukin-10/me [Metabolism]","Interleukin-6/me [Metabolism]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung Injury/ci [Chemically Induced]","Lung Injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Oxygen/ae [Adverse Effects]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley"],"journal":"Sichuan da xue xue bao.

Eight rats were randomly taken from each group and killed at 4, 7 and 14 d, respectively, after the treatment, and their lung tissues were incised for HE staining. The expressions of IL-6, IL-10 in serum and lung tissue were detected by ELISA; and the protein expression of IGF-I was measured by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS Comparing with the RA group, we found that newborn rats exposed to 600 mL/L oxygen develop a heterogeneous parenchymal lung injury with areas of arrested alveolarization and growth mixed with areas of interstitial thinning, meanwhile, both the expression of IL-6 and IL-10 in serum and lung tissue increased significantly (P < 0.05). However, in O2 + Cu group, IL-6 expression was decreased in different degrees while IL-10 increased significantly (P < 0.05). The highest expression level of IGF-I in RA group were much higher from 4 d to 7 d (alveolar development period) but significantly lower in 14 d.

We previously found that activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor (Nrf2) improved survival in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia likely due to increased expression of anti-oxidant response genes. It is not known however, whether hyperoxic induced Nrf2 activation attenuates the growth impairment caused by hyperoxia in neonatal lung. To determine if Nrf2 activation modulates cell cycle regulatory pathway genes associated with growth arrest we examined the gene expression in the lungs of Nrf2(-/-) and Nrf2(+/+) neonatal mice at one and 3days of hyperoxia exposure., METHODS: Microarray analysis was performed in neonatal Nrf2(+/+) and Nrf2(-/-) lungs exposed to one and 3days of hyperoxia. Sulforaphane, an inducer of Nrf2 was given to timed pregnant mice to determine if in utero exposure attenuated p21 and IL-6 gene expression in wildtype neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia., RESULTS: Cell cycle regulatory genes were induced in Nrf2(-/-) lung at 1day of hyperoxia. At 3days of hyperoxia, induction of cell cycle regulatory genes was similar in Nrf2(+/+) and Nrf2(-/-) lungs, despite higher inflammatory gene expression in Nrf2(-/-) lung., CONCLUSION: p21/p53 pathways gene expression was not attenuated by Nrf2 activation in neonatal lung. In utero SUL did not attenuate p21 expression in wildtype neonatal lung exposed to hyperoxia.

They have a lower survival rate due to complex multifactorial diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome, nosocomial sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, intracranial pathologies (bleeding, ischemia, maldevelopment), retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia which threaten survival and optimal neurodevelopment. Multiple pregnancies are more often delivered before the due date. Our objective was to determine the morbidity structure among prematurely born twins compared to singletons of the same gestational age., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis included 60 prematurely born children (30 preterm twins and 30 singletons) who had been diagnosed with one or more diseases: respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy, icterus, septicaemia, and other, with the exception of general infections., RESULTS: The most common diagnosis of preterm twins and singletons was hyperbilirubinaemia (83.3%) and respiratory distress syndrome (78.3%). Infections follow with 25% and intracranial hemorrhage with 21%., CONCLUSION: According to statistical analyses, there is no significant difference in incidence of morbidity among prematurely born singletons and preterm twins.","group":"g1","id":"62fec63a-dce6-4125-82f4-a669ad403c69","_showDetails":true},"bcaeb8c4-cd76-4f61-8890-af98c7fbc3d9":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Hyperoxia and interferon-gamma-induced injury in developing lungs occur via cyclooxygenase-2 and the endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent pathway.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2012-0381OC","authors":["Choo-Wing, Rayman","Syed, Mansoor A","Harijith, Anantha","Bowen, Brianne","Pryhuber, Gloria","Janer, Cecilia","Andersson, Sture","Homer, Robert J","Bhandari, Vineet"],"date":"2013//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Celecoxib","Cell Death","Cyclooxygenase 2/ge [Genetics]","*Cyclooxygenase 2/me [Metabolism]","Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]","*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress","Humans","*Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Immunohistochemistry","Infant, Newborn","Interferon-gamma/ge [Genetics]","*Interferon-gamma/me [Metabolism]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/em [Embryology]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Pyrazoles/pd [Pharmacology]","RNA, Small Interfering/ge [Genetics]","RNA, Small Interfering/me [Metabolism]","Sulfonamides/pd [Pharmacology]","Transcription Factor CHOP/ge [Genetics]","Transcription Factor CHOP/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology","volume":"48","number":"6","isbn":"1044-1549","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=23470621"],"address":"United States","abstract":"We noted a marked increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) and the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in newborn murine lung on exposure to hyperoxia and IFN-gamma.

Similarly, adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as neonates display alveolar simplification associated with a reduced number of alveolar epithelial type II cells and exhibit persistent inflammation, fibrosis, and mortality when infected with influenza A virus. Because type II cells participate in innate immunity and alveolar repair, their loss may contribute to oxygen-mediated sensitivity to viral infection. A genomewide screening of type II cells identified eosinophil-associated RNase 1 (Ear1). Ear1 was also detected in airway epithelium and was reduced in lungs of mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia. Electroporation-mediated gene delivery of Ear1 to the lung before infection successfully reduced viral replication and leukocyte recruitment during infection. It also diminished the enhanced morbidity and mortality attributed to neonatal hyperoxia. These findings demonstrate that novel epithelial expression of Ear1 functions to limit influenza A virus infection, and its loss contributes to oxygen-associated epithelial injury and fibrosis after infection. People born prematurely may have defects in epithelial innate immunity that increase their risk for respiratory viral infections. Copyright © 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

In the present study, we tested the null hypothesis that the antidepressant drug fluoxetine does not modify the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in neonatal rats. Experimental categories included I: room air (controls) with daily injection of saline; II: room air with daily injection of 10 mg/kg fluoxetine, i.p., during two weeks; III: 60% oxygen with daily injection of saline; and IV: 60% oxygen with daily injection of 10 mg/kg fluoxetine, i.p., during two weeks. Hyperoxia resulted in significant reduction in alveolar density and an increase in pulmonary endocrine cells, as well as increases in muscle layer areas of bronchi and arteries. Fluoxetine treatment generated a further increase in muscularisation and did not significantly modify the hyperoxia-induced reductions in alveolar density and increases in the endocrine cells. In hyperoxia, Real-Time PCR showed a lower pulmonary expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with no significant changes in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 12. Fluoxetine did not affect VEGF or MMP-2 expression but it significantly increased MMP-12 mRNA in both normoxic and hyperoxic groups. Zymographic analysis of MMP-2 activity in bronchoalveolar fluid showed a significantly reduced MMP-2 activity in hyperoxia, while fluoxetine treatment restored MMP-2 activity to levels comparable with the normoxic group. In conclusion, our data show that fluoxetine may worsen bronchial and arterial muscularisation during development of BPD and may up-regulate MMP expression or activity.","group":"g1","id":"947f40ee-637c-4d06-a387-c817ceda3771","_showDetails":true},"67e59a23-f098-40bc-9790-72bb2a3ca64f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Effect of antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis on bronchopulmonary dysplasia and related mechanisms.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12967-021-02794-6","authors":["Ran, Xiao","He, Yu","Ai, Qing","Shi, Yuan"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210416//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Anti-Bacterial Agents/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Disease Models, Animal","Dysbiosis/ci [Chemically Induced]","Dysbiosis/co [Complications]","Humans","*Hyperoxia","Infant, Newborn","Lung","Mice","RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Journal of translational medicine","volume":"19","number":"1","isbn":"1479-5876","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33874953"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Modification of the gut microbiota by antibiotics may influence the disease susceptibility and immunological responses.

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia could result in lung damages and developmental disorders manifested as acute lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respectively. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been shown to have a broad regulatory effect on the respiratory system. In this study, we explored the protective effects of CGRP on the hyperoxia-induced lung damage. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: normoxia, hyperoxia, and hyperoxia with CGRP. Hyperoxia groups were exposed to 95% oxygen for 14 days and treated once every other day with saline or CGRP. Hyperoxia exposure reduced the survival rate to 73%, when compared with the 93% survival rate observed in the normoxia group. The survival rate was improved to 84% with CGRP treatment. Treatment with CGRP under hyperoxia significantly alleviated the hyperoxia-induced lung histomorphological changes and the increases in leukocyte counts and total protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that reflect the pulmonary microvasular damages. CGRP treatment also restored the decreased activity of superoxide dismutase, while it decreased the increased level of malondialdehyde in the lung tissues. Importantly, CGRP treatment significantly decreased the magnitude of the hyperoxia-mediated increase in the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and transforming growth factor-beta 1 protein. In conclusion, the hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury is associated with both oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, and CGRP may ameliorate the hyperoxia-induced lung injury by down-regulating these processes.","group":"g4","id":"a165853a-e76d-46a2-8364-42b8fa08a050","_showDetails":true},"f6986d52-ab89-460a-990c-2026b7428629":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2012>","title":"Lung function among infants born preterm, with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.21609","authors":["Sanchez-Solis, Manuel","Garcia-Marcos, Luis","Bosch-Gimenez, Vicente","Perez-Fernandez, Virginia","Pastor-Vivero, Maria D","Mondejar-Lopez, Pedro"],"date":"2012//","accessDate":"20111213//","keywords":["Birth Weight","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Child, Preschool","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/ph [Physiology]","*Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Male","Respiratory Function Tests","Sex Factors","Tobacco Smoke Pollution/ae [Adverse Effects]"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"47","number":"7","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med9&NEWS=N&AN=22170860"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Both healthy preterm infants and those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have poor lung function during childhood and adolescence, although there is no evidence whether prematurity alone explains the reduction in lung function found in BPD infants.

Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 0.5 sec, and forced expiratory flows at 50, 75, 85%, and 25-75% of FVC were obtained from maximal expiratory volume curves by means of rapid thoracic compression with raised volume technique. Maximal flow at functional residual capacity was measured using rapid thoracic compression at tidal volume. Multiple regression analysis and generalized least squares (GLS) random-effects regression model were used to control for variables such as gender, weeks of gestation, age, birth weight, and tobacco smoke exposure. A sub-analysis was performed in infants born at 28+ weeks of gestation., RESULTS: BPD was associated to significantly lower flows (regression coefficients: -0.51, -0.54, -57, -0.53, and -0.82, respectively for FEF(50), FEF(75), FEF(85), FEF(25-75)). This association was driven by males and maintained in the subgroup of infants born at 28+ weeks of gestation., CONCLUSION: BPD is associated with an additional decrease of lung function during the first 2 years of life in infants born preterm.

Selenium plays a role in antioxidant system by protecting cell membranes and neutralizing the deleterious effects of free radicals. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between selenium concentration and incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia using a validated analytical method. Umbilical cord blood and blood samples 30 days after the birth were collected from 38 preterm newborn infants with gestation age of 32 weeks or less, and the separated serums were kept at -70degreeC until analysis time. Selenium concentration of serum was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The method was validated on the basis of standard validation techniques. The analytical method was linear in the range of 1 to 500 mug/L with the limit of detection of 0.4 mug/L. Samples were collected from 38 infants whose gestation age was 32 weeks or less. The blood samples were collected from the umbilical cord blood at birth in 19 cases. In 25 cases, blood samples were collected 1 month after birth.

CCSP was assayed by ELISA and cytokines by Bio-Plex., RESULTS: Median serum CCSP in extremely and moderately preterm infants rose from a baseline of 13.6 and 15.9 to 33.4 ng/ml (p = 0.04) and 59.8 ng/ml (p = 0.03) at 12 h of age, respectively. CCSP levels were highest in term infants (80.7 ng/ml at 12 h). CCSP then decreased to 22.5 ng/ml on days 3-4 (p = 0.001). CCSP of 37 RDS infants fell to a lower baseline on days 4 and 7 than that of the 22 non-RDS preterms. The 8 infants who developed BPD had persistently low serum CCSP (12.7 ng/ml at 12 h). In contrast, early postnatal changes were not seen in IL-4, -10 and -13 levels, but low IL-10 and -13 levels were found on day 7 in BPD infants., CONCLUSIONS: Serum CCSP levels were characterized by an early postnatal surge.

Our study aim is to clarify the role of sPLA2 and its modulators in the pathogenesis and clinical severity of hyaline membrane disease, infection related respiratory failure, meconium aspiration syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. sPLA2 genes will also be sequenced and possible genetic involvement will be analysed., METHODS/DESIGN: Multicentre, international, translational study, including several paediatric and neonatal intensive care units and one coordinating laboratory. Babies affected by the above mentioned conditions will be enrolled: broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, serum and whole blood will be obtained at definite time-points during the disease course. Several clinical, respiratory and outcome data will be recorded. Laboratory researchers who perform the bench part of the study will be blinded to the clinical data., DISCUSSION: This study, thanks to its multicenter design, will clarify the role(s) of sPLA2 and its pathway in these diseases: sPLA2 might be the crossroad between inflammation and surfactant dysfunction. This may represent a crucial target for new anti-inflammatory therapies but also a novel approach to protect surfactant or spare it, improving alveolar stability, lung mechanics and gas exchange.","group":"g4","id":"df0b7082-649e-4f00-b8e8-37fc9c05c817","_showDetails":true},"6cdd5bd1-af0d-4887-abc3-d3bc4de49a71":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Respiratory disease and early serum S100A12 changes in very premature infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2011.02384.x","authors":["Loughran-Fowlds, Alison","Leach, Steven","Lin, Jianwei","Oei, Julee","Henry, Richard","Day, Andrew S","Lui, Kei"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20110711//","keywords":["Biomarkers/bl [Blood]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/bl [Blood]","Interleukin-6/bl [Blood]","Interleukin-8/bl [Blood]","Leukocyte Count","Logistic Models","Neutrophils","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/bl [Blood]","S100 Proteins/bl [Blood]","*S100 Proteins/ph [Physiology]","S100A12 Protein"],"journal":"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","volume":"100","number":"12","isbn":"0803-5253","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21672013"],"address":"Norway","abstract":"AIM: The role of granulocyte-specific S100A12, a marker for inflammatory disorders, in newborn lung disease is unknown.

IL-8 and IL-6 were assayed in 52 infants., RESULTS: Infants with RDS were significantly more premature (median 27 vs. 34 weeks), more likely to receive antenatal corticosteroids (84% vs. 26%) and have lower neutrophil counts (median 2.4 vs. 3.8 x 10(9) /L) at admission.

PDGF-A, which solely signals through PDGF-receptor-alpha (PDGF-Ralpha), is required for expansion, but the receptor's relevant downstream targets remain incompletely defined. We have evaluated the proliferation, apoptosis, and differential response to the selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, by pdgfralpha-expressing LF (pdgfralpha-LF) and compared them with their nonexpressing LF counterparts. Our objective was to determine whether diminished signaling through PDGF-Ralpha-mediated pathways regulates the decline in myofibroblasts, which accompanies septal thinning and ensures more efficient alveolar gas exchange. Using quantitative stereology and flow cytometry at postnatal d 12 and 14, we observed that imatinib caused a selective suppression of proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. The number of the alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) producing pdgfralpha-LF was also reduced. Using cultures of neonatal mouse LF, we showed that imatinib did not suppress PDGF-Ralpha gene expression but reduced PDGF-A-mediated Akt phosphorylation, potentially explaining the increase in apoptosis. Our findings are relevant to bronchopulmonary dysplasia in which positive pressure ventilation interferes with myofibroblast depletion, septal thinning, and capillary maturation.","group":"g1","id":"5fe4367d-468d-4153-bcf0-c173c9cdd168","_showDetails":true},"7075f427-87df-4ce4-bd02-952d3db6c7f6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Roxadustat attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury by upregulating proangiogenic factors in newborn mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2021.03.012","authors":["Huang, Liang-Ti","Chou, Hsiu-Chu","Chen, Chung-Ming"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210324//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Glycine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Hyperoxia","Isoquinolines","Lung","*Lung Injury","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"],"journal":"Pediatrics and neonatology","volume":"62","number":"4","isbn":"1875-9572","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33865748"],"address":"Singapore","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Premature infants who require oxygen therapy for respiratory distress syndrome often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease characterized by interrupted alveologenesis. Disrupted angiogenesis inhibits alveologenesis; however, the mechanisms through which disrupted angiogenesis affects lung development are poorly understood. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors that activate multiple oxygen-sensitive genes, including those encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the HIF modulation of angiogenesis in hyperoxia-induced lung injury is not fully understood. Therefore, we explored the effects of roxadustat, an HIF stabilizer that has been shown to promote angiogenesis, in regulating pulmonary angiogenesis on hyperoxia exposure., METHODS: C57BL6 mice pups reared in room air and 85% O2 were injected with phosphate-buffered saline or 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg roxadustat. Their daily body weight and survival rate were recorded. Their lungs were excised for histology and angiogenic factor expression analyses on postnatal Day 7., RESULTS: Exposure to neonatal hyperoxia reduced body weight; survival rate; and expressions of von Willebrand factor, HIF-1alpha, phosphor mammalian target of rapamycin, VEGF, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and increased the mean linear intercept values in the pups. Roxadustat administration reversed these effects., CONCLUSION: Hyperoxia suppressed pulmonary vascular development and the expression of proangiogenic factors. Roxadustat promoted pulmonary angiogenesis on hyperoxia exposure by stabilizing HIF-1alpha and upregulating the expression of proangiogenic factors, indicating its potential in clinical and therapeutic applications.

In utero exposure to maternal smoking is the most commonly documented antenatal factor. Early life events such as the bronchopulmonary dysplasia are responsible for hypoalveolisation.

Finally the role of genes implied in pulmonary development both pre and post natally is beginning to be recognized. The decline of the respiratory function that occurs in adulthood leads then more rapidly to the functional criteria of COPD, particularly in the event of active smoking.

In a hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice model, a FLAP inhibitor given during critical window periods may prevent aberration of alveolarization in a dose- and time-dependent manner.","group":"g3","id":"1a001ea7-053b-4caa-9a48-f7ce2bbb6254","_showDetails":true},"d9df85bb-213f-4c2b-a6c5-834c5798d4e6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Surfactant protein-A enhances ureaplasmacidal activity in vitro.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1753425909360552","authors":["Okogbule-Wonodi, Adora C","Chesko, Kirsty L","Famuyide, Mobolaji E","Viscardi, Rose M"],"date":"2011//","accessDate":"20100302//","keywords":["Animals","Cell Line","Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/de [Drug Effects]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Macrophages/de [Drug Effects]","Macrophages/im [Immunology]","Macrophages/me [Metabolism]","Macrophages/mi [Microbiology]","Macrophages/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Phagocytosis/de [Drug Effects]","Phagocytosis/im [Immunology]","*Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A/pd [Pharmacology]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/ge [Genetics]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/im [Immunology]","*Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/me [Metabolism]","*Ureaplasma/im [Immunology]","Ureaplasma/py [Pathogenicity]","*Ureaplasma Infections/dt [Drug Therapy]","Ureaplasma Infections/im [Immunology]"],"journal":"Innate immunity","volume":"17","number":"2","isbn":"1753-4259","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=20197455"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Persistent respiratory tract colonization with Ureaplasma spp. in preterm infants is a significant risk factor for the development of the chronic lung disorder, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Surfactant protein-A (SP-A), a lung collectin critical for bacterial clearance and regulating inflammation, is deficient in the preterm lung. In an experimental Ureaplasma-pneumonia model, infected SP-A deficient mice exhibited delayed bacterial clearance and an exaggerated inflammatory response compared to infected wild-type mice. The objective was to analyze the role of SP-A in Ureaplasma clearance in vitro., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed SP-A binding to Ureaplasma isolates and SP-A-mediated ureaplasmal phagocytosis and killing by cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages., RESULTS: Calcium-dependent SP-A binding was similar among Ureaplasma isolates tested. Pre-incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with SP-A (10-50 mug/ml) enhanced phagocytosis of fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Ureaplasma. Surfactant protein-A also increased ureaplasmacidal activity of RAW 264.7 cells by 2.1-fold over 4 h. Pre-incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with 10 mug/ml SP-A reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) and Ureaplasma (10(6) color changing units/ml)-stimulated release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by 46% and 43%, respectively, but did not affect transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGFbeta(1)) release., CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro data confirm that SP-A is important in host defense to perinatally-acquired Ureaplasma infection.","group":"g1","id":"d9df85bb-213f-4c2b-a6c5-834c5798d4e6","_showDetails":true},"dd146cf7-cdee-428b-96af-c6c4bac48f9b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"[General health state of premature children treated for retinopathy of prematurity from 2007 to 2009].","journal":"Ceska a slovenska oftalmologie : casopis Ceske oftalmologicke spolecnosti a Slovenske oftalmologicke spolecnosti","authors":["Lilakova, D","Hejcmanova, D","Krylova, K"],"date":"2010//","keywords":["Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary/co [Complications]","Gestational Age","Humans","*Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature, Diseases","Infections/co [Complications]","Retinopathy of Prematurity/co [Complications]","Retinopathy of Prematurity/di [Diagnosis]","*Retinopathy of Prematurity/su [Surgery]"],"volume":"66","number":"4","isbn":"1211-9059","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=21394971"],"address":"Czech Republic","abstract":"The aim of this study is to characterize in detail the general health state in infants with retina treated due to retinopathy of prematurity and so to specify the group of premature infants at the highest risk, in which the closest ophthalmologist's attention needs to be paid in the screening for retinopathy in prematurely born babies. The study group consists of seven patients treated in the Perinatological Center of the Children Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic, E.U. during the period 2007-2009, in whom the retina was treated for retinopathy of prematurity. In all infants, who had to undergo the retinal treatment, the birth weight was less than 1000 g and a combination of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and infectious disease was present. In infants with the birth weight less than 1000 g, this combination was present in the range from 13.33 % to 23.68 %, which specifies the patients at the most risk. Unfavorable condition after the treatment was caused especially by serious infections and pulmonary complications presented before and after the treatment. Albeit we perform the screening of premature infants according to the current rules, the development shows that the highest attention should be paid to the infants with the birth weight less than 1000 g with complicating diseases as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and infections. For the ophthalmologist, these may be another clue to the presupposition of retinopathy of prematurity prognosis and seriousness besides the birth weight and gestational age. The complicating diseases facilitate to determine accurately the group of premature infants, which is at higher risk of higher grade of retinopathy.","group":"g1","id":"dd146cf7-cdee-428b-96af-c6c4bac48f9b","_showDetails":true},"ac7ec34c-f734-4524-8fbe-3f411f4b0de4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2010 to 2011>","title":"Deficits in lung alveolarization and function after systemic maternal inflammation and neonatal hyperoxia exposure.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.01392.2009","authors":["Velten, Markus","Heyob, Kathryn M","Rogers, Lynette K","Welty, Stephen E"],"date":"2010//","accessDate":"20100311//","keywords":["Age Factors","Airway Resistance","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Fibrosis","Gestational Age","Humans","Hyperoxia/im [Immunology]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Infant, Newborn","Inflammation/im [Immunology]","Inflammation/pa [Pathology]","*Inflammation/pp [Physiopathology]","Lipopolysaccharides","Lung Compliance","Macrophages, Alveolar/im [Immunology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C3H","Neutrophils/im [Immunology]","Organ Size","Phenotype","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","Pulmonary Alveoli/im [Immunology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","volume":"108","number":"5","isbn":"0161-7567","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med8&NEWS=N&AN=20223995"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Systemic maternal inflammation contributes to preterm birth and is associated with development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Infants with BPD exhibit decreased alveolarization, diffuse interstitial fibrosis with thickened alveolar septa, and impaired pulmonary function. We tested the hypothesis that systemic prenatal LPS administration to pregnant mice followed by postnatal hyperoxia exposure is associated with prolonged alterations in pulmonary structure and function after return to room air (RA) that are more severe than hyperoxia exposure alone. Timed-pregnant C3H/HeN mice were dosed with LPS (80 microg/kg) or saline on gestation day 16. Newborn pups were exposed to RA or 85% O2 for 14 days and then to RA for an additional 14 days. Data were collected and analyzed on postnatal days 14 and 28. The combination of prenatal LPS and postnatal hyperoxia exposure generated a phenotype with more inflammation (measured as no. of macrophages per high-power field) than either insult alone at day 28. The combined exposures were associated with a diffuse fibrotic response [measured as hydroxyproline content (microg)] but did not induce a more severe developmental arrest than hyperoxia alone. Pulmonary function tests indicated that hyperoxia, independent of maternal exposure, induced compliance decreases on day 14 that did not persist after RA recovery. Either treatment alone or combined induced an increase in resistance on day 14, but the increase persisted on day 28 only in pups receiving the combined treatment. In conclusion, the combination of systemic maternal inflammation and neonatal hyperoxia induced a prolonged phenotype of arrested alveolarization, diffuse fibrosis, and impaired lung mechanics that mimics human BPD. This new model should be useful in designing studies of specific mechanisms and interventions that could ultimately be utilized to define therapies to prevent BPD in premature infants.","group":"g1","id":"ac7ec34c-f734-4524-8fbe-3f411f4b0de4","_showDetails":true},"6ab032f3-07de-463d-b302-cdb6ada9c275":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Sildenafil attenuates pulmonary inflammation and fibrin deposition, mortality and right ventricular hypertrophy in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-30","authors":["de Visser, Yvonne P","Walther, Frans J","Laghmani, El Houari","Boersma, Hester","van der Laarse, Arnoud","Wagenaar, Gerry Tm"],"date":"2009//","accessDate":"20090429//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Disease Models, Animal","*Fibrin/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Hyperoxia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/mo [Mortality]","*Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/dt [Drug Therapy]","Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/me [Metabolism]","*Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular/mo [Mortality]","Lung Injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/mo [Mortality]","Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Piperazines/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Pneumonia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Pneumonia/me [Metabolism]","*Pneumonia/mo [Mortality]","Purines/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Rats","Rats, Wistar","Sildenafil Citrate","*Sulfones/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Survival Analysis","Survival Rate","Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"Respiratory research","volume":"10","isbn":"1465-9921","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19402887"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with sildenafil has been used to treat severe pulmonary hypertension and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease in very preterm infants who were mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome., METHODS: Sildenafil treatment was investigated in 2 models of experimental BPD: a lethal neonatal model, in which rat pups were continuously exposed to hyperoxia and treated daily with sildenafil (50-150 mg/kg body weight/day; injected subcutaneously) and a neonatal lung injury-recovery model in which rat pups were exposed to hyperoxia for 9 days, followed by 9 days of recovery in room air and started sildenafil treatment on day 6 of hyperoxia exposure. Parameters investigated include survival, histopathology, fibrin deposition, alveolar vascular leakage, right ventricular hypertrophy, and differential mRNA expression in lung and heart tissue., RESULTS: Prophylactic treatment with an optimal dose of sildenafil (2 x 50 mg/kg/day) significantly increased lung cGMP levels, prolonged median survival, reduced fibrin deposition, total protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, inflammation and septum thickness. Treatment with sildenafil partially corrected the differential mRNA expression of amphiregulin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in the lung and of brain and c-type natriuretic peptides and the natriuretic peptide receptors NPR-A, -B, and -C in the right ventricle.

Initiation of sildenafil treatment after hyperoxic lung injury and continued during room air recovery improves alveolarization and restores pulmonary angiogenesis and RVH in experimental BPD.","group":"g1","id":"6ab032f3-07de-463d-b302-cdb6ada9c275","_showDetails":true},"5b62e20c-2ed8-4c56-99f8-ffce83098d14":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"[Lipopolysaccharide and hyperoxia induce nuclear factor-kappa B expression in human embryo lung fibroblasts in vitro].","authors":["Zhang, Xiao-Ting","Liu, Jian","Yu, Xiao","Ning, Qin","Luo, Xiao-Ping"],"date":"2008//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","Humans","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Immunohistochemistry","Infant, Newborn","*Lipopolysaccharides/to [Toxicity]","Lung/cy [Cytology]","Lung/em [Embryology]","NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/an [Analysis]","NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/ge [Genetics]","*NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/me [Metabolism]","Transcription Factor RelA/an [Analysis]","Transcription Factor RelA/ge [Genetics]","*Transcription Factor RelA/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","volume":"10","number":"5","isbn":"1008-8830","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18947494"],"address":"China","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is attributed to intrauterine inflammatory and postnatal mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hyperoxia exposure on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression in human embryo lung fibroblasts (HELFs) in vitro., METHODS: Either LPS (100 ng/mL) or hyperoxia (60%), or a combination of both was employed to stimulate confluent HELFs. After 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hrs of stimulation, the nuclear translocation of two subunits p50 and p65 in HELFs was detected with immunocytochemistry. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure mRNA expression of NF-kappaB p50 and p65., RESULTS: LPS or hyperoxia stimulation induced the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 at 30 minutes of exposure. mRNA expression of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 peaked at 1 hr and then gradually decreased. A stimulation of LPS combined with hyperoxia induced the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. NF-kappaB p50 and p65 mRNA expression peaked at 2 hrs of stimulation and then decreased slowly, but was significantly higher than that in the LPS or hyperoxia stimulation alone group 4 hrs after stimulation., CONCLUSIONS: Both LPS and hyperoxia exposure induced NF-kappaB activation in the HELFs in vitro. Hyperoxia combined with LPS induced a more prolonged duration of NF-kappaB activation.

The functional involvement of pulmonary apoptosis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia- associated alveolar disruption remains undetermined. The aims of this study were to generate conditional lung-specific Fas-ligand (FasL) transgenic mice and to determine the effects of FasL-induced respiratory epithelial apoptosis on alveolar remodeling in postcanalicular lungs. Transgenic (TetOp)(7)-FasL responder mice, generated by pronuclear microinjection, were bred with Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)-rtTA activator mice. Doxycycline (Dox) was administered from embryonal day 14 to postnatal day 7, and lungs were studied between embryonal day 19 and postnatal day 21. Dox administration induced marked respiratory epithelium-specific FasL mRNA and protein up-regulation in double-transgenic CCSP-rtTA(+)/(TetOp)(7)-FasL(+) mice compared with single-transgenic CCSP-rtTA(+) littermates. The Dox-induced FasL up-regulation was associated with dramatically increased apoptosis of alveolar type II cells and Clara cells, disrupted alveolar development, decreased vascular density, and increased postnatal lethality. These data demonstrate that FasL-induced alveolar epithelial apoptosis during postcanalicular lung remodeling is sufficient to disrupt alveolar development after birth. The availability of inducible lung-specific FasL transgenic mice will facilitate studies of the role of apoptosis in normal and disrupted alveologenesis and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for perinatal and adult pulmonary diseases characterized by dysregulated apoptosis.","group":"g1","id":"70b84973-e8a3-47c0-9b1f-ac1f90e8d1d4","_showDetails":true},"70d948b5-5196-438a-b533-222d4e73defe":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Ibuprofen-induced patent ductus arteriosus closure: physiologic, histologic, and biochemical effects on the premature lung.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-2051","authors":["McCurnin, Donald","Seidner, Steven","Chang, Ling-Yi","Waleh, Nahid","Ikegami, Machiko","Petershack, Jean","Yoder, Brad","Giavedoni, Luis","Albertine, Kurt H","Dahl, Mar Janna","Wang, Zheng-ming","Clyman, Ronald I"],"date":"2008//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","*Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/dt [Drug Therapy]","Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/me [Metabolism]","Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/pp [Physiopathology]","Epithelial Sodium Channels/me [Metabolism]","Extravascular Lung Water/me [Metabolism]","Female","Fetal Organ Maturity/de [Drug Effects]","Hemodynamics","*Ibuprofen/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Inflammation Mediators/me [Metabolism]","Lung/ah [Anatomy & Histology]","*Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/em [Embryology]","Lung/ph [Physiology]","Male","Papio papio","Phosphatidylcholines/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Respiration"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"121","number":"5","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18450898"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The goal was to study the pulmonary, biochemical, and morphologic effects of a persistent patent ductus arteriosus in a preterm baboon model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: Preterm baboons (treated prenatally with glucocorticoids) were delivered at 125 days of gestation (term: 185 days), given surfactant, and ventilated for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after birth, newborns were randomly assigned to receive either ibuprofen (to close the patent ductus arteriosus; n = 8) or no drug (control; n = 13)., RESULTS: After treatment was started, the ibuprofen group had significantly lower pulmonary/systemic flow ratio, higher systemic blood pressure, and lower left ventricular end diastolic diameter, compared with the control group. There were no differences in cardiac performance indices between the groups. Ventilation index and dynamic compliance were significantly improved with ibuprofen. The improved pulmonary mechanics in ibuprofen-treated newborns were not attributable to changes in levels of surfactant protein B, C, or D, saturated phosphatidylcholine, or surfactant inhibitory proteins. There were no differences in tracheal concentrations of cytokines commonly associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The groups had similar messenger RNA expression of genes that regulate inflammation and remodeling in the lung. Lungs from ibuprofen-treated newborns were significantly drier (lower wet/dry ratio) and expressed 2.5 times more epithelial sodium channel protein than did control lungs. By 14 days after delivery, control newborns had morphologic features of arrested alveolar development (decreased alveolar surface area and complexity), compared with age-matched fetuses. In contrast, there was no evidence of alveolar arrest in the ibuprofen-treated newborns., CONCLUSIONS: Ibuprofen-induced patent ductus arteriosus closure improved pulmonary mechanics, decreased total lung water, increased epithelial sodium channel expression, and decreased the detrimental effects of preterm birth on alveolarization.","group":"g1","id":"70d948b5-5196-438a-b533-222d4e73defe","_showDetails":true},"c67ba4ca-9a83-426d-925b-33fdcfb7e26a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2008 to 2009>","title":"Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition attenuates pulmonary inflammation in neonatal lung injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00071307","authors":["de Visser, Y P","Walther, F J","Laghmani, E H","van Wijngaarden, S","Nieuwland, K","Wagenaar, G T M"],"date":"2008//","accessDate":"20071219//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Benzamides/pd [Pharmacology]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/ch [Chemistry]","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cy [Cytology]","Disease Models, Animal","Gene Expression Profiling","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Inflammation/dt [Drug Therapy]","*Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors","*Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Fibrosis/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Pyridines/pd [Pharmacology]","Rats","Rats, Wistar","*Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome/et [Etiology]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome/pa [Pathology]","*Rolipram/pd [Pharmacology]"],"journal":"The European respiratory journal","volume":"31","number":"3","isbn":"0903-1936","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=18094015"],"address":"England","abstract":"Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors may offer novel therapeutic strategies in respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore, selective PDE4 inhibitors may also provide a therapeutic option for very pre-term infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The anti-inflammatory effect of two PDE4 inhibitors was investigated in a pre-term rat model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Pre-term rat pups were exposed to room air, hyperoxia, or hyperoxia and one of two PDE4 inhibitors: rolipram and piclamilast. The anti-inflammatory effects of prolonged PDE4 inhibitor therapy were investigated by studying survival, histopathology, fibrin deposition, alveolar vascular leakage and differential mRNA expression (real-time RT-PCR) of key genes involved in inflammation, alveolar enlargement, coagulation and fibrinolysis. PDE4 inhibitor therapy prolonged median survival by up to 7 days and reduced alveolar fibrin deposition, lung inflammation and vascular leakage by decreasing the influx of monocytes and macrophages and protein efflux in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Analysis of mRNA expression of key genes involved in experimental BPD revealed a significant PDE4 inhibitor-induced improvement of genes involved in inflammation, fibrin deposition and alveolarisation. In conclusion, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition prolongs survival by inhibiting inflammation and reducing alveolar fibrin deposition in pre-term rat pups with neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, whereby piclamilast outperformed rolipram.","group":"g3","id":"c67ba4ca-9a83-426d-925b-33fdcfb7e26a","_showDetails":true},"d195e404-404c-4a13-a364-daa0f48674b0":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"[Impact of cardiopulmonary resuscitation on extremely low birth weight infants].","journal":"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1157/13097357","authors":["Sanchez-Torres, A Ma","Garcia-Alix, A","Cabanas, F","Elorza, Ma D","Madero, R","Perez, J","Quero, J"],"date":"2007//","keywords":["*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/ae [Adverse Effects]","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","*Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Male","Nervous System Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","*Nervous System Diseases/et [Etiology]","Retrospective Studies","Survival Rate","Treatment Outcome"],"volume":"66","number":"1","isbn":"1695-4033","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=17266853"],"address":"Spain","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants who undergo Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) in the delivery room present poorer survival and greater short-term neurological and general morbidity than those who do not., METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 150 ELBW infants born at our hospital between 2000 and 2004, those who needed CPR and those who did not were compared for mortality and short-term general and neurological morbidity. Infants with major birth defects, suspicion of genetic disease and those without a proactive perinatal attitude in the delivery room were excluded. CPR was defined as the administration of chest compressions and/or epinephrine in the delivery room., RESULTS: 150 infants were included, with gestational ages of 23-27 weeks (mean 25.6+/-1.2), birth weight of 425-995 grams (mean 745.2+/-132). Delivery room CPR was given to 32 infants (21.4%). No differences in perinatal characteristics were found except for lower pH and Apgar score and a higher SNAPPE score in infants who underwent CPR. Survival at discharge was similar (62.5% vs 76.3% for those without CPR). Infants who received CPR needed more surfactant, oxygen and higher median airway pressure than infants who did not. Air leaks and coagulopathy were more frequent in CPR infants (p<0.01). Prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis and retinopathy was similar in the two groups. No statistical differences between ELBW infants who needed CPR and those who did not were found in prevalence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (62.5% vs 52.5%), IVH III (31.2% vs 17.7%), periventricular haemorrhagic infarction (PHI) (18.7% vs 11%) or cystic periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) (15.6% vs 11%). However, in a combined analysis of neurological morbidity (IVH III and/or PVL and/or PHI), significant differences between the two groups were found (46.7% vs 21.6%; p=0.01)., CONCLUSION: This study does not support poorer survival or significant non-neurological morbidity during the neonatal period in ELBW infants who receive CPR. Although the prevalence of individual neurological problems was similar in the two groups, CPR was associated with a clear increase in general neurological morbidity, with a three-times greater risk of brain damage.","group":"g1","id":"d195e404-404c-4a13-a364-daa0f48674b0","_showDetails":true},"c50346c0-b8f4-44b8-8100-fcd5e2a3b893":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Neonatal transport of very low birth weight infants in Jerusalem, revisited.","authors":["Arad, Ilan","Baras, Mario","Bar-Oz, Benjamin","Gofin, Rosa"],"date":"2006//","keywords":["Adolescent","Adult","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/cl [Classification]","Infant, Premature, Diseases/dt [Drug Therapy]","Infant, Premature, Diseases/mo [Mortality]","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","*Intensive Care Units, Neonatal","Israel","Logistic Models","Maternal Age","Multicenter Studies as Topic","*Patient Transfer","Perinatal Care","Pulmonary Surfactants/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Severity of Illness Index"],"journal":"The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ","volume":"8","number":"7","isbn":"1565-1088","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16889163"],"address":"Israel","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Maternal transport, rather than neonatal transport, to tertiary care centers is generally advocated. Since a substantial number of premature deliveries still occur in hospitals with level I and level II nurseries, it is imperative to find means to improve their outcome., OBJECTIVES: To compare the neonatal outcome (survival, intraventricular hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) of inborn and outborn very low birth weight infants, accounting for sociodemographic, obstetric and perinatal variables, with reference to earlier published data., METHODS: We compared 129 premature infants with birth weights of 750-1250 g delivered between 1996 and 2000 in a hospital providing neonatal intensive care to 99 premature babies delivered in a referring hospital. In the statistical analysis, variables with a statistical significant association with the outcome variables and dissimilar distribution in the two hospitals were identified and entered together with the hospital of birth as explanatory variables in a logistic regression., RESULTS: Accounting for the covariates, the odds ratios (outborns relative to inborns) were 0.31 (95% confidence interval = 0.11-0.86, P = 0.03) for mortality, 1.37 (95% CI = 0.64-2.96, P = 0.42) for severe intraventricular hemorrhage, and 0.86 (95% CI = 0.38-1.97, P = 0.78) for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The odds ratio for survival without severe intraventricular hemorrhage was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.55-2.20, P = 0.78). Comparing the current results with earlier (1990-94) published data from the same institution showed that mortality decreased in both the outborn and inborn infants (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.09-0.58, P = 0.002 and 0.46; 95% CI = 0.20-1.04, P = 0.06, respectively), but no significant change in the incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage or brochopulmonary dysplasia was observed. Increased survival was observed also in these infants receiving surfactant, more so among the outborn. The latter finding could be attributed to the early, pre-transport surfactant administration, implemented only in the current study., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that very low birth weight outborn infants may share an outcome comparable with that of inborn babies, if adequate perinatal care including surfactant administration is provided prior to transportation to a tertiary center.","group":"g1","id":"c50346c0-b8f4-44b8-8100-fcd5e2a3b893","_showDetails":true},"01cd2382-3d77-491e-87a2-10532ccbecd6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Progress in discovery and evaluation of treatments to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000092867","authors":["Van Marter, Linda J"],"date":"2006//","accessDate":"20060601//","keywords":["Animals","Antioxidants/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","Glucocorticoids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Humans","Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","Infant, Newborn","Protease Inhibitors/tu [Therapeutic Use]"],"journal":"Biology of the neonate","volume":"89","number":"4","isbn":"0006-3126","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=16770070"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent improvements in the survival of extremely preterm infants have been accompanied by evolution in the pathogenesis and histopathology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

A synthetic surfactant containing a mimic of SP-B may also reduce the potential risks associated with the use of animal-derived products. Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of a novel synthetic surfactant containing a functional SP-B mimic (lucinactant; Discovery Laboratories, Doylestown, PA) with those of a non-protein-containing synthetic surfactant (colfosceril palmitate; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, United Kingdom) and a bovine-derived surfactant (beractant; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) in the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and RDS-related death., METHODS: We assigned randomly (double-masked) 1294 very preterm infants, weighing 600 to 1250 g and of < or =32 weeks gestational age, to receive colfosceril palmitate (n = 509), lucinactant (n = 527), or beractant (n = 258) within 20 to 30 minutes after birth. Primary outcome measures were the rates of RDS at 24 hours and the rates of death related to RDS during the first 14 days after birth. All-cause mortality rates, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rates, and rates of other complications of prematurity were prespecified secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes, air leaks, and causes of death were assigned by an independent, masked, adjudication committee with prespecified definitions. The study was monitored by an independent data safety monitoring board., RESULTS: Lucinactant reduced significantly the incidence of RDS at 24 hours, compared with colfosceril (39.1% vs 47.2%; odds ratio [OR]: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.89). There was no significant difference in comparison with beractant (33.3%). However, lucinactant reduced significantly RDS-related mortality rates by 14 days of life, compared with both colfosceril (4.7% vs 9.4%; OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.73) and beractant (10.5%; OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.18-0.66). In addition, BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was significantly less common with lucinactant than with colfosceril (40.2% vs 45.0%; OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.56-0.99), and the all-cause mortality rate at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was lower with lucinactant than with beractant (21% vs 26%; OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45-1.00)., CONCLUSIONS: Lucinactant is a more effective surfactant preparation than colfosceril palmitate for the prevention of RDS. In addition, lucinactant reduces the incidence of BPD, compared with colfosceril palmitate, and decreases RDS-related mortality rates, compared with beractant. Therefore, we conclude that lucinactant, the first of a new class of surfactants containing a functional protein analog of SP-B, is an effective therapeutic option for preterm infants at risk for RDS.","group":"g1","id":"5a1b417c-7e5a-477c-8a8b-5cabd1d5184b","_showDetails":true},"4a7364fb-2e5a-46dc-8806-0743b992fbdf":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and Pulmonary Hypertension.

We have shown the GSNO catabolic enzyme encoded by adh5 (alcohol dehydrogenase-5), GSNO reductase, is epigenetically upregulated in hyperoxia. Here, we investigated the distribution of GSNO reductase expression in human BPD and created an animal model that recapitulates the human data. Blinded comparisons of GSNO reductase protein expression were performed in human lung tissues from infants and children with and without BPD. BPD phenotypes were evaluated in global (adh5-/-) and conditional smooth muscle (smooth muscle/adh5-/-) adh5 knockout mice. GSNO reductase was prominently expressed in the airways and vessels of human BPD subjects. Compared with controls, expression was greater in BPD smooth muscle, particularly in vascular smooth muscle (2.4-fold; P = 0.003). The BPD mouse model of neonatal hyperoxia caused significant alveolar simplification, airway hyperreactivity, and right ventricular and vessel hypertrophy. Global adh5-/- mice were protected from all three aspects of BPD, whereas smooth muscle/adh5-/- mice were only protected from pulmonary hypertensive changes. These data suggest adh5 is required for the development of BPD. Expression in the pulmonary vasculature is relevant to the pathophysiology of BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension.

A total of 172 samples were obtained from 59 infants, two thirds of whom showed NF-kappaB activation in lung neutrophils and macrophages on at least one occasion. Infants who had activated NF-kappaB showed elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in their tracheal aspirates. These infants also required a longer period of mechanical ventilation support. Almost half of the infants with HMD had antenatal exposure to chorioamnionitis on the basis of placental histopathologic examination. These infants had evidence of activated NF-kappaB and elevated cytokines and were more likely to have Ureaplasma urealyticum colonization in their airways. Together, these observations suggest that NF-kappaB activation in pulmonary leukocytes may be involved in the lung inflammatory process in infants with HMD.","group":"g1","id":"2af7ac37-2306-44bc-8e51-3e3431e1177d","_showDetails":true},"4ce0f48b-884a-425c-9330-8c28ea636940":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2005 to 2007>","title":"Changes in neonatology: comparison of two cohorts of very preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks): the Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants 1983 and the Leiden Follow-Up Project on Prematurity 1996-1997.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2004-1497","authors":["Stoelhorst, Gerlinde M S J","Rijken, Monique","Martens, Shirley E","Brand, Ronald","den Ouden, A Lya","Wit, Jan-Maarten","Veen, Sylvia","Leiden Follow-Up Project on Prematurity"],"date":"2005//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","Cohort Studies","Delivery, Obstetric/mt [Methods]","Delivery, Obstetric/td [Trends]","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Hospital Mortality/td [Trends]","Humans","*Infant Mortality/td [Trends]","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/ep [Epidemiology]","Infant, Small for Gestational Age","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","*Intensive Care Units, Neonatal/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal/td [Trends]","Length of Stay","Male","*Neonatology/td [Trends]","Netherlands/ep [Epidemiology]","Obstetrics/td [Trends]","*Premature Birth/ep [Epidemiology]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/cl [Classification]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ep [Epidemiology]","Socioeconomic Factors"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"115","number":"2","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med6&NEWS=N&AN=15689337"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in peri- and neonatal care concerning neonatal mortality and morbidity by comparing 2 cohorts of very prematurely born infants (gestational age [GA] <32 weeks), 1 from the 1980s and 1 from the 1990s., METHODS: The Leiden Follow-Up Project on Prematurity (LFUPP-1996/97), a regional, prospective study, includes all infants who were born alive after a GA <32 weeks in 1996 and 1997 in the Dutch health regions Leiden, The Hague, and Delft. The Project On Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants (POPS-1983), a national, prospective study from the presurfactant era, includes all liveborn infants <32 weeks' GA and/or <1500 g from 1983 (n = 1338). For comparison, infants from the POPS-1983 cohort with a GA <32 weeks from the same Dutch health regions were selected (n = 102)., RESULTS: The absolute number of preterm births in the study region increased by 30%: 102 in 1983 to on average of 133 in 1996-1997. Centralization of perinatal care improved: the percentage of extrauterinely transported infants decreased from 61% in 1983 to 35% in 1996-1997. A total of 182 (73%) of the LFUPP-1996/97 infants were treated antenatally with glucocorticosteroids compared with 6 (6%) of the POPS-1983 infants. A total of 112 (42%) of the LFUPP-1996/97 infants received surfactant. In-hospital mortality decreased from 30% in the 1980s to 11% in the 1990s. Mortality of the extremely preterm infants (<27 weeks) decreased from 76% to 33%. The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome remained the same: approximately 60% in both groups. Mortality from respiratory distress syndrome, however, decreased from 29% to 8%. The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased from 6% to 19%. For the surviving infants, the average length of stay in the hospital and the mean number of NICU days stayed approximately the same ( approximately 67 days total admission time and 44 NICU days in both groups); including the infants who died, the mean NICU admission time increased from 27 days in the 1980s to 41 days in the 1990s. Equal percentages of adverse outcome (dead or an abnormal general condition) at the moment of discharge from hospital were found (+/-40% in both groups)., CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the absolute number of very preterm births in this study region was found, leading to a greater burden on the regional NICUs. Improvements in peri- and neonatal care have led to an increased survival of especially extremely preterm infants. However, increased survival has resulted in more morbidity, mainly bronchopulmonary dysplasia, at the moment of discharge from the hospital.","group":"g1","id":"4ce0f48b-884a-425c-9330-8c28ea636940","_showDetails":true},"0ad3093a-94fc-424b-a617-b12914d8fb8e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2003 to 2004>","title":"No association of urokinase gene 3'-UTR polymorphism with bronchopulmonary dysplasia for ventilated preterm infants.","authors":["Lin, Hung-Chih","Su, Bai-Horng","Lin, Tsung-Wen","Hsu, Chin-Moo","Wan, Lei","Tsai, Chang-Hai","Tsai, Fuu-Jen"],"date":"2004//","keywords":["3' Flanking Region/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Female","Gene Frequency","Genotype","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Logistic Models","Male","Polymerase Chain Reaction","*Polymorphism, Genetic","Prospective Studies","*Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"Acta paediatrica Taiwanica = Taiwan er ke yi xue hui za zhi","volume":"45","number":"6","isbn":"1608-8115","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med5&NEWS=N&AN=15868845"],"address":"China (Republic : 1949- )","abstract":"Pathological findings pertaining to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are consistent with a process of prolonged lung inflammation and impaired healing.

Generally, after 17 weeks of gestational age, MnSOD was predominantly expressed in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium, and macrophages, CuZnSOD was expressed in bronchial epithelium, ECSOD was expressed in bronchial epithelium, vascular endothelium, and the extracellular matrix, catalase was expressed in bronchial epithelium and alveolar macrophages, gamma-GCS-h was expressed in bronchial epithelium and endothelium, and gamma-GCS-l was expressed in bronchial epithelium. Trx was restricted to bronchial epithelium and to a lesser extent to alveolar macrophages, and HO-1 found in alveolar macrophages. Basically, the expression of these enzymes was similar in normal and diseased lung. It can be concluded that various AOEs and related proteins differ in their distribution and expression in lung before term, but generally it seems that infants are better adapted to high oxygen tension than might be expected.

Exposure of the premature lung to hyperoxia is commonly implicated in its pathogenesis. However, the exact link between hyperoxia and BPD, particularly its role in the generation of myofibroblasts, the signature cell-type for lung fibrosis, is undetermined. There is increasing evidence that lipid interstitial fibroblasts play an important role in injury-repair mechanisms in various organ systems. This study demonstrates that exposure to hyperoxia augments the transdifferentiation of pulmonary lipofibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Fetal rat lung fibroblasts (FRLF) from embryonic (e) (term = e22) 18 and e21 gestation were studied. After initial culture in minimum essential medium (MEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 21% O2 / 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C, FRLF were maintained in MEM and 10%FBS at 37 degrees C under control (21% O2 / 5% CO2) and under experimental conditions (24-hour exposure to 95% O2 /5% CO2) at passage (P) 1 and 5. At each passage, cells were allowed to attach to 100 cm2 culture dishes and grow in 21% O2 before being subjected to the experimental conditions. Passage 1 and 5 cells were analyzed for the expression of well-characterized lipogenic and myogenic markers based on semiquantitative competitive RT-PCR (for parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor [PTHrPR]), adipose differentiation related protein (ADRP), and alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), triglyceride uptake, and leptin assay. Serial passage and maintenance of cells in 21% O2 resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of the lipogenic markers from P1 to P5, spontaneously. This decrease was greater for e18 than for e21 FRLF. However, exposing cells to 95% O2 augmented the loss of the lipogenic markers and gain of the myogenic marker from P1 to P5 in comparison to cells maintained in 21% O2. These changes were also greater for e18 vs e21 lipofibroblasts. These changes in mRNA expression were accompanied by decreased triglyceride uptake and leptin secretion on exposure to hyperoxia. These results suggest that exposure to hyperoxia (95% O2) augments the transdifferentiation of pulmonary lipofibroblasts to myofibroblasts.","group":"g1","id":"2f6564c2-9a7a-4250-bad9-c32ede173352","_showDetails":true},"0c717d8e-fb1a-413c-8acb-446f99341977":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2003 to 2004>","title":"The role of fibroblast transdifferentiation in lung epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and repair in vitro.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/pdp.22.3.189.207","authors":["Torday, J S","Torres, E","Rehan, V K"],"date":"2003//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Cell Differentiation","Cell Division","Cells, Cultured","Dinoprost/pd [Pharmacology]","*Epithelial Cells/cy [Cytology]","Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Female","Fetus","*Fibroblasts/cy [Cytology]","Fibroblasts/de [Drug Effects]","Gestational Age","*Lung/cy [Cytology]","Lung/em [Embryology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Membrane Proteins/ge [Genetics]","Membrane Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Papio","Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/df [Deficiency]","Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/ge [Genetics]","Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/me [Metabolism]","Perilipin-2","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Alveoli/cy [Cytology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/em [Embryology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/an [Analysis]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Receptor, Parathyroid Hormone, Type 1/me [Metabolism]","Respiration, Artificial","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Stress, Mechanical"],"journal":"Pediatric pathology & molecular medicine","volume":"22","number":"3","isbn":"1522-7952","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med5&NEWS=N&AN=12746170"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) expression is necessary for differentiation of mesenchymal lipofibroblasts, which induce epithelial type II (TII) cell differentiation, both of which are necessary for alveolarization. PTHrP deficiency may be associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by truncation of alveolarization among preterm infants. This is supported by the baboon model of BPD (failure of alveolarization) that manifests PTHrP deficiency. We provide evidence that TII cell PTHrP expression is downregulated by alveolar overdistension, resulting in the transdifferentiation of lipofibroblasts to myofibroblasts, characterized by progressive loss of PTHrP receptor expression and triglyceride content, and sequential upregulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), typifying fibrosis. PTHrP reverses the downregulation of the PTHrP receptor and upregulation of alphaSMA, reverting myofibroblasts to a lipofibroblast genotype. When TII cells are co-cultured with lipofibroblasts, they proliferate and differentiate, expressing surfactant protein-B; in contrast, TII cells co-cultured with myofibroblasts fail to develop, mimicking the failed alveolarization associated with BPD. Treatment of myofibroblasts with 15-deoxy-Delta 12, 14 prostaglandinJ(2) (PGJ(2)) stimulates ADRP expression, reconstituting the lipofibroblast phenotype. PGJ(2)-treated myofibroblasts promote TII cell growth and surfactant protein-B expression, indicating that failed alveolarization due to transdifferentiation is reversible. We conclude that alveolar overdistension can cause fibroblast transdifferentiation, resulting in failed alveolarization.","group":"g1","id":"0c717d8e-fb1a-413c-8acb-446f99341977","_showDetails":true},"2d7a04eb-a37c-4e34-a5cc-e4dd7a9daa59":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalizations in high-risk children: follow-up of a national cohort of infants treated with Palivizumab as RSV prophylaxis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.10175","authors":["Lacaze-Masmonteil, Thierry","Roze, Jean-Christophe","Fauroux, Brigitte","French Pediatricians' Group of Sunagis Patients' Name-Based Programs"],"date":"2002//","keywords":["*Antibodies, Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized","*Antiviral Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Female","Follow-Up Studies","France/ep [Epidemiology]","Gestational Age","*Hospitalization/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Humans","Incidence","Infant, Newborn","Male","Palivizumab","Registries","Respiration, Artificial","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/pc [Prevention & Control]","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/th [Therapy]"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"34","number":"3","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=12203846"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The prophylactic administration of Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody binding the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein, was recently shown to significantly decrease the incidence of RSV-related hospitalizations among high-risk children (IMpact-RSV trial). While awaiting marketing authorization in France and through a cohort of patients' name-based national program temporarily authorized by the French Drug Agency, a prospective register of all Palivizumab-treated patients in France was set up during the epidemic season 1999-2000. Based on this register, this study was carried out to evaluate the incidence of RSV-related hospitalizations and the safety of prophylaxis among a national cohort of children at high-risk of severe RSV disease. During the study period, guidelines issued by the French Pediatric Society recommended prophylaxis for children either aged less than 6 months at inclusion and born at less than 33 weeks of gestation with a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days of life, or aged less than 2 years, born at less than 36 weeks of gestation, and having required treatment for BPD over the previous 6 months. Once included in the program, investigators were to prospectively report the clinical and demographic characteristics of children, all hospitalizations, and reasons for the hospitalizations. Five hundred and sixteen children were treated with 1-5 monthly doses. The median gestational age was 28 weeks, and children born at less than 33 weeks of gestation accounted for 88% of the cohort. The prevalence of BPD was 81%. Ninety children were hospitalized for respiratory illness. In 39 children, hospitalizations were attributed to RSV (7.6% of the total cohort). Among those 39 children, 10 (1.9% of the total cohort) required admission into an intensive care unit, and 4 required mechanical ventilation.

The scenario was of a 3-month-old infant with uncomplicated but moderately severe RSV infection requiring hospitalization. Seventy-three questionnaires were sent. 63/73 (86%) of the questionnaires were returned. With respect to management of this case almost all (61/63) the paediatricians felt that oxygen therapy was necessary (oxygen saturation described in the case was 90%). With respect to bronchodilator therapy, ipratropium bromide (38/63--60%) was chosen much more frequently than salbutamol (15/63--24%). Chest physiotherapy would have been prescribed by 8/63--13% of paediatricians. Oral steroids were infrequently chosen (1/63--2%) but nebulised steroids were selected in 7/63 (11%) cases. The routine use of RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, for RSV prophylaxis was reported by 49% (31/63) of paediatricians.

The management of infants with RSV bronchiolitis varies greatly among consultant paediatricians in Ireland. Evidence based guidelines may be of value in establishing a more uniform national treatment approach.","group":"g1","id":"35b53147-253b-4325-8f0c-ae892e9249ec","_showDetails":false},"9a7b7d0c-5e45-4670-9810-c18b678b84ab":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus-positive hospitalizations in Germany.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s100960100527","authors":["Weigl, J A","Puppe, W","Schmitt, H J"],"date":"2001//","keywords":["Acute Disease","Adolescent","Age Distribution","Child","Child, Preschool","Female","Germany/ep [Epidemiology]","*Hospitalization/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Humans","Incidence","Infant","Male","Population Surveillance","Probability","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/di [Diagnosis]","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","*Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/ip [Isolation & Purification]","Respiratory Tract Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","Respiratory Tract Infections/vi [Virology]","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Risk Factors","Sex Distribution"],"journal":"European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology","volume":"20","number":"7","isbn":"0934-9723","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11561800"],"address":"Germany","abstract":"Epidemiological data, especially population-based data, on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations in Germany have been lacking to date. Since Palivizumab (Synagis, Abbott, USA) is already available and new vaccines for active immunization are under development, these data are urgently needed. From July 1996 to June 1999, nasopharyngeal aspirates of children hospitalized in Kiel with an acute respiratory tract infection were tested by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Of 1,241 patients, 150 (12.1%) were RSV positive. RSV was the predominant pathogen detected through the end of the second year. In 37 (25%) children an underlying condition was present. For the city of Kiel and close surroundings, the cumulative incidence of RSV-positive hospitalizations in infants was 1,214/10(5) (725/10(5) in children less than 2 years). For those children less than 2 years old born with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks or 32-37 weeks, the cumulative incidence was 2,025/10(5) and 1,202/10(5), respectively (dose-effect response). For the group less than 32 weeks of age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as an underlying condition carried a relative risk of 17.8. The RSV season began between the end of September and January and ended between March and July. The population-based incidence of RSV-positive hospitalizations in Kiel is close to that reported from the UK and Scandinavia. Throughout Germany, approximately 10.000 RSV-related hospitalizations in infants can be expected annually. Prematurity is an effect modifier and BPD a strong risk factor for RSV-positive hospitalization in population-based studies. There is considerable variation in the start and end of the yearly epidemic.","group":"g1","id":"9a7b7d0c-5e45-4670-9810-c18b678b84ab","_showDetails":true},"2f382a3b-9b38-4ba1-813d-33fd6af1cf07":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Single cell transcriptomic analysis of murine lung development on hyperoxia-induced damage.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21865-2","authors":["Hurskainen, Maria","Mizikova, Ivana","Cook, David P","Andersson, Noora","Cyr-Depauw, Chanele","Lesage, Flore","Helle, Emmi","Renesme, Laurent","Jankov, Robert P","Heikinheimo, Markku","Vanderhyden, Barbara C","Thebaud, Bernard"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210310//","keywords":["Animals","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Genotype","*Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","*Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","Male","Mice","*Sequence Analysis, RNA/mt [Methods]","*Single-Cell Analysis/mt [Methods]"],"journal":"Nature communications","volume":"12","number":"1","isbn":"2041-1723","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33692365"],"address":"England","abstract":"During late lung development, alveolar and microvascular development is finalized to enable sufficient gas exchange.

Serial TAs were obtained prospectively from 35 very low birth weight infants, and IL-8 and MCP-1 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. Tracheal cultures for bacteria and genital mycoplasmas were performed on aspirates obtained during the first 2 days of life., RESULTS: Infants who developed BPD (n=18) were less mature (25.2+/-0.2 vs 27.8+/-0.5 weeks; P<0.001), of lower birth weight (746+/-28 vs 1052+/-41 g; P<0.001), and more likely to have a positive tracheal culture for Uu (39% vs 6%; P=0.026) than those who did not develop BPD (n=17).

While evaluating patients for GER by upper gastrointestinal studies (UGI), we frequently noticed laryngeal penetration or tracheal aspiration in infants < 1 year of age. We conducted this prospective study to assess the incidence of swallowing dysfunction in infants with vomiting or respiratory symptoms., METHODS: Between February 1994 and August 1997, 1,003 UGI in infants < 1 year of age were performed by two experienced pediatric radiologists. Fluoroscopy of swallowing using an appropriate image intensifier was observed as part of the UGI in all patients. In addition to evaluating premature infants, former premature infants, and infants with underlying conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), congenital heart disease (CHD), esophageal atresia and/or tracheoesophageal fistula (EA), and neurologic disorders, we assessed swallowing in 472 full-term infants in the general population who had respiratory symptoms or suspected GER, but no other apparent abnormalities. Swallowing was not assessed in patients with congenital bowel obstruction. The presence of normal swallowing or swallowing dysfunction was recorded immediately following the study. Chest radiographs obtained on the same day as the UGI were evaluated in the study. Forty-four videotaped modified barium-swallow studies (MBSS) were obtained in 25 general-population infants and reviewed frame-by-frame to determine the length of time that barium could be visualized in the subglottic trachea., RESULTS: The incidence of swallowing dysfunction is significant in premature and former premature infants, those with BPD, CHD, EA, various syndromes, and neurologic abnormality. In the general population of full-term infants referred for evaluation of vomiting or respiratory symptoms, 63 (13.4 % of 472) had swallowing dysfunction. Forty-four had tracheal aspiration (TA) and 19 had laryngeal penetration (LP). Gastroesophageal reflux was found in 79.5 % with TA and in 68.4 % with LP. The MBSS confirmed swallowing dysfunction in all patients shown to have vocal cord penetration or tracheal aspiration by UGI., CONCLUSIONS: Careful evaluation of swallowing during an UGI can identify swallowing dysfunction in full-term infants who have respiratory problems, as well as in infants with an abnormality that predisposes the patient to aspiration. Episodes of tracheal aspiration may be fleeting and overlooked if swallowing is not assessed carefully. An MBSS can confirm the observation of swallowing dysfunction found during an UGI and assist in planning appropriate dietary therapy that minimizes the likelihood of tracheal aspiration during feeding.","group":"g1","id":"6d021ad7-4197-4b8c-8ba0-de0984bd777a","_showDetails":true},"65639822-9363-495d-b26c-84379450fe70":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Glucocorticoids and lung development in the fetus and preterm infant.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.1092","authors":["Bolt, R J","van Weissenbruch, M M","Lafeber, H N","Delemarre-van de Waal, H A"],"date":"2001//","keywords":["Female","Fetal Organ Maturity","*Fetus/ph [Physiology]","Glucocorticoids/me [Metabolism]","*Glucocorticoids/pd [Pharmacology]","*Glucocorticoids/ph [Physiology]","Glucocorticoids/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/gd [Growth & Development]","Infant, Premature/ph [Physiology]","*Lung/em [Embryology]","Pregnancy","Pulmonary Surfactants/bi [Biosynthesis]","Receptors, Glucocorticoid/ge [Genetics]","Receptors, Glucocorticoid/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Pediatric pulmonology","volume":"32","number":"1","isbn":"1099-0496","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=11416880"],"address":"United States","abstract":"During the final prenatal period of fetal lung development in humans, important maturational processes occur, including the production of surfactant necessary to decrease surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli. During early gestation, the glucocorticoid receptor is expressed in the fetal lung, and glucocorticoids stimulate the production of surfactant-associated proteins and increase phospholipid synthesis by enhancing the activity of phosphatidylcholine. Other glucocorticoid-induced effects may include stimulation of cell maturation and differentiation, inhibition of DNA synthesis, changes in interstitial tissue components, stimulation of antioxidant enzymes, and regulation of pulmonary fluid metabolism. Recently, it was suggested that glucocorticoids are also important in postnatal pulmonary development, and may be related to the development of neonatal lung disease in preterm infants. Surfactant deficiency that can be prevented by antenatal corticosteroid treatment causes infant respiratory distress syndrome and requires mechanical ventilation. Ventilation by itself or in combination with high levels of oxygen, fluid overload, pulmonary infections, sepsis, and air leak syndrome causes an acute pulmonary inflammatory reaction that may result in chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of chronic lung disease of prematurity and regulate the inflammatory response by the interaction with transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappaB and activated protein 1. Indeed, inflammatory cells and the levels of chemokines and cytokines in bronchoalveolar fluid decrease after dexamethasone treatment. However, treatment of fetuses and preterm infants with repeated and/or high doses of corticosteroids may have considerable long-term side effects on somatic, brain, and lung growth. The difficult balance between short-term gain and the possible long-term side effects of glucocorticoids in preterms remains a difficult issue.

Eleven routinely intubated very premature infants. Seven treated any infant intubated for respiratory distress syndrome with surfactant, and seven sometimes used prophylactic surfactant. Poor perfusion or low blood pressure was the most common criterion for volume expansion during the first hour, using albumen (15 of 22), fresh frozen plasma (10), whole blood (9), normal saline (20 and haemacell (1). Most (18 of 22) used steroids for established bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral feeds were generally begun \"as soon as possible\". Persistent foetal circulation was treated with various vasodilators, tolazoline (14 of 22), magnesium sulphate (8) and nitric oxide (4). The main local priorities noted are the need for more neonatally trained nursing and / or medical staff. Almost all respondents noted the need for a national neonatal transport system. While this summary reveals a considerable variation in clinical practice this variation reflects the lack of evidence on which to base clinical decision making.

The main pathophysiologic feature of RDS is a primary surfactant deficiency in a structurally immature lung. Pulmonary surfactant contains 90 percent phospholipids and 10 percent proteins (surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D). As surfactant protein A (SP-A) has several major immunological and metabolic intrapulmonary functions, we aimed at investigating an association of polymorphisms of SP-A1 and SP-A2 encoding genes and the risk of BPD. We performed a case-control study exclusively including Caucasian preterm infants below 32 weeks of gestation matched for the degree of immaturity and the year of birth. Venous cord blood was taken prospectively and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), cloning and sequencing. BPD was defined as oxygen dependency or need for mechanical ventilation at day 28. Twenty-three infants with BPD were enrolled (mean gestational age 26.2 weeks; mean birth weight 760.4 g) and compared with 23 infants matched on the basis of gestational age (mean gestational age 27.9 weeks; mean birthweight 1015 g). We observed a significantly increased frequency of the SP-A1 polymorphism 6A6 in infants with BPD compared with controls. In addition to previously established risk factors for BPD, 6A6 polymorphism for SP-A1 gene is an independent co-factor.

Dexamethasone, frequently administered to infants during oxygen exposure, also inhibits septal formation in the newborn lung. Vitamin A administration reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in vitamin A-deficient premature infants, and retinoic acid improves alveolarization in newborn rats treated with dexamethasone, indicating that retinoic acid may be useful in preventing hyperoxia-induced impaired septation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To investigate whether treatment with retinoic acid during exposure to hyperoxia would improve septal formation, newborn rats exposed to > or =90% O(2) from d 3 of life to d 14 were treated with retinoic acid (d 3-13 of life) and/or dexamethasone (d 4-13 of life). In contrast with the effects of retinoic acid on dexamethasone-induced inhibition of alveolarization, we found that retinoic acid did not improve septal formation or decrease airspace size in animals exposed to hyperoxia alone or to hyperoxia plus dexamethasone. Retinoic acid did, however, increase collagen in airspace walls as demonstrated by staining and immunohistochemistry. There was no increase in procollagen mRNA by Northern hybridization analysis, indicating that retinoic acid-associated increases in lung collagen are likely due to posttranscriptional regulation. There was a trend toward increased survival in hyperoxia in animals treated with retinoic acid to the extent that combined therapy with retinoic acid and dexamethasone resulted in the greatest improvement in animal survival.

Optimal management of this problem has not been well defined because medical therapy has a significant failure rate. Surgical treatment of complicated chylothorax has become a mainstay of care., METHODS: Over the last 36 months, seven infants had a pleuroperitoneal shunt placed for the management of refractory chylothorax. Ages ranged from 10 to 66 days with a weight between 1,000 to 4,850 g. Five of the seven infants were ventilator dependent. The etiologies were congenital in four and acquired in three with one related to a cardiothoracic procedure, one related to superior vena caval thrombosis, and one postoperative diaphragmatic hernia repair with superior vena caval thrombosis. Associated conditions included a left congenital diaphragmatic hernia, asplenia, isolated renal agenesis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and a patent ductus arteriosus. Each patient was unresponsive to thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, and dietary manipulation with preoperative volume of chest tube output ranging from 50 to 162 cc/kg/d. The duration of preoperative therapy in congenital occurrences ranged from 10 to 46 days (average, 22 days). A Denver double-valved shunt system was used and catheters were implanted under general anesthesia. Manual pumping was required postoperatively on an hourly basis., RESULTS: All seven patients had excellent results with the elimination of the chylothorax and resolution of symptoms. There were two complications. Shunt survival rate was six of seven (86%). Shunt removal ranged from 24 to 79 days (average, 44 days). Patient survival rate was five of seven (71%) with one infant dying of progressive pulmonary disease and one infant dying from viral sepsis; both had functioning shunts.

Moreover, the presence of free radicals in biological systems was not generally considered likely until the discovery of superoxide dismutase in 1969, although in the 1950s the basis of oxygen toxicity and X-irradiation was proposed to be by a common free radical mechanism and the radical theory of aging was hypothesized. Oxyradicals are now widely accepted as being very important, not only in the aging process but also in numerous human diseases/disorders where they have either a primary or secondary role. Currently, there are extensive global basic research efforts to define more clearly the role of free radicals and oxidative stress in these conditions. Continuing clinical research will lead to more reliable treatment and preventive measures for many of them. In this review, a short history is presented and the current status of free radicals and oxidative stress in aging and various diseases is discussed.","group":"g1","id":"724dfcb2-49a7-4837-bbb2-cca27855bbaa","_showDetails":true},"c8917046-8a88-4607-bad5-730589ceb809":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Pregnancy outcome in women with different rheumatic diseases: a retrospective analysis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009742.2020.1849788","authors":["Eisfeld, H","Glimm, A M","Burmester, G R","Ohrndorf, S","Backhaus, M"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210224//","keywords":["Adolescent","Adult","*Connective Tissue Diseases/co [Complications]","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Live Birth","Male","Pregnancy","*Pregnancy Complications","Pregnancy Outcome","*Premature Birth/et [Etiology]","*Rheumatic Diseases/co [Complications]","Young Adult"],"journal":"Scandinavian journal of rheumatology","volume":"50","number":"4","isbn":"0300-9742","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33622159"],"address":"England","abstract":"Objective: Pregnancy may influence the course of inflammatory rheumatic diseases and, conversely, rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) can affect the outcome of pregnancy. This study aimed to retrospectively analyse the outcome of pregnancy and disease in women with RMDs. Method: Subjects were patients with high-risk pregnancy and connective tissue diseases (CTDs) or inflammatory joint diseases (IJDs) managed at a specialized rheumatology outpatient clinic from 2007 to 2014. Data from conception to 6 months postpartum were collected from medical records and a questionnaire, and analysed regarding clinical symptoms, medications, pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and infant development. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare the groups (CTD vs IJD). Results: The eligible 66 pregnancies in 57 RMD patients were divided into two groups by RMD type: CTD (n = 48) or IJD (n = 18). The live birth rate was 97% overall. Pregnancy complications (excluding two twin pregnancies) were incurred in 39.1%: miscarriage (n = 2), premature delivery (n = 12), small-for-gestational-age infants (n = 5), and/or pregnancy-related diseases (n = 14). Three children born to women with CTDs had affected development (autism spectrum disorder, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). CTD infants had a significantly lower mean gestational age (in weeks) (p = 0.042), weight (p = 0.009), and length (p = 0.016) at birth than IJD infants. Conclusion: Although the live birth rate was high, complications occurred in 39.1% of pregnancies in this cohort. Therefore, interdisciplinary management of pregnant women with RMDs at specialized clinics is strongly recommended.","group":"g1","id":"c8917046-8a88-4607-bad5-730589ceb809","_showDetails":true},"64123934-a3ef-4153-b364-4812e0672080":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Growth and body composition in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia up to 3 months corrected age: a randomized trial of a high-energy nutrient-enriched formula fed after hospital discharge.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0022-3476(98)70266-5","authors":["Brunton, J A","Saigal, S","Atkinson, S A"],"date":"1998//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Analysis of Variance","*Body Composition/ph [Physiology]","Body Height/ph [Physiology]","Body Mass Index","Bone Density","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Calcium/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Dietary Proteins/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Female","*Food, Fortified","Gestational Age","Growth Disorders/et [Etiology]","Humans","Infant","*Infant Food","*Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/ph [Physiology]","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/gd [Growth & Development]","Malabsorption Syndromes/co [Complications]","Male","Minerals/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Minerals/me [Metabolism]","Nitrogen/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Nitrogen/me [Metabolism]","Nutrition Disorders/co [Complications]","Patient Discharge","Phosphorus/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Sex Factors","Single-Blind Method","Zinc/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Zinc/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"133","number":"3","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=9738713"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine whether nutrient malabsorption or inadequate nutrient intake were involved in the cause of growth delay in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and (2) to determine whether a nutrient-enriched formula given to infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia to 3 months corrected age improves the rate of growth with greater lean and bone mass accretion when compared with infants fed an isoenergetic standard infant formula., STUDY DESIGN: A blinded, nutrition intervention trial of 60 preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (birth weight, 866 +/- 169 g, gestational age, 26 +/- 1.5 weeks) randomized to either nutrient-enriched formula or standard formula.

Therefore, we studied the effect of stretch, which simulates fetal breathing movements (FBMs), on the generation and inhibition of a key hemostatic enzyme-thrombin-by rat fetal mixed lung cells (FMLCs). Our results showed that stretch induced glycosaminoglycan production with increased antithrombin activity due to an increase in the concentration of active chondroitin sulfate. Stretch downregulated secretion of tissue factor procoagulant activity, which may lead to decreased thrombin generation on the surface of FMLCs. Overall, stretch enhanced the local control of thrombin by FMLCs. These results suggest that premature infants, who will have experienced less FBM, may have impaired thrombin regulation. Impaired thrombin regulation likely contributes to increased fibrin deposition and, potentially, the development of BPD.","group":"g1","id":"c5ecb73d-48d3-4f11-bcaf-8e6298be6aa9","_showDetails":true},"4946bfda-5c4c-49f4-b3f9-1e2340f3a0fa":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Fibronectin expression in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s100249900068","authors":["Sinkin, R A","Roberts, M","LoMonaco, M B","Sanders, R J","Metlay, L A"],"date":"1998//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Extracellular Matrix/me [Metabolism]","*Fibronectins/bi [Biosynthesis]","Fibronectins/ge [Genetics]","Gestational Age","Humans","Immunoenzyme Techniques","In Situ Hybridization","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","RNA, Messenger/bi [Biosynthesis]"],"journal":"Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society","volume":"1","number":"6","isbn":"1093-5266","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=9724336"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic fibrotic lung disease of neonates. Fibronectin (FN), a component of the extracellular matrix, is increased in the tracheobronchial effluent of neonates destined to develop BPD. Pulmonary FN is derived from plasma and local cellular synthesis. In order to identify which pulmonary cells synthesize FN and to test the hypothesis that FN is more abundant in lungs with BPD, we examined the distribution of pulmonary FN by in situ hybridization (for mRNA) and immunohistochemistry (for protein) in neonatal autopsy lung specimens, comparing lungs with BPD to those without. We used a staging system in which BPD is characterized by disruption of alveolar architecture, severe vascular changes, airway epithelial necrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and peribronchial fibrosis. FN mRNA and protein were found in vascular endothelium, macrophages, fibroblasts, vascular and airway smooth muscle, and chondrocytes as well as in the pulmonary parenchyma in neonates with and without BPD. Hyaline membranes, when present, immunostained intensely for FN protein. FN mRNA was not seen in airway epithelial cells of either group. FN mRNA and protein were first increased in early acute BPD with their levels appearing greatest during the chronic reparative stage of BPD. In long-standing \"healed\" BPD, lower levels of FN mRNA and protein were seen. These findings are consistent with the association of increased FN with adult fibrotic lung disease and the previously reported increase in FN tracheal effluent levels in infants with BPD. Our results suggest an important role for pulmonary cell-derived FN in the early inflammatory and later proliferative stages of BPD.","group":"g4","id":"4946bfda-5c4c-49f4-b3f9-1e2340f3a0fa","_showDetails":true},"422267b2-815f-41bd-b738-c1c66bdcac1e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin and monoclonal antibodies in the prevention and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0146-0005(98)80010-4","authors":["Welliver, R C"],"date":"1998//","keywords":["*Antibodies, Monoclonal/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Antibodies, Viral/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","Humans","Immunization, Passive","Immunotherapy","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/th [Therapy]","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human"],"journal":"Seminars in perinatology","volume":"22","number":"1","isbn":"0146-0005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=9523402"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is particularly severe in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and in premature infants without BPD.

Passive immunoprophylaxis of premature infants with or without BPD using a hyperimmune human globulin against RSV (RSVIg) decreases the severity of RSV infection such that the rate of hospitalization following infection is reduced by 40%. The severity of illness among hospitalized infants is also reduced. To avoid the difficulties associated with intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins, monoclonal IgG antibodies against the fusion protein of RSV have been developed. In one trial, the antibodies were ineffective, although subsequent trials using higher doses of the antibody show more promising results. Studies of IgA monoclonal antibodies directed against RSV, which are administered in the form of nose drops, are also in progress. None of these preparations appear to be effective in the treatment of established RSV infection. Each of the preparations appeared to be safe, with one exception. Infants with cyanotic heart disease who received RSVIg had an increased risk of surgical complications, perhaps related to increases in serum viscosity as a result of receiving the hyperimmunoglobulin monthly in doses of 750 mg/kg.

This review examines the inflammatory substances and growth factors that induce airway smooth muscle proliferation, and the signaling pathways that may be involved in the transduction of these extracellular signals to the cell nucleus. Also discussed are various antimitogenic substances and potential mechanisms underlying the inhibition of cell proliferation. Central to the discussion are the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), serine/threonine kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) superfamily, which upon activation, translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after mitogenic stimulation.

Energy and protein balance, past and present respiratory status, and growth were assessed as well. The results show that Ee was higher in the BPD infants compared to controls (73 +/- 9 vs 63 +/- 8 kcal/kg/day, P < 0.05), but their faecal energy loss was lower (P < 0.01).

The Exosurf/Survanta hazard ratios, representing the relative instantaneous probabilities of the next event (VENT-DC or OX-DC) occurring in the Exosurf versus Survanta groups, were close to the null value of 1.0 and were not statistically significant.

The rationales for (1) using proportional-hazards regression when duration of therapy is an outcome of interest and (2) generating internal reference risk ratios when multivariate analysis is used are discussed in relation to future studies of hyaline membrane disease or other problems of prematurity.","group":"g1","id":"9da14438-b884-436b-8e90-949a66435fec","_showDetails":false},"468ae667-1154-4947-abd0-a02d2307f5e1":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1996 to 2002>","title":"Reduced iron-associated antioxidants in premature newborns suffering intracerebral hemorrhage.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0891-5849(95)00209-x","authors":["Lackmann, G M","Hesse, L","Tollner, U"],"date":"1996//","keywords":["Apgar Score","*Asphyxia Neonatorum/bl [Blood]","Birth Weight","*Cerebral Hemorrhage/bl [Blood]","Ceruloplasmin/an [Analysis]","Ceruloplasmin/me [Metabolism]","Ferritins/bl [Blood]","Free Radicals","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/bl [Blood]","*Iron/bl [Blood]","Transferrin/an [Analysis]","Transferrin/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Free radical biology & medicine","volume":"20","number":"3","isbn":"0891-5849","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med4&NEWS=N&AN=8720912"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Oxygen radical injury may be a common pathogenic mechanism in several neonatal diseases.

To test the hypothesis that overload with ionic iron due to decreased concentrations of iron-oxidizing and iron-binding proteins induces free radical damage in premature asphyxiated newborns suffering periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH), blood plasma of newborns with PIVH (n = 7) was compared with that of controls (n = 10) within the first 12 h of life.

PIO2 was decreased stepwise to achieve SpO2 between 85 and 98%. Shift and shunt were calculated from paired SpO2/PIO2 measurements using customized software. Results were examined cross-sectionally at each time point, and longitudinally using generalized linear regression. Term infants were assessed at 44 wk PMA as a comparative reference., RESULTS: Longitudinal modelling showed continuous decline in shift in EP and VP infants during the first year of life. There was no difference in shift compared to term infants at 44 wk PMA (p = 0.094). EP infants with BPD had higher shift than infants without BPD at 36 wk PMA (p < 0.001) and 44 wk PMA (p = 0.005) but not at 1-year cPNA., CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of lung disease, prematurity per se did not result in reduced gas exchange at 1-year cPNA.

One hundred and forty-four infants were admitted during the study period; 116 had data analyzed, 112 of whom survived to discharge. Respiratory morbidity was common and the prevalence increased with decreasing gestation. Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) occurred in 92 (79%) and CLD (oxygen dependency at 28 days) in 62 (53%); 35 (30%) were oxygen dependent at 36 weeks corrected age, and 16 (14%) were oxygen dependent at term. Thirty-two infants had an FHA which was equally distributed between those infants with and without CLD. Infants with an FHA were more likely to be oxygen dependent at term (relative risk 4.4; 95% Cl 1.7,11.1). Thirty-eight percent of mothers smoked; 68% of their infants developed HMD compared to 89% of those whose mothers did not smoke. Logistic regression identified GA<28 weeks (OR 7.3; 95% Cl 1.4,39), severe HMD (OR 4.8; 95% Cl 1.1,22), and FHA (OR 11.0; 95% Cl 2.3,53) as the only factors associated with an increased risk of being oxygen dependent at term. The duration of supplemental oxygen in infants with CLD was significantly related to decreasing gestation, greater degree of barotrauma, presence of HMD, pregnancy-induced hypertension in the mother, duration of patent ductus arteriosus, and an FHA. An FHA may worsen chronic lung disease in the neonate, but is not involved as a causal factor. Clinicians should be aware of its influence on duration of oxygen supplementation when counselling parents of very preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"34f12089-f25f-4503-8b5b-934f02d0cad4","_showDetails":false},"71fb347d-8676-4cf9-ab7f-c5f9f459f0a3":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Early protein oxidation in the neonatal lung is related to development of chronic lung disease.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.1995.tb13552.x","authors":["Varsila, E","Pesonen, E","Andersson, S"],"date":"1995//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","Chronic Disease","Female","Free Radicals","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Lipid Peroxidation","Male","Oxidative Stress","Oxygen/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Proteins/an [Analysis]"],"journal":"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","volume":"84","number":"11","isbn":"0803-5253","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=8580630"],"address":"Norway","abstract":"Free radical-mediated oxidation of proteins may impair their function and cause cellular damage.

There was no significant difference in hepatic total, protein, or nonprotein sulfhydryl groups between 1- and 10-day-old premature (140 days gestation) baboons. These results suggest that premature birth does not limit the postnatal maturation of hepatic 5'-MDI activity.","group":"g1","id":"d7036718-87a7-4b8b-926a-fbc1b42f988e","_showDetails":true},"aab7a4f0-b9b5-449d-9051-26f11bb29ed8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Histological chorioamnionitis and its impact on respiratory outcome in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2020.11.009","authors":["Liu, Po-Chia","Hung, Yi-Li","Shen, Chung-Min","Chen, Pau-Chung","Hsieh, Wu-Shiun"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210120//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Chorioamnionitis/ep [Epidemiology]","*Chorioamnionitis","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Infant, Very Low Birth Weight","Placenta","Pregnancy","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ep [Epidemiology]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/et [Etiology]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Pediatrics and neonatology","volume":"62","number":"3","isbn":"1875-9572","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33568336"],"address":"Singapore","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The role of intrauterine infection in the development of neonatal pulmonary disease is unclear and the impact of histological chorioamnionitis (HCAM) on respiratory outcomes in preterm infants remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the association between HCAM and neonatal respiratory outcomes in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants and evaluate the stepwise difference in the stage and severity of HCAM among neonatal respiratory outcomes., METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 129 VLBW preterm infants with placenta histopathology examinations in this study. HCAM was subdivided into 3 stages (early, intermediate, and advanced) according to the progression of the maternal inflammatory response. The perinatal characteristics, placental histopathology, and neonatal morbidities, including respiratory outcomes (respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), Wilson-Mikity syndrome (WMS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)), were collected for comparison., RESULTS: A total of 52.7% (68/129) of the infants had HCAM, including 23 early (stage 1), 30 intermediate (stage 2), and 15 advanced (stage 3) stage. There was no significant difference in the gestational age, birth body weight or mortality rate between the HCAM and non-HCAM groups. Mothers with HCAM had a significantly lower incidence of pre-eclampsia but a higher rate of premature rupture of membrane. They also had higher WBC counts and C-reactive protein levels before delivery. Neonates with HCAM had a lower incidence of RDS but were at a higher risk for developing WMS and BPD. After multivariate analysis adjustment, HCAM was still negatively associated with RDS (aOR = .069, p < .001) but without correlation with BPD. However, neonates with intermediate to advanced-stage HCAM had a higher risk of developing WMS and increased home oxygen usage rate compared to those with early-stage HCAM., CONCLUSION: HCAM has a protective effect from RDS in preterm neonates. Additionally, VLBW neonates with intermediate to advanced-stage HCAM are at risk for WMS. Copyright © 2021.

Since in Italy today no suitable formulation of vitamin A is available, the present observational study was designed to define the profile of plasma vitamin A and retinol-binding protein (RBP) concentrations in supplemented infants at risk for BPD admitted to seven Italian NICU. Twelve babies (average 27 weeks of gestation, birth weight 1,008 g), supplemented with vitamin A, were observed with sequential measurements of retinol and RBP up to 28 days of age. At birth retinol and RBP plasma concentrations were both adequate in the infants and half their mothers' levels. During supplementation the levels rose with wide variability according to the differences in dosing and timing in the different units. Plasma levels of retinol and RBP were the same in infants who had BPD and those who did not.

In keeping with the view that newborn infants, and especially premature infants, suffer from vitamin E deficiency, elevated dosages of vitamin E have been administered to prevent the anemia of premature infants, retrolental fibroplasia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and intraventricular hemorrhage. However, the results have been conflicting. Furthermore, some infants treated with vitamin E die unexpectedly. The life-threatening hazard of such treatments has been attributed mainly to polysorbates that are used as detergents in preparations of vitamin E for intravenous use rather than to vitamin E itself.

To obtain a profile of changes of superoxide dismutase and it's isoenzymes (the main enzyme of antioxidant defence) in human blood during late fetal development, we studied blood samples from prematurely, on term and postmaturely born infants, and adults.

ECP and PMN elastase concentrations of intratracheal lavage fluids gradually decreased with the DSCG treatment.

We sought to assess the potential impact of EN by observing changes in physiometric indices (heart rate [HR] and respiratory rate [RR]) before and after EN initiation., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in children <2 years of age hospitalized for bronchiolitis receiving NIV from 2017 to 2019 in a quaternary ICU. The primary outcome was patient HR and RR before and after EN initiation. Descriptive data included demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, NIV parameters, EN characteristics, and general hospital outcomes. Analyses included paired comparative and descriptive statistics., RESULTS: Of the 124 children studied, 85 (69%) were permitted EN at a median of 12 (interquartile range [IQR]: 7 to 29) hours. The route was oral (76.5%), nasogastric (15.3%), or postpyloric (8.2%) and was predominantly started during high-flow nasal cannula (71%) at flow rates of 1 (IQR: 0.7 to 1.4) L/kg per minute. After EN initiation, reductions in the median RR (percentage change: -11 [IQR: -23 to 3]; P < .01) and HR (percentage change: -5 [IQR: -12 to 1]; P < .01) were noted. Those permitted EN were younger (5 [IQR: 2 to 11] vs 11 [IQR: 3 to 17] months; P < .01) and more likely to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (19% vs 5%; P = .04). Malnutrition rates, comorbidities, admission timing, flow rates, length of stay, and NIV duration did not differ for those provided or not provided EN. No aspiration events were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Reductions between pre- and postprandial RR after EN initiation among children hospitalized for bronchiolitis on NIV were observed without clinically significant aspiration. These findings support existing data that suggest that EN is safe during NIV and may lessen distress in some patients.

Severe hyaline membrane disease was the most common explanation for acute renal failure. All infants had severe electrolytes imbalance and fluid retention with generalized edema, which increased ventilation requirements and severely limited fluid intake. The volume of each exchange varied between 10-20 ml/kg. Four of five infants had good ultrafiltration (3.52 +/- 2.43 ml/kg/hr, mean +/- SD). Ultrafiltration was not achieved in one due to poor peripheral perfusion. Electrolytes imbalance were corrected in all patients. Although four infants died, one case given up further care after renal failure had improved, and one died of septic shock after renal function had recovered. Only one infant survived with complete recovery of renal function. We believe that early dialysis is likely to reduce both morbidity and mortality of acute renal failure in low birth weight infants.","group":"g1","id":"3133c154-d926-4273-b7f2-543b98694044","_showDetails":true},"81cdb489-8f45-4dbf-a958-f2c6d83cce0d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Treatment of patent ductus arteriosus after exogenous surfactant in baboons with hyaline membrane disease.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1203/00006450-198912000-00010","authors":["Shimada, S","Raju, T N","Bhat, R","Maeta, H","Vidyasagar, D"],"date":"1989//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Blood Pressure","Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/co [Complications]","Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/pp [Physiopathology]","*Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/th [Therapy]","Female","Humans","Hyaline Membrane Disease/co [Complications]","*Hyaline Membrane Disease/dt [Drug Therapy]","Hyaline Membrane Disease/pp [Physiopathology]","Infant, Newborn","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Male","Oxygen/bl [Blood]","Papio","Pulmonary Circulation","Pulmonary Surfactants/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Pulmonary Surfactants/tu [Therapeutic Use]"],"journal":"Pediatric research","volume":"26","number":"6","isbn":"0031-3998","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=2602035"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The effect of early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on the acute course of hyaline membrane disease was tested in a primate model, after intratracheal administration of 100 mg/kg exogenous bovine surfactant phospholipids at mean ages between 2.3-2.4 h. Twenty-two premature baboons were divided into four groups: seven animals were controls (group A); five were treated with surfactant but PDA was not intervened (group B); in five surfactant treatment was followed by three doses of 0.2 mg/kg intravenous indomethacin beginning at a mean age of 5.5 h (group C); and in five surfactant treatment was followed by a surgical ligation of PDA between 5-5.5 h of age. After surfactant instillation in groups B, C, and D, a prompt and sustained improvement was noted in a/APO2, mean airway pressure, ventilator efficiency index and pulmonary compliance. However, no consistent differences were found in the respiratory variables within the surfactant treated groups during the 72-h experiment: the respiratory course in the animals treated for PDA (groups C and D) was generally similar to the animals in which PDA was not treated (group B). In animals treated with surfactant and indomethacin (group C) the mean aortic blood pressure was maintained more optimally as compared to the other three groups. These findings suggest that although a significant early ductal shunting does occur after exogenous surfactant therapy in this animal model, the expected pulmonary deterioration does not occur, and an early abrupt interruption of PDA does not seem to provide additional advantage to the immediate course of hyaline membrane disease.","group":"g1","id":"81cdb489-8f45-4dbf-a958-f2c6d83cce0d","_showDetails":true},"6a292f9f-ea1c-47e4-9f4e-fb7cef00c301":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1988 to 1995>","title":"Interburst interval measurements in the EEGs of premature infants with normal neurological outcome.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0013-4694(89)90090-4","authors":["Hahn, J S","Monyer, H","Tharp, B R"],"date":"1989//","keywords":["*Electroencephalography","Follow-Up Studies","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/ph [Physiology]","Reference Values"],"journal":"Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology","volume":"73","number":"5","isbn":"0013-4694","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med3&NEWS=N&AN=2479519"],"address":"Ireland","abstract":"Interburst intervals (IBIs) are quiescent periods of cerebral activity, which normally occur in the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of premature infants.

Lung weight and lung DNA relative to body weight were markedly lower in infants who died at 37-41 weeks than in those who died at shorter gestations or in early infancy. Total lung DSPC and DSPC concentration had a narrow peak at 36-41 weeks. The DSPC concentration per milligram of lung DNA in the first few months of infant life was similar to that in infants at 24 weeks gestation. Lung protein concentrations increased steadily but were variable at all ages. SFD infants had significantly higher concentrations of hydroxyproline and showed a peak DSPC concentration at an earlier gestation than the normals. Lungs of HMD infants showed some increase in hydroxyproline concentration but little other quantitative evidence of difference from the normals. We suggest that the relatively small lung size in many infants who die near term may result from recurrent intrauterine stress.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive cells could be identified throughout the period of development studies (20 weeks gestation to 3 months of age), but were present in only limited numbers in less than 50% of individuals (n = 23). In contrast, large numbers of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive cells were identified in 100% of infants (1-3 months, n = 5) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The differential processing of mRNA transcribed from the calcitonin gene in neural and non-neural tissue suggests that calcitonin, rather than calcitonin gene-related peptide, is the primary product of translation in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. However, considering the potent vasodilatory and bronchoconstrictive effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide, its presence in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, even in small amounts, may be important in controlling pulmonary vaso- and/or bronchomotor tone. The presence of large numbers of calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive cells in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia suggests that calcitonin gene-related peptide may be one further agent contributing to the pulmonary pathophysiology seen in this disease.","group":"g4","id":"19f7c14b-b618-4452-b75f-154af766004b","_showDetails":true},"ac498e76-f020-48e2-83b7-f58ec634766c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1980 to 1987>","title":"Peanut lectin binding to the alveolar lining layer in hyaline membrane disease.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00712739","authors":["Barresi, G","Tuccari, G","Arena, F"],"date":"1987//","keywords":["Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate","Fluoresceins/me [Metabolism]","Histocytochemistry","Humans","*Hyaline Membrane Disease/me [Metabolism]","Infant, Newborn","*Lectins/me [Metabolism]","Peanut Agglutinin","*Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Thiocyanates/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Virchows Archiv.

MicroRNAs are important players in various biological functions including the pathogenesis of BPD. The present study aimed to examine the expression of miR-203a-3p in the peripheral blood of BPD patients and elucidate the mechanisms underlying miR-203a-3p-mediated progression of BPD. We examined the expression of miR-203a-3p in the peripheral blood of BPD patients and found that miR-203a-3p was up-regulated in the patients. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha were down-regulated in the BPD patients. Further in vitro studies showed that miR-203a-3p suppressed the expression of VEGFA in RLE-6TN cells by targeting the VEGFA 3' untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-203a-3p inhibited the viability of RLE-6TN cells and induced cell apoptosis, whereas the knockdown of miR-203a-3p exerted opposite effects. VEGFA treatment significantly attenuated the increase in the RLE-6TN cell apoptotic rates induced by miR-203a-3p overexpression; while VEGFA knockdown significantly increased the cell apoptotic rates of RLE-6TN cells, which was partially reversed by the treatment with miR-203a-3p inhibitor. Furthermore, miR-203a-3p was up-regulated, whereas VEGFA was down-regulated in the lung tissues of BPD rats, and sequestration of the expression of miR-203a-3p prevented hyperoxia-induced lung damage, increased VEGFA mRNA and protein expression levels, and promoted the protein expression of ERK, PI3K, and p38 in the lung tissues of BDP rats. In summary, the findings of our study indicate that miR-203a-3p knockdown alleviates hyperoxia-induced lung tissue damage in the BPD rat model, and its effect may be associated with the up-regulation of VEGF.","group":"g1","id":"64cbc5bf-005c-49f2-a6af-968c2a773119","_showDetails":true},"d1c7cd16-af68-46b9-aef3-28bb60215c83":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1980 to 1987>","title":"Electrocardiogram of the premature infant at 1 year of age.","authors":["Walsh, E P","Lang, P","Ellison, R C","Zierler, S","Harned, H S","Miettinen, O S"],"date":"1986//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Ductus Arteriosus, Patent/pp [Physiopathology]","*Electrocardiography","Follow-Up Studies","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Infant, Premature, Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"77","number":"3","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med2&NEWS=N&AN=3951916"],"address":"United States","abstract":"ECGs were examined from 461 premature infants at 1 year of age.

The data expand the published experience with follow-up ECGs from premature infants and suggest that the ECG may be a useful tool in follow-up of chronic residual lung disease in this population.","group":"g1","id":"d1c7cd16-af68-46b9-aef3-28bb60215c83","_showDetails":true},"e6265709-7a99-4f6d-90a2-e5478cf671b7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1980 to 1987>","title":"Pulse oximetry advantages in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","authors":["Solimano, A J","Smyth, J A","Mann, T K","Albersheim, S G","Lockitch, G"],"date":"1986//","keywords":["*Blood Gas Monitoring, Transcutaneous/mt [Methods]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","Evaluation Studies as Topic","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Oximetry","Pulse"],"journal":"Pediatrics","volume":"78","number":"5","isbn":"0031-4005","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med2&NEWS=N&AN=3763297"],"address":"United States","abstract":"We studied 12 infants with a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia who were oxygen dependent and older than 30 days. Simultaneous readings of hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) determined by two pulse oximeters (Nellcor 100, BTI Biox III) and transcutaneous (tc) PO2 (Sensor Medics, Transend) were correlated with SaO2 (Radiometer, OSM 2 Hemoximeter) and PaO2 (Corning 178) measured on blood from an indwelling arterial catheter. For each infant, the fractional inspiratory oxygen (FiO2) was adjusted to obtain three to five sets of data in the range of 70% to 95% SaO2. Fifty-three data points were generated and pooled for analysis. The slope of the regression line generated for the Nellcor 100 was .86; for the BTI Biox III, it was .91; and for the Sensor Medics Transend, it was .55, resulting in average errors of +2.5%, +1.0%, and -29%, respectively, when comparing corresponding transcutaneous and arterial values. When SaO2 was equal to or less than 95%, no infants were hyperoxic. These data confirm reports by others that tcPO2 values do not accurately represent PaO2 values in older infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Pulse oximeters do not require user calibration, and their sensor is unheated so they will not cause skin burns. We conclude that pulse oximetry offers major advantages over tcPO2 measurements in the management of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"e6265709-7a99-4f6d-90a2-e5478cf671b7","_showDetails":true},"cdfada0b-0304-4333-9247-f51bdd90214b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <1980 to 1987>","title":"Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in the newborn.","authors":["Knight, D P","Knight, J A"],"date":"1985//","keywords":["Age Factors","Female","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/co [Complications]","*Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/ep [Epidemiology]","Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/pa [Pathology]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/et [Etiology]"],"journal":"Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine","volume":"109","number":"6","isbn":"0003-9985","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med2&NEWS=N&AN=3838881"],"address":"United States","abstract":"A newborn presented with respiratory distress syndrome that was felt to be both clinically and roentgenographically typical of hyaline membrane disease.

It is postulated that HMD infants, who generally have raised levels of serum IgM, produce IgM antibodies to foreign maternal IgG and that this reaction between the infant's IgM and maternal IgG accounts for the signs of systemic disease at birth. The onset of breathing during the intrapartum period may lead to an exacerbation of the immune response in the lung. It is known that AFP suppresses T-cell-dependent antibody responses.

Inflammation is a vital pathogenic factor for BPD; we aim to evaluate the predictive and diagnostic values of systemic inflammatory indices in BPD., METHODS: Between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2023, the clinical data of 122 premature infants with a gestational age of <32 weeks in the Department of Neonatology, the Affiliated Huai'an No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, were retrospectively collected and classified into non-BPD (n = 72) and BPD (n = 50) groups based on the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 2018 criteria. To compare the general characteristics of each group, we identified the independent risk variables for BPD using multivariate logistic regression analysis, compared the systemic inflammatory indices at birth, 72 h, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), and constructed the receiver operating characteristic curves of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) diagnosis of BPD at different time points., RESULTS: 1 The independent risk factors for BPD in preterm infants were birth weight, small for gestational age, and days of oxygen therapy (all p < 0.05). 2 At 72 h and 1 week after birth, the serum NLR of the BPD group was higher than for the non-BPD group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the neutrophil count (N), NLR, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune-inflammation index, systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and pan-immune-inflammation value of infants with BPD were higher than the non-BPD group at 3 weeks after birth (p < 0.05). Moreover, at 36 weeks of PMA, the serum N, NLR, MLR, and SIRI of BPD infants were higher than those of non-BPD infants (p < 0.05). 3 The NLR of infants with and without BPD gradually increased after birth, reaching a peak at 72 h and 1 week, respectively. At 3 weeks postnatal, the NLR had the highest predictive power for BPD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.717 (p < 0.001); the sensitivity was 56% and specificity was 86.1%. In addition, the NLR at 36 weeks of PMA exhibited some diagnostic value for BPD. The AUC was 0.693 (p < 0.001), the sensitivity was 54%, and specificity was 83.3%., CONCLUSIONS: At 3 weeks after birth and 36 weeks of PMA, some systemic inflammation indices (like N, NLR, SIRI) of preterm infants with BPD have specific predictive and diagnostic values; these indices may help the management of high-risk preterm infants with BPD.","group":"g1","id":"5d70a07d-3fa1-4243-9ddd-9e767def717d","_showDetails":true},"c1347303-5947-49ea-8c54-dbe15d09ec47":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Assessment of early nutritional intake in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a cohort study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03912-0","authors":["Milanesi, Brunna G","Lima, Paola At","Villela, Leticia D","Martins, Amanda S","Gomes-Junior, Saint Clair S","Moreira, Maria E L","Meio, Maria Dalva Barbosa Baker"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210103//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Cohort Studies","Eating","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature"],"journal":"European journal of pediatrics","volume":"180","number":"5","isbn":"0340-6199","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33389073"],"address":"Germany","abstract":"This cohort study evaluated the nutritional supply in 78 very preterm newborns, with 20.5% developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

The mean gestational age and birth weight were lower in those who developed BPD. At term age, head circumference and length Z-scores were significantly lower in newborns with BPD, who started enteral feeding and reached full diet later, staying longer in parenteral nutrition. The protein rate received by all newborns was similar, whether developing BPD or not, but those who developed BPD received significantly lower fluid volume and calorie rates after the second week.

The TGF-beta superfamily has been implicated in BPD pathogenesis, however, what cell lineage it impacts remains unclear. We show that TGFbr2 is critical for alveolar epithelial (AT1) cell fate maintenance and function. Loss of TGFbr2 in AT1 cells during late lung development leads to AT1-AT2 cell reprogramming and altered pulmonary architecture, which persists into adulthood. Restriction of fetal lung stretch and associated AT1 cell spreading through a model of oligohydramnios enhances AT1-AT2 reprogramming. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal the necessity of TGFbr2 expression in AT1 cells for extracellular matrix production. Moreover, TGF-beta signaling regulates integrin transcription to alter AT1 cell morphology, which further impacts ECM expression through changes in mechanotransduction. These data reveal the cell intrinsic necessity of TGF-beta signaling in maintaining AT1 cell fate and reveal this cell lineage as a major orchestrator of the alveolar matrisome.","group":"g3","id":"c903aaf6-0a63-4cdc-9ca2-c25ce3ab1209","_showDetails":true},"a8ab46e6-ff1d-4967-aca7-242951dbf6d2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R)","title":"In utero ventilation induces lung parenchymal and vascular alterations in extremely preterm fetal sheep.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00249.2023","authors":["Azman, Zahrah","Vidinopoulos, Kayla","Somers, Ainsley","Hooper, Stuart B","Zahra, Valerie A","Thiel, Alison M","Galinsky, Robert","Tran, Nhi T","Allison, Beth J","Polglase, Graeme R"],"date":"2024//","accessDate":"20240122//","keywords":["Humans","Infant, Newborn","Sheep","Animals","Infant, Extremely Premature","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Fetus/me [Metabolism]","Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","Respiration, Artificial/mt [Methods]","Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","*Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury","Collagen/me [Metabolism]","Pneumonia/pa [Pathology]","*Pneumonia","Surface-Active Agents/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

New lung protective strategies utilizing noninvasive ventilation or low tidal volumes are now common but have not reduced rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We aimed to determine the effect of 24 h of low tidal volume ventilation on the immature lung by ventilating preterm fetal sheep in utero. Preterm fetal sheep at 110 +/- 1(SD) days' gestation underwent sterile surgery for instrumentation with a tracheal loop to enable in utero mechanical ventilation (IUV). At 112 +/- 1 days' gestation, fetuses received either in utero mechanical ventilation (IUV, n = 10) targeting 3-5 mL/kg for 24 h, or no ventilation (CONT, n = 9). At necropsy, fetal lungs were collected to assess molecular and histological markers of lung inflammation and injury. IUV significantly increased lung mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) compared with CONT, and increased surfactant protein (SP)-A1, SP-B, and SP-C mRNA expression compared with CONT. IUV produced modest structural changes to the airways, including reduced parenchymal collagen and myofibroblast density. IUV increased pulmonary arteriole thickness compared with CONT but did not alter overall elastin or collagen content within the vasculature. In utero ventilation of an extremely preterm lung, even at low tidal volumes, induces lung inflammation and injury to the airways and vasculature. In utero ventilation may be an important model to isolate the confounding mechanisms of VILI to develop effective therapies for preterm infants requiring prolonged respiratory support. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Preterm infants often require prolonged respiratory support, but the relative contribution of ventilation to the development of lung injury is difficult to isolate. In utero mechanical ventilation allows for mechanistic investigations into ventilation-induced lung injury without confounding factors associated with sustaining extremely preterm lambs ex utero. Twenty-four hours of in utero ventilation, even at low tidal volumes, increased lung inflammation and surfactant protein expression and produced structural changes to the lung parenchyma and vasculature.","group":"g1","id":"a8ab46e6-ff1d-4967-aca7-242951dbf6d2","_showDetails":true},"d6bfdd9c-d690-470a-a7d5-d76649a7de8c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023 to 2024>","title":"Furin Regulates the Alveolarization of Neonatal Lungs in a Mouse Model of Hyperoxic Lung Injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom13111656","authors":["Kato, Shin","Iwata, Osuke","Kato, Hiroyuki","Fukaya, Satoko","Imai, Yukari","Saitoh, Shinji"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20231116//","keywords":["Animals","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Mice","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Furin/ge [Genetics]","Furin/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia","Infant, Premature","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Injury","Pneumonia/me [Metabolism]","*Pneumonia"],"journal":"Biomolecules","volume":"13","number":"11","isbn":"2218-273X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med24&NEWS=N&AN=38002338"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Despite advances in treatment options, such as corticosteroid administration and less invasive respiratory support, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains an important prognostic factor in preterm infants. We previously reported that furin regulates changes in lung smooth muscle cell phenotypes, suggesting that it plays a critical role in BPD pathogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate whether it regulates the alveolarization of immature lungs through activating alveolarization-driving proteins. We first examined furin expression levels, and its functions, using an established hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model. Thereafter, we treated mice pups, as well as primary myofibroblast cell cultures, with furin inhibitors. Finally, we administered the hyperoxia-exposed mice pups with recombinant furin. Immunofluorescence revealed the co-expression of furin with alpha-smooth muscle actin. Hyperoxia exposure for 10 d decreased alveolar formation, as well as the expression of furin and its target, IGF-1R. Hexa-D-arginine administration also significantly inhibited alveolar formation. Another furin inhibitor, decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone, accumulated pro-IGF-1R, and decreased IGF-1R phosphorylation in myofibroblast primary cultures. Finally, recombinant furin treatment significantly improved alveolarization in hyperoxia-exposed mice pups. Furin regulates alveolarization in immature lungs. Therefore, this study provides novel insights regarding the involvement of furin in BPD pathogenesis, and highlights a potential treatment target for ameliorating the impact of BPD.","group":"g3","id":"d6bfdd9c-d690-470a-a7d5-d76649a7de8c","_showDetails":true},"f5606f93-f567-47e5-a159-75a9a2650a29":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023 to 2024>","title":"Cord blood stem cell-derived Angptl7 ameliorates the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia via anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic effects.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2023.13131","authors":["Ren, Zhuxiao","Yang, Liling","Wang, Jianlan","Han, Jiangxue","Lin, Shouheng","Yao, Yao","Du, Chen","Yang, Jie"],"date":"2024//","accessDate":"20231124//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Infant","Pregnancy","Female","Humans","Animals","Mice","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Angiopoietin-Like Protein 7/ge [Genetics]","Lung Injury/th [Therapy]","Lung Injury/co [Complications]","*Lung Injury","Fetal Blood","Lipopolysaccharides","Stem Cells","Cytokines","Anti-Inflammatory Agents"],"journal":"Molecular medicine reports","volume":"29","number":"1","isbn":"1791-2997","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med24&NEWS=N&AN=37997800"],"address":"Greece","abstract":"Perinatal exposure of the neonatal lung to inflammation leads to decreased lung angiogenesis and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Notably, autologous cord blood mononuclear cells (ACBMNCs) can substantially prevent severe BPD and decrease the inflammatory response in surviving very preterm neonates. Angiopoietin-like protein 7 (Angptl7) is one of the main paracrine cytokines in cord blood stem cells, and is capable of stimulating human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell expansion. The present study compared Angptl7 levels between the ACBMNCs infusion and control groups (cohort 1). Subsequently, the association between cord blood Angptl7 levels and BPD incidence in a cohort of very preterm neonates was assessed (cohort 2). The hypothesis was further verified in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury mouse model. The mRNA expression levels and protein concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the lung tissue and mouse serum were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and ELISA, respectively. The number and diameter of lung vessels and macrophage infiltration were assessed using immunofluorescence staining. Compared with in the control group, Angptl7 levels were significantly higher in the ACBMNCs infusion group in cohort 1. In cohort 2, the cord blood Angptl7 levels were significantly lower in infants who later developed BPD. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher Angptl7 level was an independent protective factor for BPD. The concentrations of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were negatively correlated with cord blood Angptl7 level; whereas, vascular endothelial growth factor-A levels were positively correlated with Angptl7 levels. In the LPS-induced lung injury mouse model, the LPS group presented with a significant loss of pulmonary vessels and smaller vessel diameters, which were ameliorated in the Angptl7 treatment group. Furthermore, LPS-induced lung inflammation and macrophage infiltration were alleviated by Angptl7 treatment (P<0.05). In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic effects of Angptl7 derived from cord blood stem cells may ameliorate BPD severity.

Regarding reported benefits on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, the potential adverse effects of high-dose docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on this short-term neonatal morbidity need further investigations in infants born very preterm. This study will determine whether high-dose DHA enteral supplementation during the neonatal period is associated with the risk of severe BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) compared with control, in contemporary cohorts of preterm infants born at less than 29 weeks of gestation., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: As part of an Australian-Canadian collaboration, we will conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials targeting infants born at less than 29 weeks of gestation and evaluating the effect of high-dose DHA enteral supplementation in the neonatal period compared with a control. Primary outcome will be severe grades of BPD (yes/no) at 36 weeks' PMA harmonised according to a recent definition that predicts early childhood morbidities. Other outcomes will be survival without severe BPD, death, BPD severity grades, serious brain injury, severe retinopathy of prematurity, patent ductus arteriosus and necrotising enterocolitis requiring surgery, sepsis, combined neonatal morbidities and growth. Severe BPD will be compared between groups using a multivariate generalised estimating equations log-binomial regression model.

The objective of this study was to better understand how proteome modulation and cell-type shifts are noted in BPD pathology. Pediatric human donors aged 1-3 yr were classified based on history of prematurity and histopathology consistent with \"healed\" BPD (hBPD, n = 3) and \"established\" BPD (eBPD, n = 3) compared with respective full-term born (n = 6) age-matched term controls. Proteins were quantified by tandem mass spectroscopy with selected Western blot validations. Multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) microscopy was performed on lung sections to enumerate cell types. Protein abundances and MxIF cell frequencies were compared among groups using ANOVA. Cell type and ontology enrichment were performed using an in-house tool and/or EnrichR. Proteomics detected 5,746 unique proteins, 186 upregulated and 534 downregulated, in eBPD versus control with fewer proteins differentially abundant in hBPD as compared with age-matched term controls. Cell-type enrichment suggested a loss of alveolar type I, alveolar type II, endothelial/capillary, and lymphatics, and an increase in smooth muscle and fibroblasts consistent with MxIF. Histochemistry and Western analysis also supported predictions of upregulated ferroptosis in eBPD versus control. Finally, several extracellular matrix components mapping to angiogenesis signaling pathways were altered in eBPD. Despite clear parsing by protein abundance, comparative MxIF analysis confirms phenotypic variability in BPD.

Its role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains inadequately understood. To address this gap, we obtained BPD-related RNA-seq data and ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) from the GEO database and FerrDb, respectively. A total of 171 BPD-related differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DE-FRGs) linked to the regulation of autophagy and immune response were identified. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and SVM-RFE algorithms identified 23 and 14 genes, respectively, as marker genes. The intersection of these 2 sets yielded 9 genes (ALOX12B, NR1D1, LGMN, IFNA21, MEG3, AKR1C1, CA9, ABCC5, and GALNT14) with acceptable diagnostic capacity. The results of the functional enrichment analysis indicated that these identified marker genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD through the regulation of immune response, cell cycle, and BPD-related pathways. Additionally, we identified 29 drugs that target 5 of the marker genes, which could have potential therapeutic implications. The ceRNA network we constructed revealed a complex regulatory network based on the marker genes, further highlighting their potential roles in BPD.

BPD-PH is characterized by vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. Nitric oxide (NO) is a pulmonary vasodilator and apoptotic mediator made in the pulmonary endothelium by NO synthase (eNOS). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous eNOS inhibitor, primarily metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1). Our hypothesis is that DDAH1 knockdown in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) will result in lower NO production, decreased apoptosis, and greater proliferation of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (hPASMC), whereas DDAH1 overexpression will have the opposite effect. hPMVECs were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting DDAH1 (siDDAH1)/scramble or adenoviral vector containing DDAH1 (AdDDAH1)/AdGFP for 24 h and co-cultured for 24 h with hPASMC. Analyses included Western blot for cleaved and total caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, beta-actin; trypan blue exclusion for viable cell numbers; terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL); and BrdU incorporation. Small interfering RNA targeting DDAH1 (siDDAH1) transfected into hPMVEC resulted in lower media nitrites, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 protein expression, and TUNEL staining; and greater viable cell numbers and BrdU incorporation in co-cultured hPASMC.

Partial recovery of hPASMC viable cell numbers after AdDDAH1-hPMVEC transfection was observed when media were treated with hemoglobin to sequester NO. In conclusion, hPMVEC-DDAH1-mediated NO production positively regulates hPASMC apoptosis, which may prevent/attenuate aberrant pulmonary vascular proliferation/remodeling in BPD-PH.

Unstoppable efforts of preterm labor in 28+0 WGA and supposed amniotic infection syndrome necessitated emergency cesarean section. The preterm infant underwent NICU therapy, developed an early-onset neonatal sepsis and therapy-refractory pulmonary insufficiency with consecutive right heart failure, resulting in death on the 36th day of life. Microbiota analyses by 16Sr DNA sequencing was performed from maternal vaginal swabs and from neonatal pharyngeal swabs. Maternal antibiotic treatment resulted in depletion of physiological vaginal colonization with Lactobacillus crispatus.

It may arise from the many causes of the respiratory distress syndrome such as hyaline membrane disease, transient tachypnoea of the newborn, meconium aspiration etc. Congenital heart disease rarely presents with early tachypnoea on day one or two, in contrast to the early presentation of cyanosis, unless there is \"pump\" (ventricular) failure such as may occur in a cardiomyopathy/myocarditis, or as a result of severe obstruction to either ventricle. Space-occupying lesions within the chest, for example from a diaphragmatic hernia or a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, may present with early tachypnoea, as can a metabolic cause resulting in acidosis. The aim of this paper, however, is to focus on infants where the tachypnoea persists or develops beyond the newborn period, at times with minimal signs but occasionally with serious underlying pathology. They include causes that may have originated in the newborn but then persist; for example, arising from pulmonary hypoplasia or polycythemia. Many congenital cardiac abnormalities, particularly those causing left sided obstructive lesions, or those due to an increasing left to right shunt from large communications between the systemic and pulmonary circulations, need be considered. Respiratory causes, for example arising from aspiration, primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease, may lead to ongoing tachypnoea.

While time domain measures of NNS are available in real time at cribside, our understanding of suck pattern generation in the frequency domain is limited. The aim of this study is to model the development of NNS in the frequency domain using Fourier and machine learning (ML) techniques in extremely preterm infants (EPIs)., Methods: A total of 117 EPIs were randomized to a pulsed or sham orocutaneous intervention during tube feedings 3 times/day for 4 weeks, beginning at 30 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Infants were assessed 3 times/week for NNS dynamics until they attained 100% oral feeding or NICU discharge. Digitized NNS signals were processed in the frequency domain using two transforms, including the Welch power spectral density (PSD) method, and the Yule-Walker PSD method. Data analysis proceeded in two stages. Stage 1: ML longitudinal cluster analysis was conducted to identify groups (classes) of infants, each showing a unique pattern of change in Welch and Yule-Walker calculations during the interventions. Stage 2: linear mixed modeling (LMM) was performed for the Welch and Yule-Walker dependent variables to examine the effects of gestationally-aged (GA), PMA, sex (male, female), patient type [respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)], treatment (NTrainer, Sham), intervention phase [1, 2, 3], cluster class, and phase-by-class interaction., Results: ML of Welch PSD method and Yule-Walker PSD method measures revealed three membership classes of NNS growth patterns. The dependent measures peak_Hz, PSD amplitude, and area under the curve (AUC) are highly dependent on PMA, but show little relation to respiratory status (RDS, BPD) or somatosensory intervention. Thus, neural regulation of NNS in the frequency domain is significantly different for each identified cluster (classes A, B, C) during this developmental period., Conclusions: Efforts to increase our knowledge of the evolution of the suck central pattern generator (sCPG) in preterm infants, including NNS rhythmogenesis will help us better understand the observed phenotypes of NNS production in both the frequency and time domains. Knowledge of those features of the NNS which are relatively invariant vs. other features which are modifiable by experience will likewise inform more effective treatment strategies in this fragile population.","group":"g1","id":"8174c5b7-8945-45f5-81a0-c6a5075a240b","_showDetails":true},"e1ee6830-79b3-42fa-8c9a-d432104aeba8":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2023>","title":"Cerebral Myelination in a Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Murine Model.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/children10081321","authors":["Chen, Wenwen","Wang, Ran","Chen, Chao"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230731//","journal":"Children (Basel, Switzerland)","volume":"10","number":"8","isbn":"2227-9067","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm8&NEWS=N&AN=37628321"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a devastating disease in preterm infants concurrent with neurodevelopmental disorders.

We here describe new developments in lung function testing and sleep-disordered breathing diagnosis, early life exposures affecting pulmonary function in children and effect of COVID-19 on sleep and lung function. In paediatric asthma, we present the important role of the exposome in asthma development, and how biologics can provide better outcomes. We discuss new methods to assess distal airways in children with CF, as some details remain blind when using the lung clearance index. Moreover, we summarise the new ERS guidelines for bronchiectasis management in children and adolescents. We present interventions to reduce morbidity and monitor pulmonary function in newborns at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and long-term chronic respiratory morbidity of this disease. In respiratory epidemiology, we characterise primary ciliary dyskinesia, identify early life determinants of respiratory health and describe the effect of COVID-19 preventive measures on respiratory symptoms. Also, we describe the epidemiology of interstitial lung diseases, possible consequences of tracheomalacia and a classification of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage in children. Finally, we highlight that the characterisation of genes and pathways involved in the development of a disease is essential to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Although the therapy is currently undergoing clinical development, the lung distribution of budesonide throughout the premature neonatal lung has not yet been investigated. Here, we applied mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to investigate the surfactant-assisted distal lung distribution of budesonide. Unlabeled budesonide was either delivered using saline as a vehicle (n = 5) or in combination with a standard dose of the porcine surfactant Poractant alfa (n = 5). These lambs were ventilated for one minute, and then the lungs were extracted for MSI analysis. Another group of lambs (n = 5) received the combination of budesonide and Poractant alfa, followed by two hours of mechanical ventilation. MSI enabled the label-free detection and visualization of both budesonide and the essential constituent of Poractant alfa, the porcine surfactant protein C (SP-C). 2D ion intensity images revealed a non-uniform distribution of budesonide with saline, which appeared clustered in clumps. In contrast, the combination therapy showed a more homogeneous distribution of budesonide throughout the sample, with more budesonide distributed towards the lung periphery. We found similar distribution patterns for the SP-C and budesonide in consecutive lung tissue sections, indicating that budesonide was transported across the lungs associated with the exogenous surfactant. After two hours of mechanical ventilation, the budesonide intensity signal in the 2D ion intensity maps dropped dramatically, suggesting a rapid lung clearance and highlighting the relevance of achieving a uniform surfactant-assisted lung distribution of budesonide early after delivery to maximize the anti-inflammatory and maturational effects throughout the lung.","group":"g1","id":"b8cdf3b8-11db-4a1b-a6db-b29e6ca2b294","_showDetails":true},"2cf43e75-b9e0-4ed3-bf93-b77b8d135d63":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) PubMed-not-MEDLINE <2021>","title":"Long non-coding RNA Rian protects against experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia by sponging miR-421.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10213","authors":["Tao, Xifeng","Fang, Yafei","Huo, Chen"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210519//","journal":"Experimental and therapeutic medicine","volume":"22","number":"1","isbn":"1792-0981","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=pmnm6&NEWS=N&AN=34055080"],"address":"Greece","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a frequent complication characterized by accelerated lung alveolarization in newborns. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRs) are regarded as essential regulators in various diseases, including BPD. However, the detailed mechanism of the functions of RNA imprinted and accumulated in nucleus (Rian) lncRNA in the progression of BPD have remained elusive. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the interaction between miR-421 and Rian in BPD models and MLE-12 cells. The ability of Rian to protect neonatal lungs from hyperoxia-induced lung damage was examined. A mouse model of BPD and a hyperoxia-stimulated MLE-12 cell damage model were generated and treated with specific plasmid/mimics for the overexpression of Rian/miR-421. The interaction between miR-421 and Rian was predicted and verified using StarBase and a dual-luciferase reporter assay, respectively. The expression levels of miR-421 or Rian in both tissues and the MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cell line were assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR. As parameters of alveolarization, the mean linear intercept (MLI), radial alveolar count (RAC) and the lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratio were measured. Furthermore, RT-qPCR was used to measure mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta) in the lung tissue of mice, and ELISAs were performed to determine the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta) in the supernatant of MLE-12 cells. Cell growth and apoptosis were evaluated using an MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity was assessed using a caspase-3 activity detection kit. Prediction with StarBase and the dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-421 directly targeted Rian. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that Rian was downregulated and miR-421 was upregulated in lung tissues of the mouse model of BPD and in hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells. However, the expression of miR-421 was decreased by Rian-overexpression, an effect that was reversed by miR-421 mimics. In addition, BPD was alleviated by Rian-plasmid, as confirmed by the enhanced RAC and reduced MLI and LW/BW ratio. The present results also indicated that Rian-plasmid inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta) in BPD mouse serum and hyperoxia-induced MLE-12 cells. In addition, Rian-plasmid eliminated the effect of hyperoxia to inhibit cell viability and induce apoptosis in MLE-12 cells. However, all of these effects of Rian were markedly reversed by miR-421 mimics. The present results indicated that Rian may attenuate hyperoxic damage in neonatal lungs and may serve as a novel molecular target for BPD treatment.

Therefore, we established a workflow that allows for the generation-specific quantitative (stereological) analysis of pulmonary blood vessels. A whole left rabbit lung was fixed by vascular perfusion, embedded in glycol methacrylate and imaged by micro-computed tomography (microCT).

Secondary objectives include determination of ROP prevalence; correlation of gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW) and other risk factors to ROP; and identification of the most common intervention., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Retrospective cross-sectional study of ROP records between 1 December 2013 and 30 November 2018 from the Medical Retina Service of the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences of the institution was studied. Variables with p value <0.05 were considered significant. STATA V.14 was used for all analysis., RESULTS: Only 851 of 898 infants screened for ROP were included in the study. Of these 698 would have been screened based on 2005 guidelines. All 118 infants with ROP were identified by both guidelines. Detection rate was higher using the 2005 than the 2013 guidelines (16.9% vs 13.3%, p value=0.0496). ROP prevalence was 9.7%.

Although a stage-specific alteration of lung lipidome occurs during postnatal lung development, whether neonatal hyperoxia, a known mediator of BPD in rodent models, changes lipid profiles in mouse lungs is still to be elucidated. To answer this question, newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 3 days and allowed to recover in normoxia until postnatal day (pnd) 7 and pnd14, time-points spanning the peak stage of alveologenesis. A total of 2263 lung lipid species were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, covering 5 lipid categories and 18 lipid subclasses. The most commonly identified lipid species were glycerophospholipids, followed by sphingolipids and glycerolipids. In normoxic conditions, certain glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid species augmented at pnd14 compared to pnd7. At pnd7, hyperoxia generally increased glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, and glycerolipid species. Hyperoxia increased NADPH, acetyl CoA, and citrate acid but reduced carnitine and acyl carnitine. Hyperoxia increased oxidized glutathione but reduced catalase. These changes were not apparent at pnd14. Hyperoxia reduced docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid at pnd14 but not at pnd7. Altogether, the lung lipidome changes throughout alveolarization. Neonatal hyperoxia alters the lung lipidome, which may contribute to alveolar simplification and dysregulated vascular development.","group":"g1","id":"f7c75522-46ce-4f76-b496-8491ad940896","_showDetails":true},"93769eff-3321-46ab-8739-a5d76b10a65b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Oxygen toxicity causes cyclic damage by destabilizing specific Fe-S cluster-containing protein complexes.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.02.013","authors":["Baik, Alan H","Haribowo, Augustinus G","Chen, Xuewen","Queliconi, Bruno B","Barrios, Alec M","Garg, Ankur","Maishan, Mazharul","Campos, Alexandre R","Matthay, Michael A","Jain, Isha H"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230308//","keywords":["Animals","Humans","Mice","Electron Transport Complex I/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Hyperoxia","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Mitochondria/me [Metabolism]","Mitochondrial Diseases/me [Metabolism]","*Mitochondrial Diseases","Oxygen/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Molecular cell","volume":"83","number":"6","isbn":"1097-2765","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=36893757"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Oxygen is toxic across all three domains of life. Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically investigate the major cellular pathways affected by excess molecular oxygen. We find that hyperoxia destabilizes a specific subset of Fe-S cluster (ISC)-containing proteins, resulting in impaired diphthamide synthesis, purine metabolism, nucleotide excision repair, and electron transport chain (ETC) function. Our findings translate to primary human lung cells and a mouse model of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. We demonstrate that the ETC is the most vulnerable to damage, resulting in decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption. This leads to further tissue hyperoxia and cyclic damage of the additional ISC-containing pathways. In support of this model, primary ETC dysfunction in the Ndufs4 KO mouse model causes lung tissue hyperoxia and dramatically increases sensitivity to hyperoxia-mediated ISC damage. This work has important implications for hyperoxia pathologies, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, aging, and mitochondrial disorders. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, it may lead to alveolar simplification and loss of proximal airway epithelial cilia. Little is known about the mechanism by which hyperoxia causes ciliary dysfunction in the proximal respiratory tract. We hypothesized that hyperoxia causes intraflagellar transport (IFT) dysfunction with resultant decreased cilia length. Differentiated basal human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) were exposed to hyperoxia or air for up to 48 h. Neonatal mice (<12 h old) were exposed to hyperoxia for 72 h and recovered in room air until postnatal day (PND) 60. Cilia length was measured from scanning electron microscopy images using a MATLAB-derived program. Proteomics and metabolomics were carried out in cells after hyperoxia. After hyperoxia, there was a significant time-dependent reduction in cilia length after hyperoxia in HAEC. Proteomic analysis showed decreased abundance of multiple proteins related to IFT including dynein motor proteins. In neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia, there was a significant decrease in acetylated alpha tubulin at PND10 followed by recovery to normal levels at PND60. In HAEC, hyperoxia decreased the abundance of multiple proteins associated with complex I of the electron transport chain. In HAEC, hyperoxia increased levels of malate, fumarate, and citrate, and reduced the ATP/ADP ratio at 24 h with a subsequent increase at 36 h. Exposure to hyperoxia reduced cilia length, and this was associated with aberrant IFT protein expression and dysregulated metabolism. This suggests that hyperoxic exposure leads to aberrant IFT protein expression in the respiratory epithelium resulting in shortened cilia.","group":"g1","id":"387557f8-3a9e-4b86-8c86-3aad153b67ee","_showDetails":true},"c91c8cfd-55bf-46fa-84f6-1381a438ea2c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Smartphone application links severity of retinopathy of prematurity to early motor behavior in a cohort of high-risk preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaapos.2022.11.018","authors":["Rodriguez, Sarah Hilkert","Blair, Michael P","Timtim, Elise","Millman, Ryan","Si, Zhuangjun","Wroblewski, Kristen","Andrews, Bree","Msall, Michael E","Peyton, Colleen"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230113//","keywords":["Infant","Infant, Newborn","Humans","Infant, Premature","Retinopathy of Prematurity/co [Complications]","*Retinopathy of Prematurity","Smartphone","Bevacizumab","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Gestational Age","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus","volume":"27","number":"1","isbn":"1091-8531","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=36642242"],"address":"United States","abstract":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the General Movement Assessment (GMA) with the Motor Optimality Score-Revised (MOS-R) as a neurodevelopmental marker in infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)., METHODS: Infants screened prospectively for ROP were evaluated at 3 months' post-term age using a smartphone application to complete the GMA and MOS-R. Results were analyzed by ROP severity., RESULTS: Of 105 enrolled infants, 83 completed the study. Of these, 54 (65%) had any ROP, 32 (39%) had severe ROP, and 13 (16%) had type 1 ROP. The proportion with aberrant GMA was significantly higher in infants with severe ROP (14/32 [44%]) compared with infants who had milder ROP (8/51 [16%]; P = 0.006). Of those with severe ROP, there was no significant difference comparing infants with type 1 ROP treated with bevacizumab (7/13 [54%]) to infants with type 2 ROP without treatment (7/19 [37%]; P = 0.47). Although the presence of any ROP, stage of ROP, and severe ROP each predicted lower MOS-R scores on univariate analyses, only severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and markers of brain injury remained significant in the multivariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: The GMA was a convenient, short-term method of data collection with low attrition. Although severe ROP initially appeared linked to poor early motor scores, this association is likely confounded by neurological and respiratory complications, which frequently accompany severe ROP.

Female alveolar epithelial cells had less EMT and pulmonary fibrosis signaling in hyperoxia. In the endothelium, expansion of Car4+ EC (Cap2) was seen in hyperoxia along with an emergent subpopulation of Cap2 with repressed VEGF signaling. This regenerative response was increased in females exposed to hyperoxia. Mesenchymal cells had inflammatory signatures in hyperoxia, with a new distal interstitial fibroblast subcluster characterized by repressed lipid biosynthesis and a transcriptomic signature resembling myofibroblasts.

Meta-analyses suggest that corticosteroids may be associated with increased survival without cerebral palsy in infants at high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) but are associated with adverse

Whether this association exists in contemporary practice is uncertain because most randomized clinical trials administered corticosteroids earlier and at higher doses than currently recommended., Objective: To evaluate whether the pretreatment risk of death or grade 2 or 3 BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age modified the association between postnatal corticosteroid therapy and death or disability at 2 years' corrected age in extremely preterm infants., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed data on 482 matched pairs of infants from 45 participating US hospitals in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network Generic Database (GDB). Infants were included in the cohort if they were born at less than 27 weeks' gestation between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2017; survived the first 7 postnatal days; and had 2-year death or developmental follow-up data collected between January 2013 and December 2019. Corticosteroid-treated infants were propensity score matched with untreated controls. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2019, to November 30, 2022., Exposure: Systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent BPD that was initiated between day 8 and day 42 after birth., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was death or moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years' corrected age. The secondary outcome was death or moderate to severe cerebral palsy at 2 years' corrected age., Results: A total of 482 matched pairs of infants (mean [SD] gestational age, 24.1 [1.1] weeks]; 270 males [56.0%]) were included from 656 corticosteroid-treated infants and 2796 potential controls. Most treated infants (363 [75.3%]) received dexamethasone. The risk of death or disability associated with corticosteroid therapy was inversely associated with the estimated pretreatment probability of death or grade 2 or 3 BPD. The risk difference for death or neurodevelopmental impairment associated with corticosteroids decreased by 2.7% (95% CI, 1.9%-3.5%) for each 10% increase in the pretreatment risk of death or grade 2 or 3 BPD. This risk transitioned from estimated net harm to benefit when the pretreatment risk of death or grade 2 or 3 BPD exceeded 53% (95% CI, 44%-61%). For death or cerebral palsy, the risk difference decreased by 3.6% (95% CI, 2.9%-4.4%) for each 10% increase in the risk of death or grade 2 or 3 BPD and transitioned from estimated net harm to benefit at a pretreatment risk of 40% (95% CI, 33%-46%)., Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggested that corticosteroids were associated with a reduced risk of death or disability in infants at moderate to high pretreatment risk of death or grade 2 or 3 BPD but with possible harm in infants at lower risk.","group":"g1","id":"9b602d5d-2027-403a-9471-e46016398721","_showDetails":true},"1c3a3a98-f75d-460d-a8f9-40d031099edc":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"Remarkable sex-specific differences at single-cell resolution in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00269.2022","authors":["Cantu, Abiud","Gutierrez, Manuel C","Dong, Xiaoyu","Leek, Connor","Sajti, Eniko","Lingappan, Krithika"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20221025//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Animals","Male","Female","Humans","Mice","*Lung Injury","*Hyperoxia","Endothelial Cells","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Lung","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Animals, Newborn"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

BPD management aims to minimize further injury, provide an optimal environment to support growth and recovery. In clinic neonatal care, we need a new therapy for BPD. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) inhibit cell apoptosis and promote cell repair allowing cells to survive lethal injury. We hypothesized that Hsp70 could be used to prevent hyperoxia related BPD in the neonatal rat model through its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we explored the effect of Hsp70 on hyperoxia-induced lung injury using neonatal rats. Neonatal Wistar rats were delivered naturally at full term of gestation and were then pooled and randomly assigned to several groups to receive heat stimulation (41degreeC for 20 min) or room temperature conditions. The Hsp70 group received recombinant Hsp70 intraperitoneally (200 mug/kg, daily). All newborn rats were placed under hyperoxic conditions (85% oxygen) for 21 days. Survival rates in both heat-hyperoxia and Hsp70-hyperoxia groups were higher than those in the hyperoxia group (p < 0.05). Both endogenous and exogenous Hsp70 could reduce early apoptosis of alveolar cells under hyperoxia. Additionally, there were less macrophage infiltration in the lung of the Hsp70 groups (p < 0.05). Heat stress, heat shock proteins, and exogenous recombinant Hsp70 significantly increased the survival rate and reduced pathological hyperoxia induced lung injuries in the development of BPD. These results suggest that treating hyperoxia-induced lung injury with Hsp70 may reduce the risk of developing BPD. Copyright: © 2023 Lee et al.

Previously, the authors reported that the Wnt signaling plays a key role in alveolar injury and repair by regulating alveolar epithelial type II cell (AECII) proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, the authors wished to investigate whether Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo signaling pathway, affects AECII proliferation and differentiation via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in BPD. It was found that YAP regulated AECII proliferation and differentiation. A decreased expression of YAP, Wnt3a and nuclear beta-catenin was observed in lung tissues affected by BPD. In vitro, YAP and Wnt3a overexpression in BPD promoted AECII proliferation and differentiation into AECIs by increasing the nuclear transfer of beta-catenin and vice versa. The effects of a decreased Wnt3a expression in primary AECIIs in BPD were compensated by YAP overexpression, as were the effects of Wnt3a knockdown in primary AECIIs. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that YAP and Wnt3a independently promote AECII proliferation and differentiation in experimental BPD by increasing the nuclear beta-catenin levels. Therefore, Wnt3a or YAP may be candidate regulatory targets for improving the outcomes of BPD.","group":"g5","id":"ed7eb3f0-d9d5-454e-8945-25afb79a2736","_showDetails":true},"60787a6b-46d4-4c2f-b92a-9adf69c18595":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2023>","title":"High continuous positive airway pressures versus non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in preterm neonates: protocol for a multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-069024","authors":["Mukerji, Amit","Rempel, Emily","Thabane, Lehana","Johnson, Heather","Schmolzer, Georg","Law, Brenda Hiu Yan","Jani, Pranav","Tracy, Mark","Rottkamp, Catherine","Keszler, Martin","Kirpalani, Haresh","Shah, Prakesh S","Amyotte M","Brazil M","Beattie K","Fray C","Perla E","Luig M","Shah D","Skelton H","McDonagh H","McElroy S","NOVEL Trial Group"],"date":"2023//","accessDate":"20230214//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Infant","Child","Humans","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/mt [Methods]","Pilot Projects","Infant, Premature","Intermittent Positive-Pressure Ventilation/mt [Methods]","*Noninvasive Ventilation","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/th [Therapy]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn","Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Multicenter Studies as Topic"],"journal":"BMJ open","volume":"13","number":"2","isbn":"2044-6055","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med23&NEWS=N&AN=36787974"],"address":"England","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Low pressure nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has long been the mainstay of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm neonates, at a constant distending pressure of 5-8 cmH2O. When traditional nCPAP pressures are insufficient, other modes including nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are used. In recent years, high nCPAP pressures (>=9 cmH2O) have also emerged as an alternative. However, the comparative benefits and risks of these modalities remain unknown., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial, infants <29 weeks' gestational age (GA) who either: (A) fail treatment with traditional nCPAP or (B) being extubated from invasive mechanical ventilation with mean airway pressure >=10 cmH2O, will be randomised to receive either high nCPAP (positive end-expiratory pressure 9-15 cmH2O) or NIPPV (target mean Paw 9-15 cmH2O). Primary outcome is feasibility of the conduct of a larger, definitive trial as assessed by rates of recruitment and protocol violations. The main secondary outcome is failure of assigned treatment within 7 days postrandomisation. Multiple other clinical outcomes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be ascertained.

Many unanswered questions remain about the content and cargo of EVs in premature infants and their role in lung development. To characterize EVs during human lung development, tracheal aspirates were collected from premature neonates between 22 and 35 wk gestational age and analyzed via nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and bead-based flow cytometry. EVs were detectable across late canalicular through saccular stages of lung development, demonstrating larger sizes earlier in gestation. EVs contained an abundance of the EV-enriched tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81, as well as epithelial cell and immune cell markers. Increases in select surface proteins (CD24 and CD14) on EVs were associated with gestational age and with the risk of BPD. Finally, query of expression data obtained from epithelial cells in a single-cell atlas of murine lung development found that epithelial EV marker expression also changes with developmental time. Together, these data demonstrate an association between EV profile and lung development and provide a foundation for future functional classification of EVs, with the goal of determining their role in cell signaling during development and harnessing their potential as a new therapeutic target in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"e79f32b5-cf30-4119-b306-5103c3164aa7","_showDetails":true},"51bcc473-f593-44b4-a0cc-2012c653f8ee":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"SMOFlipid Impact on Growth and Neonatal Morbidities in Very Preterm Infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu14193952","authors":["Asfour, Suzan S","Alshaikh, Belal","AlMahmoud, Latifah","Sumaily, Haider H","Alodhaidan, Nabeel A","Alkhourmi, Mousa","Abahussain, Hissah A","Khalil, Thanaa M","Albeshri, Bushra A","Alhamidi, Aroub A","Al-Anazi, Maha R","Asfour, Raneem S","Al-Mouqdad, Mountasser M"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20220923//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Fat Emulsions, Intravenous","Female","Fish Oils","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases","Male","Morbidity","Olive Oil","Parenteral Nutrition","*Sepsis","Soybean Oil","Triglycerides"],"journal":"Nutrients","volume":"14","number":"19","isbn":"2072-6643","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med22&NEWS=N&AN=36235604"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"The soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil lipid (SMOFlipid) is increasingly being used worldwide without definite evidence of its benefits.

Disruption of genes in the network can interrupt normal development and cause diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) - a chronic lung disease in preterm infants with morbid and sometimes lethal consequences characterized by lung immaturity and reduced alveolarization. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse exhibiting a moderate severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) at the onset of alveologenesis. Using approaches mirroring the construction of the model GRN in sea urchin's development, we constructed the IGF1 signaling network underlying alveologenesis using this mouse model that phenocopies BPD. The constructed GRN, consisting of 43 genes, provides a bird's eye view of how the genes downstream of IGF1 are regulatorily connected. The GRN also reveals a mechanistic interpretation of how the effects of IGF1 signaling are transduced within SCMF from its specification genes to its effector genes and then from SCMF to its neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with WNT5A and FGF10 signaling as the bridge. Consistently, blocking WNT5A signaling in mice phenocopies BPD as inferred by the network. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD. Our network view of alveologenesis is transforming our perspective to understand and treat BPD. This new perspective calls for the construction of the full signaling GRN underlying alveologenesis, upon which targeted therapies for this neonatal chronic lung disease can be viably developed.

However, its role in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury has not been delineated. In this study, we investigate whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury by regulating FPR2 activity. We observed a significant increase in FPR2 levels in alveolar macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) after H2O2-induced stress, which decreased after MSC treatment. In the H2O2-induction model, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha) were significantly reduced in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with WRW4, an inhibitor of FPR2, or MSCs. Viability of lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells was significantly improved when cultured in the conditioned media of RAW264.7 cells treated with WRW4 or MSCs, compared to when cultured in the conditioned media of control RAW265.7 cells exposed to H2O2. For the in vivo study, wild-type and FPR2 knockout (FPR2-/-) C57/BL6 mouse pups were randomly exposed to 80% oxygen or room air from postnatal day (P) 1 to P14. At P5, 2 x 105 MSCs were transplanted intratracheally. MSCs reduced the elevated FPR2 activity at P7 and improved the decreased FPR2 activity as well as the increased immuno-stained FPR2 activity in alveolar macrophages in hyperoxic lungs at P14. Both FPR2-/- and MSCs similarly attenuated impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis, and increased apoptosis and inflammation of hyperoxic lungs without synergistic effects. Our findings suggest that the protective effects of MSCs in hyperoxic lung injury might be related to indirect modulation of FPR2 activity, at least of alveolar macrophages in neonatal mice.","group":"g1","id":"6c73966d-4d1c-4ece-b8c4-e0f5876997fd","_showDetails":true},"6b018d22-0795-46ca-8119-374758d2fe22":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"Neonatal hyperoxia in mice triggers long-term cognitive deficits via impairments in cerebrovascular function and neurogenesis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI146095","authors":["Lithopoulos, Marissa A","Toussay, Xavier","Zhong, Shumei","Xu, Liqun","Mustafa, Shamimunisa B","Ouellette, Julie","Freitas-Andrade, Moises","Comin, Cesar H","Bassam, Hayam A","Baker, Adam N","Sun, Yiren","Wakem, Michael","Moreira, Alvaro G","Blanco, Cynthia L","Vadivel, Arul","Tsilfidis, Catherine","Seidner, Steven R","Slack, Ruth S","Lagace, Diane C","Wang, Jing","Lacoste, Baptiste","Thebaud, Bernard"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20221115//","keywords":["Infant, Newborn","Female","Mice","Humans","Animals","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia","Animals, Newborn","*Premature Birth","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Neurogenesis","Cognitive Dysfunction/et [Etiology]","*Cognitive Dysfunction","Cognition","Lung/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","volume":"132","number":"22","isbn":"0021-9738","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med22&NEWS=N&AN=36136598"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Preterm birth is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age.

While neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are crucial for proper brain development, it is unclear whether they play a role in BPD-associated neurodevelopmental deficits.

Eligible participants were infants born at 23 to 33 weeks' gestation between 2000 and 2020. Infants transferred from or to other health care facilities prior to discharge or death were excluded in analysis of outcomes. Data were analyzed from December 2021 until May 2022., Exposures: The presence of anomalies of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra was assessed. Covariates were discharge year, exposure to antenatal steroids, sex, maternal race, gestational age, birthweight, mechanical ventilation in first 72 hours of life, genetic disorders, and extrarenal anomalies., Main Outcomes and Measures: Death or in-hospital severe illness (acute kidney injury, kidney failure, intracranial hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bacterial sepsis, or administration of inotrope or vasopressor)., Results: In this cohort of 409704 infants, 191105 (46.6%) were girls, mean (SD) gestational age was 30.1 (2.84) weeks, and mean (SD) birth weight was 1.49 (0.53) kg. A total of 8093 infants (2.0%) had CAKUT, with urinary tract dilation comprising the majority of cases (5669 [70.0%]). The presence of CAKUT correlated with earlier gestational age and was associated with genetic disorders and extrarenal anomalies. Analysis of 323957 infants after exclusions demonstrated an adjusted odds ratio of 3.96 (95% CI, 3.70-4.24) of death or severe illness. This risk was found across all forms of CAKUT including isolated urinary tract dilation., Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that clinicians caring for preterm infants should have higher suspicion for CAKUT and consider screening, particularly those with extrarenal anomalies or genetic disorders, as preterm infants with CAKUT appear to be at significantly higher risk of death or severe illness. Detection of CAKUT can inform risk stratification and clinical decision making, and should also prompt clinicians to consider a genetic evaluation.","group":"g1","id":"3d3a8cba-46ef-4933-adca-287ca536d4b4","_showDetails":true},"e94d4f9e-d70c-4bca-803a-acae52d2e6a7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"Bone mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes prevent hyperoxia-induced apoptosis of primary type II alveolar epithelial cells in vitro.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13692","authors":["Yang, Wei","Huang, Chao","Wang, Wenjian","Zhang, Baozhu","Chen, Yunbin","Xie, Xinlin"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20220902//","keywords":["Rats","Animals","Alveolar Epithelial Cells","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/me [Metabolism]","Exosomes/me [Metabolism]","*Exosomes","Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/me [Metabolism]","Apoptosis","TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/me [Metabolism]","Oxygen/me [Metabolism]","Mesenchymal Stem Cells/me [Metabolism]","*Mesenchymal Stem Cells"],"journal":"PeerJ","volume":"10","isbn":"2167-8359","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med22&NEWS=N&AN=36071827"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Background: The presence of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs) is one of the most important causes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Exosomes from bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can reduce hyperoxia-induced damage and provide better results in terms of alveolar and pulmonary vascularization parameters than BMSCs. Currently, intervention studies using BMSC-derived exosomes on the signaling pathways regulating proliferation and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells under the condition of BPD have not been reported. This study investigated the effects of rat BMSC-derived exosomes on the proliferation and apoptosis of hyperoxia-induced primary AECIIs in vitro., Methods: The isolated AECIIs were grouped as follows: normal control (21% oxygen), hyperoxia (85% oxygen), hyperoxia+exosome (20 microg/mL), hyperoxia+exosome+LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor, 20 microM), and hyperoxia+exosome+rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor, 5 nM). We used the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to determine the roles of the PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. The effects of BMSC-derived exosomes on AECII proliferation and apoptosis were assessed, respectively., Results: Decreased levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, the cell proliferation protein Ki67, p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR, as well as increased levels of AECII apoptosis and the proapoptotic protein Bax in the hyperoxia group were observed. Notably, Sprague Dawley rat BMSC-derived exosomes could reverse the effect of hyperoxia on AECII proliferation. However, the application of LY294002 and rapamycin inhibited the protective effects of BMSC-derived exosomes., Conclusion: Our findings revealed that BMSC-derived exosomes could regulate the expression of apoptosis-related proteins likely via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby preventing hyperoxia-induced AECII apoptosis.

Proteomic and morphometric studies showed that tunicamycin directly increased ER stress of rat lungs and decreased lung complexity with a BPD phenotype. Previously, we showed that hyperoxia initiates a cycle of destruction that we hypothesized starts from increasing OS through MPO accumulation and then increases ER stress to cause BPD. To inhibit ER stress, we used tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a molecular chaperone. To break the cycle of destruction and reduce OS and MPO, we used N-acetyl-lysyltyrosylcysteine amide (KYC). The fact that TUDCA improved lung complexity in tunicamycin- and hyperoxia-treated rat pups supports the idea that ER stress plays a causal role in BPD. Additional support comes from data showing TUDCA decreased lung myeloid cells and MPO levels in the lungs of tunicamycin- and hyperoxia-treated rat pups. These data link OS and MPO to ER stress in the mechanisms mediating BPD. KYC's inhibition of ER stress in the tunicamycin-treated rat pup's lung provides additional support for the idea that MPO-induced ER stress plays a causal role in the BPD phenotype. ER stress appears to expand our proposed cycle of destruction. Our results suggest ER stress evolves from OS and MPO to increase neonatal lung injury and impair growth and development. The encouraging effect of TUDCA indicates that this compound has the potential for treating BPD.","group":"g3","id":"c502e07b-3729-4b0b-b144-f44b0b6707fe","_showDetails":true},"052b0379-d2c7-448e-acec-74d57011e57d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"All trans-retinoic acid modulates hyperoxia-induced suppression of NF-kB-dependent Wnt signaling in alveolar A549 epithelial cells.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272769","authors":["Tsotakos, Nikolaos","Ahmed, Imtiaz","Umstead, Todd M","Imamura, Yuka","Yau, Eric","Silveyra, Patricia","Chroneos, Zissis C"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20220810//","keywords":["Alveolar Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Female","Humans","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia","Infant, Newborn","Lung/me [Metabolism]","NF-kappa B/me [Metabolism]","Pregnancy","Premature Birth/me [Metabolism]","*Premature Birth","Tretinoin/me [Metabolism]","Tretinoin/pd [Pharmacology]","Wnt Signaling Pathway"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"17","number":"8","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med22&NEWS=N&AN=35947545"],"address":"United States","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Despite recent advances in perinatal medicine, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common complication of preterm birth.

Different studies investigated neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants with BPD, often using the old dichotomous definition (BPD vs Non-BPD). This retrospective study aims to evaluate the role of different BPD severity grades on ND outcomes at 24 months of corrected age (CA)., METHODS: All preterm infants born between 2011 and 2015 in the study hospital with a gestational age (GA) <= 30 weeks and discharged from our NICU were included and were divided in infants with and without BPD. Infants with BPD were divided into three severity groups as defined by NICHD/NHLBI Workshop in 2001, and were compared to their Non-BPD peers, matching them according to the same GA and year of birth. At 24 months postmenstrual age, we assessed general outcomes (growth and hospital readmissions) and neurodevelopmental outcomes (motor, developmental and sensory outcomes) with a standardized assessment., RESULTS: We enrolled 89 patients affected by BPD of different grades of severity and a control group of 89 preterm infants without BPD. Infants with Moderate and Severe BPD showed a significantly higher corrected odds ratio (OR) for cognitive impairment compared to controls. Within the group of infants without severe disability (regarding Griffiths' scales), infants with Moderate and Severe BPD as well as infants with Mild BPD showed a significantly higher risk of a lower total Developmental Quotient (DQ) score, even after correction for confounding factors., CONCLUSIONS: Our study evidenced that not only Severe BPD infants, but also Moderate ones showed a higher risk of overall cognitive impairment at 24 months CA. Within the group of infants without severe disability, also those with Mild BPD had lower Griffiths DQ scores than those without. This would suggest that infants with BPD, regardless of severity, warrant neurodevelopmental follow-up. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The recurrence rate of spontaneous preterm birth is high, and additional preventive measures are required. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin compared to placebo in the prevention of preterm birth in women with a previous spontaneous preterm birth., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a parallel multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (the APRIL study). The study was performed in 8 tertiary and 26 secondary care hospitals in the Netherlands. We included women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous preterm birth of a singleton between 22 and 37 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to aspirin 80 mg daily or placebo initiated between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation and continued until 36 weeks or delivery. Randomisation was computer generated, with allocation concealment by using sequentially numbered medication containers. Participants , their healthcare providers, and researchers were blinded for treatment allocation. The primary outcome was preterm birth <37 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes included a composite of poor neonatal outcome (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia > grade 1, intraventricular hemorrhage > grade 2, necrotising enterocolitis > stage 1, retinopathy of prematurity, culture proven sepsis, or perinatal death). Analyses were performed by intention to treat. From May 31, 2016 to June 13, 2019, 406 women were randomised to aspirin (n = 204) or placebo (n = 202). A total of 387 women (81.1% of white ethnic origin, mean age 32.5 +/- SD 3.8) were included in the final analysis: 194 women were allocated to aspirin and 193 to placebo. Preterm birth <37 weeks occurred in 41 (21.2%) women in the aspirin group and 49 (25.4%) in the placebo group (relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 1.20, p = 0.32). In women with >=80% medication adherence, preterm birth occurred in 24 (19.2%) versus 30 (24.8%) women (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25, p = 0.29). The rate of the composite of poor neonatal outcome was 4.6% (n = 9) versus 2.6% (n = 5) (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 5.25, p = 0.29). Among all randomised women, serious adverse events occurred in 11 out of 204 (5.4%) women allocated to aspirin and 11 out of 202 (5.4%) women allocated to placebo. None of these serious adverse events was considered to be associated with treatment allocation. The main study limitation is the underpowered sample size due to the lower than expected preterm birth rates., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that low-dose aspirin did not significantly reduce the preterm birth rate in women with a previous spontaneous preterm birth. However, a modest reduction of preterm birth with aspirin cannot be ruled out.

To determine whether antenatal MEx therapy attenuates intrauterine inflammation and preserves lung growth in a rat model of CA-induced BPD.

Placental tissues from ETX-exposed pregnancies showed increased expression of inflammatory markers NLRP-3 and IL-1s and altered spiral artery morphology. In addition, infant rats exposed to intrauterine ETX had reduced alveolarization and pulmonary vessel density (PVD), increased right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and decreased lung mechanics. Intrauterine MEx therapy of ETX-exposed pups reduced inflammatory cytokines, normalized spiral artery architecture, and preserved distal lung growth and mechanics. In vitro studies showed that MEx treatment enhanced distal lung branching and increased VEGF and SPC gene expression. Antenatal MEx treatment preserved distal lung growth and reduced intrauterine inflammation in a model of CA-induced BPD.

Previous studies indicate that TGFbeta activation in the O2-injured mouse pup lung increases lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression. But how TGFbeta regulates this, and whether the LOXs generate excess pulmonary aldehydes are unknown. First, we determined that O2-mediated lung injury increases LOX protein expression in TGFbeta-stimulated pup lung interstitial fibroblasts. This regulation appeared to be direct; this is because TGFbeta treatment also increased LOX protein expression in isolated pup lung fibroblasts. Then using a fibroblast cell line, we determined that TGFbeta stimulates LOX expression at a transcriptional level via Smad2/3-dependent signaling. LOX is translated as a pro-protein that requires secretion and extracellular cleavage before assuming amine oxidase activity and, in some cells, reuptake with nuclear localization. We found that pro-LOX is processed in the newborn mouse pup lung. Also, O2-mediated injury was determined to increase pro-LOX secretion and nuclear LOX immunoreactivity particularly in areas populated with interstitial fibroblasts and exhibiting malformed ECM. Then, using molecular probes, we detected increased aldehyde levels in vivo in O2-injured pup lungs, which mapped to areas of increased pro-LOX secretion in lung sections. Increased activity of LOXs plays a critical role in the aldehyde generation; an inhibitor of LOXs prevented the elevation of aldehydes in the O2-injured pup lung. These results reveal new mechanisms of TGFbeta and LOX in newborn lung disease and suggest that aldehyde-reactive probes might have utility in sensing the activation of LOXs in vivo during lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"35478017-6a6e-4b23-83df-c133562898e8","_showDetails":true},"500bc253-c4ec-4e92-b639-d1d493816efe":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2022>","title":"Mortality in Outpatients with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.09.055","authors":["Aoyama, Brianna C","Rice, Jessica L","McGrath-Morrow, Sharon A","Collaco, Joseph M"],"date":"2022//","accessDate":"20211006//","keywords":["Adolescent","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts","Child","Child, Preschool","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Gastrostomy","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Intensive Care Units, Neonatal","Male","Maryland/ep [Epidemiology]","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"241","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med21&NEWS=N&AN=34624317"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To study the demographic and clinical characteristics of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to identify the factors most strongly predictive of outpatient mortality, with the goal of identifying those individuals at greatest risk., STUDY DESIGN: Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrospectively reviewed for 862 subjects recruited from an outpatient BPD clinic. Characteristics of the deceased and living participants were compared using nonparametric analysis. Regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality., RESULTS: Of the 862 subjects, 13 (1.5%) died during follow-up, for an overall mortality rate of approximately 15.1 deaths per 1000 subjects. Two patients died in the postneonatal period (annual mortality incidence, 369.9 per 100 000), 9 died between age 1 and 4 years (annual mortality incidence, 310.2 per 100 000), and 2 died between age of 5 and 14 years (annual mortality incidence, 71.4 per 100 000). After adjusting for gestational age and BPD severity, mortality was found to be associated with the amount of supplemental oxygen required at discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 4.10; P = .001), presence of a gastrostomy tube (aHR, 8.13; P = .012), and presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt (aHR, 4.31; P = .021)., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of mortality among preterm infants with BPD is substantially higher than that seen in the general population. The need for greater amounts of home supplemental oxygen and the presence of a gastrostomy tube or CSF shunt were associated with an increased risk of postdischarge mortality. Future studies should focus on clarifying risk factors for the development of severe disease to allow for early identification and treatment of those at highest risk. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The growth hormone (GH)- and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1 systems regulate cell homeostasis and organ development. Since IGF1 is decreased in preterm infants, we investigated the GH- and IGF1 signaling (1) in newborn mice with acute and prolonged exposure to hyperoxia as well as after recovery in room air; and (2) in cultured murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) and primary neonatal lung fibroblasts (pLFs) after treatment with GH, IGF1, and IGF1-receptor (IGF1-R) inhibitor or silencing of GH-receptor (Ghr) and Igf1r using the siRNA technique. We found that (1) early postnatal hyperoxia caused an arrest of alveolarization that persisted until adulthood. Both short-term and prolonged hyperoxia reduced GH-receptor expression and STAT5 signaling, whereas Igf1 mRNA and pAKT signaling were increased. These findings were related to a loss of epithelial cell markers (SFTPC, AQP5) and proliferation of myofibroblasts (alphaSMA+ cells). After recovery, GH-R-expression and STAT5 signaling were activated, Igf1r mRNA reduced, and SFTPC protein significantly increased. Cell culture studies showed that IGF1 induced expression of mesenchymal (e.g., Col1a1, Col4a4) and alveolar epithelial cell type I (Hopx, Igfbp2) markers, whereas inhibition of IGF1 increased SFTPC and reduced AQP5 in MLE-12. GH increased Il6 mRNA and reduced proliferation of pLFs, whereas IGF1 exhibited the opposite effect. In summary, our data demonstrate an opposite regulation of GH- and IGF1- signaling during short-term/prolonged hyperoxia-induced lung injury and recovery, affecting alveolar epithelial cell differentiation, inflammatory activation of fibroblasts, and a possible uncoupling of the GH-IGF1 axis in lungs after hyperoxia.","group":"g3","id":"451a03d8-7307-45ae-a1a6-eafa8bc603ab","_showDetails":true},"7d05283e-ce4c-4acd-8d00-e14bb0693105":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Risk factors for recurrent wheezing in preterm infants who received prophylaxis with palivizumab.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.36416/1806-3756/e20210157","authors":["Manini, Mariana Bueno","Matsunaga, Natasha Yumi","Gianfrancesco, Livea","Oliveira, Marina Simoes","Carvalho, Maria Rosa Vieira de","Ribeiro, Gisleine Leila Martins Tengler","Morais, Eliane de Oliveira","Ribeiro, Maria Angela Goncalves O","Morcillo, Andre Moreno","Ribeiro, Jose Dirceu","Toro, Adyleia Aparecida Dalbo Contrera"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20211015//","keywords":["Antiviral Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Cross-Sectional Studies","Hospitalization","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Palivizumab/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Respiratory Sounds","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/dt [Drug Therapy]","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections","Risk Factors"],"journal":"Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia","volume":"47","number":"5","isbn":"1806-3713","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34669834"],"address":"Brazil","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of recurrent wheezing (RW) in preterm infants who received prophylaxis against severe infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to identify genetic susceptibility (atopy or asthma) and risk factors for RW., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving preterm infants who received prophylaxis with palivizumab at a referral center in Brazil during the first two years of age.

This study was conducted to probe the biological roles of lncRNA CASC2 in the pathogenesis of BPD and neonatal lung injury. Firstly, a hyperoxia-induced mouse model with BPD was established. LncRNAs with differential expression in lung tissues of normal and BPD mice were analyzed by microarray. An adenovirus vector overexpressing CASC2 was constructed and its functions on BPD symptoms in model mice were analyzed. Gain- and loss-of function studies of CASC2 were performed in a bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B to determine its role in cell apoptosis and proliferation under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. The downstream mechanical molecules of lncRNA CASC2 were predicted on bioinformatics systems and confirmed by luciferase assays. The functional interactions among lncRNA CASC2, miR-194-5p, and CAV1 in BPD were determined by rescue experiments. Consequently, lncRNA CASC2 was found to be poorly expressed in BPD mice. Besides, overexpressed CASC2 was found to relieve the symptoms of BPD in neonatal mice and suppress apoptosis as well as promote proliferation in hyperoxia-induced BEAS-2B cells. Importantly, CASC2 was found to regulate CAV1 expression by competitively binding to miR-194-5p and downregulate the activity of the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway, thereby suppressing lung injury. Either miR-194-5p upregulation or CAV1 downregulation blocked the roles of CASC2. To sum up, this study evidenced that CASC2 alleviates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in mouse and cell models with the involvement of a miR-194-5p-CAV1 crosstalk and the TGF-beta1 inactivation.

However, many infants who go home with normally functioning lungs are also at risk for hyperreactivity after a respiratory viral infection. We recently reported a new, low-dose hyperoxia mouse model (40% for 8 days; 40x8) that causes a transient change in lung function that resolves, rendering 40x8 adult animals functionally indistinguishable from room air controls. Here we report that when infected with IAV, 40x8 mice display an early transient activation of TGFbeta signaling and later airway hyperreactivity associated with peribronchial inflammation (profibrotic macrophages) and fibrosis compared with infected room air controls, suggesting neonatal oxygen induced hidden molecular changes that prime the lung for hyperreactive airways disease. Although searching for potential activators of TGFbeta signaling, we discovered that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is elevated in naive 40x8 mice compared with controls and localized to lung megakaryocytes and platelets before and during IAV infection. Elevated TSP-1 was also identified in human autopsy samples of former preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These findings reveal how low doses of oxygen that do not durably change lung function may prime it for hyperreactive airways disease by changing expression of genes, such as TSP-1, thus helping to explain why former preterm infants who have normal lung function are susceptible to airway obstruction and increased morbidity after viral infection.","group":"g1","id":"ab3ab394-38e6-4cee-89ec-e634d3e52331","_showDetails":true},"f30d1b73-808c-4287-81d0-5c70bee0a122":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Nebulized curcumin protects neonatal lungs from antenatal insult in rats.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00195.2021","authors":["Guillier, Cyril","Carriere, Diane","Pansiot, Julien","Maroni, Arielle","Billion, Elodie","Ringot, Maud","Benoist, Jean-Francois","Jacques, Sebastien","Matrot, Boris","Jarreau, Pierre-Henri","Vaiman, Daniel","Baud, Olivier","Zana-Taieb, Elodie"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210623//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/et [Etiology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Curcumin/pd [Pharmacology]","*Diet, Protein-Restricted/ae [Adverse Effects]","Female","Fetal Growth Retardation/dt [Drug Therapy]","Fetal Growth Retardation/et [Etiology]","Fetal Growth Retardation/me [Metabolism]","Fetal Growth Retardation/pa [Pathology]","Male","Nebulizers and Vaporizers","PPAR gamma/ag [Agonists]","PPAR gamma/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Antenatal low-protein diet (LPD) exposure in rats induces IUGR and mimics BPD-related alveolarization disorders. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) plays a key role in normal lung development and was found deregulated following LPD exposure. The objective of this article was to investigate the effects of nebulized curcumin, a natural PPARgamma agonist, to prevent IUGR-related abnormal lung development. We studied rat pups antenatally exposed to an LPD or control diet (CTL) and treated with nebulized curcumin (50 mg/kg) or vehicle from postnatal (P) days 1 to 5. The primary readouts were lung morphometric analyses at P21. Immunohistochemistry (P21) and microarrays (P6 and P11) were compared within animals exposed to LPD versus controls, with and without curcumin treatment. Quantitative morphometric analyses revealed that LPD induced abnormal alveolarization as evidenced by a significant increase in mean linear intercept (MLI) observed in P21 LPD-exposed animals. Early curcumin treatment prevented this effect, and two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated significant interaction between diet and curcumin both for MLI [F(1,39) = 12.67, P = 0.001] and radial alveolar count at P21 [F(1,40) = 6.065, P = 0.0182]. Immunohistochemistry for fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), a major regulator of PPARgamma pathway, showed a decreased FABP4+ alveolar cell density in LPD-exposed animals treated by curcumin. Transcriptomic analysis showed that early curcumin significantly prevented the activation of profibrotic pathways observed at P11 in LPD-exposed animals. Nebulized curcumin appears to be a promising strategy to prevent alveolarization disorders in IUGR rat pups, targeting pathways involved in lung development.","group":"g1","id":"f30d1b73-808c-4287-81d0-5c70bee0a122","_showDetails":true},"2bf35172-0bb9-477f-9abf-083ed0998d0f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Effect of sex chromosomes versus hormones in neonatal lung injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.146863","authors":["Grimm, Sandra L","Dong, Xiaoyu","Zhang, Yuhao","Carisey, Alexandre F","Arnold, Arthur P","Moorthy, Bhagavatula","Coarfa, Cristian","Lingappan, Krithika"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210708//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Female","*Gonadal Hormones/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Hyperoxia/et [Etiology]","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia","Infant, Newborn","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","Lung Injury/ge [Genetics]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","*Lung Injury","Male","Mice","Ovary/me [Metabolism]","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/ae [Adverse Effects]","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/mt [Methods]","*Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","Protective Factors","Risk Factors","Sex Characteristics","*Sex Chromosomes","Testis/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"JCI insight","volume":"6","number":"13","isbn":"2379-3708","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34061778"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in neonatal lung injury are unknown.

This model generates XX and XY mice that each have either testes (with Sry, XXM, or XYM) or ovaries (without Sry, XXF, or XYF). Lung alveolarization and vascular development were more severely impacted in XYM and XYF compared with XXF and XXM mice. Cell cycle-related pathways were enriched in the gonadal or chromosomal females, while muscle-related pathways were enriched in the gonadal males, and immune-response-related pathways were enriched in chromosomal males. Female gene signatures showed a negative correlation with human patients who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or needed oxygen therapy at 28 days. These results demonstrate that chromosomal sex - and not gonadal sex - impacted the response to neonatal hyperoxia exposure. The female sex chromosomal complement was protective and could mediate sex-specific differences in the neonatal lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"2bf35172-0bb9-477f-9abf-083ed0998d0f","_showDetails":true},"482dc6ea-3dc9-453b-8782-eab301742f13":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"HIV-negative case of Talaromyces marneffei pulmonary infection with a TSC2 mutation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03000605211016761","authors":["Shen, Qian","Sheng, Lingyan","Zhou, Jianying"],"date":"2021//","keywords":["Adult","*HIV Infections","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Lung/dg [Diagnostic Imaging]","Male","Mutation","*Mycoses","Talaromyces","Young Adult"],"journal":"The Journal of international medical research","volume":"49","number":"5","isbn":"0300-0605","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med20&NEWS=N&AN=34057840"],"address":"England","abstract":"Talaromyces marneffei is a rare dimorphic pathogenic fungus that can induce severe infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.

A 24-year-old male patient presented with cough and expectoration for 6 months. Computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities and cystic and cavitated lesions in both lungs. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was performed to confirm T. marneffei pulmonary infection. The results were further verified using bronchoscopy specimen cultures. This was an HIV-negative patient without a travel history to endemic zones and his blood exon sequencing results showed a mutation in the TSC2 gene. To date, he has recovered well with voriconazole therapy. In summary, patients with TSC2 mutations that induce bronchopulmonary dysplasia may be potential hosts for T. marneffei.

Neonatal hyperoxia that is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia confers susceptibility to influenza A virus (IAV) infection later in life.

Here, we show that neonatal hyperoxia abolishes the clock-mediated time of day protection from IAV in mice, independent of viral burden through host tolerance pathways. We discovered that the lung intrinsic clock (and not the central or immune clocks) mediated this dysregulation. Loss of circadian protein, Bmal1, in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells recapitulates the increased mortality, loss of temporal gating, and other key features of hyperoxia-exposed animals.

We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of immature mice, a model of BPD, increases lung IL-12-producing Clec9a+ CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), pro-inflammatory responses, and airway hyperreactivity following rhinovirus (RV) infection. However, the requirement for CD103+ DCs and Clec9a, a DAMP receptor that binds necrotic cell cytoskeletal filamentous actin (F-actin), for RV-induced inflammatory responses has not been demonstrated. To test this, 2-day-old C57BL/6J, CD103+ DC-deficient Batf3-/- or Clec9agfp-/- mice were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia for 14 days. Also, selected mice were treated with neutralizing antibody against CD103. Immediately after hyperoxia, the mice were inoculated with RV intranasally. We found that compared with wild-type mice, hyperoxia-exposed Batf3-/- mice showed reduced levels of IL-12p40, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, fewer IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells, and decreased airway responsiveness following RV infection. Similar effects were observed in anti-CD103-treated and Clec9agfp-/- mice. Furthermore, hyperoxia increased airway dead cell number and extracellular F-actin levels. Finally, studies in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome showed that tracheal aspirate CLEC9A expression positively correlated with IL12B expression, consistent with the notion that CLEC9A+ cells are responsible for IL-12 production in humans as well as mice. We conclude that CD103+ DCs and Clec9a are required for hyperoxia-induced pro-inflammatory responses to RV infection. In premature infants, Clec9a-mediated activation of CD103+ DCs may promote pro-inflammatory responses to viral infection, thereby driving respiratory morbidity.","group":"g1","id":"438efc9d-0250-4474-8f87-294c1b836579","_showDetails":true},"8b5b60f6-ba52-4c25-9948-349d13771865":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"The pentose phosphate pathway mediates hyperoxia-induced lung vascular dysgenesis and alveolar simplification in neonates.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.137594","authors":["Gong, Jiannan","Feng, Zihang","Peterson, Abigail L","Carr, Jennifer F","Lu, Xuexin","Zhao, Haifeng","Ji, Xiangming","Zhao, You-Yang","De Paepe, Monique E","Dennery, Phyllis A","Yao, Hongwei"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210308//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Cell Proliferation","*Endothelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Glycolysis","Humans","Hyperoxia","Infant, Newborn","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Lung","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Neovascularization, Pathologic/et [Etiology]","*Neovascularization, Pathologic/me [Metabolism]","Oxygen/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Oxygen/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Pentose Phosphate Pathway","Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/bs [Blood Supply]","Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Mice"],"journal":"JCI insight","volume":"6","number":"5","isbn":"2379-3708","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33497360"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Dysmorphic pulmonary vascular growth and abnormal endothelial cell (EC) proliferation are paradoxically observed in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), despite vascular pruning.

It is unknown whether hyperoxia, a known mediator of BPD in rodent models, alters glycolysis and the PPP in lung ECs. We hypothesized that hyperoxia increases glycolysis and the PPP, resulting in abnormal EC proliferation and dysmorphic angiogenesis in neonatal mice. To test this hypothesis, lung ECs and newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia and allowed to recover in air. Hyperoxia increased glycolysis and the PPP. Increased PPP, but not glycolysis, caused hyperoxia-induced abnormal EC proliferation. Blocking the PPP reduced hyperoxia-induced glucose-derived deoxynucleotide synthesis in cultured ECs. In neonatal mice, hyperoxia-induced abnormal EC proliferation, dysmorphic angiogenesis, and alveolar simplification were augmented by nanoparticle-mediated endothelial overexpression of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, the second enzyme in the PPP. These effects were attenuated by inhibitors of the PPP. Neonatal hyperoxia augments the PPP, causing abnormal lung EC proliferation, dysmorphic vascular development, and alveolar simplification.

The combination of maternal inflammation and neonatal hyperoxia contributes to epigenetic changes that influence gene expression and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We have previously demonstrated suppression of miR-29b and increases in DNA methylation in infants with severe BPD and in our mouse model of maternal inflammation and neonatal hyperoxia exposure. The present studies further explored epigenetic changes in the murine model to include histone methylation. We identified a global suppression of histone methylation in exposed mice and validated decreases in expression in well-defined histone modifications, specifically H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me2, H3K79me2, and H4K20me3. We further tested the hypothesis that restoration of miR-29b expression would restore the histone methylation marks. Using lipid nanoparticle delivery of miR-29b, partial to full methylation was reestablished for H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3; all tri-methylation marks. To identify the causes of decreased methylation in exposed mice, we measured commonly identified methylases and demethylases. We found a decreased expression of SUV40H2, a methylase primarily associated with H4K20me3. Further studies are needed to identify the causes for the decreased global histone methylation and potential therapeutic opportunities. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Current literature on the abundance and distribution of ACE2 protein in the human respiratory tract is controversial. We examined the effect of age and lung injury on ACE2 protein expression in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models. We also examined ACE2 expression in human tissues with and without coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). ACE2 expression was detected at very low levels in preterm, but was absent in full-term and adult NHP lung homogenates. This pattern of ACE2 expression contrasted with that of transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), which was significantly increased in full-term newborn and adult NHP lungs compared to preterm NHP lungs. ACE2 expression was not detected in NHP lungs with cigarette smoke-induced airway disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Murine lungs lacked basal ACE2 immunoreactivity, but responded to hyperoxia, bacterial infection, and allergen exposure with new ACE2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells. In human specimens, robust ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected in ciliated epithelial cells in paranasal sinus specimens, while ACE2 expression was detected only in rare type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in control lungs. In autopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ACE2 was detected in rare ciliated epithelial and endothelial cells in the trachea, but not in the lung. There was robust expression of ACE2 expression in F344/N rat nasal mucosa and lung specimens, which authentically recapitulated the ACE2 expression pattern in human paranasal sinus specimens. Thus, ACE2 protein expression demonstrates a significant gradient between upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and is scarce in the lung. This pattern of ACE2 expression supports the notion of sinonasal epithelium being the main entry site for SARS-CoV-2 but raises further questions on the pathogenesis and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","group":"g1","id":"8b0617f1-558f-43f1-ab0a-0102e3421ea5","_showDetails":true},"8e7c7494-92fc-48cd-b37b-aa3fc15e8d69":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Nrf2-Keap1-ARE-NQO1 signaling attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung cell injury by inhibiting apoptosis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2021.11860","authors":["Weng, Bowen","Zhang, Xiaoyue","Chu, Xiaoyun","Gong, Xiaohui","Cai, Cheng"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20210126//","keywords":["A549 Cells","*Antioxidant Response Elements","*Apoptosis","Humans","Hyperoxia/ge [Genetics]","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1/ge [Genetics]","*Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/ge [Genetics]","*NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/me [Metabolism]","NF-E2-Related Factor 2/ge [Genetics]","*NF-E2-Related Factor 2/me [Metabolism]","*Signal Transduction"],"journal":"Molecular medicine reports","volume":"23","number":"3","isbn":"1791-2997","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33495821"],"address":"Greece","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the main causes of chronic lung disease in premature infants.

Among 17 126 survivors, BPD developed in 7792 (45.5%) infants, and its proportion significantly increased from 41.4% (99% CI, 36.5%-46.4%) in 2003 to 52.0% (99% CI, 48.2%-55.9%) in 2016. A multivariable analysis of the survivors showed a positive association of BPD with >=4 weeks' supplemental oxygen or invasive ventilation, birth weight <750 g, small for gestational age, >=4 weeks' noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, chorioamnionitis, <26 weeks' gestational age, <20 cases per year of center patient volume, or treated patent ductus arteriosus. Although the median duration of invasive ventilation was shortened, the proportions of factors associated adversely with BPD generally showed increasing trends over time., CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate of extremely preterm infants has decreased, but the rate of BPD has increased in survivors between 2003 and 2016. Despite the decreasing duration of invasive ventilation over time, increasing rates of BPD suggest that differences in the patient population or other management strategies influence the development of BPD.

BNP levels were available at age 1-5 weeks. Longitudinal BNP trends were assessed using mixed-effects modeling. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to identify BNP cutoffs maximizing correct outcome classification at each time point. The time to reach BNP cutoff by outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves for weeks 3-5., RESULTS: Twenty-nine infants (59%) had a poor outcome. Infants with a poor outcome were more likely than those with a good outcome to have liver herniated into the thorax (90% vs 50%; P = .002) and to undergo nonprimary repair (93% vs 35%; P < .001). Mixed-effects modeling demonstrated a differing decline in BNP over time by outcome group (P = .003 for interaction). BNP accurately predicted outcome at 3-5 weeks (area under the curve, 0.81-0.82). BNP cutoffs that maximized correct outcome classification decreased over time from 285 pg/mL at 3 weeks to 100 pg/mL at 4 weeks and 48 pg/mL at 5 weeks. Time to reach the cutoffs of 100 pg/mL and 48 pg/mL were longer in the poor outcome group (log-rank P = .006 and <.0001, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated BNP accurately predicts poor outcome in infants with CDH at age 3-5 weeks, with declining cutoffs over 3-5 weeks of age.

A persistently patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants can have clinical consequences. Decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance, especially in extremely low gestational age newborns, increases left-to-right shunting through the ductus and increases pulmonary blood flow further, leading to interstitial pulmonary edema and volume load to the left heart. Potential consequences of left-to-right shunting via a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) include increased risk for prolonged ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis or focal intestinal perforation, intraventricular hemorrhage, and death. In the last decade, there has been a trend toward less aggressive treatment of PDA in preterm infants. However, there is a subgroup of infants who will likely benefit from intervention, be it pharmacologic, interventional, or surgical: (1) prophylactic intravenous indomethacin in highly selected extremely low gestational age newborns with PDA (<26 + 0/7 weeks' gestation, <750 g birth weight), (2) early targeted therapy of PDA in selected preterm infants at particular high risk for PDA-associated complications, and (3) PDA ligation, catheter intervention, or oral paracetamol may be considered as rescue options for hsPDA closure. The impact of catheter-based closure of hsPDA on clinical outcomes should be determined in future prospective studies. Finally, we provide a novel treatment algorithm for PDA in preterm infants that integrates the several treatment modalities in a staged approach.

There are no early clinical biomarkers for pulmonary outcome and limited therapeutic interventions., OBJECTIVES: We performed global proteomics of premature infant tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma to determine the composition and source of lung fluid proteins and to identify potential biomarkers of respiratory outcome., METHODS: TA samples were collected from intubated infants in the TOLSURF cohort before and after nitric oxide treatment, and plasma was collected from NO CLD infants. Protein abundance was assayed by HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry and Protein Prospector software. mRNA abundance in mid-gestation fetal lung was assessed by RNA sequencing. Pulmonary morbidity was defined as a need for ventilatory support at term and during the first year., RESULTS: Abundant TA proteins included albumin, hemoglobin, and actin-related proteins. 96 of 137 detected plasma proteins were present in TA (r = 0.69, p<0.00001). Based on lung RNAseq data, ~88% of detected TA proteins in injured infant lung are derived at least in part from lung epithelium with overrepresentation in categories of cell membrane/secretion and stress/inflammation. Comparing 37 infants at study enrollment (7-14 days) who did or did not develop persistent pulmonary morbidity, candidate biomarkers of both lung (eg., annexin A5) and plasma (eg., vitamin D-binding protein) origin were identified. Notably, levels of free hemoglobin were 2.9-fold (p = 0.03) higher in infants with pulmonary morbidity. In time course studies, hemoglobin decreased markedly in most infants after enrollment coincident with initiation of inhaled nitric oxide treatment., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that both lung epithelium and plasma contribute to the lung fluid proteome in premature infants with lung injury. Early postnatal elevation of free hemoglobin and heme, which are both pro-oxidants, may contribute to persistent lung disease by depleting nitric oxide and increasing oxidative/nitrative stress.","group":"g4","id":"ff422436-1794-41b0-9a53-c9dcf67fec62","_showDetails":true},"9b7810be-9509-4549-b157-fc8e27c4e652":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"CD74, a novel predictor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000023477","authors":["Gao, Junyan","Wu, Mingfu","Wang, Fudong","Jiang, Lijun","Tian, Rui","Zhu, Xueping","He, Shan"],"date":"2020//","keywords":["*Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Case-Control Studies","Datasets as Topic","Female","Gene Expression Profiling","Genetic Markers","*Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Male","Protein Interaction Maps","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"journal":"Medicine","volume":"99","number":"48","isbn":"0025-7974","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33235138"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major complication and accounts for high morbidity and mortality of preterm infants. The present study aimed to identify the key genes in the development of BPD and to provide some new insights into the pathogenesis of BPD. The GSE108754 dataset was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database containing 5 samples of BPD patients and 6 of non-BPD infants. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BPD and non-BPD patients were identified by R software. The pathway and function enrichment analyses were performed through Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery website. The protein-protein interaction network for DEGs was established by Cytoscape software and the most highly connected module was selected through MCODE plugin. Furthermore, the clinical sample verification among 25 BPD patients and 10 non-BPD infants was carried out in our center. Finally, based on the results above, the gene set enrichment analysis focusing on CD74 upregulated status was employed. Totally, 189 DEGs including 147 upregulated genes and 42 downregulated genes between BPD and non-BPD patients were screened out. The pathway and function enrichments revealed these DEGs were mainly enriched in asthma, intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen processing and presentation and immune response. Thirteen DEGs (CD74, HLA-DMA, HLA-DRA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DOB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DOA, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DQB1) were determined as hub genes. The mRNA expression levels of the 13 hub genes were tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction among our clinical samples. Eventually, CD74 was confirmed to be the most significant highly expressed in BPD samples (P < .001) and its expression level was negatively correlated with gestational age (r = -0.653) and birth weight (r = -0.675). The gene set enrichment analysis results showed the gene sets associated with lupus erythematosus, viral myocarditis, immune network for IgA production, graft versus host disease, cell adhesion molecules and so no were differentially enriched with the phenotype of high-expression CD74. In conclusion, CD74 may serve to predict the BPD development and provide a new therapeutic target for BPD.","group":"g4","id":"9b7810be-9509-4549-b157-fc8e27c4e652","_showDetails":true},"34d8340e-292d-43e6-8603-8d39a94745a7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Novel homozygous missense mutation in ABCA3 protein leading to severe respiratory distress in term infant.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-235520","authors":["Gupta, Naveen Parkash","Batra, Anil","Puri, Ratna","Meena, Varun"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20201010//","keywords":["*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/ge [Genetics]","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/me [Metabolism]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/ul [Ultrastructure]","Biopsy","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","DNA Mutational Analysis","Fatal Outcome","Female","Homozygote","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Intubation, Intratracheal","Lung/dg [Diagnostic Imaging]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Microscopy, Electron","Mutation, Missense","*Pulmonary Surfactants/me [Metabolism]","Radiography","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/di [Diagnosis]","*Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/ge [Genetics]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/pa [Pathology]","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/th [Therapy]","Severity of Illness Index","Exome Sequencing"],"journal":"BMJ case reports","volume":"13","number":"10","isbn":"1757-790X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33040033"],"address":"England","abstract":"The term baby presented with respiratory distress with X-ray pictures consistent as hyaline membrane disease (HMD).

Premature neonatal rabbits were administered a single dose of ITBS on the day of delivery and exposed to 95% oxygen. Following 7 days of hyperoxia, in vivo forced oscillation and pressure-volume maneuvers were performed to examine pulmonary function. Histological and molecular analysis was performed to assess alveolar and extracellular matrix (ECM) morphology, along with gene expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), IL-8, and CCL-2. ITBS attenuated the functional effect of hyperoxia-induced lung injury and limited the change to respiratory system impedance, measured using the forced oscillation technique. Treatment effects were most obvious in the small airways, with significant effects on small airway resistance and small airway reactance. In addition, ITBS mitigated the decrease in inspiratory capacity and static compliance. ITBS restricted alveolar septal thickening without altering the mean linear intercept and mitigated hyperoxia-induced remodeling of the ECM. These structural changes were associated with improved inspiratory capacity and lung compliance. Gene expression of CTGF, IL-8, and CCL-2 was significantly downregulated in the lung. Treatment with ITBS shortly after delivery attenuated the functional and structural consequences of hyperoxia-induced lung injury to day 7 of life in the preterm rabbit.","group":"g1","id":"3079a34d-b1ba-4825-83d0-27dc6e354ac6","_showDetails":true},"8a9065ba-2b8c-4b74-9cec-bac593c851a2":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Therapy for Apnoea of Prematurity: A Retrospective Study on Effects of Standard Dose and Genetic Variability on Clinical Response to Caffeine Citrate in Chinese Preterm Infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12325-020-01544-2","authors":["He, Xin","Qiu, Jin-Chun","Lu, Ke-Yu","Guo, Hong-Li","Li, Ling","Jia, Wei-Wei","Ni, Ming-Ming","Liu, Yun","Xu, Jing","Chen, Feng","Cheng, Rui"],"date":"2021//","accessDate":"20201112//","keywords":["Apnea/dt [Drug Therapy]","Apnea/ge [Genetics]","*Apnea","Caffeine/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Caffeine","China","Citrates","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Reference Standards","Retrospective Studies"],"journal":"Advances in therapy","volume":"38","number":"1","isbn":"0741-238X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=33180318"],"address":"United States","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Apnoea of prematurity (AOP) is among the most common diagnoses in the neonatal intensive care unit. Caffeine treatment is a preferred treatment choice. However, neonatal caffeine therapy results in significant intersubject variability. This study aimed to determine the effects of plasma caffeine levels based on standard dose and genetic variability on clinical response to caffeine citrate in Chinese preterm infants., METHODS: This single-center and retrospective study examined data from 112 preterm infants (< 35 weeks gestational age) between July 2017 and July 2018. Subjects were divided into apnoea-free (n = 48) and apnoeic (n = 64) groups, and their clinical outcomes were summarized. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure levels of caffeine and its primary metabolites. Eighty-eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms were chosen for genotyping by a MassARRAY system., RESULTS: Preterm infants in the apnoea-free group were associated with a reduction in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and a reduced requirement for patent ductus arteriosus ligation. No significant association was observed between plasma-trough-concentration-to-dose (C0/D) ratio and birth weight, gestational age, or postnatal age in either group. Polymorphisms in CYP1A2 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) genes did not affect plasma caffeine levels. Polymorphisms in adenosine receptor genes ADORA1 (rs10920568 and rs12744240), ADORA2A (rs34923252 and rs5996696), and ADORA3 (rs10776727 and rs2298191), especially in AHR (rs4410790) and adenosine deaminase (rs521704), play critical roles in the interindividual response to caffeine therapy., CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms in caffeine's target receptors, but not the exposure levels based on the standard dosing, were associated with variable responses to caffeine therapy in preterm neonates. Future studies are needed to uncover how these genetic variants affect responses to caffeine therapy in this patient population.","group":"g1","id":"8a9065ba-2b8c-4b74-9cec-bac593c851a2","_showDetails":true},"bb3ed1ab-61b7-45fe-a2d1-090a1b4cb553":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Interactive and independent effects of early lipopolysaccharide and hyperoxia exposure on developing murine lungs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00013.2020","authors":["Shrestha, Amrit Kumar","Menon, Renuka T","El-Saie, Ahmed","Barrios, Roberto","Reynolds, Corey","Shivanna, Binoy"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200909//","keywords":["Animals","Cell Proliferation/de [Drug Effects]","Cell Proliferation/ph [Physiology]","Disease Models, Animal","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/dt [Drug Therapy]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/me [Metabolism]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/pa [Pathology]","Inflammation/dt [Drug Therapy]","Inflammation/pa [Pathology]","*Lipopolysaccharides/pd [Pharmacology]","*Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Vascular Remodeling/de [Drug Effects]","Vascular Remodeling/ph [Physiology]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

C57BL/6J mice were exposed to normoxia or 70% O2 (hyperoxia) during postnatal days (PNDs) 1-5 and intraperitoneally injected with varying LPS doses or a vehicle on PNDs 3-5. On PND 14, we performed morphometry, echocardiography, and gene and protein expression studies to determine the effects of hyperoxia and LPS on lung development, vascular remodeling and function, inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. LPS and hyperoxia independently and cooperatively affected lung development, inflammation, and apoptosis. Growth rate and antioxidant enzyme expression were predominantly affected by LPS and hyperoxia, respectively, while cell proliferation and vascular remodeling and function were mainly affected by combined exposure to LPS and hyperoxia. Mice treated with lower LPS doses developed adaptive responses and hyperoxia exposure did not worsen their BPD phenotype, whereas those mice treated with higher LPS doses displayed the most severe BPD phenotype when exposed to hyperoxia and were the only group that developed PH. Collectively, our data suggest that an additional insult such as LPS may be necessary for models utilizing short-term exposure to moderate hyperoxia to recapitulate human BPD-PH.","group":"g1","id":"bb3ed1ab-61b7-45fe-a2d1-090a1b4cb553","_showDetails":true},"39686fcf-c315-4a49-8036-c11ffc19540d":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Inhaled vitamin A is more effective than intramuscular dosing in mitigating hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a neonatal rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00266.2020","authors":["Gelfand, Craig A","Sakurai, Reiko","Wang, Ying","Liu, Yitian","Segal, Robert","Rehan, Virender K"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200805//","keywords":["*Acute Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Surfactants/me [Metabolism]","Rats","*Vitamin A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

We employed our well-established hyperoxia-injury neonatal rat model, exposing newborn rats to 7 days of constant extreme (95% O2) hyperoxia, comparing vitamin A dosed every 48 h via either aerosol inhalation or intramuscular injection with normoxic untreated healthy animals and vehicle-inhalation hyperoxia groups as positive and negative controls, respectively. Separately, similar vitamin A dosing of normoxia-dwelling animals was performed. Analyses after day 7 included characterization of alveolar histomorphology and protein biomarkers of alveolar maturation [surfactant protein C (SP-C), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, cholinephosphate cytidylyl transferase, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor, FLK-1, and retinoid X receptors (RXR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma], apoptosis (Bcl2 and Bax) key injury repair pathway data including protein markers (ALK-5 and beta-catenin) and neutrophil infiltration, and serum vitamin A levels. Compared with intramuscular dosing, inhaled vitamin A significantly enhanced biomarkers of alveolar maturation, mitigated hyperoxia-induced lung damage, and enhanced surfactant protein levels, suggesting that it may be more efficacious in preventing BPD in extremely premature infants than the traditionally used IM dosing regimen. We speculate lung-targeted inhaled vitamin A may also be an effective therapy against other lung damaging conditions leading to BPD or, more generally, to acute lung injury.","group":"g1","id":"39686fcf-c315-4a49-8036-c11ffc19540d","_showDetails":true},"8b0e38df-dc23-4a2c-a0b3-83ff7077344b":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Neonatal therapy with PF543, a sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor, ameliorates hyperoxia-induced airway remodeling in a murine model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00169.2020","authors":["Ha, Alison W","Sudhadevi, Tara","Ebenezer, David L","Fu, Panfeng","Berdyshev, Evgeny V","Ackerman, Steven J","Natarajan, Viswanathan","Harijith, Anantha"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200722//","keywords":["*Airway Remodeling/de [Drug Effects]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Disease Models, Animal","Hyperoxia/ci [Chemically Induced]","*Hyperoxia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Methanol/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]","Methanol/pd [Pharmacology]","Mice, Knockout","Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/de [Drug Effects]","*Pyrrolidines/pd [Pharmacology]","Reactive Oxygen Species/me [Metabolism]","Signal Transduction/de [Drug Effects]","Sulfones"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling promotes HO-mediated neonatal BPD; however, its role in the sequela of AWRM is not known. We noted an increased concentration of S1P in tracheal aspirates of neonatal infants with severe BPD, and earlier, demonstrated that Sphk1-/- mice showed protection against HO-induced BPD. The role of SPHK1/S1P in promoting AWRM following exposure of neonates to HO was investigated in a murine model. Therapy using PF543, the specific SPHK1 inhibitor, during neonatal HO reduced alveolar simplification followed by reduced AWRM in adult mice. This was associated with reduced airway hyperreactivity to intravenous methacholine. Neonatal HO exposure was associated with increased expression of SPHK1 in lung tissue of adult mice, which was reduced with PF543 therapy in the neonatal stage. This was accompanied by amelioration of HO-induced reduction of E-cadherin in airway epithelium. This may be suggestive of arrested partial epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by HO. In vitro studies using human primary airway epithelial cells (HAEpCs) showed that SPHK1 inhibition or deletion restored HO-induced reduction in E-cadherin and reduced formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Blocking mtROS with MitoTempo attenuated HO-induced partial EMT of HAEpCs. These results collectively support a therapeutic role for PF543 in preventing HO-induced BPD in neonates and the long-term sequela of AWRM, thus conferring a long-term protection resulting in improved lung development and function.","group":"g3","id":"8b0e38df-dc23-4a2c-a0b3-83ff7077344b","_showDetails":true},"f0ce4ac6-21fa-494d-8686-34fe7453376e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Mechanism of oxidative stress and Keap-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000020433","authors":["Ma, Di","Gao, Wenhui","Liu, Junjiao","Kong, Dan","Zhang, Yunfeng","Qian, Min"],"date":"2020//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Case-Control Studies","Catalase/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Glutathione Peroxidase/me [Metabolism]","Heme Oxygenase-1/ge [Genetics]","Heme Oxygenase-1/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Hyperoxia","Hypoxia","Infant, Premature","Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1/ge [Genetics]","*Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Membrane Proteins/ge [Genetics]","Membrane Proteins/me [Metabolism]","NF-E2-Related Factor 2/ge [Genetics]","*NF-E2-Related Factor 2/me [Metabolism]","*Oxidative Stress","Pregnancy","RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Signal Transduction","Superoxide Dismutase/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"Medicine","volume":"99","number":"26","isbn":"0025-7974","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=32590729"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease common in premature infants and is one of the leading causes of disability and death in newborns.

With increased time of hyperoxia exposure, the alveolar wall became attenuated. Under hypoxia conditions, the activity of oxidative stress-related enzymes (CAT, GSH-Px, SOD) in lung samples was significantly lower than that before treatment. The expression level of Keap1 mRNA and protein in the hyperoxia group was slightly lower than that of control group.

The dysregulation of molecular targets has been implicated in the presentation of BPD, but there is currently no method to correlate resultant morphological changes observed in tissue histology with these perturbations to differences in function throughout saccular and alveolar lung development. Lung compliance is an aggregate measure of the lung's mechanical properties that is highly sensitive to a number of molecular, cellular, and architectural characteristics, but little is known about compliance in the neonatal mouse lung due to measurement challenges. We have developed a novel method to quantify changes in lung volume and pressure to determine inspiratory and expiratory compliance throughout neonatal mouse lung development. The compliance measurements obtained were validated against compliance values from published studies using mature lungs following enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The system was then used to quantify changes in compliance that occurred over the entire span of neonatal mouse lung development. These methods fill a critically important gap connecting powerful mouse models of development and disease to measures of functional lung mechanics critical to respiration and enable insights into the genetic, molecular, and cellular underpinnings of BPD pathology to improve lung function in premature infants.

Its expression increases during lung development and is increased after exposure of rat pups to hyperoxia compared with controls bred in room air. To further investigate the role of SPOCK2 during lung development, we designed two mouse models, one that uses a specific anti-Spock2 antibody and one that reproduces the hyperoxia-induced Spock2 expression with a transgenic mouse model resulting in a conditional and lung-targeted overexpression of Spock2. When mice were bred under hyperoxic conditions, treatment with anti-Spock2 antibodies significantly improved alveolarization. Lung overexpression of Spock2 altered alveolar development in pups bred in room air and worsened hyperoxia-induced lesions. Neither treatment with anti-Spock2 antibody nor overexpression of Spock2 was associated with abnormal activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2. These two models did not alter the expression of known players in alveolar development. This study brings strong arguments for the deleterious role of SPOCK2 on lung alveolar development especially after lung injury, suggesting its role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia susceptibility. These effects are not mediated by a deregulation in metalloproteases activity and in expression of factors essential to normal alveolarization.

Platelets are the primary source of circulating 5-HT and is released upon platelet activation. Platelet transfusions are associated with neonatal mortality and increased rates of BPD. As BPD is often complicated by PH, we tested the hypothesis that circulating platelets are activated and also increased in the lungs of neonatal mice with bleomycin-induced PH associated with BPD. Newborn wild-type mice received intraperitoneal bleomycin (3 units/kg) three times weekly for 3 weeks. Platelets from mice with experimental PH exhibited increased adhesion to collagen under flow (at 300 s-1 and 1,500 s-1 ) and increased expression of the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin and phosphatidylserine, markers of platelet activation. Platelet-derived factors 5-HT and platelet factor 4 were increased in plasma from mice with experimental PH. Pharmacologic blockade of the 5-HT 2A receptor (5-HT 2A R) prevents bleomycin-induced PH and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Here, platelets from mice with bleomycin-induced PH demonstrate increased 5-HT 2A R expression providing further evidence of both platelet activation and increased 5-HT signaling in this model. In addition, bleomycin treatment increased lung platelet accumulation. In summary, platelets are activated, granule factors are released, and are increased in numbers in the lungs of mice with experimental neonatal PH. These results suggest platelet activation and release of platelet-derived factors may increase vascular tone, promote aberrant angiogenesis, and contribute to the development of neonatal PH.

Alveolar fibroblasts produced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), which instructed expansion and maturation of pulmonary ILC precursors. Conditional ablation of IGF1 in alveolar fibroblasts or deletion of the IGF-1 receptor from ILC precursors interrupted ILC3 biogenesis and rendered newborn mice susceptible to pneumonia.

The association between Ureaplasma exposure and the symptoms or outcomes of infected mothers or their infants born at term remains poorly understood. We investigated the clinical characteristics of preterm and term infants with or without Ureaplasma in their gastric fluid., METHODS: Gastric fluid samples were collected from 47 newborns in the neonatal intensive-care unit immediately after birth and tested using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting Ureaplasma spp., Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The clinical findings and outcomes of the neonates and their mothers were retrospectively evaluated., RESULTS: Ureaplasma spp. were detected in 9/47 samples (19%) by multiplex PCR assays. In all cases, the subspecies was U. parvum. The Ureaplasma-positive group had a significantly higher incidence of chorioamnionitis in utero than the Ureaplasma-negative group. Regarding preterm infants, the IgM levels in the Ureaplasma-positive group were significantly higher than in the Ureaplasma-negative group. In contrast, in term infants, the rates of a non-reassuring fetal status, a maternal fever, and maternal leukocyte counts and maternal C-reactive protein levels within five days before delivery in the Ureaplasma-positive group were significantly higher than those in the Ureaplasma-negative group. All three extremely-low-birth-weight infants with Ureaplasma developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Its prognosis is influenced by a complex network of genetic interactions. In this study, we determined the potential key factors in the pathogenesis of this condition., METHODS: We constructed scale-free gene coexpression network using weighted gene coexpression network analysis. The analysis was carried out on the GSE8586 dataset, which contains the expression profiles of umbilical cord tissue homogenates from 20 neonates with BPD and 34 unaffected controls., RESULTS: Our analysis identified one significantly downregulated coexpression module related to the BPD phenotype. It was significantly enriched in genes related to human T-cell leukemia virus infection and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this module, the expression of the following four hub genes in infants with BPD was significantly decreased: Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), BTG antiproliferation factor 2 (BTG2), Jun proto-oncogene (JUN), and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1). The downregulation of these hub genes was verified in clinical samples derived from blood and umbilical cord tissue., CONCLUSION: The decreased expression of FOS, BTG2, JUN, and EGR1 is associated with BPD and, therefore, could be used as biomarkers to diagnose early BPD.

MicroRNA (miR) are known to be involved in many biological and pathological processes in the lung. Although a changed expression has been described for several miR in BPD, a causal role remains to be established., RESULTS: Our results showed that the expression level of miR-154 increases during lung development and decreases postnatally. Further, hyperoxia treatment maintains high levels of miR-154 in alveolar type 2 cells (AT2). We hypothesized that the decrease in miR-154 expression in AT2 cells is required for normal alveologenesis. To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel transgenic mouse allowing doxycycline-based miR-154 overexpression. Maintenance of miR-154 expression in the postnatal distal lung epithelium under normoxia conditions is sufficient to reproduce the hypoalveologenesis phenotype triggered by hyperoxia. Using a pull-down assay, we identified Caveolin1 as a key downstream target of miR-154. Caveolin1 protein is downregulated in response to overexpression of miR-154. This is associated with increased phosphorylation of Smad3 and Tgf-s signaling. We found that AT2 cells overexpressing miR-154 display decreased expression of AT2 markers and increased expression of AT1 markers., CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-154 in postnatal lung may function as an important physiological switch that permits the induction of the correct alveolar developmental program, while conversely, failure to down-regulate miR-154 suppresses alveolarization, leading to the common clinically observed phenotype of alveolar simplification.","group":"g1","id":"f070af71-a825-4ce4-83f6-90d3ac745efd","_showDetails":false},"e2dd294f-d386-4a9f-8266-5bd8eab9aef6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Tie-2 Cre-Mediated Deficiency of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 2 Potentiates Experimental Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension in Neonatal Mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms21072408","authors":["Menon, Renuka T","Shrestha, Amrit Kumar","Barrios, Roberto","Reynolds, Corey","Shivanna, Binoy"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200331//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/me [Metabolism]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/pa [Pathology]","*Integrases/me [Metabolism]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","MAP Kinase Signaling System","Mice","Mice, Knockout","*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/df [Deficiency]","*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/ge [Genetics]","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/me [Metabolism]","Pneumonia/me [Metabolism]","*Receptor, TIE-2/me [Metabolism]","Signal Transduction","Transcriptome"],"journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","volume":"21","number":"7","isbn":"1422-0067","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med17&NEWS=N&AN=32244398"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a significant lung morbidity of infants, and disrupted lung angiogenesis is a hallmark of this disease.

Therefore, we hypothesized that Tie2 Cre-mediated deficiency of ERK2 in the endothelial cells of neonatal murine lungs would potentiate hyperoxia-induced BPD and PH. We initially determined the role of ERK2 in in vitro angiogenesis using fetal HPMECs. To disrupt endothelial ERK2 signaling in the lungs, we decreased ERK2 expression by breeding ERK2flox/flox mice with Tie-Cre mice. One-day-old endothelial ERK2-sufficient (eERK2+/+) or -deficient (eERK2+/-) mice were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (FiO2 70%) for 14 d. We then performed lung morphometry, gene and protein expression studies, and echocardiography to determine the extent of inflammation, oxidative stress, and development of lungs and PH. The knockdown of ERK2 in HPMECs decreased in vitro angiogenesis. Hyperoxia increased lung inflammation and oxidative stress, decreased lung angiogenesis and alveolarization, and induced PH in neonatal mice; however, these effects were augmented in the presence of Tie2-Cre mediated endothelial ERK2 deficiency. Therefore, we conclude that endothelial ERK2 signaling is necessary to mitigate hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice.

In humans, the same phenotype is the hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease that affects premature babies and may have long lasting consequences in adulthood. So far, the knowledge regarding adult effects of developmental arrest in the lung is limited. This is attributable to few follow-up studies of BPD survivors and lack of good experimental models that could help predict the outcomes of this early age disease for the adult individual. In this study, we used the constitutive lung-specific Pdgfa deletion mouse model to analyze the consequences of developmental lung defects in adult mice. We assessed lung morphology, physiology, cellular content, ECM composition and proteomics data in mature mice, that perinatally exhibited lungs with a BPD-like morphology. Histological and physiological analyses both revealed that enlarged alveolar air spaces remained until adulthood, resulting in higher lung compliance and higher respiratory volume in knockout mice. Still, no or only small differences were seen in cellular, ECM and protein content when comparing knockout and control mice. Taken together, our results indicate that Pdgfa deletion-induced lung developmental arrest has consequences for the adult lung at the morphological and functional level. In addition, these mice can reach adulthood with a BPD-like phenotype, which makes them a robust model to further investigate the pathophysiological progression of the disease and test putative regenerative therapies.","group":"g1","id":"6117c69f-f8a6-4f83-91ef-392384a14e58","_showDetails":false},"8320dfeb-6df9-4adb-958d-d7f5fed843ba":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"The Course Of IGF-1 Levels and Nutrient Intake in Extremely and Very Preterm Infants During Hospitalisation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu12030675","authors":["Yumani, Dana F J","Calor, Alexandra K","van Weissenbruch, Mirjam M"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200302//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dh [Diet Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","*Energy Intake","Female","Humans","*Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature/bl [Blood]","*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight/bl [Blood]","*Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/me [Metabolism]","Longitudinal Studies","Male","*Parenteral Nutrition, Total"],"journal":"Nutrients","volume":"12","number":"3","isbn":"2072-6643","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med17&NEWS=N&AN=32131447"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays an important role in the complex association between nutrition, growth, and maturation in extremely and very preterm infants.

Actual daily macronutrient intake was calculated, and growth was assessed weekly. IGF-1 was sampled from umbilical cord blood at birth and every other week thereafter., RESULTS: There was an inverse relationship between the amount of parenteral nutrition in the second week of life and IGF-1. Total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, as well as total energy intake, primarily showed a positive association with IGF-1 levels, particularly between 30 and 33 weeks PMA. Gestational age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and weight were significant confounders in the association between nutrient intake and IGF-1 levels., CONCLUSION: Parenteral nutrition was found to be a negative predictor of IGF-1 levels, and there could potentially be a time frame in which macronutrient intake is unable to impact IGF-1 levels. Future research should aim to narrow down this time frame and to gain more insight into factors enhancing or decreasing the response of IGF-1 to nutrition, e.g., age and inflammatory state, to align nutritional interventions accordingly.","group":"g1","id":"8320dfeb-6df9-4adb-958d-d7f5fed843ba","_showDetails":false},"a3199853-098d-4ba2-84cf-62a4b7d2c035":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Next-generation sequencing to investigate circular RNA profiles in the peripheral blood of preterm neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23260","authors":["Mao, Xiaonan","Guo, Yan","Qiu, Jie","Zhao, Li","Xu, Junjie","Yin, Jiao","Lu, Keyu","Zhang, Mingshun","Cheng, Rui"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20200224//","keywords":["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/bl [Blood]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","Case-Control Studies","Female","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Male","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","*RNA, Circular/bl [Blood]","Respiration, Artificial"],"journal":"Journal of clinical laboratory analysis","volume":"34","number":"7","isbn":"0887-8013","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med17&NEWS=N&AN=32091150"],"address":"United States","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging noncoding RNAs that are involved in many biological processes and diseases.

In this study, we generated a conditional loss-of-function mouse model (Wnt5aCAG) and examined the specific role of Wnt5a during the saccular and alveolar phases of lung development. The lack of Wnt5a in the saccular phase blocked distal airway expansion and attenuated differentiation of endothelial and alveolar epithelial type I (AT1) cells and myofibroblasts. Postnatal Wnt5a inactivation disrupted alveologenesis, producing a phenotype resembling human bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Mutant lungs showed hypoalveolization, but endothelial and epithelial differentiation was unaffected. The major impact of Wnt5a inactivation on alveologenesis was on myofibroblast differentiation and migration, with reduced expression of key regulatory genes. These findings were validated in vitro using isolated lung fibroblasts. Conditional inactivation of the WNT5a receptors Ror1 and Ror2 in alveolar myofibroblasts recapitulated the Wnt5aCAG phenotype, demonstrating that myofibroblast defects are the major cause of arrested alveologenesis in Wnt5aCAG lungs. Finally, we show that WNT5a is reduced in human BPD lung samples, indicating the clinical relevance and potential role for WNT5a in pathogenesis of BPD.","group":"g4","id":"ca7bc132-004b-4d0e-b023-873f94063bfc","_showDetails":true},"135dc738-8934-4607-86b2-baa0d4129686":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Acute and chronic changes in the control of breathing in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00086.2018","authors":["Mouradian, Gary C Jr","Alvarez-Argote, Santiago","Gorzek, Ryan","Thuku, Gabriel","Michkalkiewicz, Teresa","Wong-Riley, Margaret T T","Konduri, Girija Ganesh","Hodges, Matthew R"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190117//","keywords":["Age Factors","Animals","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/me [Metabolism]","*Hypoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hypoxia/pa [Pathology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Rats"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

However, long-term hyperoxia exposure can arrest lung development, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which increases acute and long-term respiratory morbidity and mortality. The neural mechanisms controlling breathing are highly plastic during development. Whether the ventilatory control system adapts to pulmonary disease associated with hyperoxia exposure in infancy remains unclear. Here, we assessed potential age-dependent adaptations in the control of breathing in an established rat model of BPD associated with hyperoxia. Hyperoxia exposure ( FIO2 ; 0.9 from 0 to 10 days of life) led to a BPD-like lung phenotype, including sustained reductions in alveolar surface area and counts, and modest increases in airway resistance. Hyperoxia exposure also led to chronic increases in room air and acute hypoxic minute ventilation (Ve) and age-dependent changes in breath-to-breath variability. Hyperoxia-exposed rats had normal oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) in room air but greater reductions in SpO2 during acute hypoxia (12% O2) that were likely due to lung injury. Moreover, acute ventilatory sensitivity was reduced at P12 to P14. Perinatal hyperoxia led to greater glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and an increase in neuron counts within six of eight or one of eight key brainstem regions, respectively, controlling breathing, suggesting astrocytic expansion. In conclusion, perinatal hyperoxia in rats induced a BPD-like phenotype and age-dependent adaptations in Ve that may be mediated through changes to the neural architecture of the ventilatory control system. Our results suggest chronically altered ventilatory control in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"135dc738-8934-4607-86b2-baa0d4129686","_showDetails":true},"3f800558-77f9-4abf-bb56-8457842881b7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Consequences of early postnatal lipopolysaccharide exposure on developing lungs in mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00560.2017","authors":["Shrestha, Amrit Kumar","Bettini, Matthew L","Menon, Renuka T","Gopal, Vashisht Y N","Huang, Shixia","Edwards, Dean P","Pammi, Mohan","Barrios, Roberto","Shivanna, Binoy"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20181011//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Cell Proliferation/de [Drug Effects]","Dose-Response Relationship, Drug","Inflammation/ci [Chemically Induced]","Inflammation/me [Metabolism]","Inflammation/pa [Pathology]","*Lipopolysaccharides/to [Toxicity]","Mice","*Pulmonary Alveoli/gd [Growth & Development]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","*T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/me [Metabolism]","T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/pa [Pathology]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Postnatal sepsis causes BPD, yet the contributory mechanisms are unclear. To address this gap, studies have used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the alveolar phase of lung development. However, the lungs of infants who develop BPD are still in the saccular phase of development, and the effects of LPS during this phase are poorly characterized. We hypothesized that chronic LPS exposure during the saccular phase disrupts lung development by mechanisms that promote inflammation and prevent optimal lung development and repair. Wild-type C57BL6J mice were intraperitoneally administered 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg of LPS or a vehicle once daily on postnatal days (PNDs) 3-5. The lungs were collected for proteomic and genomic analyses and flow cytometric detection on PND6. The impact of LPS on lung development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis was determined on PND7. Finally, we determined differences in the LPS effects between the saccular and alveolar lungs. LPS decreased the survival and growth rate and lung development in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were associated with a decreased expression of proteins regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and increased expression of those mediating inflammation. While the lung macrophage population of LPS-treated mice increased, the T-regulatory cell population decreased. Furthermore, LPS-induced inflammatory and apoptotic response and interruption of cell proliferation and alveolarization was greater in alveolar than in saccular lungs.

The epigenetic regulators of sepsis-induced endothelial immune activation, lung inflammation, and alveolar remodeling remain unclear. Herein, we examined the role of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase, HDAC6, in regulating EC Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and modulating sepsis-induced lung injury in a neonatal model of sterile sepsis. In human primary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MAPK, IKK-beta, and p65 phosphorylation as well as inflammatory cytokine expression were exaggerated with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubastatin A, and by dominant-negative HDAC6 with a mutated catalytic domain 2. Expression of HDAC6 wild-type protein suppressed LPS-induced myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) acetylation, p65 (Lys310) acetylation, MyD88/TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) coimmunoprecipitation, and proinflammatory TLR4 signaling in HPMEC. In a neonatal mouse model of sepsis, the HDAC6 inhibitor tubastatin A amplified lung EC TLR4 signaling and vascular permeability. HDAC6 inhibition augmented LPS-induced MyD88 acetylation, MyD88/TRAF6 binding, p65 acetylation, canonical TLR4 signaling, and inflammation in the developing lung. Sepsis-induced decreases in the fibroblast growth factors FGF2 and FGF7 and increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 were worsened with HDAC6 inhibition, while elastin expression was equally suppressed. Exaggerated sepsis-induced acute lung inflammation observed with HDAC6 inhibition worsened alveolar simplification evidenced by increases in mean linear intercepts and decreased radial alveolar counts. Our studies reveal that HDAC6 is a constitutive negative regulator of cytoplasmic TLR4 signaling in EC and the developing lung. The therapeutic efficacy of augmenting HDAC6 activity in neonatal sepsis to prevent lung injury needs to be evaluated.","group":"g1","id":"54662dea-ca84-4f54-95ec-a7d0f567ffbc","_showDetails":true},"4d4465cc-0e02-4250-bc28-44d835bc341a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2021>","title":"Effects of antioxidant MnTBAP on angiogenesis in newborn mice with hyperoxic lung injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/NPM-200483","authors":["Paturi, B","Ryan, R M","Nielsen, L","Wang, H","Kumar, V H S"],"date":"2021//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Antioxidants/tu [Therapeutic Use]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Disease Models, Animal","*Lung Injury/dt [Drug Therapy]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Metalloporphyrins/cl [Classification]","*Metalloporphyrins/tu [Therapeutic Use]","Mice","Neovascularization, Physiologic/de [Drug Effects]"],"journal":"Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine","volume":"14","number":"1","isbn":"1878-4429","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med19&NEWS=N&AN=32804105"],"address":"Netherlands","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Oxygen toxicity mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an essential role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. By reducing oxidative stress, antioxidants protect the immature lung. We studied the effects of MnTBAP, a catalytic antioxidant on angiogenesis and alveolar growth following neonatal hyperoxia., METHODS: Newborn mouse litters randomized to room air (RA) or >95% O2 for 72 hours from day 4 (D4) to D7 to receive either MnTBAP (10 mg/kg/d) or saline intraperitoneally (every 24 h for three doses). Lungs harvested for angiogenic gene expression, protein expression, and histopathology post-hyperoxia exposure. Radial alveolar count (RAC), mean linear intercept (MLI) and vessel density assessed by histopathology., RESULTS: Angiogenic gene expression was significantly lower in the hyperoxia group compared to the RA group. The protein expression for VEGF and its receptor, VEGFR1, was significantly lower following treatment with MnTBAP compared to hyperoxia alone. Expression of VEGFR2, Angiopoietin-1 and TIE2, were substantially higher in the RA groups compared to hyperoxia groups with or without MnTBAP. Hyperoxia groups demonstrated alveolar simplification. MnTBAP reduced vessel density and failed to improve alveolar growth following hyperoxia., CONCLUSIONS: MnTBAP, a catalytic antioxidant, does not offer protection from hyperoxia-induced alveolar impairment. The lack of angiogenic upregulation by MnTBAP may contribute to alveolar simplification in newborn mice.","group":"g3","id":"4d4465cc-0e02-4250-bc28-44d835bc341a","_showDetails":true},"226c8efc-2201-4989-8f6e-35f9368a8009":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Differential modulation of pulmonary caspases: Is this the key to Ureaplasma-driven chronic inflammation?.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216569","authors":["Silwedel, Christine","Fehrholz, Markus","Speer, Christian P","Ruf, Katharina C","Manig, Steffi","Glaser, Kirsten"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190508//","keywords":["A549 Cells","*Apoptosis","*Caspases/me [Metabolism]","Cells, Cultured","*Cytokines/me [Metabolism]","*Endothelium, Vascular/en [Enzymology]","*Epithelial Cells/en [Enzymology]","Humans","Pneumonia/en [Enzymology]","*Pneumonia/et [Etiology]","Pneumonia/pa [Pathology]","Ureaplasma/ip [Isolation & Purification]","*Ureaplasma Infections/co [Complications]"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"14","number":"5","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=31067276"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Although accepted agents in chorioamnionitis and preterm birth, the role of Ureaplasma species (spp.) in inflammation-driven morbidities of prematurity, including the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, remains controversial. To add to scarce in vitro data addressing the pro-inflammatory capacity of Ureaplasma spp., pulmonary epithelial-like A549 cells and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) were incubated with Ureaplasma (U.) urealyticum, U. parvum, and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ureaplasma isolates down-regulated caspase mRNA levels in A549 cells (caspase 8: p<0.001, 9: p<0.001, vs. broth), while increasing caspase protein expression, enzyme activity, and cell death in HPMEC (active caspase 3: p<0.05, caspase 8: p<0.05, active caspase 9: p<0.05, viability: p<0.05). LPS, contrarily, induced caspase mRNA expression in HPMEC (caspase 3: p<0.01, 4: p<0.001, 5: p<0.001, 8: p<0.001, vs. control), but not in A549 cells, and did not affect enzyme activity or protein levels in either cell line. LPS, but neither Ureaplasma isolate, enhanced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 in both A549 (p<0.05, vs. control) and HPMEC (p<0.001) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (p<0.01), IL-1beta (p<0.001), and IL-8 (p<0.05) in HPMEC. We are therefore the first to demonstrate a differential modulation of pulmonary caspases by Ureaplasma spp. in vitro. Ureaplasma-driven enhanced protein expression and activity of caspases in pulmonary endothelial cells result in cell death and may cause structural damage. Down-regulated caspase mRNA in pulmonary epithelial cells, contrarily, may indicate Ureaplasma-induced inhibition of apoptosis and prevent effective immune responses. Both may ultimately contribute to chronic Ureaplasma colonization and long-term pulmonary inflammation.","group":"g1","id":"226c8efc-2201-4989-8f6e-35f9368a8009","_showDetails":true},"ecd455b6-85e1-4caa-a74e-8df1067b636f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"So You Want to Give Stem Cells to Babies?

Interview guides and directed content analysis were framed using the theoretical domains framework, a tool specifically developed for implementation research to identify influences on behavior., RESULTS: Key barriers for parents included their lack of knowledge about clinical trial processes in general, stem cells, and concerns about their risks and side effects. Importantly, parents preferred to be approached for recruitment directly by a neonatologist, either before delivery or 1 or 2 weeks after birth. However, the majority of neonatologists felt that approaching parents was not part of their role. Neonatologists reported competing priorities, time commitment, costs, and lack of institutional support as significant barriers to their ability to recruit patients., CONCLUSIONS: By integrating stakeholders early into the development of a clinical trial of mesenchymal stromal cell therapy, we identified and can address important barriers to enrollment. Some identified barriers were unanticipated and could have compromised recruitment had they not been identified by this study.

Infants were classified based on treatment at a hospital with an SpO2 alarm policy change and study epoch (before vs after policy change). We used a generalized linear mixed model to determine the effect of hospital group and epoch on the primary outcomes of mortality and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and secondary outcomes of necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and any ROP., RESULTS: There were 3809 infants in 10 hospitals with an SpO2 alarm policy change and 3685 infants in 9 hospitals without a policy change.

The aim of this study is to systematically explore BPD-related genes and characterize their functions.Natural language processing analysis was used to identify BPD-related genes. Gene data were extracted from PubMed database. Gene ontology, pathway, and network analysis were carried out, and the result was integrated with corresponding database. In this study, 216 genes were identified as BPD-related genes with P < .05, and 30 pathways were identified as significant. A network of BPD-related genes was also constructed with 17 hub genes identified. In particular, phosphatidyl inositol-3-enzyme-serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway involved the largest number of genes. Insulin was found to be a promising candidate gene related with BPD, suggesting that it may serve as an effective therapeutic target.Our data may help to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying BPD. However, the mechanisms of BPD are elusive, and further studies are needed.","group":"g4","id":"633c48ec-d755-444e-b9a0-af03219c35ef","_showDetails":true},"ab6bdfb8-afe3-4ed0-82a5-67a2a2a46e4e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Decorin Secreted by Human Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Induces Macrophage Polarization via CD44 to Repair Hyperoxic Lung Injury.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms20194815","authors":["Kwon, Ji Hye","Kim, Miyeon","Bae, Yun Kyung","Kim, Gee-Hye","Choi, Soo Jin","Oh, Wonil","Um, Soyoun","Jin, Hye Jin"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190927//","keywords":["Animals","Biomarkers","*Decorin/bi [Biosynthesis]","Disease Models, Animal","*Fetal Blood/cy [Cytology]","Fluorescent Antibody Technique","Gene Knockdown Techniques","Humans","*Hyaluronan Receptors/bl [Blood]","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Lung Injury/di [Diagnosis]","Lung Injury/et [Etiology]","Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/th [Therapy]","*Macrophage Activation/im [Immunology]","*Macrophages/im [Immunology]","*Macrophages/me [Metabolism]","*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/me [Metabolism]","Rats"],"journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","volume":"20","number":"19","isbn":"1422-0067","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med16&NEWS=N&AN=31569732"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), caused by hyperoxia in newborns and infants, results in lung damage and abnormal pulmonary function. However, the current treatments for BPD are steroidal and pharmacological therapies, which cause neurodevelopmental impairment. Treatment with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSCs) is an efficient alternative approach. To prevent pulmonary inflammation in BPD, this study investigated the hypothesis that a key regulator was secreted by MSCs to polarize inflammatory macrophages into anti-inflammatory macrophages at inflammation sites. Lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophages co-cultured with MSCs secreted low levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and IL-6, but high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Silencing decorin in MSCs suppressed the expression of CD44, which mediates anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages. The effects of MSCs were examined in a rat model of hyperoxic lung damage. Macrophage polarization differed depending on the levels of decorin secreted by MSCs. Moreover, intratracheal injection of decorin-silenced MSCs or MSCs secreting low levels of decorin confirmed impaired alveolarization of damaged lung tissues by down-regulation of decorin. In tissues, a decrease in the anti-inflammatory macrophage marker, CD163, was observed via CD44. Thus, we identified decorin as a key paracrine factor, inducing macrophage polarization via CD44, a master immunoregulator in mesenchymal stem cells.","group":"g1","id":"ab6bdfb8-afe3-4ed0-82a5-67a2a2a46e4e","_showDetails":true},"73252ea6-e461-4493-8d75-08b9cbd36144":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2019>","title":"Mitochondrial DNA variation modulates alveolar development in newborn mice exposed to hyperoxia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00220.2019","authors":["Kandasamy, Jegen","Rezonzew, Gabriel","Jilling, Tamas","Ballinger, Scott","Ambalavanan, Namasivayam"],"date":"2019//","accessDate":"20190821//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*DNA, Mitochondrial/ge [Genetics]","*Disease Models, Animal","Energy Metabolism","Female","*Genetic Variation","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice","Mice, Inbred C3H","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mitochondria/me [Metabolism]","*Mitochondria/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Superoxides/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Newborn C57BL6 wild type (C57n/C57mt, C57WT) and C3H/HeN wild type (C3Hn/C3Hmt, C3HWT) mice and novel Mitochondrial-nuclear eXchange (MNX) strains with nuclear DNA (nDNA) from their parent strain and mtDNA from the other-C57MNX (C57n/C3Hmt) and C3HMNX (C3Hn/C57mt)-were exposed to 21% or 85% O2 from birth to postnatal day 14 (P14). Lung mechanics and histopathology were examined on P15. Neonatal mouse lung fibroblast (NMLF) bioenergetics and mitochondrial superoxide (O2-) generation were measured. Pulmonary resistance and mitochondrial O2- generation were increased while alveolarization, compliance, and NMLF basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate were decreased in hyperoxia-exposed C57WT mice (C57n/C57mt) versus C57MNX mice (C57n/C3Hmt) and in hyperoxia-exposed C3HMNX mice (C3Hn/C57mt) versus C3HWT (C3Hn/C3Hmt) mice. Our study suggests that neonatal C57 mtDNA-carrying strains have increased hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization, pulmonary mechanical dysfunction, and mitochondrial bioenergetic and redox dysfunction versus C3H mtDNA strains.

Frequency of GT placement before 18-22 months, demographic and medical factors associated with GT placement, and associated long-term outcomes at 18-22 months of corrected age were described. Associations between GT placement and neonatal morbidities and long-term outcomes were assessed with logistic regression after adjustment for center and common co-variables., RESULTS: Of the 4549 ELBW infants included in these analyses, 333 (7.3%) underwent GT placement; 76% had the GT placed postdischarge. Of infants with GTs, 11% had birth weights small for gestational age, 77% had bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and 29% severe intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia. At follow-up, 56% of infants with a GT had weight <10th percentile, 61% had neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), and 55% had chronic breathing problems. After adjustment, small for gestational age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage/periventricular leukomalacia, poor growth, and NDI were associated with GT placement. Thirty-two percent of infants with GTs placed were taking full oral feeds at follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: GT placement is common in ELBW infants, particularly among those with severe neonatal morbidities. GT placement in this population was associated with poor growth, NDI, and chronic respiratory and feeding problems at follow-up.

A 16S rRNA sequencing approach was applied to compare the gut microbiota composition between the BPD group and controls. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the predictor variables., RESULTS: Eight subjects in the BPD group and 10 subjects in the preterm group were analyzed during the observation period. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were the four dominant bacteria phyla of intestinal microflora.

We previously showed that experimental IUGR impairs angiogenesis; however, mechanisms that impair pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) function are uncertain. The NF-kappaB pathway promotes vascular growth in the developing mouse lung, and we hypothesized that IUGR disrupts NF-kappaB-regulated proangiogenic targets in fetal PAEC. PAECs were isolated from the lungs of control fetal sheep and sheep with experimental IUGR from an established model of chronic placental insufficiency. Microarray analysis identified suppression of NF-kappaB signaling and significant alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways in IUGR PAEC, including decreases in collagen 4alpha1 and laminin alpha4, components of the basement membrane and putative NF-kappaB targets. In comparison with controls, immunostaining of active NF-kappaB complexes, NF-kappaB-DNA binding, baseline expression of NF-kappaB subunits p65 and p50, and LPS-mediated inducible activation of NF-kappaB signaling were decreased in IUGR PAEC. Although pharmacological NF-kappaB inhibition did not affect angiogenic function in IUGR PAEC, angiogenic function of control PAEC was reduced to a similar degree as that observed in IUGR PAEC. These data identify reductions in endothelial NF-kappaB signaling as central to the disrupted angiogenesis observed in IUGR, likely by impairing both intrinsic PAEC angiogenic function and NF-kappaB-mediated regulation of ECM components necessary for vascular development. These data further suggest that strategies that preserve endothelial NF-kappaB activation may be useful in lung diseases marked by disrupted angiogenesis such as IUGR.","group":"g1","id":"c847801b-7b00-42e9-bc3b-0d5a7eeb041b","_showDetails":true},"b8f724dd-7738-473b-808e-23792548ca25":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Enteral lactoferrin to prevent infection for very preterm infants: the ELFIN RCT.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3310/hta22740","authors":["Griffiths, James","Jenkins, Paula","Vargova, Monika","Bowler, Ursula","Juszczak, Edmund","King, Andrew","Linsell, Louise","Murray, David","Partlett, Christopher","Patel, Mehali","Berrington, Janet","Embleton, Nicholas","Dorling, Jon","Heath, Paul T","McGuire, William","Oddie, Sam"],"date":"2018//","keywords":["Animals","Cattle","*Enteral Nutrition","Enterocolitis, Necrotizing/pc [Prevention & Control]","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","*Infant, Extremely Premature","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control]","*Infections/di [Diagnosis]","*Lactoferrin/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Male"],"journal":"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)","volume":"22","number":"74","isbn":"1366-5278","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=30574860"],"address":"England","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Infections acquired in hospital are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants. Several small trials have suggested that supplementing the enteral diet of very preterm infants with lactoferrin, an antimicrobial protein processed from cow's milk, prevents infections and associated complications., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not enteral supplementation with bovine lactoferrin (The Tatua Cooperative Dairy Company Ltd, Morrinsville, New Zealand) reduces the risk of late-onset infection (acquired > 72 hours after birth) and other morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants., DESIGN: Randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Randomisation was via a web-based portal and used an algorithm that minimised for recruitment site, weeks of gestation, sex and single versus multiple births., SETTING: UK neonatal units between May 2014 and September 2017., PARTICIPANTS: Infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation and aged < 72 hours at trial enrolment., INTERVENTIONS: Eligible infants were allocated individually (1 : 1 ratio) to receive enteral bovine lactoferrin (150 mg/kg/day; maximum 300 mg/day) or sucrose (British Sugar, Peterborough, UK) placebo (same dose) once daily from trial entry until a postmenstrual age of 34 weeks. Parents, caregivers and outcome assessors were unaware of group assignment., OUTCOMES: Primary outcome - microbiologically confirmed or clinically suspected late-onset infection. Secondary outcomes - microbiologically confirmed infection; all-cause mortality; severe necrotising enterocolitis (NEC); retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); a composite of infection, NEC, ROP, BPD and mortality; days of receipt of antimicrobials until 34 weeks' postmenstrual age; length of stay in hospital; and length of stay in intensive care, high-dependency and special-care settings., RESULTS: Of 2203 enrolled infants, primary outcome data were available for 2182 infants (99%). In the intervention group, 316 out of 1093 (28.9%) infants acquired a late-onset infection versus 334 out of 1089 (30.7%) infants in the control group [adjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.04]. There were no significant differences in any secondary outcomes: microbiologically confirmed infection (RR 1.05, 99% CI 0.87 to 1.26), mortality (RR 1.05, 99% CI 0.66 to 1.68), NEC (RR 1.13, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.89), ROP (RR 0.89, 99% CI 0.62 to 1.28), BPD (RR 1.01, 99% CI 0.90 to 1.13), or a composite of infection, NEC, ROP, BPD and mortality (RR 1.01, 99% CI 0.94 to 1.08). There were no differences in the number of days of receipt of antimicrobials, length of stay in hospital, or length of stay in intensive care, high-dependency or special-care settings. There were 16 reports of serious adverse events for infants in the lactoferrin group and 10 for infants in the sucrose group., CONCLUSIONS: Enteral supplementation with bovine lactoferrin does not reduce the incidence of infection, mortality or other morbidity in very preterm infants., FUTURE WORK: Increase the precision of the estimates of effect on rarer secondary outcomes by combining the data in a meta-analysis with data from other trials.

For each epoch and NICU, we calculated proportions of infants receiving cyclooxygenase inhibitor (COXI) or PDA ligation and determined NICU-specific changes in these therapies between consecutive epochs. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine adjusted relationships between NICU-specific changes in PDA management and contemporaneous changes in local outcomes., RESULTS: We included 642 observations of interepoch change at 119 hospitals summarizing 32 094 infants. NICU-specific changes in COXI use and ligation showed significant dose-response associations with contemporaneous changes in adjusted local outcomes. Each percentage point decrease in NICU-specific proportion treated with either COXI or ligation was associated with a 0.21 percentage point contemporaneous increase in adjusted local in-hospital mortality (95% CI 0.06, 0.33; P = .005) among infants born 400-749 g. In contrast, decreasing NICU-specific ligation rate among infants 1000-1499 g was associated with decreasing adjusted local bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P = .009) and death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P = .01)., CONCLUSIONS: NICU-specific outcomes of preterm birth co-vary with local PDA management. Treatment for PDA closure may benefit some infants born 400-749 g. Decreasing NICU-specific rates of COXI use or ligation were not associated with increases in local adjusted rates of examined adverse outcomes in larger preterm infants.

Global African genetic ancestry was associated with increased survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia among infants of maternal self-reported Hispanic white race/ethnicity [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, P = 0.01]. Admixture mapping found suggestive outcome associations with local African ancestry at chromosome bands 18q21 and 10q22 among infants of maternal self-reported African-American race/ethnicity.

The protective allele of this variant was significantly associated with lower nitric oxide metabolites in the urine of non-Hispanic white infants ( P = 0.006), supporting a role in the racial differential response to nitric oxide. Interrogating genes upregulated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia lungs indicated association with variants in CCL18, a cytokine associated with fibrosis and interstitial lung disease, and pathway analyses implicated variation in genes involved in immune/inflammatory processes in response to infection and mechanical ventilation.

We used a software-based method to predict the metagenome of the tracheal aspirate (TA) microbiome from 16S rRNA sequencing data in preterm infants and to identify functional ortholog genes that were differentially abundant in BPD-predisposed and BPD-resistant infants. We also identified metabolites that were differentially enriched in these samples by use of untargeted mass spectrometry and mummichog to identify the metabolic pathways involved. Microbial metagenome analysis identified specific pathways that were less abundant in the functional metagenome of the microbiota of BPD-predisposed infants compared with BPD-resistant infants. The airway metabolome of BPD-predisposed infants was enriched for metabolites involved in fatty acid activation and androgen and estrogen biosynthesis compared with BPD-resistant infants. These findings suggest that in extremely preterm infants the early airway microbiome may alter the metabolome, thereby modifying the risk of BPD. The differential enrichment of sex steroid metabolic pathways supports previous studies suggesting a role for sexual dimorphism in BPD risk. This study also suggests a role for metabolomic and metagenomic profiles to serve as early biomarkers of BPD risk.","group":"g1","id":"4172e697-d0a1-481a-8e41-a486b1a6db6b","_showDetails":true},"c4252c39-1bed-4125-a030-5b1ff2c3114e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Pulmonary endothelial cells exhibit sexual dimorphism in their response to hyperoxia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00416.2018","authors":["Zhang, Yuhao","Dong, Xiaoyu","Shirazi, Jasmine","Gleghorn, Jason P","Lingappan, Krithika"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180810//","keywords":["Actins/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Cell Movement/de [Drug Effects]","Cell Proliferation/de [Drug Effects]","Cell Survival/de [Drug Effects]","Cells, Cultured","Child, Preschool","*Endothelial Cells/de [Drug Effects]","Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Endothelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/de [Drug Effects]","Female","Fibroblasts/de [Drug Effects]","Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","Fibroblasts/pa [Pathology]","Humans","Infant","Male","Neovascularization, Physiologic/de [Drug Effects]","*Oxygen/to [Toxicity]","Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Artery/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Artery/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Artery/pa [Pathology]","Sex Characteristics","Sex Factors"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Despite the well-established sex-specific differences in the incidence of BPD, the molecular mechanism(s) behind these are not completely understood. Exposure to a high concentration of oxygen (hyperoxia) contributes to BPD and creates a profibrotic environment in the lung. Our objective was to elucidate the sex-specific differences in neonatal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) in normoxic and hyperoxic conditions, including the propensity for endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. HPMECs (18- to 24-wk gestation donors, 6 male donors and 5 female donors) were subjected to hyperoxia (95% O2 and 5% CO2) or normoxia (air and 5% CO2) up to 72 h. We assessed cell migration and angiogenesis at baseline. Cell proliferation, viability, and expression of endothelial (CD31) and fibroblast markers (alpha-smooth muscle actin) were measured upon exposure to hyperoxia. Female HPMECs had significantly higher cell migration when assessed by the wound healing assay (40.99 +/- 4.4%) compared with male HPMECs (14.76 +/- 3.7%) and showed greater sprouting (1710 +/- 962 mum in female cells vs. 789 +/- 324 in male cells) compared with male endothelial cells in normoxia. Hyperoxia exposure decreased cell viability (by 9.8% at 48 h and 11.7% at 72 h) and proliferation (by 26.7% at 72 h) markedly in male HPMECs, whereas viability was sustained in female endothelial cells. There was greater expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (2.5-fold) and decreased expression (5-fold) of CD31 in male HPMECs upon exposure to hyperoxia. The results indicate that cellular sex affects response in HPMECs in normoxia and hyperoxia.

Under normoxic conditions, female human neonatal pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells display greater migration and angiogenic sprouting compared with male endothelial cells. Compared with female endothelial cells, hyperoxia exposure decreased cell viability and proliferation and increased alpha-smooth muscle actin and decreased CD31 expression in male endothelial cells, indicating an increased endothelial-mesenchymal transition.","group":"g1","id":"c4252c39-1bed-4125-a030-5b1ff2c3114e","_showDetails":true},"303c8023-95c0-4121-8be7-a42314bd4237":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Lung omics signatures in a bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension-like murine model.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00183.2018","authors":["Shrestha, Amrit Kumar","Gopal, Vashisht Y N","Menon, Renuka T","Hagan, Joseph L","Huang, Shixia","Shivanna, Binoy"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180726//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Biomarkers/an [Analysis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Humans","Hypertension, Pulmonary/ge [Genetics]","Hypertension, Pulmonary/me [Metabolism]","*Hypertension, Pulmonary/pa [Pathology]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","*Proteome/an [Analysis]","*Transcriptome"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Upon TXNRD1 inhibition, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is disproportionally increased compared with Nrf2 target NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (Nqo1). HO-1 has been investigated as a potential therapeutic target in both ARDS and BPD. TXNRD1 is predominantly expressed in airway epithelial cells; however, the mechanism of HO-1 induction by TXNRD1 inhibitors is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that TXNRD1 inhibition induces HO-1 via Nrf2-dependent mechanisms. Wild-type (WT), Nrf2KO1.3, and Nrf2KO2.2 cells were morphologically indistinguishable, indicating that Nrf2 can be deleted from murine-transformed club cells (mtCCs) using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Hemin, a Nrf2-independent HO-1-inducing agent, significantly increased HO-1 expression in WT, Nrf2KO1.3, and Nrf2KO2.2. Auranofin (AFN) (0.5 microM) inhibited TXNRD1 activity by 50% and increased Nqo1 and Hmox1 mRNA levels by 6- and 24-fold, respectively, in WT cells.

Lambs were further assigned to 15 minutes of either: a) Injurious mechanical ventilation (MV) or b) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 5 cmH2O. After the 15 minute intervention, the animals were returned to the uterus and delivered after i) 6 or ii) 24 hours in utero., RESULTS: MV caused lung injury and inflammation, increased lung mRNA for cytokines and EGFR ligands, caused airway epithelial cell proliferation, and decreased airway epithelial phosphorylated ERK1/2.

There were no differences in markers of lung injury or inflammation between CPAP animals receiving Gefitinib or saline., CONCLUSION: Inhibition of the EGFR pathway did not alter acute lung inflammation or injury from mechanical ventilation in preterm sheep.","group":"g1","id":"a5303baf-c218-4f57-ac55-8a259be02f9c","_showDetails":true},"846b0466-4d6e-4e17-9d07-f879f6c49dfb":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Effect of progesterone on Smad signaling and TGF-beta/Smad-regulated genes in lung epithelial cells.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200661","authors":["Kunzmann, Steffen","Ottensmeier, Barbara","Speer, Christian P","Fehrholz, Markus"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180712//","keywords":["A549 Cells","Airway Remodeling/de [Drug Effects]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","*Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Epithelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","*Gene Expression Regulation/de [Drug Effects]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Phosphorylation/de [Drug Effects]","*Progesterone/ae [Adverse Effects]","Progesterone/pd [Pharmacology]","*Respiratory Mucosa/me [Metabolism]","Respiratory Mucosa/pa [Pathology]","*Signal Transduction/de [Drug Effects]","*Smad2 Protein/me [Metabolism]","*Smad3 Protein/me [Metabolism]","*Transforming Growth Factor beta1/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"13","number":"7","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=30001393"],"address":"United States","abstract":"The effect of endogenous progesterone and/or exogenous pre- or postnatal progesterone application on lung function of preterm infants is poorly defined. While prenatal progesterone substitution may prevent preterm birth, in vitro and in vivo data suggest a benefit of postnatal progesterone replacement on the incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for progesterone's effects are undefined. Numerous factors are involved in lung development, airway inflammation, and airway remodeling: the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) signaling pathway and TGF-beta-regulated genes, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transgelin (TAGLN), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). These processes contribute to the development of BPD. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether progesterone could affect TGF-beta1-activated Smad signaling and CTGF/transgelin/PAI-1 expression in lung epithelial cells. The pharmacological effect of progesterone on Smad signaling was investigated using a TGF-beta1-inducible luciferase reporter and western blotting analysis of phosphorylated Smad2/3 in A549 lung epithelial cells. The regulation of CTGF, transgelin, and PAI-1 expression by progesterone was studied using a promoter-based luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting in the same cell line. While progesterone alone had no direct effect on Smad signaling in lung epithelial cells, it dose-dependently inhibited TGF-beta1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation, as shown by luciferase assays and western blotting analysis. Progesterone also antagonized the TGF-beta1/Smad-induced upregulation of CTGF, transgelin, and PAI-1 at the promoter, mRNA, and/or protein levels. The present study highlights possible new molecular mechanisms involving progesterone, including inhibition of TGF-beta1-activated Smad signaling and TGF-beta1-regulated genes involved in BPD pathogenesis, which are likely to attenuate the development of BPD by inhibiting TGF-beta1-mediated airway remodeling. Understanding these mechanisms might help to explain the effects of pre- or postnatal application of progesterone on lung diseases of preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"846b0466-4d6e-4e17-9d07-f879f6c49dfb","_showDetails":true},"b5760d35-8e3c-4996-9d00-9075247e611a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Hyperoxia Disrupts Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1/2-Induced Angiogenesis in the Developing Lungs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms19051525","authors":["Menon, Renuka T","Shrestha, Amrit Kumar","Barrios, Roberto","Shivanna, Binoy"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180520//","keywords":["Animals","Apoptosis","Cell Cycle","Cells, Cultured","Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Endothelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Endothelium, Vascular/me [Metabolism]","Endothelium, Vascular/pa [Pathology]","Female","Humans","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","*MAP Kinase Signaling System","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/me [Metabolism]","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/me [Metabolism]","*Neovascularization, Physiologic"],"journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","volume":"19","number":"5","isbn":"1422-0067","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=29783779"],"address":"Switzerland","abstract":"Hyperoxia contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of infants that is characterized by interrupted alveologenesis.

In pre-clinical BPD models, hyperoxia increases the expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2; however, its effects on the lung endothelial ERK1/2 signaling are unclear. Further, whether ERK1/2 activation promotes lung angiogenesis in infants is unknown. Hence, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) hyperoxia exposure will increase lung endothelial ERK1/2 signaling in neonatal C57BL/6J (WT) mice and in fetal human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs); (2) ERK1/2 inhibition will disrupt angiogenesis in vitro by repressing cell cycle progression. In mice, hyperoxia exposure transiently increased lung endothelial ERK1/2 activation at one week of life, before inhibiting it at two weeks of life. Interestingly, hyperoxia-mediated decrease in ERK1/2 activation in mice was associated with decreased angiogenesis and increased endothelial cell apoptosis. Hyperoxia also transiently activated ERK1/2 in HPAECs. ERK1/2 inhibition disrupted angiogenesis in vitro, and these effects were associated with altered levels of proteins that modulate cell cycle progression. Collectively, these findings support our hypotheses, emphasizing that the ERK1/2 pathway is a potential therapeutic target for BPD infants with decreased lung vascularization.","group":"g1","id":"b5760d35-8e3c-4996-9d00-9075247e611a","_showDetails":true},"28354d13-e02a-4097-a27b-469c66cd8c0f":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Effects of budesonide and surfactant in preterm fetal sheep.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00528.2017","authors":["Kothe, T Brett","Royse, Emily","Kemp, Matthew W","Schmidt, Augusto","Salomone, Fabrizio","Saito, Masatoshi","Usuda, Haruo","Watanabe, Shimpei","Musk, Gabrielle C","Jobe, Alan H","Hillman, Noah H"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180419//","keywords":["Animals","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/th [Therapy]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","Budesonide/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","Budesonide/pd [Pharmacology]","*Budesonide","Female","Fetus/me [Metabolism]","Fetus/pa [Pathology]","Fetus/pp [Physiopathology]","*Fetus","Liver/me [Metabolism]","Liver/pa [Pathology]","Liver/pp [Physiopathology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Pregnancy","Premature Birth/me [Metabolism]","Premature Birth/pa [Pathology]","Premature Birth/pp [Physiopathology]","*Premature Birth/th [Therapy]","Pulmonary Surfactants/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","Pulmonary Surfactants/pd [Pharmacology]","*Pulmonary Surfactants","Respiration, Artificial/ae [Adverse Effects]","Respiration, Artificial/mt [Methods]","Sheep"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Ewes at 125 +/- 1 days gestational age had fetal surgery to expose fetal head and chest with placental circulation intact. Lambs were randomized to 1) mechanical ventilation with escalating VT to target 15 ml/kg by 15 min or 2) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 cmH2O.

The fetuses were returned to the uterus for 24 h and then delivered and ventilated for 30 min to assess lung function. Budesonide levels were low in lung and plasma. CPAP groups had improved oxygenation, ventilation, and decreased injury markers compared with fetal VT lambs. Budesonide improved ventilation in CPAP lambs. Budesonide decreased lung weights and lung liquid and increased lung compliance and surfactant protein mRNA. Budesonide decreased proinflammatory and acute-phase responses in lung.

Exosomes and exosomal miRNAs may regulate cell differentiation and tissue and organ development. We discovered that tracheal aspirates from infants with severe BPD had increased numbers of, but smaller, exosomes compared with term controls. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from hyperoxia-exposed mice (an animal model of BPD) and supernatants from hyperoxia-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells (in vitro model of BPD) had increased exosomes compared with air controls. Next, in a prospective cohort study of tracheal aspirates obtained at birth from extremely preterm infants, utilizing independent discovery and validation cohorts, we identified unbiased exosomal miRNA signatures predictive of severe BPD. The strongest signal of reduced miR-876-3p in BPD-susceptible compared with BPD-resistant infants was confirmed in the animal model and in vitro models of BPD. In addition, based on our recent discovery of increased Proteobacteria in the airway microbiome being associated with BPD, we developed potentially novel in vivo and in vitro models for BPD combining Proteobacterial LPS and hyperoxia exposure. Addition of LPS led to a larger reduction in exosomal miR 876-3p in both hyperoxia and normoxia compared with hyperoxia alone, thus indicating a potential mechanism by which alterations in microbiota can suppress miR 876-3p. Gain of function of miR 876-3p improved the alveolar architecture in the in vivo BPD model, demonstrating a causal link between miR 876-3p and BPD. In summary, we provide evidence for the strong predictive biomarker potential of miR 876-3p in severe BPD. We also provide insights on the pathogenesis of neonatal lung disease, as modulated by hyperoxia and microbial product-induced changes in exosomal miRNA 876-3p, which could be targeted for future therapeutic development.","group":"g1","id":"27700b62-7fff-4bba-99db-394a286af341","_showDetails":true},"a46b4520-d89c-44d2-a8c6-24aef65a1c21":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Aurothioglucose does not improve alveolarization or elicit sustained Nrf2 activation in C57BL/6 models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00539.2017","authors":["Li, Qian","Li, Rui","Wall, Stephanie B","Dunigan, Katelyn","Ren, Changchun","Jilling, Tamas","Rogers, Lynette K","Tipple, Trent E"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20180125//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Antirheumatic Agents/pd [Pharmacology]","*Aurothioglucose/pd [Pharmacology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/dt [Drug Therapy]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Cells, Cultured","Female","*Gene Expression Regulation/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/cy [Cytology]","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C3H","Mice, Inbred C57BL","NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/ge [Genetics]","*NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/me [Metabolism]","NF-E2-Related Factor 2/ge [Genetics]","*NF-E2-Related Factor 2/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/cy [Cytology]","Pulmonary Alveoli/de [Drug Effects]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Thioredoxin Reductase 1/ge [Genetics]","*Thioredoxin Reductase 1/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Given that inbred mouse strains have differential sensitivity and endogenous Nrf2 activation by hyperoxia, the present studies utilized two C57BL/6 exposure models to evaluate the effects of ATG on lung development and Nrf2 activation. The first model (0-14 days) was used in our C3H/HeN studies and the 2nd model (4-14 days) is well characterized in C57BL/6 mice. ATG significantly inhibited lung TrxR1 activity in both models; however, there was no effect on parameters of alveolarization in C57BL/6 mice. In sharp contrast to C3H/HeN mice, there was no effect of ATG on pulmonary NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 ( Nqo1) and heme oxygenase-1 ( Hmox1) at 72 h in either C57BL/6 model. In conclusion, although ATG inhibited TrxR1 activity in the lungs of newborn C57BL/6 mice, effects on lung development and sustained Nrf2-dependent pulmonary responses were blunted.

Increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling plays a prominent role in PH pathogenesis and progression in adults. We hypothesized that increased 5-HT signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of neonatal PH, complicating BPD and neonatal lung injury. Thus, we investigated 5-HT signaling in neonatal mice exposed to bleomycin, previously demonstrated to induce PH and alveolar simplification. Newborn wild-type mice received intraperitoneal PBS, ketanserin (1 mg/kg), bleomycin (3 U/kg) or bleomycin (3 U/kg) plus ketanserin (1 mg/kg) three times weekly for 3 wk. Following treatment with bleomycin, pulmonary expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph1), was significantly increased. Bleomycin did not affect pulmonary 5-HT 2A receptor (R) expression, but did increase pulmonary gene expression of the 5-HT 2BR and serotonin transporter. Treatment with ketanserin attenuated bleomycin-induced PH (increased RVSP and RVH) and pulmonary vascular remodeling (decreased vessel density and increased muscularization of small vessels). In addition, we found that treatment with ketanserin activated pulmonary MAPK and Akt signaling in mice exposed to bleomycin. We conclude that 5-HT signaling is increased in a murine model of neonatal PH and pharmacological inhibition of the 5-HT 2AR protects against the development of PH in neonatal lung injury. We speculate this occurs through restoration of MAPK signaling and increased Akt signaling.","group":"g1","id":"7eb1f7b9-d5b5-40e5-86e6-d560d37906c0","_showDetails":true},"294f9c6b-890c-44b4-8c6e-867fac6e798e":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2018>","title":"Race Effects of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Preterm Infants: An Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.10.004","authors":["Askie, Lisa M","Davies, Lucy C","Schreiber, Michael D","Hibbs, Anna Maria","Ballard, Philip L","Ballard, Roberta A"],"date":"2018//","accessDate":"20171211//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Administration, Inhalation","Black or African American/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/eh [Ethnology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Glucocorticoids/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Humans","Infant","*Infant Mortality/eh [Ethnology]","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Length of Stay/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","*Nitric Oxide/ad [Administration & Dosage]","Nitric Oxide/ae [Adverse Effects]","Race Factors","Respiratory Therapy/ae [Adverse Effects]","Respiratory Therapy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]","Survival Rate"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"193","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med15&NEWS=N&AN=29241680"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) improves survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) for preterm African American infants., STUDY DESIGN: An individual participant data meta-analysis was conducted, including 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials that enrolled infants born at <34 weeks of gestation receiving respiratory support, had at least 15% (or a minimum of 10 infants in each trial arm) of African American race, and used a starting iNO of >5 parts per million with the intention to treat for 7 days minimum.

PH was defined by echocardiographic criteria. Genomic DNA isolated from patient blood samples was analyzed for 31 SNPs in DUSP genes. Clinical characteristics and minor allele frequencies were compared between BPD-PH (cases) and BPD-without PH (control) groups. Biomarker models to predict PH in BPD using clinical and SNP data were tested by calculations of area under the ROC curve., RESULTS: In our BPD cohort, 32% (n = 61) had PH. Of the DUSP SNPs evaluated, DUSP1 SNP rs322351 was less common, and DUSP5 SNPs rs1042606 and rs3793892 were more common in cases than in controls. The best fit biomarker model combines clinical and DUSP genetic data with an area under the ROC curve of 0.76., CONCLUSION: We identified three DUSP SNPs as potential BPD-PH biomarkers. Combining clinical and DUSP genetic data yields the most robust predictor for PH in BPD.","group":"g4","id":"9ceac224-8d45-470f-bbda-cb60d5f71dcf","_showDetails":true},"1ee97fbe-3c0b-4b03-916d-9531892a6884":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Lung function at term in extremely preterm-born infants: a regional prospective cohort study.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016868","authors":["Bentsen, Mariann Haavik","Markestad, Trond","Oymar, Knut","Halvorsen, Thomas"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20171025//","keywords":["Birth Weight","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ep [Epidemiology]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant","*Infant, Extremely Premature","Infant, Newborn","Linear Models","Logistic Models","*Lung/pp [Physiopathology]","Male","Multivariate Analysis","Norway","Prospective Studies","ROC Curve","Sex Factors","Term Birth","Tidal Volume"],"journal":"BMJ open","volume":"7","number":"10","isbn":"2044-6055","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=29074512"],"address":"England","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To compare lung function of extremely preterm (EP)-born infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with that of healthy term-born infants, and to determine which perinatal characteristics were associated with lung function at term and how predictive these measurements were for later respiratory health in EP-born infants., METHODS: Perinatal variables were recorded prospectively, and tidal breathing parameters were measured at term-equivalent age using electromagnetic inductance plethysmography. Respiratory morbidity was defined by hospital readmissions and/or treatment with asthma medications during the first year of life., RESULTS: Fifty-two EP-born infants (mean gestational age 261, range 226-276 weeks) and 45 term-born infants were included. There was evidence of significant airway obstruction, higher tidal volumes and increased minute ventilation in the EP-born infants with and without BPD, although generally more pronounced for those with BPD. Male gender, antenatal steroids and number of days on continuous positive airway pressure were associated with lung function outcomes at term. A prediction model incorporating two unrelated tidal breathing parameters, BPD, birth weight z-score and gender, predicted respiratory morbidity in the first year of life with good accuracy (area under the curve 0.818, sensitivity and specificity 81.8% and 75.0%, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Lung function measured at term-equivalent age was strikingly abnormal in EP-born infants, irrespective of BPD.

These have not yet been studied in combination. This study tested the hypothesis that combined inflammatory and oxidative stressors would interact and change PPARgamma- and Nrf2-regulated gene expression and antioxidant capacity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of dual stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and hyperoxia in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM)., METHODS: Sub-confluent BMDM from wild-type C57BL/6J mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1ug/mL for 2 hours followed by room air (21% oxygen) or hyperoxia (95% oxygen) for 24 hours. Taqman real time-polymerase chain reaction gene expression assays, total antioxidant capacity assays, and Luminex assays were performed., RESULTS: Supernatants of cultured BMDM contained significant antioxidant capacity. In room air, LPS treatment decreased expression of PPARgamma and Nrf2, and increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and heme oxygenase-1; similar findings were observed under hyperoxic conditions. LPS treatment decreased cellular total antioxidant capacity in room air but not in hyperoxia. Increased expression of sulfiredoxin-1 in response to hyperoxia was not observed in LPS-treated cells. Dual stimulation with LPS treatment and exposure to hyperoxia did not have synergistic effects on gene expression. Cellular total antioxidant capacity was not changed by hyperoxia exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis was supported and we demonstrate an interaction between inflammatory and oxidative stressors in a model system of bronchopulmonary dysplasia pathogenesis. The protective anti-oxidant effect of cell culture media may have protected the cells from the most deleterious effects of hyperoxia.","group":"g1","id":"ada7d84c-9ac9-4ff0-9b7f-288e9ad4e91d","_showDetails":true},"6a7b6384-60ac-4bdf-8949-348dd2376573":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Sexual dimorphism of the pulmonary transcriptome in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury: identification of angiogenesis as a key pathway.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00230.2017","authors":["Coarfa, Cristian","Zhang, Yuhao","Maity, Suman","Perera, Dimuthu N","Jiang, Weiwu","Wang, Lihua","Couroucli, Xanthi","Moorthy, Bhagavatula","Lingappan, Krithika"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20170817//","keywords":["Animals","Female","*Gene Expression Regulation","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","*Lung Injury/me [Metabolism]","Lung Injury/pa [Pathology]","Male","Mice","*Neovascularization, Physiologic","*Sex Characteristics","*Transcriptome"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) contributes to the development of BPD. The male sex is considered an independent risk factor for the development of BPD. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. We hypothesized that sex-specific modulation of biological processes in the lung under hyperoxic conditions contributes to sex-based differences. Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia [95% [Formula: see text], postnatal day (PND) 1-5: saccular stage of lung development] and euthanized on PND 7 or 21. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-Seq on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Analysis of the pulmonary transcriptome revealed differential sex-specific modulation of crucial pathways such as angiogenesis, response to hypoxia, inflammatory response, and p53 pathway. Candidate genes from these pathways were validated at the mRNA level by qPCR. Analysis also revealed sex-specific differences in the modulation of crucial transcription factors. Focusing on the differential modulation of the angiogenesis pathway, we also showed sex-specific differential activation of Hif-1alpha-regulated genes using ChIP-qPCR and differences in expression of crucial genes (Vegf, VegfR2, and Phd2) modulating angiogenesis. We demonstrate the translational relevance of our findings by showing that our murine sex-specific differences in gene expression correlate with those from a preexisting human BPD data set. In conclusion, we provide novel molecular insights into differential sex-specific modulation of the pulmonary transcriptome in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and highlight angiogenesis as one of the crucial differentially modulated pathways.

The cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway has not been well studied in BPD-associated PH. In addition, there is little data about the natural history of hyperoxia-induced PH in mice or the utility of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibition in established disease. C57BL/6 mice were placed in room air or 75% O2 within 24h of birth for 14d, followed by recovery in room air for an additional 7 days (21d). Additional pups were treated with either vehicle or sildenafil for 7d during room air recovery. Mean alveolar area, pulmonary artery (PA) medial wall thickness (MWT), RVH, and vessel density were evaluated at 21d. PA protein from 21d animals was analyzed for soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activity, PDE5 activity, and cGMP levels. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure results in persistent alveolar simplification, RVH, decreased vessel density, increased MWT, and disrupted cGMP signaling despite a period of room air recovery. Delayed treatment with sildenafil during room air recovery is associated with improved RVH and decreased PA PDE5 activity, but does not have significant effects on alveolar simplification, PA remodeling, or vessel density.

HCA was defined as neutrophil infiltrates in the amnion, chorion of the membranes, or chorionic plate, associated or not with funisitis. The main outcome measure was moderate or severe BPD.

Among those diagnosed with BPD, a subset of infants develop severe BPD with disproportionate pulmonary morbidities. In addition to decreased alveolarization, these infants develop obstructive and/or restrictive lung function due to increases in or dysregulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Analyses of plasma obtained from preterm infants during the first week of life indicate that circulating miR-29b is suppressed in infants that subsequently develop BPD and that decreased circulating miR-29b is inversely correlated with BPD severity. Our mouse model mimics the pathophysiology observed in infants with severe BPD, and we have previously reported decreased pulmonary miR-29b expression in this model. The current studies tested the hypothesis that adeno-associated 9 (AAV9)-mediated restoration of miR-29b in the developing lung will improve lung alveolarization and minimize the deleterious changes in matrix deposition. Pregnant C3H/HeN mice received an intraperitoneal LPS injection on embryonic day 16 and newborn pups were exposed to 85% oxygen from birth to 14 days of life. On postnatal day 3, AAV9-miR-29b or AAV9-control was administered intranasally. Mouse lung tissues were then analyzed for changes in miR-29 expression, alveolarization, and matrix protein levels and localization. Although only modest improvements in alveolarization were detected in the AAV9-miR29b-treated mice at postnatal day 28, treatment completely attenuated defects in matrix protein expression and localization. Our data suggest that miR-29b restoration may be one component of a novel therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent severe BPD in prematurely born infants.

Oxidative stress from hyperoxia can injure developing lungs through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Early caffeine treatment decreases the rate of BPD, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that caffeine attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury through its chemical chaperone property. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were raised either in 90 (hyperoxia) or 21% (normoxia) oxygen from postnatal day 1 (P1) to postnatal day 10 (P10) and then recovered in 21% oxygen until P21. Caffeine (20 mg/kg) or normal saline (control) was administered intraperitoneally daily starting from P2. Lungs were inflation-fixed for histology or snap-frozen for immunoblots. Blood caffeine levels were measured in treated pups at euthanasia and were found to be 18.4 +/- 4.9 mug/ml. Hyperoxia impaired alveolar formation and increased ER stress markers and downstream effectors; caffeine treatment attenuated these changes at P10. Caffeine also attenuated the hyperoxia-induced activation of cyclooxygenase-2 and markers of apoptosis. In conclusion, hyperoxia-induced alveolar growth impairment is mediated, in part, by ER stress. Early caffeine treatment protects developing lungs from hyperoxia-induced injury by attenuating ER stress.

TA was collected from 43 premature infants randomly assigned to receive either iNO or placebo gas (birth weight 530-1230 g, median 800 g, gestational age 24 to 28 2/7 weeks, median 26 weeks). Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), neuropeptide Y and leukotriene B4 were measured in serial TA samples from postnatal day 2 to 14. Furthermore, TA levels of nitrotyrosine and nitrite were determined under iNO therapy., RESULTS: The TA levels of IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1alpha, IL-1beta, ASM and albumin increased with advancing postnatal age in critically ill preterm infants, whereas nitrotyrosine TA levels declined in both, iNO-treated and placebo-treated infants. The iNO treatment generally increased nitrite TA levels, whereas nitrotyrosine TA levels were not affected by iNO treatment. Furthermore, iNO treatment transiently reduced early inflammatory and fibrotic markers associated with BPD development including TGF-beta1, IP-10 and IL-8, but induced a delayed increase of ASM TA levels., CONCLUSION: Treatment with iNO may have played a role in reducing several inflammatory and fibrotic mediators in TA of preterm infants compared to placebo-treated infants. However, survival without BPD was not affected in the main EUNO trial., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00551642.","group":"g1","id":"be43ac94-4e16-48fa-994f-0e1b753dd8eb","_showDetails":true},"ee1a8341-1904-4d8a-a6c8-e862b2521a77":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2017>","title":"Posttranslational modification of beta-catenin is associated with pathogenic fibroblastic changes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00477.2016","authors":["Sucre, Jennifer M S","Vijayaraj, Preethi","Aros, Cody J","Wilkinson, Dan","Paul, Manash","Dunn, Bruce","Guttentag, Susan H","Gomperts, Brigitte N"],"date":"2017//","accessDate":"20161209//","keywords":["Actins/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Cell Nucleus/de [Drug Effects]","Cell Nucleus/me [Metabolism]","Dasatinib/pd [Pharmacology]","Fibroblasts/de [Drug Effects]","*Fibroblasts/me [Metabolism]","*Fibroblasts/pa [Pathology]","Humans","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Hypoxia/co [Complications]","Hypoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hypoxia/pa [Pathology]","Infant, Newborn","Lung/de [Drug Effects]","Lung/gd [Growth & Development]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Organoids/de [Drug Effects]","Organoids/me [Metabolism]","Phosphorylation/de [Drug Effects]","Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]","Protein Processing, Post-Translational/de [Drug Effects]","*Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Protein Transport/de [Drug Effects]","Up-Regulation/de [Drug Effects]","Wnt Signaling Pathway/de [Drug Effects]","*beta Catenin/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

The histopathology of BPD is characterized by an arrest of alveolarization with fibroblast activation. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is important in early lung development. When Wnt signaling is active, phosphorylation of beta-catenin by tyrosine kinases at activating sites, specifically at tyrosine 489 (Y489), correlates with nuclear localization of beta-catenin. We examined fetal lung tissue, lung tissue from term newborns, and lung tissue from infants who died with BPD; we found nuclear beta-catenin phosphorylation at Y489 in epithelial and mesenchymal cells in fetal tissue and BPD tissue, but not in the lungs of term infants. Using a 3D human organoid model, we found increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin phosphorylated at Y489 (p-beta-cateninY489) after exposure to alternating hypoxia and hyperoxia compared with organoids cultured in normoxia. Exogenous stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway in organoids was sufficient to cause nuclear localization of p-beta-cateninY489 in normoxia and mimicked the pattern of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression seen with fibroblastic activation from oxidative stress. Treatment of organoids with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor prior to cyclic hypoxia-hyperoxia inhibited nuclear localization of p-beta-cateninY489 and prevented alpha-SMA expression by fibroblasts. Posttranslational phosphorylation of beta-catenin is a transient feature of normal lung development. Moreover, the persistence of p-beta-cateninY489 is a durable marker of fibroblast activation in BPD and may play an important role in BPD disease pathobiology.

Despite these catastrophic consequences, no evidence-based therapies are available for the prevention of pulmonary hypertension in this population. Sildenafil is a potent pulmonary vasodilator approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults. Preclinical models suggest a beneficial effect of sildenafil on premature lungs through improved alveolarization and preserved vascular development. Sildenafil may therefore prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease of prematurity by reducing pulmonary vascular remodeling and lowering pulmonary vascular resistance; however, clinical trial evidence is needed. The present study, supported by the National Institutes of Health's National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, will generate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary effectiveness data on sildenafil in a population of premature infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia at risk for pulmonary hypertension., METHODS: We have designed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential dose-escalating, double-masked, safety trial of sildenafil in premature infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We will randomize 120 premature infants < 29 weeks gestational age with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 32-40 weeks postmenstrual age in a dose-escalating approach 3:1 (sildenafil: placebo) sequentially into each of 3 cohorts at ~ 30 clinical sites. Participants will receive up to 34 days of study drug, followed by 28 days of safety monitoring. The primary outcome will be safety as determined by incidence of hypotension. Secondary outcomes will include pharmacokinetics and preliminary effectiveness of sildenafil based on presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by echocardiography at the end of treatment period., DISCUSSION: Sildenafil is a promising intervention to prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Clinical trials of sildenafil specifically designed for premature infants are urgently needed. The current study will make substantial contributions to scientific knowledge of the safety of sildenafil in premature infants at risk for pulmonary hypertension.

EPC-EXOs were isolated by ExoQuick-TC kits from the conditioned media of EPCs. The PMVECs were divided into three groups, including the normal group, the hyperoxia group (exposed to 85% O2) and the EPC-EXOs treatment group (exposed to 85% O2 and EPC-EXOs with the concentration of 100 microg/mL). The activities of proliferation, migration and tube formation of PMVECs were detected at the endpoint. The mRNA and protein expression levels of VEGF, VEGFR2 and eNOS in different groups were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot., RESULTS: We found EPC-EXOs exhibited a cup or biconcave morphology, with the size ranging from 30 to 150 nm, and positive for the characteristic exosomal surface marker proteins, CD63 and TSG101. Comparing to the control group, Hyperoxic stress impaired the proliferation, migration, and tubule formation of PMVECs, and decreased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) of PMVECs. Comparing to the hyperoxia group, EPC-EXOs treatment enhanced the bioactivity of PMVECs in vitro, and increased the expression of eNOS, VEGF and VEGFR2., CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate EPCs secrete exosomes that have independent angiogenic activity in vitro. This may help explain in part the protective effects of EPCs on hyperoxic injury in the developing lung vasculature and may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for BPD.","group":"g1","id":"19f17008-504b-41a5-a90c-4990b938558d","_showDetails":true},"b031a8af-4dc5-4753-9cbb-2a8aec234f19":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"Effect of Early Expressed Human Milk on Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 and Short-Term Outcomes in Preterm Infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168139","authors":["Serrao, Francesca","Papacci, Patrizia","Costa, Simonetta","Giannantonio, Carmen","Cota, Francesco","Vento, Giovanni","Romagnoli, Costantino"],"date":"2016//","accessDate":"20161214//","keywords":["Breast Feeding","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Female","Hospitalization","Humans","Incidence","Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/ch [Chemistry]","Intestinal Mucosa/me [Metabolism]","Longitudinal Studies","Male","*Milk, Human/ch [Chemistry]","Nutritional Status","Parenteral Nutrition","Pasteurization","Prospective Studies","Sepsis/pc [Prevention & Control]","Treatment Outcome"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"11","number":"12","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=27973552"],"address":"United States","abstract":"AIMS: Preterm breast milk contains high levels of bioactive components, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), that are reduced by Holder pasteurization.

The retinal phenotype of this model, which we termed hyperoxia-induced proliferative retinopathy (HIPR), shows severe disruption of retinal vasculature and loss of vascular patterning, disorganized intra-retinal angiogenesis, inflammation and retinal detachment.

Female MSC secrete more anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors as compared to male MSC. Whether the therapeutic efficacy of MSC in attenuating lung injury in an experimental model of BPD is influenced by the sex of the donor MSC or recipient is unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that female MSC would have greater lung regenerative properties than male MSC in experimental BPD and this benefit would be more evident in males., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intra-tracheal (IT) administration of female MSC to neonatal rats with experimental BPD has more beneficial reparative effects as compared to IT male MSC., METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to normoxia (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 2- P21 were randomly assigned to receive male or female IT bone marrow (BM)-derived green fluorescent protein (GFP+) MSC (1 x 106 cells/50 mul), or Placebo on P7. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), vascular remodeling, alveolarization, and angiogenesis were assessed at P21. PH was determined by measuring right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and pulmonary vascular remodeling was evaluated by quantifying the percentage of muscularized peripheral pulmonary vessels. Alveolarization was evaluated by measuring mean linear intercept (MLI) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Angiogenesis was determined by measuring vascular density. Data are expressed as mean +/- SD, and analyzed by ANOVA., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the RA groups. Exposure to hyperoxia resulted in a decrease in vascular density and RAC, with a significant increase in MLI, RVSP, and the percentage of partially and fully muscularized pulmonary arterioles. Administration of both male and female MSC significantly improved vascular density, alveolarization, RVSP, percent of muscularized vessels and alveolarization. Interestingly, the improvement in PH and vascular remodeling was more robust in the hyperoxic rodents who received MSC from female donors. In keeping with our hypothesis, male animals receiving female MSC, had a greater improvement in vascular remodeling. This was accompanied by a more significant decrease in lung pro-inflammatory markers and a larger increase in anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic markers in male rodents that received female MSC. There were no significant differences in MSC engraftment among groups., CONCLUSIONS: Female BM-derived MSC have greater therapeutic efficacy than male MSC in reducing neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and vascular remodeling. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of female MSC were more pronounced in male animals. Together, these findings suggest that female MSC maybe the most potent BM-derived MSC population for lung repair in severe BPD complicated by PH.","group":"g1","id":"15ddee1b-7aef-42d2-86e6-5a0a71667b08","_showDetails":true},"6162d516-0bfd-4f1a-b219-4bd5b28a1151":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"Early Cumulative Supplemental Oxygen Predicts Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in High Risk Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.06.079","authors":["Wai, Katherine C","Kohn, Michael A","Ballard, Roberta A","Truog, William E","Black, Dennis M","Asselin, Jeanette M","Ballard, Philip L","Rogers, Elizabeth E","Keller, Roberta L","Trial of Late Surfactant (TOLSURF) Study Group"],"date":"2016//","accessDate":"20160726//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/mo [Mortality]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pp [Physiopathology]","Female","Gestational Age","Humans","Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Male","*Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/mt [Methods]","Prospective Studies","ROC Curve","Risk","Survival Rate"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"177","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med13&NEWS=N&AN=27470692"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic accuracy of early cumulative supplemental oxygen (CSO) exposure for prediction of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death, and to evaluate the independent association of CSO with BPD or death., STUDY DESIGN: We performed a secondary analysis of the Trial of Late Surfactant, which enrolled 511 infants born at <=28 weeks gestational age who were mechanically ventilated at 7-14 days of life. Our primary outcome was BPD or death at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, as determined by a physiological oxygen/flow challenge. Average daily supplemental oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen - 0.21) was calculated. CSO was calculated as the sum of the average daily supplemental oxygen over time periods of interest up to 28 days of age. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) values were generated to evaluate the accuracy of CSO for prediction of BPD or death.

BPD is characterized by an arrest in lung development with marked impairment of alveolar septation and vascular development. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that male neonatal mice will be more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury and will display larger arrest in lung alveolarization. Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia [95% FiO2, postnatal day (PND) 1-5] and euthanized on PND 7 and 21. Extent of alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, inflammation, and modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway were determined and compared with room air controls. Macrophage and neutrophil infiltration was significantly increased in hyperoxia-exposed animals but was increased to a larger extent in males compared with females. Lung morphometry showed a higher mean linear intercept (MLI) and a lower radial alveolar count (RAC) and therefore greater arrest in lung development in male mice. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of markers of angiogenesis (PECAM1 and VEGFR2) in males after hyperoxia exposure compared with females. Interestingly, female mice showed increased activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in the lungs compared with males. These results support the hypothesis that sex plays a crucial role in hyperoxia-mediated lung injury in this model. Elucidation of the sex-specific molecular mechanisms may aid in the development of novel individualized therapies to prevent/treat BPD.

TGF-s1 mRNA and protein levels in lung tissues were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. With increasing time of hyperoxia exposure, the hyperoxia group gradually suffered from pathological changes such as poor development of lung tissues, alveolar simplification, decrease in the number of alveoli, and hindered pulmonary microvascular development. On the 7th day of hyperoxia exposure, TGF-s1 mRNA and protein levels (relative to b-actin) of the hyperoxia group (0.34 +/- 0.19 and 0.21 +/- 0.09, respectively) were significantly lower than those of the control group (0.83 +/- 0.45 and 0.57 +/- 0.45, respectively; P < 0.05). TGF-s1 participates in the pathogenesis of BPD as an important regulatory factor during pulmonary vascular development.","group":"g1","id":"e543d28d-b4ae-4081-8565-ae7cdfe9f63a","_showDetails":true},"a26fcf78-8fd4-47cc-97d2-437199cbd15c":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2016>","title":"Absence of TNF-alpha enhances inflammatory response in the newborn lung undergoing mechanical ventilation.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00367.2015","authors":["Ehrhardt, Harald","Pritzke, Tina","Oak, Prajakta","Kossert, Melina","Biebach, Luisa","Forster, Kai","Koschlig, Markus","Alvira, Cristina M","Hilgendorff, Anne"],"date":"2016//","accessDate":"20160325//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Apoptosis","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Cells, Cultured","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Lung/im [Immunology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Pneumonia/ge [Genetics]","Pneumonia/im [Immunology]","Pneumonia/me [Metabolism]","Respiration, Artificial","Trachea/me [Metabolism]","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/ge [Genetics]","*Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

As heightened expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha has been described in infants with BPD, we hypothesized that absence of TNF-alpha would reduce pulmonary inflammation, and attenuate structural changes in newborn mice undergoing MV-O2 Neonatal TNF-alpha null (TNF-alpha(-/-)) and wild type (TNF-alpha(+/+)) mice received MV-O2 for 8 h; controls spontaneously breathed 40% O2 Histologic, mRNA, and protein analysis in vivo were complemented by in vitro studies subjecting primary pulmonary myofibroblasts to mechanical stretch. Finally, TNF-alpha level in tracheal aspirates from preterm infants were determined by ELISA. Although MV-O2 induced larger and fewer alveoli in both, TNF-alpha(-/-) and TNF-alpha(+/+) mice, it caused enhanced lung apoptosis (TUNEL, caspase-3/-6/-8), infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, and proinflammatory mediator expression (IL-1beta, CXCL-1, MCP-1) in TNF-alpha(-/-) mice. These differences were associated with increased pulmonary transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, decreased TGF-beta inhibitor SMAD-7 expression, and reduced pulmonary NF-kappaB activity in ventilated TNF-alpha(-/-) mice. Preterm infants who went on to develop BPD showed significantly lower TNF-alpha levels at birth. Our results suggest a critical balance between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta signaling in the developing lung, and underscore the critical importance of these key pathways in the pathogenesis of BPD.

We have previously found that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) production, is elevated in patients with BPD-associated PH. ADMA is metabolised by N() ,N() -dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Presently, we test the hypothesis that there are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DDAH1 and/or DDAH2 associated with the development of PH in BPD patients., METHODS: BPD patients were enrolled (n = 98) at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Clinical characteristics and 36 SNPs in DDAH1 and DDAH2 were compared between BPD-associated PH patients (cases) and BPD-alone patients (controls)., RESULTS: In BPD patients, 25 (26%) had echocardiographic evidence of PH (cases). In this cohort, DDAH1 wild-type rs480414 was 92% sensitive and 53% specific for PH in BPD, and the DDAH1 SNP rs480414 decreased the risk of PH in an additive model of inheritance (OR = 0.39; 95% CI [0.18-0.88], p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The rs480414 SNP in DDAH1 may be protective against the development of PH in patients with BPD.

We hypothesized that lung matricellular protein expression predicts BPD development., METHODS: We collected tracheal aspirates and MSCs from mechanically-ventilated premature infants during the first week of life. Tracheal aspirate and MSC-conditioned media were analyzed for seven matricellular proteins including SPARC (for Secreted Protein, Acidic, Rich in Cysteine, also called osteonectin) and normalized to secretory component of IgA. A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine whether tracheal aspirate matricellular protein levels were independent predictors of BPD or death, controlling for gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW)., RESULTS: We collected aspirates from 89 babies (38 developed BPD, 16 died before 36 wks post-conceptual age). MSC-conditioned media showed no differences in matricellular protein abundance between cells from patients developing BPD and cells from patients who did not. However, SPARC levels were higher in tracheal aspirates from babies with an outcome of BPD or death (p<0.01). Further, our logistic model showed that tracheal aspirate SPARC (p<0.02) was an independent predictor of BPD/death. SPARC deposition was increased in the lungs of patients with BPD., CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically-ventilated premature infants, tracheal aspirate SPARC levels predicted development of BPD or death. Further study is needed to determine the value of SPARC as a biomarker or therapeutic target in BPD.","group":"g1","id":"0b9231c8-fdd2-4d42-a846-3de0d926e600","_showDetails":false},"2bdb9753-b612-4a7e-8ee7-8c5ff64fbd26":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Respiratory syncytial virus in preterm infants: 19 years of active epidemiological surveillance in a children's hospital.","journal":"Archivos argentinos de pediatria","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.5546/aap.2020.eng.386","authors":["Gentile, Angela","Lucion, Maria F","Juarez, Maria Del Valle","Castellano, Vanesa","Bakir, Julia","Pacchiotti, Anabella","Areso, Maria S","Viegas, Mariana","Goya, Stephanie","Mistchenko, Alicia"],"date":"2020//","keywords":["Child","Cross-Sectional Studies","Hospitalization","Hospitals, Pediatric","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Prospective Studies","Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/ep [Epidemiology]","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections","*Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human","Risk Factors"],"volume":"118","number":"6","isbn":"0325-0075","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33231045"],"address":"Argentina","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in pediatrics.

There is no definitive treatment other than delivery. A drug that can quench the disease process could be useful to treat early onset pre-eclampsia, as it could allow pregnancies to safely continue to a gestation where fetal outcomes are significantly improved. We have generated preclinical data to show esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor used for gastric reflux, has potent biological effects that makes it a worthwhile therapeutic candidate. Esomeprazole potently decreases soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin secretion from placenta and endothelial cells, and has biological actions to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We propose undertaking a phase II, double blind, randomised controlled clinical trial to examine whether administering 40 mg esomeprazole daily may prolong gestation in women with early onset pre-eclampsia. We will recruit 120 women (gestational age of 26+0 to 31+6 weeks) who will be randomised to receive either esomeprazole or an identical placebo. The primary outcome will be the number of days from randomisation to delivery. Secondary outcomes include maternal, fetal and neonatal composite and individual outcomes. Maternal outcomes include maternal death, eclampsia, pulmonary oedema, severe renal impairment, cerebral vascular events and liver haematoma or rupture. Neonatal outcomes include neonatal death within 6 weeks after the due date, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We will examine whether esomeprazole can decrease serum sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin levels and we will record the safety of esomeprazole in these pregnancies., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has ethical approval (Protocol V.2.4, M14/09/038, Federal Wide assurance Number 00001372, IRB0005239), and is registered with NHREC (ID 3649) and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201504000771349).

Normal fetal development occurs in a hypoxic environment and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) regulate the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha that controls apoptosis and angiogenesis. To understand SS-induced BPD, we hypothesized that gestational SS affected alveolar development through HIF-1alpha., METHODS: Pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to air (control) or SS throughout the gestational period and the 7-day-old lungs of the progeny were examined., RESULTS: Gestational SS increased apoptosis of alveolar and airway epithelial cells. This response was associated with increased alveolar volumes, higher levels of proapoptotic factors (FOXO3a, HIPK2, p53, BIM, BIK, and BAX) and the antiangiogenic factor (GAX), and lower levels of antiapoptotic factors (Akt-PI3K, NF-kappaB, HIF-1alpha, and Bcl-2) in the lung. Although gestational SS increased the cells containing the proangiogenic bombesin-like-peptide, it markedly decreased the expression of its receptor GRPR in the lung. The effects of SS on apoptosis were attenuated by the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine., CONCLUSIONS: Gestational SS-induced BPD is potentially regulated by nAChRs and associated with downregulation of HIF-1alpha, increased apoptosis of epithelial cells, and increased alveolar volumes. Thus, in mice, exposure to sidestream tobacco smoke during pregnancy promotes BPD-like condition that is potentially mediated through the nAChR/HIF-1alpha pathway.","group":"g1","id":"5ba72b05-f49f-4aab-b782-702c4024af8d","_showDetails":true},"230a537b-8118-4a0a-825f-727992d4a922":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Antenatal endotoxin disrupts lung vitamin D receptor and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1alpha-hydroxylase expression in the developing rat.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00253.2015","authors":["Mandell, Erica","Seedorf, Gregory J","Ryan, Sharon","Gien, Jason","Cramer, Scott D","Abman, Steven H"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150904//","keywords":["*25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/bi [Biosynthesis]","Animals","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ci [Chemically Induced]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/em [Embryology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Calcifediol/me [Metabolism]","*Endothelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Endothelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","*Endotoxins/to [Toxicity]","*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/de [Drug Effects]","*Lung/em [Embryology]","Lung/pa [Pathology]","Pulmonary Artery/em [Embryology]","Pulmonary Artery/pa [Pathology]","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","*Receptors, Calcitriol/bi [Biosynthesis]","Sheep","Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase/bi [Biosynthesis]"],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

However, little is known about lung-specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation during development, especially regarding maturational changes in lung-specific expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), 1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-OHase), and CYP24A1 during late gestation and the effects of antenatal ETX exposure on 1,25-(OH)2D3 metabolism in the lung. We hypothesized that vit D regulatory proteins undergo maturation regulation in the late fetal and early neonatal lung and that prenatal exposure to ETX impairs lung growth partly through abnormal endogenous vit D metabolism. Normal fetal rat lungs were harvested between embryonic day 15 and postnatal day 14. Lung homogenates were assayed for VDR, 1alpha-OHase, and CYP24A1 protein contents by Western blot analysis. Fetal rats were injected on embryonic day 20 with intra-amniotic ETX, ETX + 1,25-(OH)2D3, or saline and delivered 2 days later. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) from fetal sheep were assessed for VDR, 1alpha-OHase, and CYP24A1 expression after treatment with 25-(OH)D3, 1,25-(OH)2D3, ETX, ETX + 25-(OH)D3, or ETX + 1,25-(OH)2D3. We found that lung VDR, 1alpha-OHase, and CYP2741 protein expression dramatically increase immediately before birth (P < 0.01 vs. early fetal values). Antenatal ETX increases CYP24A1 expression (P < 0.05) and decreases VDR and 1alpha-OHase expression at birth (P < 0.001), but these changes are prevented with concurrent vit D treatment (P < 0.001). ETX-induced reduction of fetal PAEC growth and tube formation and lung 1alpha-OHase expression are prevented by vit D treatment (P < 0.001). We conclude that lung VDR, 1alpha-OHase, and CYP24A1 protein content markedly increase before birth and that antenatal ETX disrupts lung vit D metabolism through downregulation of VDR and increased vit D catabolic enzyme expression, including changes in developing endothelium. We speculate that endogenous vitamin D metabolism modulates normal fetal lung development and that prenatal disruption of vit D signaling may contribute to impaired postnatal lung growth at least partly through altered angiogenic signaling.

Although evidence initially highlighted roles for fibroblasts in the production and remodeling of the lung extracellular matrix, more recent studies have described the presence of different fibroblast subsets in the developing lung. These subsets include myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts and their precursors. These cells are believed to play different roles in alveologenesis and are localized to different regions of the developing septa. The precise roles played by these different fibroblast subsets remain unclear. Understanding the signaling pathways that control the discrete functions of these fibroblast subsets would help to clarify the roles and the regulation of lung fibroblasts during lung development. Here, we critically evaluate a recent report that described divergent fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways in two different subsets of lung fibroblasts that express different levels of green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha promoter. The GFP expression was used as a surrogate for lipofibroblasts (GFP(low)) and myofibroblasts (GFP(high)). It was suggested that Fgf10/Fgf1 and Fgf18/Fgfr3 autocrine pathways may be operative in GFP(low) and GFP(high) cells, respectively, and that these pathways might regulate the proliferation and migration of different fibroblast subsets during alveologenesis. These observations lay important groundwork for the further exploration of FGF function during normal lung development, as well as in aberrant lung development associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Animal models may help in understanding the molecular processes involved in this condition and define therapeutic targets. Our goal was to identify molecular pathways using the earlier described preterm rabbit model of hyperoxia induced lung-injury. Transcriptome analysis by mRNA-sequencing was performed on lungs from preterm rabbit pups born at day 28 of gestation (term: 31 days) and kept in hyperoxia (95% O2) for 7 days. Controls were preterm pups kept in normoxia. Transcriptomic data were analyzed using Array Studio and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), in order to identify the central molecules responsible for the observed transcriptional changes. We detected 2217 significantly dysregulated transcripts following hyperoxia, of which 90% could be identified. Major pathophysiological dysregulations were found in inflammation, lung development, vascular development and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. To conclude, amongst the many dysregulated transcripts, major changes were found in the inflammatory, oxidative stress and lung developmental pathways. This information may be used for the generation of new treatment hypotheses for hyperoxia-induced lung injury and BPD.","group":"g3","id":"f1360d93-9f90-4f27-8a94-a6a9876601b2","_showDetails":true},"6d61ee5c-ec25-459b-a163-b098d454a693":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2015>","title":"Genetic Contributions to the Development of Complications in Preterm Newborns.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131741","authors":["Poggi, Chiara","Giusti, Betti","Gozzini, Elena","Sereni, Alice","Romagnuolo, Ilaria","Kura, Ada","Pasquini, Elisabetta","Abbate, Rosanna","Dani, Carlo"],"date":"2015//","accessDate":"20150714//","keywords":["Angiotensinogen/ge [Genetics]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","Cohort Studies","Female","Gene Frequency","Genotype","Heme Oxygenase-1/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Intracranial Hemorrhages/co [Complications]","Male","Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/ge [Genetics]","Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/ge [Genetics]","*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","Pregnancy","Premature Birth/en [Enzymology]","*Premature Birth/ge [Genetics]","Premature Birth/th [Therapy]","Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1/ge [Genetics]","Respiration, Artificial","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/co [Complications]","Retinopathy of Prematurity/co [Complications]","Retrospective Studies","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"10","number":"7","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med12&NEWS=N&AN=26172140"],"address":"United States","abstract":"AIM: We aimed to identify specific polymorphisms of genes encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), renin-angiotensin system (angiotensinogen gene [AGT], angiotensinogen type 1 receptor [AGTR1], angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]), and heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) in a cohort of preterm infants and correlate their presence with the development of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) requiring mechanical ventilation (MV), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)., STUDY DESIGN: We carried out a retrospective study to evaluate the allele frequency and genotype distribution of polymorphisms of VEGFA, eNOS, AGT, AGTR1, ACE, and HMOX-1 in a population of preterm neonates (n=342) with a gestational age <=28 weeks according to the presence or absence of RDS requiring MV, BPD, IVH, or ROP. Moreover, we evaluated through the haplotype reconstruction analysis whether combinations of the selected polymorphisms are related to the occurrence of RDS, BPD, IVH and ROP., RESULTS: In our population 157 infants developed RDS requiring MV, 71 BPD, 70 IVH, and 43 ROP. We found that TC+CC rs2070744 eNOS (41.7 vs. 25.4%, p=0.01) and GT+TT rs1799983 eNOS (51.8 vs. 35.2%, p=0.01) polymorphisms are independent risk factors for BPD.

We sought to determine the role of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) in a hyperoxia-induced neonatal mouse model of PH and RVH. After birth, C57BL/6 mice were placed in room air (RA) or 75% O2 (CH) for 14 days to induce PH and RVH. Mice were euthanized at 14 days or recovered in RA for 14 days or 42 days prior to euthanasia at 28 or 56 days of age. Some pups received sildenafil or vehicle (3 mg.kg(-1). dose(-1) sc) every other day from P0. RVH was assessed by Fulton's index [RV wt/(LV + septum) wt]. PDE5 protein expression was analyzed via Western blot, PDE5 activity was measured by commercially available assay, and cGMP was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Hyperoxia induced RVH in mice after 14 days, and RVH did not resolve until 56 days of age. Hyperoxia increased PDE5 expression and activity in RV, but not LV + S, after 14 days. PDE5 expression normalized by 28 days of age, but PDE5 activity did not normalize until 56 days of age. Sildenafil given during hyperoxia prevented RVH, decreased RV PDE5 activity, and increased RV cGMP levels. Mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of PDE5 had increased RVH in RA. These findings suggest normal RV PDE5 function is disrupted by hyperoxia, and elevated PDE5 contributes to RVH and remodeling. Therefore, in addition to impacting the pulmonary vasculature, sildenafil also targets PDE5 in the neonatal mouse RV and decreases RVH.

A key step in ECM maturation is cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which imparts stability and functionality to the ECM. During aberrant late lung development in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) patients and animal models of BPD, alveolarization is blocked, and the function of ECM cross-linking enzymes is deregulated, suggesting that perturbed ECM cross-linking may impact alveolarization. In a hyperoxia (85% O2)-based mouse model of BPD, blunted alveolarization was accompanied by alterations to lung collagen and elastin levels and cross-linking. Total collagen levels were increased (by 63%). The abundance of dihydroxylysinonorleucine collagen cross-links and the dihydroxylysinonorleucine-to-hydroxylysinonorleucine ratio were increased by 11 and 18%, respectively, suggestive of a profibrotic state. In contrast, insoluble elastin levels and the abundance of the elastin cross-links desmosine and isodesmosine in insoluble elastin were decreased by 35, 30, and 21%, respectively. The lung collagen-to-elastin ratio was threefold increased. Treatment of hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice with the lysyl oxidase inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile partially restored normal collagen levels, normalized the dihydroxylysinonorleucine-to-hydroxylysinonorleucine ratio, partially normalized desmosine and isodesmosine cross-links in insoluble elastin, and partially restored elastin foci structure in the developing septa. However, beta-aminopropionitrile administration concomitant with hyperoxia exposure did not improve alveolarization, evident from unchanged alveolar surface area and alveoli number, and worsened septal thickening (increased by 12%). These data demonstrate that collagen and elastin cross-linking are perturbed during the arrested alveolarization of developing mouse lungs exposed to hyperoxia.

First, pups were ventilated for 8 h with low (LVT: 3.5 ml/kg), moderate (MVT: 8.5 ml/kg), or high (HVT: 25 ml/kg) tidal volumes. LVT and MVT decreased Tnc expression, whereas HVT increased expression of all three elastogenic genes and Tnc. PDGF alpha-receptor mRNA was increased in all ventilation groups, while Pdgfb expression was decreased after MVT and HVT ventilation. Only HVT ventilation upregulated Vegf expression. Independent of VT, ventilation upregulated Vegfr1 expression, while MVT and HVT downregulated Vegfr2 expression. Next, we evaluated duration (0-24 h) of MVT ventilation on gene expression. Although expression of all elastogenic genes peaked at 12 h of ventilation, only Fbln5 was negatively affected at 24 h. Tnc expression decreased with duration of ventilation. Changes in expression of Pdgfr and Vegfr were maximal at 8 h of ventilation. Disturbed elastin fiber deposition and decrease in small vessel density was only observed after 24 h. Thus, an imbalance between Fbln5 and Eln expression may trigger dysregulated elastin fiber deposition during the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, ventilation-induced alterations in Pdgf and Vegf receptor expression are tidal volume dependent and may affect pulmonary vessel formation.

Genome-wide association and gene set analysis was performed for BPD or death, severe BPD or death, and severe BPD in survivors. Specific targets were validated via the use of gene expression in BPD lung tissue and in mouse models., RESULTS: Of 751 infants analyzed, 428 developed BPD or died. No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance (P < 10(-8)), although multiple SNPs in adenosine deaminase, CD44, and other genes were just below P < 10(-6). Of approximately 8000 pathways, 75 were significant at false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1 and P < .001 for BPD/death, 95 for severe BPD/death, and 90 for severe BPD in survivors. The pathway with lowest FDR was miR-219 targets (P = 1.41E-08, FDR 9.5E-05) for BPD/death and phosphorous oxygen lyase activity (includes adenylate and guanylate cyclases) for both severe BPD/death (P = 5.68E-08, FDR 0.00019) and severe BPD in survivors (P = 3.91E-08, FDR 0.00013).

Specimens were imaged using HP 3He diffusion MRI to generate apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) as biomarkers of alveolar airspace size, with comparison to mean linear intercept (Lm) via quantitative histology., RESULTS: Mean ADC and Lm were significantly increased throughout the diseased specimen (ADC = 0.26 +/- 0.06 cm2/s, Lm = 587 +/- 212 microm) compared with healthy specimens (ADC = 0.14 +/- 0.03 cm2/s, Lm = 133 +/- 37 microm; p < 1 x 10-7); increased values reflect enlarged airspaces.

The 77-amino acid isoform of interleukin-8 (interleukin-877) is a less potent chemoattractant than other shorter isoforms. Although interleukin-877 is abundant in the preterm circulation, its regulation in the preterm lung is unknown., OBJECTIVES: To study expression and processing of pulmonary interleukin-877 in preterm infants who did and did not develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: Total interleukin-8 and interleukin-877 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from preterm infants by immunoassay. Neutrophil serine proteases were used to assess processing. Neutrophil chemotaxis assays and degranulation of neutrophil matrix metalloproteinase-9 were used to assess interleukin-8 function., MAIN RESULTS: Peak total interleukin-8 and interleukin-877 concentrations were increased in infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared to those who did not. Shorter forms of interleukin-8 predominated in the preterm lung (96.3% No-bronchopulmonary dysplasia vs 97.1% bronchopulmonary dysplasia, p>0.05). Preterm bronchoalveolar lavage fluid significantly converted exogenously added interleukin-877 to shorter isoforms (p<0.001). Conversion was greater in bronchopulmonary dysplasia infants (p<0.05). This conversion was inhibited by alpha-1 antitrypsin and antithrombin III (p<0.01). Purified neutrophil serine proteases efficiently converted interleukin-877 to shorter isoforms in a time- and dose-dependent fashion; shorter interleukin-8 isoforms were primarily responsible for neutrophil chemotaxis (p<0.001). Conversion by proteinase-3 resulted in significantly increased interleukin-8 activity in vitro (p<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Shorter, potent, isoforms interleukin-8 predominate in the preterm lung, and are increased in infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, due to conversion of interleukin-877 by neutrophil serine proteases and thrombin. Processing of interleukin-8 provides an attractive therapeutic target to prevent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","group":"g1","id":"6f508500-38b8-4dc6-9065-2fd89b4cac5f","_showDetails":true},"bced7066-c40c-4eb4-9d1e-b6fd7086959a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Lipopolysaccharide induces up-regulation of TGF-alpha through HDAC2 in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091083","authors":["Ni, Wensi","Lin, Ning","He, Hua","Zhu, Jianxing","Zhang, Yongjun"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140304//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/im [Immunology]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Cell Line","Down-Regulation","Female","Histone Deacetylase 1/ge [Genetics]","Histone Deacetylase 1/im [Immunology]","*Histone Deacetylase 2/ge [Genetics]","Histone Deacetylase 2/im [Immunology]","Humans","Lipopolysaccharides/ad [Administration & Dosage]","*Lipopolysaccharides/im [Immunology]","Lung/im [Immunology]","Lung/me [Metabolism]","*Lung/pa [Pathology]","Rats","*Transforming Growth Factor alpha/ge [Genetics]","Transforming Growth Factor alpha/im [Immunology]","*Up-Regulation"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"9","number":"3","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24595367"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolar simplification with decreased alveolar number and increased airspace. Previous studies suggested that transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) may contribute to arrested alveolar development in BPD. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) control cellular signaling and gene expression. HDAC2 is crucial for suppression of inflammatory gene expression. Here we investigated whether HDAC2 was involved in the arrest of alveolarization, as well as the ability of HDAC2 to regulate TGF-alpha expression in a rat model of BPD induced by intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results showed that LPS exposure led to a suppression of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression and activity, induced TGF-alpha expression, and disrupted alveolar morphology. Mechanistic studies showed that overexpression of HDAC2, but not HDAC1, suppressed LPS-induced TGF-alpha expression. Moreover, the HDAC inhibitor TSA or downregulation of HDAC2 by siRNA both significantly increased TGF-alpha expression in cultured myofibroblasts. Finally, preservation of HDAC activity by theophylline treatment improved alveolar development and attenuated TGF-alpha release. Together, these findings indicate that attenuation of TGF-alpha-mediated effects in the lung by enhancing HDAC2 may have a therapeutic effect on treating BPD.","group":"g1","id":"bced7066-c40c-4eb4-9d1e-b6fd7086959a","_showDetails":true},"aef8e258-6711-4fb2-9cf8-d5ab13b4f542":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Neonatal physiological correlates of near-term brain development on MRI and DTI in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2014.05.013","authors":["Rose, Jessica","Vassar, Rachel","Cahill-Rowley, Katelyn","Stecher Guzman, Ximena","Hintz, Susan R","Stevenson, David K","Barnea-Goraly, Naama"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140602//","keywords":["Brain/gd [Growth & Development]","*Brain/pa [Pathology]","Cross-Sectional Studies","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Female","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","*Infant, Very Low Birth Weight/ph [Physiology]","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male"],"journal":"NeuroImage.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between neonatal physiological risk factors and early brain structure in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants using structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at near-term age. Structural brain MRI, diffusion-weighted scans, and neonatal physiological risk factors were analyzed in a cross-sectional sample of 102 VLBW preterm infants (BW <= 1500 g, gestational age (GA) <= 32 weeks), who were admitted to the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford NICU and recruited to participate prior to routine near-term brain MRI conducted at 36.6 +/- 1.8 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) from 2010 to 2011; 66/102 also underwent a diffusion-weighted scan. Brain abnormalities were assessed qualitatively on structural MRI, and white matter (WM) microstructure was analyzed quantitatively on DTI in six subcortical regions defined by DiffeoMap neonatal brain atlas. Specific regions of interest included the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, the thalamus, and the globus pallidus. Regional fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated using DTI data and examined in relation to neonatal physiological risk factors including gestational age (GA), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and sepsis, as well as serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, albumin, and total bilirubin. Brain abnormalities were observed on structural MRI in 38/102 infants including 35% of females and 40% of males. Infants with brain abnormalities observed on MRI had higher incidence of BPD (42% vs. 25%) and sepsis (21% vs. 6%) and higher mean and peak serum CRP levels, respectively, (0.64 vs. 0.34 mg/dL, p = .008; 1.57 vs. 0.67 mg/dL, p= .006) compared to those without. The number of signal abnormalities observed on structural MRI correlated to mean and peak CRP (rho = .316, p = .002; rho = .318, p= .002). The number of signal abnormalities observed on MRI correlated with thalamus MD (left: r= .382, p= .002; right: r= .400, p= .001), controlling for PMA-at-scan. Thalamus WM microstructure demonstrated the strongest associations with neonatal risk factors. Higher thalamus MD on the left and right, respectively, was associated with lower GA (r = -.322, p = .009; r= -.381, p= .002), lower mean albumin (r = -.276, p= .029; r= -.385, p= .002), and lower mean bilirubin (r = -.293, p= .020; r= -.337 p= .007). Results suggest that at near-term age, thalamus WM microstructure may be particularly vulnerable to certain neonatal risk factors. Interactions between albumin, bilirubin, phototherapy, and brain development warrant further investigation. Identification of physiological risk factors associated with selective vulnerability of certain brain regions at near-term age may clarify the etiology of neurodevelopmental impairment and inform neuroprotective treatment for VLBW preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"aef8e258-6711-4fb2-9cf8-d5ab13b4f542","_showDetails":true},"caa00a1b-e874-4293-b445-2268b2c32f7a":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Filamin A mutation may be associated with diffuse lung disease mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature newborns.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02847","authors":["Lord, Amanda","Shapiro, Adam J","Saint-Martin, Christine","Claveau, Martine","Melancon, Serge","Wintermark, Pia"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140722//","keywords":["*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","DNA Mutational Analysis","Diagnosis, Differential","Female","*Filamins/ge [Genetics]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","*Infant, Premature","Infant, Premature, Diseases/di [Diagnosis]","*Infant, Premature, Diseases/ge [Genetics]","Infant, Premature, Diseases/me [Metabolism]","Lung Diseases/di [Diagnosis]","*Lung Diseases/ge [Genetics]","Lung Diseases/me [Metabolism]","Mutation"],"journal":"Respiratory care","volume":"59","number":"11","isbn":"0020-1324","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=25053830"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common long-term complication in premature newborns requiring ventilatory support and is the most common cause of chronic diffuse lung disease in this population.

DNA was isolated from blood leucocytes and assayed for 17 SNPs in l-arginine/nitric oxide pathway genes by Sequenom massarray. Genes included carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthase, nitric oxide synthase and arginase.

Changes in PDGF receptor (PDGFR) expression in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease of hypoalveolarization, have not been examined. We hypothesized that PDGFR expression is reduced in neonatal lung mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from infants who develop BPD. MSCs from tracheal aspirates of premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation in the first week of life were studied. MSC migration was assessed in a Boyden chamber. Human lung tissue was obtained from the University of Rochester Neonatal Lung Biorepository. Neonatal mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 days. PDGFR expression was quantified by qPCR, immunoblotting, and stereology. MSCs were isolated from 25 neonates (mean gestational age 27.7 wk); 13 developed BPD and 12 did not. MSCs from infants who develop BPD showed lower PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta mRNA and protein expression and decreased migration to PDGF isoforms. Lungs from infants dying with BPD show thickened alveolar walls and paucity of PDGFR-alpha-positive cells in the dysmorphic alveolar septa. Similarly, lungs from hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice showed lower expression of PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta, with significant reductions in the volume of PDGFR-alpha-positive alveolar tips. In conclusion, MSCs from infants who develop BPD hold stable alterations in PDGFR gene expression that favor hypoalveolarization.

DHA and AA are precursors to downstream metabolites that terminate the inflammatory response. We hypothesized that treatment with Resolvin D1 and/or Lipoxin A4 would prevent lung injury in a murine model of BPD., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of Resolvin D1 and/or Lipoxin A4 on hyperoxia-induced lung injury., METHODS: C57/BL6 pups were randomized at birth to Room Air, Hyperoxia (>90% oxygen), Hyperoxia + Resolvin D1, Hyperoxia + Lipoxin A4, or Hyperoxia + Resolvin D1/Lipoxin A4. Resolvin D1 and/or Lipoxin A4 (2 ng/g) were given IP on days 0, 3, 6, and 9. On day 10, mice were sacrificed and lungs collected for morphometric analyses including Mean Linear Intercept (MLI), Radial Alveolar Count (RAC), and Septal Thickness (ST); RT-PCR analyses of biomarkers of lung development and inflammation; and ELISA for TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2., RESULT: The increased ST observed with hyperoxia exposure was normalized by both Resolvin D1 and Lipoxin A4; while, hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification was attenuated by Lipoxin A4. Relative to hyperoxia, Resolvin D1 reduced the gene expression of CXCL2 (2.9 fold), TIMP1 (6.7 fold), and PPARgamma (4.8 fold). Treatment with Lipoxin A4 also led to a reduction of CXCL2 (2.4 fold) while selectively increasing TGFbeta2 (2.1 fold) and Smad3 (1.58 fold)., CONCLUSION: The histologic and biochemical changes seen in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in this murine model can be reversed by the addition of DHA and AA fatty acid downstream metabolites that terminate the inflammatory pathways and modulate growth factors. These fatty acids or their metabolites may be novel therapies to prevent or treat lung injury in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"974de7dd-ff97-4129-ad77-9bcd47d6f9a7","_showDetails":true},"98ec34b7-20f0-418a-8853-d82dcccaa0ee":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Finding novel molecular connections between developmental processes and disease.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003578","authors":["Park, Jisoo","Wick, Heather C","Kee, Daniel E","Noto, Keith","Maron, Jill L","Slonim, Donna K"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140529//","keywords":["Animals","*Chromosome Mapping/mt [Methods]","Computer Simulation","*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/ge [Genetics]","Genetic Markers/ge [Genetics]","*Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ge [Genetics]","*Genome-Wide Association Study/mt [Methods]","Humans","*Models, Genetic","*Proteome/ge [Genetics]"],"journal":"PLoS computational biology","volume":"10","number":"5","isbn":"1553-734X","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24874013"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Identifying molecular connections between developmental processes and disease can lead to new hypotheses about health risks at all stages of life. Here we introduce a new approach to identifying significant connections between gene sets and disease genes, and apply it to several gene sets related to human development. To overcome the limits of incomplete and imperfect information linking genes to disease, we pool genes within disease subtrees in the MeSH taxonomy, and we demonstrate that such pooling improves the power and accuracy of our approach. Significance is assessed through permutation. We created a web-based visualization tool to facilitate multi-scale exploration of this large collection of significant connections (http://gda.cs.tufts.edu/development). High-level analysis of the results reveals expected connections between tissue-specific developmental processes and diseases linked to those tissues, and widespread connections to developmental disorders and cancers. Yet interesting new hypotheses may be derived from examining the unexpected connections. We highlight and discuss the implications of three such connections, linking dementia with bone development, polycystic ovary syndrome with cardiovascular development, and retinopathy of prematurity with lung development. Our results provide additional evidence that TGFB lays a key role in the early pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome. Our evidence also suggests that the VEGF pathway and downstream NFKB signaling may explain the complex relationship between bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity, and may form a bridge between two currently-competing hypotheses about the molecular origins of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

However, caffeine mediated effects on airway remodelling are still undefined. The TGF-beta/Smad signalling pathway is one of the key pathways involved in airway remodelling. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a downstream mediator of TGF-beta, and transgelin, a binding and stabilising protein of the cytoskeleton, are both regulated by TGF-beta1 and play an important role in airway remodelling. Both have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether caffeine, an unspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, and rolipram, a prototypical PDE-4 selective inhibitor, were both able to affect TGF-beta1-induced Smad signalling and CTGF/transgelin expression in lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, the effect of transgelin knock-down on Smad signalling was studied. The pharmacological effect of caffeine and rolipram on Smad signalling was investigated by means of a luciferase assay via transfection of a TGF-beta1-inducible reporter plasmid in A549 cells. The regulation of CTGF and transgelin expression by caffeine and rolipram were studied by promoter analysis, real-time PCR and Western blot. Endogenous transgelin expression was down-regulated by lentiviral transduction mediating transgelin-specific shRNA expression. The addition of caffeine and rolipram inhibited TGF-beta1 induced reporter gene activity in a concentration-related manner. They also antagonized the TGF-beta1 induced up-regulation of CTGF and transgelin on the promoter-, the mRNA-, and the protein-level. Functional analysis showed that transgelin silencing reduced TGF-beta1 induced Smad-signalling and CTGF induction in lung epithelial cells. The present study highlights possible new molecular mechanisms of caffeine and rolipram including an inhibition of Smad signalling and of TGF-beta1 regulated genes involved in airway remodelling. An understanding of these mechanisms might help to explain the protective effects of caffeine in prevention of BPD and suggests rolipram to be a potent replacement for caffeine.","group":"g4","id":"8a77d0d3-b5b6-4c60-8ae0-99908654353d","_showDetails":true},"38f09934-6fb5-4342-be44-d16e306b60d4":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2020>","title":"Hyperoxia exposure arrests alveolarization in neonatal rats via PTEN-induced putative kinase 1-Parkin and Nip3-like protein X-mediated mitophagy disorders.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2020.4766","authors":["Yu, Xuefei","Sun, Yanli","Cai, Qing","Zhao, Xinyi","Liu, Ziyun","Xue, Xindong","Fu, Jianhua"],"date":"2020//","accessDate":"20201022//","keywords":["Alveolar Epithelial Cells/me [Metabolism]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/pa [Pathology]","Alveolar Epithelial Cells/ul [Ultrastructure]","Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/co [Complications]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pa [Pathology]","Disease Models, Animal","Female","Hyperoxia/co [Complications]","*Hyperoxia/me [Metabolism]","Hyperoxia/pa [Pathology]","Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial","*Membrane Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Mitochondria/pa [Pathology]","Mitochondria/ul [Ultrastructure]","*Mitophagy","*Protein Kinases/me [Metabolism]","*Proto-Oncogene Proteins/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/pa [Pathology]","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"International journal of molecular medicine","volume":"46","number":"6","isbn":"1107-3756","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med18&NEWS=N&AN=33125104"],"address":"Greece","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also known as chronic lung disease, is one of the most common respiratory diseases in premature new-born humans. Mitochondria are not only the main source of reactive oxygen species but are also critical for the maintenance of homeostasis and a wide range of biological activities, such as producing energy, buffering cytosolic calcium and regulating signal transduction. However, as a critical quality control method for mitochondria, little is known about the role of mitophagy in BPD. The present study assessed mitochondrial function in hyperoxia-exposed alveolar type II (AT-II) cells of rats during lung development. New-born Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into hyperoxia (85% oxygen) and control (21% oxygen) groups. Histopathological and morphological properties of the lung tissues were assessed at postnatal days 1, 3, 7 and 14. Ultrastructural mitochondrial alteration was observed using transmission electron microscopy and the expression of the mitophagy proteins putative kinase (PINK)1, Parkin and Nip3-like protein X (NIX) in the lung tissues was evaluated using western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining was used to determine the co-localisation of PINK1 and Parkin. Real-time analyses of extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate were performed using primary AT-II cells to evaluate metabolic changes. Mitochondria in hyperoxia-exposed rat AT-II cells began to show abnormal morphological and physiological features. These changes were accompanied by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased expression levels of PINK1-Parkin and NIX. Increased binding between a mitochondria marker (cytochrome C oxidase subunit IV isoform I) and an autophagy marker (microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3B) was observed in primary AT-II cells and was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial metabolic capacity in model rats. Thus, mitophagy mediated by PINK1, Parkin and NIX in AT-II cells occurred in hyperoxia-exposed new-born rats. These findings suggested that the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of BPD and result in attenuated alveolar development.","group":"g3","id":"38f09934-6fb5-4342-be44-d16e306b60d4","_showDetails":true},"b212986a-a673-4b08-b9d0-2b0616475845":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Ventilation-induced increases in EGFR ligand mRNA are not altered by intra-amniotic LPS or ureaplasma in preterm lambs.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096087","authors":["Hillman, Noah H","Gisslen, Tate","Polglase, Graeme R","Kallapur, Suhas G","Jobe, Alan H"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140430//","keywords":["*Amnion/me [Metabolism]","Animals","*Animals, Newborn","*ErbB Receptors/me [Metabolism]","Female","In Situ Hybridization","Ligands","*Lipopolysaccharides/me [Metabolism]","*Obstetric Labor, Premature","Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/ge [Genetics]","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Pregnancy","*RNA, Messenger/me [Metabolism]","*Respiration, Artificial","Sheep","*Ureaplasma/ip [Isolation & Purification]"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"9","number":"4","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24788984"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Chorioamnionitis and mechanical ventilation are associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Mechanical ventilation at birth activates both inflammatory and acute phase responses. These responses can be partially modulated by previous exposure to intra-amniotic (IA) LPS or Ureaplasma parvum (UP). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands participate in lung development, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 1 and ACE2 contribute to lung inflammation. We asked whether brief mechanical ventilation at birth altered EGFR and ACE pathways and if antenatal exposure to IA LPS or UP could modulate these effects. Ewes were exposed to IA injections of UP, LPS or saline multiple days prior to preterm delivery at 85% gestation. Lambs were either immediately euthanized or mechanically ventilated for 2 to 3 hr. IA UP and LPS cause modest changes in the EGFR ligands amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), and betacellulin (BTC) mRNA expression. Mechanical ventilation greatly increased mRNA expression of AREG, EREG, and HB-EGF, with no additional increases resulting from IA LPS or UP. With ventilation AREG and EREG mRNA localized to cells in terminal airspace. EGFR mRNA also increased with mechanical ventilation. IA UP and LPS decreased ACE1 mRNA and increased ACE2 mRNA, resulting in a 4 fold change in the ACE1/ACE2 ratio. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volumes increased both ACE1 and ACE2 expression. The alterations seen in ACE with IA exposures and EGFR pathways with mechanical ventilation may contribute to the development of BPD in preterm infants.","group":"g1","id":"b212986a-a673-4b08-b9d0-2b0616475845","_showDetails":true},"7aa03320-f734-43a2-bac6-ae28dcf427d6":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Comparative analyses of lung transcriptomes in patients with alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins and in foxf1 heterozygous knockout mice.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094390","authors":["Sen, Partha","Dharmadhikari, Avinash V","Majewski, Tadeusz","Mohammad, Mahmoud A","Kalin, Tanya V","Zabielska, Joanna","Ren, Xiaomeng","Bray, Molly","Brown, Hannah M","Welty, Stephen","Thevananther, Sundararajah","Langston, Claire","Szafranski, Przemyslaw","Justice, Monica J","Kalinichenko, Vladimir V","Gambin, Anna","Belmont, John","Stankiewicz, Pawel"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140410//","keywords":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Female","Forkhead Transcription Factors/df [Deficiency]","*Forkhead Transcription Factors/ge [Genetics]","Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Expression Regulation","*Genes, Lethal","Heterozygote","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Lung/ab [Abnormalities]","Lung/bs [Blood Supply]","*Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","Metabolic Networks and Pathways","Mice","Mice, Knockout","*Persistent Fetal Circulation Syndrome/ge [Genetics]","Persistent Fetal Circulation Syndrome/me [Metabolism]","*Pulmonary Alveoli/ab [Abnormalities]","Pulmonary Alveoli/bs [Blood Supply]","Pulmonary Alveoli/me [Metabolism]","Pulmonary Veins/ab [Abnormalities]","*Pulmonary Veins/me [Metabolism]","*Transcriptome"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"9","number":"4","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24722050"],"address":"United States","abstract":"Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV) is a developmental disorder of the lungs, primarily affecting their vasculature.

The majority of mice with heterozygous loss-of-function of Foxf1 exhibit neonatal lethality with evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage in some of them. By comparing transcriptomes of human ACDMPV lungs with control lungs using expression arrays, we found that several genes and pathways involved in lung development, angiogenesis, and in pulmonary hypertension development, were deregulated.

Three-day-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to air or hyperoxia (FiO2, 75%) in the presence or absence of inhaled CO (250 ppm for 1 h twice daily) for 21 days.

Conversely, HO-1-null mice showed exaggerated hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization. CO also inhibited hyperoxia-induced pulmonary accumulation of F4/80+, CD11c+, and CD11b+ monocytes and Gr-1+ neutrophils. Furthermore, CO attenuated lung mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including the monocyte chemoattractant CCL2 in vivo, and decreased hyperoxia-induced type I alveolar epithelial cell CCL2 production in vitro. Hyperoxia-exposed CCL2-null mice, like CO-treated mice, showed attenuated alveolar simplification and lung infiltration of CD11b+ monocytes, consistent with the notion that CO blocks lung epithelial cell cytokine production.

Systemic application of H2S via the slow-release H2S donor GYY4137 for 10 days resulted in pronounced improvement in lung alveolarization in pups breathing 85% O2, compared with vehicle-treated littermates. Although without impact on lung oxidative status, systemic H2S blunted leukocyte infiltration into alveolar air spaces provoked by hyperoxia, and restored normal lung interleukin 10 levels that were otherwise depressed by 85% O2. Treatment of primary mouse alveolar type II (ATII) cells with the rapid-release H2S donor NaHS had no impact on cell viability; however, NaHS promoted ATII cell migration. Although exposure of ATII cells to 85% O2 caused dramatic changes in mRNA expression, exposure to either GYY4137 or NaHS had no impact on ATII cell mRNA expression, as assessed by microarray, suggesting that the effects observed were independent of changes in gene expression. The impact of NaHS on ATII cell migration was attenuated by glibenclamide, implicating ion channels, and was accompanied by activation of Akt, hinting at two possible mechanisms of H2S action. These data support further investigation of H2S as a candidate interventional strategy to limit the arrested alveolarization associated with BPD.","group":"g3","id":"a5693883-00ea-46a5-b1e8-a468c2e5c30b","_showDetails":true},"add433af-6383-4e8d-a86a-ed5607b00cb7":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2014>","title":"Mesenchymal stem cells for bronchopulmonary dysplasia: phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.12.011","authors":["Chang, Yun Sil","Ahn, So Yoon","Yoo, Hye Soo","Sung, Se In","Choi, Soo Jin","Oh, Won Il","Park, Won Soon"],"date":"2014//","accessDate":"20140206//","notes":"Comment in (CIN)","keywords":["Biomarkers/me [Metabolism]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis]","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/pc [Prevention & Control]","Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mt [Methods]","Cytokines/me [Metabolism]","Feasibility Studies","Female","Hepatocyte Growth Factor/me [Metabolism]","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Infant, Premature","Logistic Models","Male","Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/ae [Adverse Effects]","*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/mt [Methods]","Severity of Illness Index","Trachea/me [Metabolism]","Trachea/su [Surgery]","Transplantation, Homologous/ae [Adverse Effects]","Transplantation, Homologous/mt [Methods]","Treatment Outcome","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/me [Metabolism]"],"journal":"The Journal of pediatrics","volume":"164","number":"5","isbn":"0022-3476","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med11&NEWS=N&AN=24508444"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and feasibility of allogeneic human umbilical cord blood (hUCB)-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in preterm infants., STUDY DESIGN: In a phase I dose-escalation trial, we assessed the safety and feasibility of a single, intratracheal transplantation of hUCB-derived MSCs in preterm infants at high risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The first 3 patients were given a low dose (1 x 10(7) cells/kg) of cells, and the next 6 patients were given a high dose (2 x 10(7) cells/kg). We compared their adverse outcomes, including BPD severity, with those of historical case-matched comparison group., RESULTS: Intratracheal MSC transplantation was performed in 9 preterm infants, with a mean gestational age of 25.3 +/- 0.9 weeks and a mean birth weight of 793 +/- 127 g, at a mean of 10.4 +/- 2.6 days after birth. The treatments were well tolerated, without serious adverse effects or dose-limiting toxicity attributable to the transplantation. Levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, matrix metalloproteinase-9, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and transforming growth factor beta1 in tracheal aspirates at day 7 were significantly reduced compared with those at baseline or at day 3 posttransplantation. BPD severity was lower in the transplant recipients, and rates of other adverse outcomes did not differ between the comparison group and transplant recipients., CONCLUSION: Intratracheal transplantation of allogeneic hUCB-derived MSCs in preterm infants is safe and feasible, and warrants a larger and controlled phase II study.

The p66(Shc) isoform antagonizes proliferation, regulates oxidative stress, and mediates apoptosis. It is highly expressed in the canalicular but not the later stages of mouse lung development, and its expression persists in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic disease associated with premature birth. These observations suggest that p66(Shc) has a developmental function. However, constitutive p66(Shc) deletion yields no morphological phenotype, and the structure of the Shc gene precludes its inducible deletion. To elucidate its function in lung development, we transfected p66(Shc) or nonsilencing small-interfering RNA (siRNA) into the epithelia of embryonic day 11 mouse lungs that were then cultured for 3 days and analyzed morphometrically. To assess cellular proliferation and epithelial differentiation, lung explants were immunostained and immunoblotted for p66(Shc), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the proximal airway differentiation antigens Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10) and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1, and the alveolar surfactant proteins (SP)-A, -B, and -C. Explants transfected with nonsilencing siRNA demonstrated specific epithelial uptake and normal morphological development relative to uninjected controls. In contrast, transfection with p66(Shc) siRNA significantly increased lumenal cross-sectional areas, decreased branching, and increased epithelial proliferation (P < 0.05 for all). Relative to controls, the expression of SP-B, SP-C, CC10, and TTF-1 was decreased by p66(Shc) knockdown. SP-A was not expressed in either control or treated lungs.

All three enzymes were localized to the septal walls in developing mouse lungs, with Plod1 also expressed in the vessel walls of the developing lung and Plod3 expressed uniquely at the base of developing septa. The expression of plod1, plod2, and plod3 was upregulated in the lungs of mouse pups exposed to 85% O2, an experimental animal model of BPD. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta increased plod2 mRNA levels and activated the plod2 promoter in vitro in lung epithelial cells and in lung fibroblasts. Using in vivo neutralization of TGF-beta signaling in the experimental animal model of BPD, TGF-beta was identified as the regulator of aberrant plod2 expression. PLOD2 mRNA expression was also elevated in human neonates who died with BPD or at risk for BPD, compared with neonates matched for gestational age at birth or chronological age at death.

The objective of the current study was to determine the impact of maternal and fetal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key betamethasone pathways on respiratory outcomes that serve as markers for severity of disease., STUDY DESIGN: DNA was obtained from women who were given betamethasone and from their infants. Samples were genotyped for 73 exploratory drug metabolism and glucocorticoid pathway SNPs. Clinical variables and neonatal outcomes were obtained. Logistic regression analysis that controlled for relevant clinical variables to determine SNP impact on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the need for respiratory support, and surfactant therapy use was performed., RESULTS: Data from 109 women who delivered 117 infants were analyzed: 14.5% of the infants experienced BPD; 70.8% of the infants needed some respiratory support after birth, and 27.5% of the infants needed surfactant therapy. In a multivariable regression analysis, gestational age at delivery was associated with most neonatal respiratory outcomes (P <= .01), and chorioamnionitis was associated with BPD (P < .03). The following genotypes were associated with respiratory severity outcomes: BPD-fetal Importin 13 gene (IPO13; rs4448553; odds ratio [OR], 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-0.92); surfactant use-maternal IPO13 (rs2428953 and 2486014; OR, 13.8; 95% CI, 1.80-105.5; and OR, 35.5; 95% CI, 1.71-736.6, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Several discrete maternal and fetal SNPs in the IPO13 family may be associated with neonatal respiratory outcomes after maternal antenatal corticosteroid treatment for anticipated preterm birth.

This study aimed to estimate initial hospitalization charges after extremely preterm birth in China over the previous decade., METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in the largest tertiary neonatal intensive care unit in Shanghai, China, including 441 extremely preterm infants (gestational age <28 weeks) discharged between 2010 and 2019. Hospitalization data and medical charges were obtained from electronic inpatient medical records. Subgroup analysis was conducted to examine how the charges and length of stay varied by gestational age, discharge year, survival status, and major morbidities., RESULTS: The median total hospitalization charge was $20,770.70 with a median length of stay of 70.0 days. Total and daily charges declined as gestational age increased. A rising trend was found over time for overall and daily medical charges. Compared with decedents, survivors had a longer length of stay and higher total hospitalization charges, but their charge per day was lower. Total hospitalization charges were significantly higher in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (Stage II-III), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and sepsis when compared with neonates of the same gestational age without these co-morbidities. Charges for treatments accounted for the highest proportion (31.3%)., LIMITATIONS: Local statistics collected retrospectively might limit generalizability to other regions. Long-term medical charges were not reported., CONCLUSION: Economic burden of the initial hospitalization for extremely preterm infants was substantial in China. Such economic factors should be fully taken into account for perinatal consultations, medical insurance policy-making, and clinical decisions.","group":"g1","id":"41313fe8-6241-4ff7-87b5-d5dfaa4c4346","_showDetails":false},"4dd511fd-b6fa-4dde-8574-a47f4d289373":{"type":"unknown","database":"Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2013>","title":"Reduction of microRNA-206 contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia through up-regulation of fibronectin 1.","doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074750","authors":["Zhang, Xiaoying","Xu, Jing","Wang, Junjie","Gortner, Ludwig","Zhang, Sheng","Wei, Xiujuan","Song, Jie","Zhang, Yupei","Li, Qiuping","Feng, Zhichun"],"date":"2013//","accessDate":"20130910//","keywords":["Animals","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/ge [Genetics]","*Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/me [Metabolism]","Cell Adhesion","Cell Line, Tumor","Cell Movement","Cell Proliferation","Female","*Fibronectins/me [Metabolism]","*Gene Expression Regulation","Humans","Lung/me [Metabolism]","Male","Mice","*MicroRNAs/me [Metabolism]","RNA, Small Interfering/me [Metabolism]","Wound Healing"],"journal":"PloS one","volume":"8","number":"9","isbn":"1932-6203","urls":["http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med10&NEWS=N&AN=24040336"],"address":"United States","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To characterize microRNA-206 (miR-206) in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., DESIGN/METHODS: We assessed the expression of miR-206 in BPD mouse lung tissues and blood samples of BPD patients by quantitative real-time PCR. Then, the role of miR-206 in regulating cell biology were examined by XTT assay, flow cytometry, transwell invasion assay, wound healing assay and adhesion assay in vitro. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay, real-time PCR, western blot and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to figure out the target gene of miR-206., RESULTS: A reduction in expression of miR-206 was observed in BPD mice compared with controls and in BPD patients compared with controls. miR-206 overexpression significantly induced cell apoptosis, reduced cell proliferation, migration and adhesion abilities, whereas the inhibition of miR-206 expression had the opposite effect. Fibronectin 1 (FN1) is a direct target of miR-206, and fn 1 can be transcriptionally and translationally regulated by miR-206. Down-regulation of miR-206 modulates biological functions of the cells, at least in part, by increasing the level of fn 1. Furthermore, fn 1 expression levels were increased in the BPD mice and BPD patients., CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-206 and its target gene, fn 1, may contribute to the progression of
