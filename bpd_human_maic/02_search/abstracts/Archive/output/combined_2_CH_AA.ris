AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is one of the most serious complications observed in premature infants. Thanks to microarray technique, expression of nearly all human genes can be reliably evaluated., OBJECTIVE: To compare whole genome expression in the first month of life in groups of infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: 111 newborns were included in the study. The mean birth weight was 1029 g (SD:290), and the mean gestational age was 27.8 weeks (SD:2.5). Blood samples were drawn from the study participants on the 5th, 14th and 28th day of life. The mRNA samples were evaluated for gene expression with the use of GeneChip R Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays. The infants were divided into two groups: bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n=68) and control (n=43)., RESULTS: Overall 2086 genes were differentially expressed on the day 5, only 324 on the day 14 and 3498 on the day 28. Based on pathway enrichment analysis we found that the cell cycle pathway was up-regulated in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia group. The activation of this pathway does not seem to be related with the maturity of the infant. Four pathways related to inflammatory response were continuously on the 5(th), 14(th) and 28(th) day of life down-regulated in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia group. However, the expression of genes depended on both factors: immaturity and disease severity. The most significantly down-regulated pathway was the T cell receptor signaling pathway., CONCLUSION: The results of the whole genome expression study revealed alteration of the expression of nearly 10% of the genome in bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) presents a major threat of very preterm birth and treatment options are still limited. Stem cells from different sources have been used successfully in experimental BPD, induced by postnatal hyperoxia., OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) in a new double-hit mouse model of BPD., METHODS: For the double-hit, date mated mice were subjected to hypoxia and thereafter the offspring was exposed to hyperoxia. Human umbilical cord blood MNCs were given intraperitoneally by day P7. As outcome variables were defined: physical development (auxology), lung structure (histomorphometry), expression of markers for lung maturation and inflammation on mRNA and protein level. Pre- and postnatal normoxic pups and sham treated double-hit pups served as control groups., RESULTS: Compared to normoxic controls, sham treated double-hit animals showed impaired physical and lung development with reduced alveolarization and increased thickness of septa. Electron microscopy revealed reduced volume density of lamellar bodies. Pulmonary expression of mRNA for surfactant proteins B and C, Mtor and Crabp1 was reduced. Expression of Igf1 was increased. Treatment with umbilical cord blood MNCs normalized thickness of septa and mRNA expression of Mtor to levels of normoxic controls. Tgfb3 mRNA expression and pro-inflammatory IL-1beta protein concentration were decreased., CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate the therapeutic potential of umbilical cord blood MNCs in a new double-hit model of BPD in newborn mice. We found improved lung structure and effects on molecular level. Further studies are needed to address the role of systemic administration of MNCs in experimental BPD.

AB  - Sustained lung inflations (SI) at birth may recruit functional residual capacity (FRC). Clinically, SI increase oxygenation and decrease need for intubation in preterm infants. We tested whether a SI to recruit FRC would decrease lung injury from subsequent ventilation of fetal, preterm lambs. The preterm fetus (128+/-1 day gestation) was exteriorized from the uterus, a tracheostomy was performed, and fetal lung fluid was removed. While maintaining placental circulation, fetuses were randomized to one of four 15-min interventions: 1) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O (n=4), 2) 20 s SI to 50 cmH2O then PEEP 8 cmH2O (n=10), 3) mechanical ventilation at tidal volume (VT) 7 ml/kg (n=13), or 4) 20 s SI then ventilation at VT 7 ml/kg (n=13). Lambs were ventilated with 95% N2/5% CO2 and PEEP 8 cmH2O. Volume recruitment was measured during SI, and fetal tissues were collected after an additional 30 min on placental support. SI achieved a mean FRC recruitment of 15 ml/kg (range 8-27). Fifty percent of final FRC was achieved by 2 s, 65% by 5 s, and 90% by 15 s, demonstrating prolonged SI times are needed to recruit FRC. SI alone released acute-phase proteins into the fetal lung fluid and increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase response genes in the lung. Mechanical ventilation further increased all markers of lung injury. SI before ventilation, regardless of the volume of FRC recruited, did not alter the acute-phase and proinflammatory responses to mechanical ventilation at birth.

AB  - Lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants and emphysema lack efficient treatments. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to normal and impaired alveolar growth and repair may identify new therapeutic targets for these lung diseases. Axonal guidance cues are molecules that guide the outgrowth of axons. Amongst these axonal guidance cues, members of the Semaphorin family, in particular Semaphorin 3C (Sema3C), contribute to early lung branching morphogenesis. The role of Sema3C during alveolar growth and repair is unknown. We hypothesized that Sema3C promotes alveolar development and repair. In vivo Sema3C knock down using intranasal siRNA during the postnatal stage of alveolar development in rats caused significant air space enlargement reminiscent of BPD. Sema3C knock down was associated with increased TLR3 expression and lung inflammatory cells influx. In a model of O2-induced arrested alveolar growth in newborn rats mimicking BPD, air space enlargement was associated with decreased lung Sema3C mRNA expression. In vitro, Sema3C treatment preserved alveolar epithelial cell viability in hyperoxia and accelerated alveolar epithelial cell wound healing. Sema3C preserved lung microvascular endothelial cell vascular network formation in vitro under hyperoxic conditions. In vivo, Sema3C treatment of hyperoxic rats decreased lung neutrophil influx and preserved alveolar and lung vascular growth. Sema3C also preserved lung plexinA2 and Sema3C expression, alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and decreased lung apoptosis. In conclusion, the axonal guidance cue Sema3C promotes normal alveolar growth and may be worthwhile further investigating as a potential therapeutic target for lung repair.

AB  - Stimulation of MAS oncogene receptor (MAS) or angiotensin (Ang) receptor type 2 (AT2) may be novel therapeutic options for neonatal chronic lung disease (CLD) by counterbalancing the adverse effects of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, consisting of arterial hypertension (PAH)-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and pulmonary inflammation. We determined the cardiopulmonary effects in neonatal rats with CLD of daily treatment during continuous exposure to 100% oxygen for 10 days with specific ligands for MAS [cyclic Ang-(1-7); 10-50 mug.kg(-1). day(-1)] and AT2 [dKcAng-(1-7); 5-20 mug.kg(-1). day(-1)]. Parameters investigated included lung and heart histopathology, fibrin deposition, vascular leakage, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, coagulation, and alveolar development. We investigated the role of nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (25 mg.kg(-1). day(-1)) during AT2 agonist treatment. Prophylactic treatment with agonists for MAS or AT2 for 10 days diminished cardiopulmonary injury by reducing alveolar septum thickness and medial wall thickness of small arterioles and preventing RVH. Both agonists attenuated the pulmonary influx of inflammatory cells, including macrophages (via AT2) and neutrophils (via MAS) but did not reduce alveolar enlargement and vascular alveolar leakage. The AT2 agonist attenuated hyperoxia-induced fibrin deposition. In conclusion, stimulation of MAS or AT2 attenuates cardiopulmonary injury by reducing pulmonary inflammation and preventing PAH-induced RVH but does not affect alveolar and vascular development in neonatal rats with experimental CLD. The beneficial effects of AT2 activation on experimental CLD were mediated via a NOS-independent mechanism.

AB  - Curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, modulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma signaling, a key molecule in the etiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We have previously shown curcumin's acute protection against neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury. However, its longer-term protection against BPD is not known. Hypothesizing that concurrent treatment with curcumin protects the developing lung against hyperoxia-induced lung injury long-term, we determined if curcumin protects against hyperoxic neonatal rat lung injury for the first 5 days of life, as determined at postnatal day (PND) 21. One-day-old rat pups were exposed to either 21 or 95% O2 for 5 days with or without curcumin treatment (5 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally one time daily, following which the pups grew up to PND21 in room air. At PND21 lung development was determined, including gross and cellular structural and functional effects, and molecular mediators of inflammatory injury. To gain mechanistic insights, embryonic day 19 fetal rat lung fibroblasts were examined for markers of apoptosis and MAP kinase activation following in vitro exposure to hyperoxia for 24 h in the presence or absence of curcumin (5 muM). Curcumin effectively blocked hyperoxia-induced lung injury based on systematic analysis of markers for lung injury (apoptosis, Bcl-2/Bax, collagen III, fibronectin, vimentin, calponin, and elastin-related genes) and lung morphology (radial alveolar count and alveolar septal thickness). Mechanistically, curcumin prevented the hyperoxia-induced increases in cleaved caspase-3 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Molecular effects of curcumin, both structural and cytoprotective, suggest that its actions against hyperoxia-induced lung injury are mediated via Erk1/2 activation and that it is a potential intervention against BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether there was an adverse effect on brain growth after hydrocortisone (HC) treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in a large cohort of infants without dexamethasone exposure., STUDY DESIGN: Infants who received HC for BPD between 2005 and 2011 and underwent magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age were included. Control infants born in Geneva (2005-2006) and Utrecht (2007-2011) were matched to the infants treated with HC according to segmentation method, sex, and gestational age. Infants with overt parenchymal pathology were excluded. Multivariable analysis was used to determine if there was a difference in brain volumes between the 2 groups., RESULTS: Seventy-three infants treated with HC and 73 matched controls were included. Mean gestational age was 26.7 weeks, and mean birth weight was 906 g. After correction for gestational age, postmenstrual age at time of scanning, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and birth weight z-score, no differences were found between infants treated with HC and controls in total brain tissue or cerebellar volumes., CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of associated parenchymal brain injury, no reduction in brain tissue or cerebellar volumes could be found at term-equivalent age between infants with or without treatment with HC for BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extremely preterm infants often receive mechanical ventilation (MV), which can contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the effects of MV alone on the extremely preterm lung and the lung's capacity for repair are poorly understood., AIM: To characterise lung injury induced by MV alone, and mechanisms of injury and repair, in extremely preterm lungs and to compare them with very preterm lungs., METHODS: Extremely preterm lambs (0.75 of term) were transiently exposed by hysterotomy and underwent 2 h of injurious MV. Lungs were collected 24 h and at 15 d after MV. Immunohistochemistry and morphometry were used to characterise injury and repair processes. qRT-PCR was performed on extremely and very preterm (0.85 of term) lungs 24 h after MV to assess molecular injury and repair responses., RESULTS: 24 h after MV at 0.75 of term, lung parenchyma and bronchioles were severely injured; tissue space and myofibroblast density were increased, collagen and elastin fibres were deformed and secondary crest density was reduced. Bronchioles contained debris and their epithelium was injured and thickened. 24 h after MV at 0.75 and 0.85 of term, mRNA expression of potential mediators of lung repair were significantly increased. By 15 days after MV, most lung injury had resolved without treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Extremely immature lungs, particularly bronchioles, are severely injured by 2 h of MV. In the absence of continued ventilation these injured lungs are capable of repair. At 24 h after MV, genes associated with injurious MV are unaltered, while potential repair genes are activated in both extremely and very preterm lungs.

AB  - Ureaplasma species are the most frequently isolated microorganisms inside the amniotic cavity and have been associated with spontaneous abortion, chorioamnionitis, premature rupture of the membranes (PROM), preterm labour (PL) pneumonia in neonates and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates. The mechanisms by which Ureaplasmas cause such diseases remain unclear, but it is believed that inappropriate induction of inflammatory responses is involved, triggered by the innate immune system. As part of its mechanism of activation, the innate immune system employs germ-lined encoded receptors, called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in order to "sense" pathogens. One such family of PRRs are the Toll like receptor family (TLR). In the current study we aimed to elucidate the role of TLRs in Ureaplasma-induced inflammation in human amniotic epithelial cells. Using silencing, as well as human embryonic kidney (HEK) transfected cell lines, we demonstrate that TLR2, TLR6 and TLR9 are involved in the inflammatory responses against Ureaplasma parvum and urealyticum serovars. Ureaplasma lipoproteins, such as Multiple Banded antigen (MBA), trigger responses via TLR2/TLR6, whereas the whole bacterium is required for TLR9 activation. No major differences were observed between the different serovars. Cell activation by Ureaplasma parvum and urealyticum seem to require lipid raft function and formation of heterotypic receptor complexes comprising of TLR2 and TLR6 on the cell surface and TLR9 intracellularly.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious chronic lung disease affecting extremely preterm infants. While mitochondrial dysfunction has been investigated in various medical conditions, limited research has explored mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene mutations, specifically in BPD. This study aimed to evaluate mitochondrial mtDNA gene mutations in extremely preterm infants with BPD. In this prospective observational study, we enrolled a cohort of extremely preterm infants diagnosed with BPD. Clinical data were collected to provide comprehensive patient profiles. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole-blood samples obtained within a defined timeframe. Subsequently, mtDNA extraction and sequencing using next-generation sequencing technology were performed to identify mtDNA gene mutations. Among the cohort of ten extremely preterm infants with BPD, mtDNA sequencing revealed the presence of mutations in seven patients, resulting in a total of twenty-one point mutations. Notably, many of these mutations were identified in loci associated with critical components of the respiratory chain complexes, vital for proper mitochondrial function and cellular energy production. This pilot study provides evidence of mtDNA point mutations in a subset of extremely preterm infants with BPD. These findings suggest a potential association between mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of BPD. Further extensive investigations are warranted to unravel the mechanisms underlying mtDNA mutations in BPD. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe condition in premature infants that compromises lung function and necessitates oxygen support. Despite major improvements in perinatal care minimizing the devastating effects, BPD remains the most frequent complication of extreme preterm birth. Our study reports the safety of the allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (allo-UC-MSCs) and the progression of lung development in four infants with established BPD., METHODS: UC tissue was collected from a healthy donor, followed by propagation at the Stem Cell Core Facility at Vinmec Research Institute of Stem Cell and Gene Technology. UC-MSC culture was conducted under xeno- and serum-free conditions. Four patients with established BPD were enrolled in this study between May 25, 2018, and December 31, 2018. All four patients received two intravenous doses of allo-UC-MSCs (1 million cells/kg patient body weight (PBW) per dose) with an intervening interval of 7 days. Safety and patient conditions were evaluated during hospitalization and at 7 days and 1, 6 and 12 months postdischarge., RESULTS: No intervention-associated severe adverse events or prespecified adverse events were observed in the four patients throughout the study period. At the time of this report, all patients had recovered from BPD and were weaned off of oxygen support. Chest X-rays and CT scans confirmed the progressive reductions in fibrosis., CONCLUSIONS: Allo-UC-MSC administration is safe in preterm infants with established BPD. Trial registration This preliminary study was approved by the Vinmec International Hospital Ethics Board (approval number: 88/2019/QD-VMEC; retrospectively registered March 12, 2019).

AB  - We have recently shown that a combination of vitamin A (VA) and retinoic acid (RA) in a 10:1 molar ratio (VARA) synergistically increases lung retinoid content in newborn rodents, more than either VA or RA alone in equimolar amounts. We hypothesized that the increase in lung retinoids would reduce oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in attenuation of alveolar simplification and abnormal lung function in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. Newborn C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 85% O2 (hyperoxia) or air (normoxia) for 7 or 14 days from birth and given vehicle or VARA every other day. Lung retinol content was measured by HPLC, function was assessed by flexiVent, and development was evaluated by radial alveolar counts, mean linear intercept, and secondary septal crest density. Mediators of oxidative stress, inflammation, and alveolar development were evaluated in lung homogenates. We observed that VARA increased lung retinol stores and attenuated hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification while increasing lung compliance and lowering resistance. VARA attenuated hyperoxia-induced increases in DNA damage and protein oxidation accompanied with a reduction in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 protein but did not alter malondialdehyde adducts, nitrotyrosine, or myeloperoxidase concentrations. Interferon-gamma and macrophage inflammatory protein-2alpha mRNA and protein increased with hyperoxia, and this increase was attenuated by VARA. Our study suggests that the VARA combination may be a potential therapeutic strategy in conditions characterized by VA deficiency and hyperoxia-induced lung injury during lung development, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated endothelial activation contributes to lung inflammation and alveolar remodeling seen in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mechanisms underlying LPS-mediated oxidative stress and proinflammatory signaling in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) remain unclear. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase (Nox) mediates LPS-induced endothelial activation in HPMEC by regulating phosphorylation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway proteins. LPS-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was associated with increased 2-OH-E(+) (marker for superoxide formation) levels and was attenuated by apocynin and the Nox inhibitor, VAS2870. LPS triggered membrane translocation of p67phox, suggesting activation of Nox2. Silencing Nox2, but not Nox4, suppressed LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression in HPMEC. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that inhibitor of kappa-B kinase-beta (IKK-beta) serine phosphorylation induced by LPS was inhibited by Nox2 silencing. We examined whether Nox2-dependent, LPS-mediated IKK-beta phosphorylation was regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or TGF-beta associated kinase-1 (TAK1) in HPMEC. LPS increased PP2A activity in HPMEC, and inhibition of PP2A did not alter LPS-mediated ICAM-1 expression but attenuated IKK-beta phosphorylation. TAK1 inhibition decreased LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression in HPMEC, and Nox2 silencing attenuated LPS-mediated TAK1 phosphorylation (Thr184/187). We demonstrate that Nox2 regulates LPS-mediated endothelial activation in pulmonary endothelial cells by modulating phosphorylation of key kinases in the TLR signaling cascade. Our data support a novel mechanism by which Nox-dependent signaling regulates proinflammatory signaling in pulmonary endothelial cells. Inhibition of vascular Nox may potentially limit lung injury and alveolar remodeling caused by infections in BPD.

AB  - Inflammation and antenatal glucocorticoids, the latter given to mothers at risk for preterm birth, affect lung development and may contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The effects of the combined exposures on inflammation and antenatal glucocorticoids on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling are unknown. TGF-beta and its downstream mediators are implicated in the etiology of BPD. Therefore, we asked whether glucocorticoids altered intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects on TGF-beta expression, its signaling molecule phosphorylated sma and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (pSmad2), and the downstream mediators connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Ovine singleton fetuses were randomized to receive either an intra-amniotic injection of LPS and/or maternal betamethasone (BTM) intramuscularly 7 and/or 14 days before delivery at 120 days gestational age (GA; term = 150 days GA). Saline was used for controls. Protein levels of TGF-beta1 and -beta2 were measured by ELISA. Smad2 phosphorylation was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. CTGF and Cav-1 mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Free TGF-beta1 and -beta2 and total TGF-beta1 levels were unchanged after LPS and/or BTM exposure, although total TGF-beta2 increased in animals exposed to BTM 7 days before LPS. pSmad2 immunostaining increased 7 days after LPS exposure although pSmad2 protein expression did not increase. Similarly, CTGF mRNA and protein levels increased 7 days after LPS exposure as Cav-1 mRNA and protein levels decreased. BTM exposure before LPS prevented CTGF induction and Cav-1 downregulation. This study demonstrated that the intrauterine inflammation-induced TGF-beta signaling can be inhibited by antenatal glucocorticoids in fetal lungs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence now supports the association between the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) with the pathogenesis of preterm labor, intraventricular hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNs) and mononuclear cell (MONOs) infiltration of the placenta is associated with these disorders. The aim of this study was to reveal cell-specific differences in gene expression and cytokine release in response to endotoxin that would elucidate inflammatory control mechanisms in the newly born., METHODS: PMNs and MONOs were separately isolated from the same cord blood sample. A genome-wide microarray screened for gene expression and related pathways at 4 h of LPS stimulation (n = 5). RT-qPCR and ELISA were performed for selected cytokines at 4 h and 18 h of LPS stimulation., RESULTS: Compared to PMNs, MONOs had a greater diversity and more robust gene expression that included pro-inflammatory (PI) cytokines, chemokines and growth factors at 4 h. Only MONOs had genes changing expression (all up regulated including interleukin-10) that were clustered in the JAK/STAT pathway. Pre-incubation with IL-10 antibody, for LPS-stimulated MONOs, led to up regulated PI and IL-10 gene expression and release of PI cytokines after 4 h., DISCUSSION: The present study suggests a dominant role of MONO gene expression in control of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome at 4 hrs of LPS stimulation. LPS-stimulated MONOs but not PMNs of the newborn have the ability to inhibit PI cytokine gene expression by latent IL-10 release.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between direct costs for the initial neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization and 4 potentially preventable morbidities in a retrospective cohort of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight <1500 g)., STUDY DESIGN: The sample included 425 VLBW infants born alive between July 2005 and June 2009 at Rush University Medical Center. Morbidities included brain injury, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and late-onset sepsis. Clinical and economic data were retrieved from the institution's system-wide data and cost accounting system. A general linear regression model was fit to determine incremental direct costs associated with each morbidity., RESULTS: After controlling for birth weight, gestational age, and sociodemographic characteristics, the presence of brain injury was associated with a $12048 (P = .005) increase in direct costs; necrotizing enterocolitis, with a $15 440 (P = .005) increase; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, with a $31565 (P < .001) increase; and late-onset sepsis, with a $10055 (P < .001) increase. The absolute number of morbidities was also associated with significantly higher costs., CONCLUSION: This study provides collective estimates of the direct costs incurred during neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization for these 4 morbidities in VLBW infants. The incremental costs associated with these morbidities are high, and these data can inform future studies evaluating interventions aimed at preventing or reducing these costly morbidities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation of preterm babies increases survival but can also cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), leading to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). It is not known whether shear stress injury from gases flowing into the preterm lung during ventilation contributes to VILI., METHODS: Preterm lambs of 131 days' gestation (term = 147 d) were ventilated for 2 hours with a bias gas flow of 8 L/min (n = 13), 18 L/min (n = 12) or 28 L/min (n = 14). Physiological parameters were measured continuously and lung injury was assessed by measuring mRNA expression of early injury response genes and by histological analysis. Control lung tissue was collected from unventilated age-matched fetuses. Data were analysed by ANOVA with a Tukey post-hoc test when appropriate., RESULTS: High bias gas flows resulted in higher ventilator pressures, shorter inflation times and decreased ventilator efficiency. The rate of rise of inspiratory gas flow was greatest, and pulmonary mRNA levels of the injury markers, EGR1 and CTGF, were highest in lambs ventilated with bias gas flows of 18 L/min. High bias gas flows resulted in increased cellular proliferation and abnormal deposition of elastin, collagen and myofibroblasts in the lung., CONCLUSIONS: High ventilator bias gas flows resulted in increased lung injury, with up-regulation of acute early response genes and increased histological lung injury. Bias gas flows may, therefore, contribute to VILI and BPD.

AB  - In bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), alveolar septae are thickened with collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-positive myofibroblasts. Periostin, a secreted extracellular matrix protein, is involved in TGF-beta-mediated fibrosis and myofibroblast differentiation. We hypothesized that periostin expression is required for hypoalveolarization and interstitial fibrosis in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice, an animal model for this disease. We also examined periostin expression in neonatal lung mesenchymal stromal cells and lung tissue of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice and human infants with BPD. Two-to-three day-old wild-type and periostin null mice were exposed to air or 75% oxygen for 14 days. Mesenchymal stromal cells were isolated from tracheal aspirates of premature infants. Hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice increased alveolar wall periostin expression, particularly in areas of interstitial thickening. Periostin co-localized with alpha-smooth muscle actin, suggesting synthesis by myofibroblasts. A similar pattern was found in lung sections of infants dying of BPD. Unlike wild-type mice, hyperoxia-exposed periostin null mice did not show larger air spaces or alpha-smooth muscle-positive myofibroblasts. Compared to hyperoxia-exposed wild-type mice, hyperoxia-exposed periostin null mice also showed reduced lung mRNA expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, elastin, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL4. TGF-beta treatment increased mesenchymal stromal cell periostin expression, and periostin treatment increased TGF-beta-mediated DNA synthesis and myofibroblast differentiation. We conclude that periostin expression is increased in the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mice and infants with BPD, and is required for hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization and interstitial fibrosis.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have shown that maternal preeclampsia (PE) increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (soluble VEGFR1, known as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, or sFlt-1), an endogenous antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is markedly elevated in amniotic fluid and maternal blood in PE. Therefore, we hypothesized that antenatal exposure to excess sFlt-1 disrupts lung development through impaired VEGF signaling in utero, providing a mechanistic link between PE and BPD. To determine whether increased sFlt-1 in amniotic fluid is sufficient to cause sustained abnormalities of lung structure during infancy, sFlt-1 or saline was injected into amniotic sacs of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at 20 days of gestation (term, 22 days). After birth, pups were observed through 14 days of age for study. We found that intra-amniotic sFlt-1 treatment decreased alveolar number, reduced pulmonary vessel density, and caused right and left ventricular hypertrophy in 14-day-old rats. In addition, intra-amniotic sFlt-1 treatment suppressed activation of lung VEGF receptor-2 and increased apoptosis in endothelial and mesenchymal cells in the newborn lung. We conclude that exposure to excess sFlt-1 in amniotic fluid during late gestation causes sustained reductions in alveolarization and pulmonary vascular growth during infancy, accompanied by biventricular hypertrophy suggesting pulmonary and systemic hypertension. We speculate that impaired VEGF signaling in utero due to exposure of high amniotic fluid levels of sFlt-1 in PE disrupts lung growth and contributes to the increased risk of BPD in infants born to mothers with PE.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Angiogenesis is one of the most important processes for normal lung development. Oxidative stress can impair the pulmonary angiogenesis, leading to chronic lung disease or Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of EC-SOD overexpression on pulmonary angiogenesis on neonates following exposure to acute hyperoxia., DESIGN/METHODS: Transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) neonatal mice (10 mice per group) were exposed either to air (control group) or 95% O(2) for 7 days starting at birth. After exposure, all animals were sacrificed. ROS concentration was measured in lung homogenates using OxiSelect ROS assay kit. Mean vascular density (MVD) was measured using anti CD34 staining. RNA was extracted and the angiogenesis markers, VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 and PECAM-1 were analyzed by RT-q PCR. VGEF protein was measured using Western blots. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) was assayed by flow cytometer., RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of ROS in TG hyperoxic neonate group (156+/-14.2) compared to WT hyperoxic animals (255+/-35.1). Evaluation of MVD, using anti-CD34, showed marked significant increase of MVD in the TG group following hyperoxic exposure (85+/-12) in comparison to the WT hyperoxic group (62+/-8.4), (P<0.05). Among the hyperoxic groups, both RNA and protein of VEGF expression were significantly reduced in the WT animals compared to the TG group (P<0.05). The same trend was found in VEGFR 1 and 2 which were significantly reduced in WT group compared to the TG group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between hyperoxia TG and control group (P>0.05). PECAM expression was significantly reduced in both hyperoxic compared to normoxic groups (P<0.05). EPC's showed significant reduction in WT hyperoxic group compared to others (P>0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: EC-SOD plays a key role in preserving angiogenesis by scavenging free radicals which has an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis process in neonatal mice lung following exposure to hyperoxia.

AB  - Maintenance of blood oxygen saturation dictates supplemental oxygen administration to premature infants, but hyperoxia predisposes survivors to respiratory diseases such as asthma. Although much research has focused on oxygen effects on alveoli in the setting of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the mechanisms by which oxygen affects airway structure or function relevant to asthma are still under investigation. We used isolated human fetal airway smooth muscle (fASM) cells from 18-20 postconceptual age lungs (canalicular stage) to examine oxygen effects on intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) and cellular proliferation. fASM cells expressed substantial smooth muscle actin and myosin and several Ca(2+) regulatory proteins but not fibroblast or epithelial markers, profiles qualitatively comparable to adult human ASM. Fluorescence Ca(2+) imaging showed robust [Ca(2+)](i) responses to 1 muM acetylcholine (ACh) and 10 muM histamine (albeit smaller and slower than adult ASM), partly sensitive to zero extracellular Ca(2+). Compared with adult, fASM showed greater baseline proliferation. Based on this validation, we assessed fASM responses to 10% hypoxia through 90% hyperoxia and found enhanced proliferation at <60% oxygen but increased apoptosis at >60%, effects accompanied by appropriate changes in proliferative vs. apoptotic markers and enhanced mitochondrial fission at >60% oxygen. [Ca(2+)](i) responses to ACh were enhanced for <60% but blunted at >60% oxygen. These results suggest that hyperoxia has dose-dependent effects on structure and function of developing ASM, which could have consequences for airway diseases of childhood. Thus detrimental effects on ASM should be an additional consideration in assessing risks of supplemental oxygen in prematurity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants born very preterm are more likely to experience neonatal morbidities compared to their term peers. Variations in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with these morbidities may yield novel information about the processes impacted by these morbidities., METHODS: This study included 532 infants born < 30 weeks gestation, participating in the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants study. We used a neonatal morbidity risk score, which was an additive index of the number of morbidities experienced during the NICU stay, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), severe brain injury, serious neonatal infections, and severe retinopathy of prematurity. DNA was collected from buccal cells at discharge from the NICU, and DNAm was measured using the Illumina MethylationEPIC. We tested for differential methylation in association with the neonatal morbidity risk score then tested for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and overrepresentation of biological pathways., RESULTS: We identified ten differentially methylated CpGs (alpha Bonferroni-adjusted for 706,278 tests) that were associated with increasing neonatal morbidity risk scores at three intergenic regions and at HPS4, SRRD, FGFR1OP, TNS3, TMEM266, LRRC3B, ZNF780A, and TENM2. These mostly followed dose-response patterns, for 8 CpGs increasing DNAm associated with increased numbers of morbidities, while for 2 CpGs the risk score was associated with decreasing DNAm. BPD was the most substantial contributor to differential methylation. We also identified seven potential DMRs and over-representation of genes involved in Wnt signaling; however, these results were not significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing., CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal DNAm, within genes involved in fibroblast growth factor activities, cellular invasion and migration, and neuronal signaling and development, are sensitive to the neonatal health complications of prematurity. We hypothesize that these epigenetic features may be representative of an integrated marker of neonatal health and development and are promising candidates to integrate with clinical information for studying developmental impairments in childhood.

AB  - Duodenal atresia is a well-recognized cause of neonatal bowel obstruction. General anesthesia with tracheal intubation is the traditional anesthetic technique for surgical correction of this condition. Metabolic abnormalities and fluid deficits coupled with residual anesthetics are known to increase the risk of postoperative apnea, prolonging the operating room time and delaying extubation. Spinal anesthesia (SA) is an accepted alternative to general anesthesia in formerly preterm infants. In the current literature, there are reports of successful use of SA for simple infraumbilical surgery and, occasionally, for upper abdominal surgery, but there is no information on the use of SA in neonates for duodenal atresia repair. We present a case of duodenal atresia in a preterm infant at a gestational age of 30 weeks with coexisting bronchopulmonary dysplasia successfully repaired under SA. Further studies that compare the adverse effects with the potential advantages of SA are warranted before future recommendations are made for neonates who are undergoing upper abdominal surgery.

AB  - Angiogenesis is crucial for lung development. Although there has been considerable exploration, the mechanism by which lung vascular and alveolar formation is controlled is still not completely understood. Here we show that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), a component of the Wnt ligand-receptor complex, regulates angiogenesis and alveolar formation in the lung by modulating expression of the angiopoietin (Ang) receptor, Tie2, in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Vascular development in whole mouse lungs and in cultured ECs is controlled by LRP5 signaling, which is, in turn, governed by a balance between the activities of the antagonistic Tie2 ligands, Ang1 and Ang2. Under physiological conditions when Ang1 is dominant, LRP5 knockdown decreases Tie2 expression and thereby, inhibits vascular and alveolar development in the lung. Conversely, when Ang2 dominates under hyperoxia treatment in neonatal mice, high LRP5 and Tie2 expression suppress angiogenesis and lung development. These findings suggest that the LRP5-Tie2-Ang signaling axis plays a central role in control of both angiogenesis and alveolarization during postnatal lung development, and that deregulation of this signaling mechanism might lead to developmental abnormalities of the lung, such as are observed in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

AB  - In bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), alveolar septa are thickened with collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin-, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-positive myofibroblasts. We examined the biochemical mechanisms underlying myofibroblastic differentiation, focusing on the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta)/beta-catenin signaling pathway. In the cytoplasm, beta-catenin is phosphorylated on the NH(2) terminus by constitutively active GSK-3beta, favoring its degradation. Upon TGF-beta stimulation, GSK-3beta is phosphorylated and inactivated, allowing beta-catenin to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of genes involved in myofibroblastic differentiation. We examined the role of beta-catenin in TGF-beta1-induced myofibroblastic differentiation of neonatal lung mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from tracheal aspirates of premature infants with respiratory distress. TGF-beta1 increased beta-catenin expression and nuclear translocation. Transduction of cells with GSK-3beta S9A, a nonphosphorylatable, constitutively active mutant that favors beta-catenin degradation, blocked TGF-beta1-induced myofibroblastic differentiation. Furthermore, transduction of MSCs with DELTAN-catenin, a truncation mutant that cannot be phosphorylated on the NH(2) terminus by GSK-3beta and is not degraded, was sufficient for myofibroblastic differentiation. In vivo, hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice increases expression of beta-catenin in alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts. Similar changes were found in lungs of infants with BPD. Finally, low-passage unstimulated MSCs from infants developing BPD showed higher phospho-GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, and alpha-actin content compared with MSCs from infants not developing this disease, and phospho-GSK-3beta and beta-catenin each correlated with alpha-actin content. We conclude that phospho-GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling regulates alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, a marker of myofibroblast differentiation, in vitro and in vivo. This pathway appears to be activated in lung mesenchymal cells from patients with BPD.

AB  - AIM: Caffeine treatment reduces the frequency of apnoea of prematurity (AOP) and eliminates the need for mechanical ventilation by acting as a nonspecific inhibitor of adenosine A1 and adenosine 2A receptors. Patients with AOP have demonstrated variant responses to caffeine therapy. We proposed to investigate the role of A1 and 2A polymorphisms in the development of AOP and individual differences in caffeine response. Secondly, we aimed to determine whether these polymorphisms have any effect on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development., METHODS: Cord blood samples were collected from infants born with gestational ages between 24 and 34 weeks. Two groups were defined: patients without apnoea (n = 60) and patients with apnoea (n = 55). Patients with apnoea were divided into two subgroups: a caffeine-responsive group (n = 30) and an unresponsive group (n = 25). Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms were chosen for genotyping., RESULTS: Patients with apnoea over 28 weeks of gestational age who responded to the caffeine treatment were found to carry the rs16851030 C/C genotype rather than the C/T or T/T genotype. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant correlation between rs35320474-C/T and T/T genotypes and apnoea and BPD development., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a role for adenosine receptor gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to AOP and BPD and in interindividual variability to caffeine response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial-Monocyte Activating Polypeptide (EMAP II) is a secreted protein with well-established anti-angiogenic activities. Intracellular EMAP II expression is increased during fetal development at epithelial/mesenchymal boundaries and in pathophysiologic fibroproliferative cells of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, emphysema, and scar fibroblast tissue following myocardial ischemia. Precise function and regulation of intracellular EMAP II, however, has not been explored to date., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that high intracellular EMAP II suppresses cellular proliferation by slowing progression through the G2M cell cycle transition in epithelium and fibroblast. Furthermore, EMAP II binds to and is phosphorylated by Cdk1, and exhibits nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning, with only nuclear EMAP II being phosphorylated. We observed that extracellular secreted EMAP II induces endothelial cell apoptosis, where as excess intracellular EMAP II facilitates epithelial and fibroblast cells migration., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that EMAP II has specific intracellular effects, and that this intracellular function appears to antagonize its extracellular anti-angiogenic effects during fetal development and pulmonary disease progression.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of infancy, is characterized by arrested alveolar development. Pulmonary angiogenesis, mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, is essential for alveolarization. However, the transcriptional regulators mediating pulmonary angiogenesis remain unknown. We previously demonstrated that NF-kappaB, a transcription factor traditionally associated with inflammation, plays a unique protective role in the neonatal lung. Therefore, we hypothesized that constitutive NF-kappaB activity is essential for postnatal lung development. Blocking NF-kappaB activity in 6-day-old neonatal mice induced the alveolar simplification similar to that observed in BPD and significantly reduced pulmonary capillary density. Studies to determine the mechanism responsible for this effect identified greater constitutive NF-kappaB in neonatal lung and in primary pulmonary endothelial cells (PEC) compared with adult. Moreover, inhibiting constitutive NF-kappaB activity in the neonatal PEC with either pharmacological inhibitors or RNA interference blocked PEC survival, decreased proliferation, and impaired in vitro angiogenesis. Finally, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, NF-kappaB was found to be a direct regulator of the angiogenic mediator, VEGF-receptor-2, in the neonatal pulmonary vasculature. Taken together, our data identify an entirely novel role for NF-kappaB in promoting physiological angiogenesis and alveolarization in the developing lung. Our data suggest that disruption of NF-kappaB signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD and that enhancement of NF-kappaB may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to promote lung growth and regeneration in pulmonary diseases marked by impaired angiogenesis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease and major risk factor for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among preterm infants. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in oxidative injury responses in the lungs. Two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene have been associated with RSV infection in children. However, it is unclear to what extent this association is confounded by BPD or prematurity. In this study, we analyzed two population-based cohorts of preterm infants at risk for BPD as well as ethnicity-matched infants born at term, to test whether the TLR4 polymorphisms Asp299Gly (rs4986790) and Thr399Ile (rs4986791) are independently associated with BPD or premature birth. In a Canadian cohort (n = 269) composed of a majority of Caucasian preterm infants (BPD incidence of 38%), the TLR4-299 heterozygous genotype was significantly under-represented in infants without BPD (1.6% of infants versus 12% in infants with severe BPD) after adjusting for twins, ethnicity, gestational age, birth weight and gender (p = 0.014). This association was not replicated in a Finnish cohort (n = 434) of premature singletons or first-born siblings of Caucasian descent, although the incidence of BPD was substantially lower in this latter population (15%). We did not detect a significant association (>2-fold) between TLR4 genotypes and prematurity (p>0.05). We conclude that these TLR4 genotypes may have, at best, a modest influence on BPD severity in some populations of high-risk preterm infants. Further studies are warranted to clarify how clinical heterogeneity may impact genetic susceptibility to BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major complication of prematurity resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The pathology of BPD is multifactorial and leads to alveolar simplification and distal lung injury. Previous studies have shown a beneficial effect of systemic treatment with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and MSC-conditioned media (MSC-CM) leading to amelioration of the lung parenchymal and vascular injury in vivo in the hyperoxia murine model of BPD. It is possible that the beneficial response from the MSCs is at least in part due to activation of endogenous lung epithelial stem cells. Bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) are an adult lung stem cell population capable of self-renewal and differentiation in culture, and BASCs proliferate in response to bronchiolar and alveolar lung injury in vivo. Systemic treatment of neonatal hyperoxia-exposed mice with MSCs or MSC-CM led to a significant increase in BASCs compared with untreated controls. Treatment of BASCs with MSC-CM in culture showed an increase in growth efficiency, indicating a direct effect of MSCs on BASCs. Lineage tracing data in bleomycin-treated adult mice showed that Clara cell secretory protein-expressing cells including BASCs are capable of contributing to alveolar repair after lung injury. MSCs and MSC-derived factors may stimulate BASCs to play a role in the repair of alveolar lung injury found in BPD and in the restoration of distal lung cell epithelia. This work highlights the potential important role of endogenous lung stem cells in the repair of chronic lung diseases.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolar simplification with decreased alveolar number and increased airspace size. Formation of alveoli involves a process known as secondary septation triggered by myofibroblasts. This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of altered lung morphogenesis in a rat model of BPD induced by intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results showed that LPS disrupted alveolar morphology and led to abnormal localization of myofibroblasts in the lung of newborn rats, mostly in primary septa with few in secondary septa. To identify potential mechanisms, in vitro experiments were carried out to observe the migration behavior of myofibroblasts. The migration speed of lung myofibroblasts increased with LPS treatment, whereas the directional persistence decreased. We found that LPS induced activation of EGFR and overexpression of its ligand, TGF-alpha in myofibroblasts. AG1478, an EGFR inhibitor, abrogated the enhanced locomotivity of myofibroblasts by LPS and also increased the directional persistence of myofibroblast migration. Myofibroblasts showed a high asymmetry of phospho-EGFR localization, which was absent after LPS treatment. Application of rhTGF-alpha to myofibroblasts decreased the directional persistence. Our findings indicated that asymmetry of phospho-EGFR localization in myofibroblasts was important for cell migration and its directional persistence. We speculate that LPS exposure disrupts the asymmetric localization of phospho-EGFR, leading to decreased stability of cell polarity and final abnormal location of myofibroblasts in vivo, which is critical to secondary septation and may contribute to the arrested alveolar development in BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alveolar septation marks the beginning of the transition from the saccular to alveolar stage of lung development. Inflammation can disrupt this process and permanently impair alveolar formation resulting in alveolar hypoplasia as seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm newborns. NF-kappaB is a transcription factor central to multiple inflammatory and developmental pathways including dorsal-ventral patterning in fruit flies; limb, mammary and submandibular gland development in mice; and branching morphogenesis in chick lungs. We have previously shown that epithelial overexpression of NF-kappaB accelerates lung maturity using transgenic mice. The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that targeted deletion of NF-kappaB signaling in lung epithelium would impair alveolar formation., METHODS: We generated double transgenic mice with lung epithelium-specific deletion of IKKbeta, a known activating kinase upstream of NF-kappaB, using a cre-loxP transgenic recombination strategy. Lungs of resulting progeny were analyzed at embryonic and early postnatal stages to determine specific effects on lung histology, and mRNA and protein expression of relevant lung morphoreulatory genes. Lastly, results measuring expression of the angiogenic factor, VEGF, were confirmed in vitro using a siRNA-knockdown strategy in cultured mouse lung epithelial cells., RESULTS: Our results showed that IKKbeta deletion in the lung epithelium transiently decreased alveolar type I and type II cells and myofibroblasts and delayed alveolar formation. These effects were mediated through increased alveolar type II cell apoptosis and decreased epithelial VEGF expression., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that epithelial NF-kappaB plays a critical role in early alveolar development possibly through regulation of VEGF.

AB  - Sex as a biological variable plays a critical role both during lung development and in modulating postnatal hyperoxic lung injury and repair. The molecular mechanisms behind these sex-specific differences need to be elucidated. Our objective was to determine if the neonatal lung epigenomic landscape reconfiguration has profound effects on gene expression and could underlie sex-biased differences in protection from or susceptibility to diseases. Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO, PND 1-5: saccular stage) or room air and euthanized on PND 7 and 21. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and quantified. Epigenomic landscape was assessed using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) of the H3K27ac histone modification mark, associated with active genes, enhancers, and super-enhancers. These data were then integrated, pathways identified and validated. Sex-biased epigenetic modulation of gene expression leads to differential regulation of biological processes in the developing lung at baseline and after exposure to hyperoxia. The female lung exhibits a more robust epigenomic response for the H3K27ac mark in response to hyperoxia. Epigenomic changes distribute over genomic and epigenomic domains in a sex-specific manner. The differential epigenomic responses also enrich for key transcription regulators crucial for lung development. In addition, by utilizing H3K27ac as the target epigenomic change we were also able to identify new epigenomic reprogramming at super-enhancers. Finally, we report for the first time that the upregulation of p21 (Cdkn1a) in the injured neonatal lung could be mediated through gain of H3K27ac. These data demonstrate that modulation of transcription via epigenomic landscape alterations may contribute to the sex-specific differences in preterm neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and repair.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation (MV) of very premature infants contributes to lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the effects of which can be long-lasting. Little is currently known about the ability of the very immature lung to recover from ventilator-induced lung injury. Our objective was to determine the ability of the injured very immature lung to repair in the absence of continued ventilation and to identify potential mechanisms. At 125 days gestational age (days GA, 0.85 of term), fetal sheep were partially exposed by hysterotomy under anesthesia and aseptic conditions; they were intubated and ventilated for 2 h with an injurious MV protocol and then returned to the uterus to continue development. Necropsy was performed at either 1 day (short-term group, 126 days GA, n = 6) or 15 days (long-term group, 140 days GA, n = 5) after MV; controls were unventilated (n = 7-8). At 1 day after MV, lungs displayed signs of injury, including hemorrhage, disorganized elastin and collagen deposition in the distal airspaces, altered morphology, significantly reduced secondary septal crest density, and decreased airspace. Bronchioles had thickened epithelium with evidence of injury and sloughing. Relative mRNA levels of early response genes (connective tissue growth factor, cysteine-rich 61, and early growth response-1) and proinflammatory cytokines [interleukins (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta] were not different between groups 1 day after MV. At 15 days after MV, lung structure was normal with no evidence of injury. We conclude that 2 h of MV induces severe injury in the very immature lung and that these lungs have the capacity to repair spontaneously in the absence of further ventilation.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) increases the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Abnormal lung structure has been noted in animal models of IUGR, but whether IUGR adversely impacts fetal pulmonary vascular development and pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) function is unknown. We hypothesized that IUGR would decrease fetal pulmonary alveolarization, vascular growth, and in vitro PAEC function. Studies were performed in an established model of severe placental insufficiency and IUGR induced by exposing pregnant sheep to elevated temperatures. Alveolarization, quantified by radial alveolar counts, was decreased 20% (P < 0.005) in IUGR fetuses. Pulmonary vessel density was decreased 44% (P < 0.01) in IUGR fetuses. In vitro, insulin increased control PAEC migration, tube formation, and nitric oxide (NO) production. This response was absent in IUGR PAECs. VEGFA stimulated tube formation, and NO production also was absent. In control PAECs, insulin increased cell growth by 68% (P < 0.0001). Cell growth was reduced in IUGR PAECs by 29% at baseline (P < 0.01), and the response to insulin was attenuated (P < 0.005). Despite increased basal and insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in IUGR PAECs, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein expression as well as basal and insulin-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation were decreased in IUGR PAECs. Both VEGFA and VEGFR2 also were decreased in IUGR PAECs. We conclude that fetuses with IUGR are characterized by decreased alveolar and vascular growth and PAEC dysfunction in vitro. This may contribute to the increased risk for adverse respiratory outcomes and BPD in infants with IUGR.

AB  - There is no effective intervention to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Curcumin has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and it modulates signaling of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), an important molecule in the pathobiology of BPD. However, its role in the prevention of BPD is not known. We determined 1) if curcumin enhances neonatal lung maturation, 2) if curcumin protects against hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, and 3) if this protection is mediated by blocking TGF-beta. Embryonic day 19 fetal rat lung fibroblasts were exposed to 21% or 95% O(2) for 24 h following 1 h of treatment with curcumin. Curcumin dose dependently accelerated e19 fibroblast differentiation [increased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) receptor, PPARgamma, and adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP) levels and triolein uptake] and proliferation (increased thymidine incorporation). Pretreatment with curcumin blocked the hyperoxia-induced decrease (PPARgamma and ADRP) and increase (alpha-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin) in markers of lung injury/repair, as well as the activation of TGF-beta signaling. In a separate set of experiments, neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to 21% or 95% O(2) for 7 days with or without intraperitoneal administration of curcumin. Analysis for markers of lung injury/repair [PTHrP receptor, PPARgamma, ADRP, fibronectin, TGF-beta receptor (activin receptor-like kinase 5), and Smad3] and lung morphology (radial alveolar count) demonstrated that curcumin effectively blocks TGF-beta activation and hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Therefore, curcumin accelerates lung maturation by stimulating key alveolar epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and prevents hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury, possibly by blocking TGF-beta activation, suggesting that it is a potential intervention against BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: The molecular mechanism(s) by which mechanical ventilation disrupts alveolar development, a hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is unknown., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of 24 h of mechanical ventilation on lung cell cycle regulators, cell proliferation and alveolar formation in newborn rats., METHODS: Seven-day old rats were ventilated with room air for 8, 12 and 24 h using relatively moderate tidal volumes (8.5 mL.kg-1)., MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Ventilation for 24 h (h) decreased the number of elastin-positive secondary crests and increased the mean linear intercept, indicating arrest of alveolar development. Proliferation (assessed by BrdU incorporation) was halved after 12 h of ventilation and completely arrested after 24 h. Cyclin D1 and E1 mRNA and protein levels were decreased after 8-24 h of ventilation, while that of p27(Kip1) was significantly increased. Mechanical ventilation for 24 h also increased levels of p57(Kip2), decreased that of p16(INK4a), while the levels of p21(Waf/Cip1) and p15(INK4b) were unchanged. Increased p27(Kip1) expression coincided with reduced phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) at Thr157, Thr187 and Thr198 (p<0.05), thereby promoting its nuclear localization. Similar -but more rapid- changes in cell cycle regulators were noted when 7-day rats were ventilated with high tidal volume (40 mL.kg-1) and when fetal lung epithelial cells were subjected to a continuous (17% elongation) cyclic stretch., CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that prolonged (24 h) of mechanical ventilation causes cell cycle arrest in newborn rat lungs; the arrest occurs in G1 and is caused by increased expression and nuclear localization of Cdk inhibitor proteins (p27(Kip1), p57(Kip2)) from the Kip family.

AB  - The pathological hallmarks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most common long-term pulmonary complications associated with preterm birth, include arrested alveolarization, abnormal vascular growth, and variable interstitial fibrosis. Severe BPD is often complicated by pulmonary hypertension characterized by excessive pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy that significantly contributes to the mortality and morbidity of these infants. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a multifunctional protein that coordinates complex biological processes during tissue development and remodeling. We have previously shown that conditional overexpression of CTGF in airway epithelium under the control of the Clara cell secretory protein promoter results in BPD-like architecture in neonatal mice. In this study, we have generated a doxycycline-inducible double transgenic mouse model with overexpression of CTGF in alveolar type II epithelial (AT II) cells under the control of the surfactant protein C promoter. Overexpression of CTGF in neonatal mice caused dramatic macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in alveolar air spaces and perivascular regions. Overexpression of CTGF also significantly decreased alveolarization and vascular development. Furthermore, overexpression of CTGF induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Most importantly, we have also demonstrated that these pathological changes are associated with activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/glucose synthesis kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta)/beta-catenin signaling. These data indicate that overexpression of CTGF in AT II cells results in lung pathology similar to those observed in infants with severe BPD and that ILK/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling may play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe BPD.

AB  - Survivors of moderate-to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia have impaired alveologenesis lasting at least into early adult life. The mechanisms underlying this long-term effect are unknown. We hypothesized that short-term inhibition of growth factor-mediated early alveolar formation would result in a long-term impairment of subsequent alveologenesis. Neonatal rats were injected daily with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor antagonist, imatinib mesylate, from day 1-7 of life, to inhibit the early alveolar formation occurring by in-growth of secondary crests into precursor saccules. The pups were then allowed to recover for 7, 14, 21, or 58 days. In imatinib-treated pups, DNA synthesis in total lung cells, and specifically in cells of secondary crests, was reduced at day 8 of life, had rebounded on day 14 of life but was then again reduced by day 28 of life. At day 8 of life, imatinib-treated pups had impaired alveologenesis as reflected by a decrease in secondary crests, an increase in alveolar size, and an overall decrease in both estimated alveolar number and generations compared with age-matched controls. No meaningful recovery was observed, even after a 21- or 58-day recovery period. The lungs of imatinib-treated pups had increased fibulin-5 content and an abnormal deposition of elastin. We conclude that reduced signaling through the PDGF pathways, at an early stage of alveologenesis, can result in long-lasting changes in lung architecture. A likely mechanism is through impaired formation of the elastin scaffold required for alveolarization.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation is a risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Fifteen minutes of high tidal volume (V(T)) ventilation induces inflammatory cytokine expression in small airways and lung parenchyma within 3 h. Our objective was to describe the temporal progression of cytokine and maturation responses to lung injury in fetal sheep exposed to a defined 15-min stretch injury. After maternal anesthesia and hysterotomy, 129-day gestation fetal lambs (n = 7-8/group) had the head and chest exteriorized. Each fetus was intubated, and airway fluid was gently removed. While placental support was maintained, the fetus received ventilation with an escalating V(T) to 15 ml/kg without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for 15 min using heated, humidified 100% nitrogen. The fetus was then returned to the uterus for 1, 6, or 24 h. Control lambs received a PEEP of 2 cmH(2)O for 15 min. Tissue samples from the lung and systemic organs were evaluated. Stretch injury increased the early response gene Egr-1 and increased expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines within 1 h. The injury induced granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA and matured monocytes to alveolar macrophages by 24 h. The mRNA for the surfactant proteins A, B, and C increased in the lungs by 24 h. The airway epithelium demonstrated dynamic changes in heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) over time. Serum cortisol levels did not increase, and induction of systemic inflammation was minimal. We conclude that a brief period of high V(T) ventilation causes a proinflammatory cascade, a maturation of lung monocytic cells, and an induction of surfactant protein mRNA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships among cerebral palsy (CP) phenotypes and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) severity and, in the process, to generate hypotheses regarding causal pathways linking BPD to CP., STUDY DESIGN: We studied 1047 infants born before the 28th week of gestation. Receipt of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), with or without the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) at 36 weeks PMA, defined two levels of BPD. At 24 months, the children underwent neurologic examinations and CP diagnoses were made using an algorithm based on topographic localisation., RESULTS: The 536 infants with BPD were at increased risk of all three CP phenotypes. In time-oriented multivariable analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, receipt of supplemental oxygen without MV at 36 weeks PMA (BPD) was not associated with increased risk of any CP phenotype. In contrast, BPD accompanied by MV at 36 weeks PMA (BPD/MV) was associated with a nearly sixfold increased risk of quadriparesis and a fourfold increased risk of diparesis., CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with both MV and supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA strongly predicts the more common bilateral CP phenotypes. BPD without MV at 36 weeks PMA was not significantly associated with any form of CP.

AB  - Thrombotic events are being increasingly recognized during the neonatal period. An infant girl was born at 29 weeks' gestation after a pregnancy complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. After an initial uncomplicated clinical course, her oxygen requirement increased, which was interpreted as an early sign of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At 3 weeks of age, she suddenly collapsed and died of severe pulmonary hypertension. At autopsy, multiple pulmonary artery emboli and several older renal vein thromboses were found. Results of genetic analyses of the infant and her family were negative for thrombophilia. Although embolism represents a frequent emergency in adults, fatal pulmonary embolism has never, to our knowledge, been described for premature infants. This case suggests that thrombotic events are underdiagnosed and that additional studies are needed to define infants at risk and optimal treatment strategies.

AB  - Ureaplasma species, the most commonly isolated microorganisms in women with chorioamnionitis, are associated with preterm delivery. Chorioamnionitis increases the risk and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns. It is not known whether the timing of exposure to inflammation in utero is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that chronic inflammation would alter the pulmonary air space and vascular development after 70 days of exposure to infection. Pregnant ewes were given intra-amniotic injection of Ureaplasma parvum serovars 3 or 6 at low (2 x 10(4) cfu) or high doses (2 x 10(7) cfu) or media (controls) at 55 days gestational age. Fetuses were delivered at 125 days (term = 150 days). U. parvum was grown from the lungs of all exposed fetuses, and neutrophils and monocytes were increased in the air spaces. Lung mRNA expression of IL-1beta and IL-8, but not IL-6, was modestly increased in U. parvum-exposed fetuses. U. parvum exposure increased surfactant and improved lung gas volumes. The changes in lung inflammation and maturation were independent of serovar or dose. Exposure to U. parvum did not change multiple indices of air space or vascular development. Parenchymal elastin and collagen content were similar between groups. Expression of several endothelial proteins and pulmonary resistance arteriolar media thickness were also not different between groups. We conclude that chronic exposure to U. parvum does not cause sustained effects on air space or vascular development in premature lambs.

AB  - PURPOSE: The VICI-trial reported that in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were equivalent using conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The purpose of this study was to determine if the mode of ventilation at the time of CDH repair affected mortality or oxygen dependence at 28 days., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants born wih CDH from 1991 to 2015. A generalized linear model was applied to the data using a propensity score analysis., RESULTS: Eighty patients met the inclusion criteria; at the time of surgery 39 (48.8%) patients were on HFV and 41 (51.3%) patients were on CMV. In the HFV group, 16 (47.1%) patients remained oxygen dependent and there were 5 (12.8%) deaths at 28 days. In the CMV group, 5 (12.2%) patients remained oxygen dependent at 28 days but none had died. The base model demonstrated that the HFV group had increased rates of oxygen dependence [OR = 6.40 (2.13, 22.2), p = 0.002]. However, after propensity score analysis, we found no difference between HFV and CMV., CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that in infants with CDH, there is no significant difference between HFV and CMV in oxygen dependency or death.

AB  - Hypercapnia is regularly observed in chronic lung disease, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Hypercapnia results in increased nitric oxide synthase activity and in vitro formation of nitrates. Neural vasculature of the immature subject is particularly sensitive to nitrative stress. We investigated whether exposure to clinically relevant sustained high CO(2) causes microvascular degeneration in the newborn brain by inducing nitrative stress, and whether this microvascular degeneration has an impact on brain growth. Newborn rat pups were exposed to 10% CO(2) as inspired gas (Pa(CO(2)) = 60-70 mmHg) starting within 24 h of birth until postnatal day 7 (P7). Brains were notably collected at different time points to measure vascular density, determine brain cortical nitrite/nitrate, and trans-arachidonic acids (TAAs; products of nitration) levels as effectors of vessel damage. Chronic exposure of rat pups to high CO(2) (Pa(CO(2)) approximately 65 mmHg) induced a 20% loss in cerebrovascular density at P3 and a 15% decrease in brain mass at P7; at P30, brain mass remained lower in CO(2)-exposed animals. Within 24 h of exposure to CO(2), brain eNOS expression and production of nitrite/nitrate doubled, lipid nitration products (TAAs) increased, and protein nitration (3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity) was also coincidently augmented on brain microvessels (lectin positive). Intracerebroventricular injection of TAAs (10 microM) replicated cerebrovascular degeneration. Treatment of rat pups with NOS inhibitor (L-N(omega)-nitroarginine methyl ester) or a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst (FeTPPS) prevented hypercapnia-induced microvascular degeneration and preserved brain mass. Cytotoxic effects of high CO(2) were reproduced in vitro/ex vivo on cultured endothelial cells and sprouting microvessels. In summary, hypercapnia at values frequently observed in preterm infants with chronic lung disease results in increased nitrative stress, which leads to cerebral cortical microvascular degeneration and curtails brain growth.

AB  - The fetal lung vasculature forms in tandem with developing airways. Whereas saccular airway morphogenesis is arrested in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the potential vascular phenotype in BPD at this stage of development is less well-understood. As inflammation increases the risk of BPD and induces arrest of saccular airway morphogenesis, we tested the effects of Escherichia coli LPS on fetal mouse lung vascular development. Injecting LPS into the amniotic fluid of Tie2-lacZ endothelial reporter mice at embryonic day 15 stimulated angiogenesis in the saccular stage fetal lung mesenchyme. LPS also increased the number of endothelial cells in saccular stage fetal mouse lung explants. Inflammation appeared to directly promote vascular development, as LPS stimulated pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell angiogenesis, cell migration, and proliferation in vitro. Whereas LPS did not increase expression of VEGF, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Tie2, fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1), fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1), PDGFA, PDGFB, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), or connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), LPS did stimulate the production of the angiogenic CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Both MIP-1alpha and MCP-1 increased angiogenesis in fetal mouse lung explants. In addition, inhibitory antibodies against MIP-1alpha and MCP-1 blocked the effects of LPS on fetal lung vascular development, suggesting these chemokines are downstream mediators of LPS-induced angiogenesis. We speculate that an inflammation-mediated surge in angiogenesis could lead to formation of aberrant alveolar capillaries in the lungs of patients developing BPD.

AB  - Neonatal hyperoxia impairs vascular and alveolar growth in mice and decreases endothelial progenitor cells. To determine the role of bone marrow-derived cells in restoration of neonatal lung structure after injury, we studied a novel bone marrow myeloid progenitor cell population from Tie2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice (bone marrow-derived angiogenic cells; BMDAC). We hypothesized that treatment with BMDAC would restore normal lung structure in infant mice during recovery from neonatal hyperoxia. Neonatal mice (1-day-old) were exposed to 80% oxygen for 10 days. BMDACs (1 x 10(5)), embryonic endothelial progenitor cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (control), or saline were then injected into the pulmonary circulation. At 21 days of age, saline-treated mice had enlarged alveoli, reduced septation, and a reduction in vascular density. In contrast, mice treated with BMDAC had complete restoration of lung structure that was indistinguishable from room air controls. BMDAC comprised 12% of distal lung cells localized to pulmonary vessels or alveolar type II (AT2) cells and persist (8.8%) for 8 wk postinjection. Coculture of AT2 cells or lung endothelial cells (luEC) with BMDAC augmented AT2 and luEC cell growth in vitro. We conclude that treatment with BMDAC after neonatal hyperoxia restores lung structure in this model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Despite tremendous technological and therapeutic advances, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a leading cause of respiratory morbidity in very low birth weight infants, and there are no effective preventive and/or therapeutic options. We have previously reported that hyperoxia-induced neonatal rat lung injury might be prevented by rosiglitazone (RGZ). Here, we characterize 1) perturbations in wingless/Int (Wnt) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling, and 2) structural aberrations in lung morphology following 7-day continuous in vivo hyperoxia exposure to neonatal rats. We also tested whether treatment of neonatal pups with RGZ, concomitant to hyperoxia, could prevent such aberrations. Our study revealed that hyperoxia caused significant upregulation of Wnt signaling protein markers lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (Lef-1) and beta-catenin and TGF-beta pathway transducers phosphorylated Smad3 and Smad7 proteins in whole rat lung extracts. These changes were also accompanied by upregulation of myogenic marker proteins alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and calponin but significant downregulation of the lipogenic marker peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) expression. These molecular perturbations were associated with reduction in alveolar septal thickness, radial alveolar count, and larger alveoli in the hyperoxia-exposed lung. These hyperoxia-induced molecular and morphological changes were prevented by systemic administration of RGZ, with lung sections appearing near normal. This is the first evidence that in vivo hyperoxia induces activation of both Wnt and TGF-beta signal transduction pathways in lung and of its near complete prevention by RGZ. Hyperoxia-induced arrest in alveolar development, a hallmark of BPD, along with these molecular changes strongly implicates these proteins in hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Administration of PPARgamma agonists may thus be a potential strategy to attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung injury and subsequent BPD.

AB  - Chorioamnionitis, a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants, causes an influx of inflammatory cells into the fetal lung. Using a fetal sheep model, we evaluated the time course of activation, functional maturity, and apoptosis of the leukocytes recruited to the fetal air spaces by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Time-mated sheep were given intra-amniotic injections with 10 mg of Escherichia coli LPS or saline 2 or 7 days before preterm delivery at 124 days of gestation (term is 150 days). Both neutrophils and monocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) had activated NF-kappaB after 2- and 7-day LPS exposures. These neutrophils and monocytes expressed the activation factor CD11b and the maturation factor PU.1 at 2 days, and increased PU.1 expression was detected in macrophages at 7 days. Leukocyte oxidative burst activity was greatest at 7 days. BALF lipid peroxidation increased fivefold at 2 days, while protein carbonyls increased eightfold at 7 days. Nitrative stress was not detected in the BALF, but leukocytes in the lung expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS)II (inducible NOS). BALF leukocytes expressed the antioxidant peroxiredoxin V. Lung glutathione peroxidase was also increased with LPS exposure. There was minimal apoptosis of airway and lung leukocytes assessed by caspase-3 activation. Intra-amniotic LPS recruits leukocytes to the fetal air space that have a persistent activation. These results have implications for the pathogenesis of lung inflammatory disorders in the preterm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal pulmonary inflammation is associated with reduced risk for respiratory distress syndrome but with an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with impaired alveogenesis., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that fetal systemic inflammation induced by intravenous (IV) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) would affect lung development in utero., STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-one fetal sheep were instrumented (107 days gestational age). Control fetuses received saline (N = 12) and 9 in the study group received 100 ng of LPS IV 3 days after surgery. Animals were assessed for lung maturation and structure after 3 (N = 5) and 7 (N = 4) days., RESULTS: Interleukin-6 concentration increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage more than 40-fold 3 days after LPS IV. Processing of pro-surfactant protein (SP)-B to mature SP-B and increased SP-B concentrations were shown 7 days after LPS IV. Deposition of elastin fibers at sites of septation was disturbed within 3 days after LPS IV., CONCLUSION: Lung maturation and disturbed lung structure occurred after short-term exposure to fetal inflammation and suggests new targeted therapies for BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very preterm infants. It has been proposed that the risk of developing BPD may be associated with host genetic factors that regulate TNF production. The most commonly studied variant is the guanine to adenine transition at position -308 nucleotides relative to the transcription start site (TNF -308A). However, studies that have examined the association between TNF (-308A) and BPD have reported conflicting findings and have been generally underpowered to exclude plausible genotypic risks., AIM: To systematically review evidence for the association of TNF (-308A) with BPD., METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic association studies., RESULTS: Six cohort studies in which a total of 804 preterm infants participated were identified. The studies were generally of fair methodological quality. None of the individual studies or a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the six studies found a significant association of TNF (-308A) genotype with the development of BPD: pooled relative risk 1.03 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.25)., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the TNF (-308A) polymorphism is not strongly associated with the risk of developing BPD in very preterm infants. The 95% confidence interval is consistent with an association no stronger than a relative increase in risk of 25%. Future research efforts to define genetic predisposition to BPD should focus on alternative candidate genes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of cord blood proteins and antenatal factors in the prediction of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., STUDY DESIGN: The prospectively collected cohort included 163 infants. All infants were born between 1998-2002 in a single regional hospital before 32 weeks of gestation and survived the first hospitalization. Altogether, 107 cord blood proteins were analyzed. Twenty-two antenatal clinical factors were included in the data mining and logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: The incidence of RDS was 64% and of BPD was 25%. Histologic chorioamnionitis protected from RDS (odds ratio [OR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.53; P < .001). Besides the length of gestation, other clinical factors poorly predicted the outcomes. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 independently predicted RDS (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 3.0-23.1; P < .001). Soluble glycoprotein 130 independently predicted BPD (OR, 6.07; 95%CI, 2.20-16.7; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Specific antenatal immunologic activation predicts either acute or chronic respiratory disease in very preterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastric fluid microbes were examined in preterm infants at birth to assess their influence on the postnatal outcome., STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study., SETTING: Level III neonatal intensive care unit., PATIENTS: A total of 103 premature neonates with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Gastric fluid microbes were identified by analysis of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Additionally, the urease gene of Ureaplasma species was detected by polymerase chain reaction of gastric fluid obtained at birth and/or tracheal aspirate from ventilated preterm infants. The association between detection of microbes and bronchopulmonary dysplasia was investigated through assessment from clinical features and by a lung injury marker (KL-6)., RESULTS: Forty-two of 103 gastric fluid specimens were positive for microbes. Ureaplasma species were detected in 23 of the 42 (55%) gastric fluid specimens. All infants with Ureaplasma species in tracheal aspirate fluid also had positive gastric fluid specimens. Compared to infants negative for gastric fluid microbes, infants positive for microbes had higher rates of maternal chorioamnionitis (18% vs 78%), premature rupture of membranes (11% vs 55%), severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (1.6% vs 14%) and showed higher plasma KL-6 levels during the initial 4 weeks of life., CONCLUSION: Detection of gastric fluid microbes was correlated well with antenatal infection and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Detection of Ureaplasma species in gastric fluid was associated with subsequent respiratory colonisation. These results suggest that antenatal exposure of the immature fetus to microbes may cause lung injury and promote the onset of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alveolarization requires coordinated extracellular matrix remodeling, a process in which matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role. We postulated that polymorphisms in MMP genes might affect MMP function in preterm lungs and thus influence the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two hundred and eighty-four consecutive neonates with a gestational age of <28 weeks were included in this prospective study. Forty-five neonates developed BPD. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were sought in the MMP2, MMP14 and MMP16 genes. After adjustment for birth weight and ethnic origin, the TT genotype of MMP16 C/T (rs2664352) and the GG genotype of MMP16 A/G (rs2664349) were found to protect from BPD. These genotypes were also associated with a smaller active fraction of MMP2 and with a 3-fold-lower MMP16 protein level in tracheal aspirates collected within 3 days after birth. Further evaluation of MMP16 expression during the course of normal human and rat lung development showed relatively low expression during the canalicular and saccular stages and a clear increase in both mRNA and protein levels during the alveolar stage. In two newborn rat models of arrested alveolarization the lung MMP16 mRNA level was less than 50% of normal., CONCLUSIONS: MMP16 may be involved in the development of lung alveoli. MMP16 polymorphisms appear to influence not only the pulmonary expression and function of MMP16 but also the risk of BPD in premature infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Most studies of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) for prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants have focused on short-term mortality and morbidity. Our aim was to determine the long-term effects of iNO., METHODS: A 7-year follow-up was undertaken of infants entered into a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of iNO for prevention of BPD in premature infants born between 24 and 28 weeks plus six days of gestation. At 7 years, survival and hospital admissions since the 2-year follow-up, home oxygen therapy in the past year, therapies used in the previous month and growth assessments were determined. Questionnaires were used to compare general health, well-being, and quality of life., RESULTS: A total of 305 children were assessed. No deaths were reported. Rates of hospitalization for respiratory problems (6.6 vs. 10.5%, iNO and placebo group, respectively) and use of respiratory medications (6.6 vs. 9.2%) were similar. Two patients who received iNO and one who received placebo had received home oxygen therapy. There were no significant differences in any questionnaire-documented health outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: iNO for prevention of BPD in very premature infants with respiratory distress did not result in long-term benefits or adverse long-term sequelae. In the light of current evidence, routine use of iNO cannot be recommended for prevention of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) is increased in lung injury following hyperoxia exposure in neonatal mice, in association with impaired alveolar development. We studied the role of MMP-9 in the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced functional and histological changes in neonatal mouse lung. Reduced alveolarization with remodeling of ECM is a major morbidity component of oxidant injury in developing lung. MMP-9 mediates oxidant injury in developing lung causing altered lung remodeling. Five-day-old neonatal wild-type (WT) and MMP-9 (-/-) mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 8 days. The lungs were inflation fixed, and sections were examined for morphometry. The mean linear intercept and alveolar counts were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry for MMP-9 and elastin was performed. MMP-2, MMP-9, type I collagen, and tropoelastin were measured by Western blot analysis. Lung quasistatic compliance was studied in anaesthetized mice. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly increased in lungs of WT mice exposed to hyperoxia compared with controls. Immunohistochemistry showed an increase in MMP-9 in mesenchyme and alveolar epithelium of hyperoxic lungs. The lungs of hyperoxia-exposed WT mice had less gas exchange surface area and were less compliant compared with room air-exposed WT and hyperoxia-exposed MMP-9 (-/-) mice. Type I collagen and tropoelastin were increased in hyperoxia-exposed WT with aberrant elastin staining. These changes were ameliorated in hyperoxia-exposed MMP-9 (-/-) mice. MMP-9 plays an important role in the structural changes consequent to oxygen-induced lung injury. Blocking MMP-9 activity may lead to novel therapeutic approaches in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Elevated level of oxygen (hyperoxia) is widely used in critical care units and in respiratory insufficiencies. In addition, hyperoxia has been implicated in many diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although hyperoxia is known to cause DNA base modifications and strand breaks, the DNA damage response has not been adequately investigated. We have investigated the effect of hyperoxia on DNA damage signaling and show that hyperoxia is a unique stress that activates the ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM)- and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR)-dependent p53 phosphorylations (Ser6, -15, -37, and -392), phosphorylation of histone H2AX (Ser139), and phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). In addition, we show that phosphorylation of p53 (Ser6) and histone H2AX (Ser139) depend on both ATM and ATR. We demonstrate that ATR activation precedes ATM activation in hyperoxia. Finally, we show that ATR is required for ATM activation in hyperoxia. Taken together, we report that ATR is the major DNA damage signal transducer in hyperoxia that activates ATM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to study the association between pepsin in tracheal aspirate samples and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants., METHODS: Serial tracheal aspirate samples were collected during the first 28 days from mechanically ventilated preterm neonates. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. An enzymatic assay with a fluorescent substrate was used to detect pepsin. Total protein was measured by the Bradford assay to correct for the dilution during lavage. Immunohistochemistry using antibody against human pepsinogen was performed in 10 lung tissue samples from preterm infants., RESULTS: A total of 256 tracheal aspirate samples were collected from 59 preterm neonates. Pepsin was detected in 234 (91.4%) of 256 of the tracheal aspirate samples. Twelve infants had no bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 31 infants developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and 16 infants died before 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. The mean pepsin concentration was significantly lower in infants with no bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with those who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia or developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia/died before 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Moreover, the mean pepsin level was significantly higher in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with moderate bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The mean pepsin level in tracheal aspirate samples from the first 7 days was also lower in infants with no bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with those who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia or developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia/died before 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Pepsinogen was not localized in the lung tissues by immunohistochemistry., CONCLUSION: The concentration of pepsin was increased in the tracheal aspirate of preterm infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia or died before 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Recovery of pepsin in tracheal aspirate samples is secondary to gastric aspiration, not by hematogenous spread or local synthesis in the lungs. Chronic aspiration of gastric contents may contribute in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Neuregulin is an important growth factor in fetal surfactant synthesis, and downregulation of its receptor, ErbB4, impairs fetal surfactant synthesis. We hypothesized that pulmonary ErbB4 deletion will affect the developing lung leading to an abnormal postnatal lung function. ErbB4-deleted lungs of 11- to 14-wk-old adult HER4heart mice, rescued from their lethal cardiac defects, were studied for the effect on lung function, alveolarization, and the surfactant system. ErbB4 deletion impairs lung function and structure in HER4heart mice resulting in a hyperreactive airway system and alveolar simplification, as seen in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It also leads to a downregulation of surfactant protein D expression and an underlying chronic inflammation in these lungs. Our findings suggest that this animal model could be used to further study the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and might help design protective interventions.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, the mechanisms by which excessive stretch of fetal or neonatal type II epithelial cells contributes to lung injury are not well defined. In these investigations, isolated embryonic day 19 fetal rat type II epithelial cells were cultured on substrates coated with fibronectin and exposed to 5% or 20% cyclic stretch to simulate mechanical forces during lung development or lung injury, respectively. Twenty percent stretch of fetal type II epithelial cells increased necrosis, apoptosis, and proliferation compared with control, unstretched samples. By ELISA and real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), 20% stretch increased secretion of IL-8 into the media and IL-8 gene expression and inhibited IL-10 release. Interestingly, administration of recombinant IL-10 before 20% stretch did not affect cell lysis but significantly reduced apoptosis and IL-8 release compared with stretched samples without IL-10. Collectively, our studies suggest that IL-10 may play an important role in protection of fetal type II epithelial cells from injury secondary to stretch.

AB  - Hyperoxia is one of the major contributors to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease in premature infants. Emerging evidence suggests that the arrested lung development of BPD is associated with pulmonary endothelial cell death and vascular dysfunction resulting from hyperoxia-induced lung injury. A better understanding of the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell death will provide critical information for the pathogenesis and therapeutic development of BPD. Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) is a protein secreted from endothelial cells. It plays an important role in vascular tubulogenesis. In the present study, we found that Egfl7 gene expression was significantly decreased in the neonatal rat lungs after hyperoxic exposure. The Egfl7 expression was returned to near normal level 2 wk after discounting oxygen exposure during recovery period. In cultured human endothelial cells, hyperoxia also significantly reduced Egfl7 expression. These observations suggest that diminished levels of Egfl7 expression might be associated with hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell death and lung injury. When we overexpressed human Egfl7 (hEgfl7) in EA.hy926 human endothelial cell line, we found that hEgfl7 overexpression could partially block cytochrome c release from mitochondria and decrease caspase-3 activation. Further Western blotting analyses showed that hEgfl7 overexpression could reduce expression of a proapoptotic protein, Bax, and increase expression of an antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-xL. Theses findings indicate that hEGFL7 may protect endothelial cell from hyperoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibition of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One-third to one-half of all infants born before the 28th week of gestation develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Inflammatory regulators appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD, possibly beginning in fetal life. To evaluate the feasibility of using expression profiling in umbilical cord tissue to discover molecular signatures for developmental staging and for determining risk of BPD, we conducted a cross-sectional study of infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation (n = 54). Sections of umbilical cord were obtained at birth from 20 infants who later developed BPD and from 34 of their peers who did not develop BPD., RESULTS: Umbilical cord expression profiles at birth exhibited systematic differences in bioenergetic pathways with respect to gestational age. Infants who subsequently developed BPD had distinct signatures involving chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation pathways, which have previously been implicated in several adult onset lung diseases. These findings are consistent with prior work on inflammatory processes and bioenergetics in prematurity., CONCLUSION: This study of gene expression of the newborn umbilical cord implicates the chromatin remodeling pathways in those premature infants who subsequently develop BPD. Larger sample sizes will be required to generate prognostic markers from umbilical cord profiles.

AB  - An 8-mo-old infant born at 24-wk of gestation died unexpectedly 12 h after his ninth uneventful general anesthetic. Preoperatively, he required low-flow nasal oxygen due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic diuretic therapy, and IV alimentation. As planned preoperatively, the infant remained tracheally intubated after his elective surgery and went to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. However, over the next 6 h, he developed fever. The diagnosis of postoperative sepsis was considered. One hour before his death his temperature reached 43 degrees C. Autopsy documented Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and renal tubules containing myoglobin.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor blockade impairs lung growth and decreases nitric oxide (NO) production in neonatal rat lungs. Inhaled NO (iNO) treatment after VEGF inhibition preserves lung growth in infant rats by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that neonatal VEGF inhibition disrupts lung growth by causing apoptosis in endothelial cells, which is attenuated by early iNO treatment. Three-day-old rats received SU-5416, an inhibitor of VEGF receptor, or its vehicle and were raised in room air with or without iNO (10 ppm). SU-5416 reduced alveolar counts and lung vessel density by 28% (P < 0.005) and 21% (P < 0.05), respectively, as early as at 7 days of age. SU-5416 increased lung active caspase-3 protein by 60% at 5 days of age (P < 0.05), which subsided by 7 days of age, suggesting a transient increase in lung apoptosis after VEGF blockade. Apoptosis primarily colocalized to lung vascular endothelial cells, and SU-5416 increased endothelial cell apoptotic index by eightfold at 5 days of age (P <0.0001). iNO treatment after SU-5416 prevented the increases in lung active caspase-3 and in endothelial cell apoptotic index. There was no difference in alveolar type 2 cell number between control and SU-5416-treated rats. We conclude that neonatal VEGF receptor inhibition causes transient apoptosis in pulmonary endothelium, which is followed by persistently impaired lung growth. Early iNO treatment after VEGF inhibition reduces endothelial cell apoptosis in neonatal lungs. We speculate that enhancing endothelial cell survival after lung injury may preserve neonatal lung growth in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - In extending our previous studies toward development of an engineered distal lung tissue construct (M. J. Mondrinos, S. Koutzaki, E. Jiwanmall, M. Li, J. P. Dechadarevian, P. I. Lelkes, and C. M. Finck. Tissue Eng 12: 717-728, 2006), we studied the effects of exogenous fibroblast growth factors FGF10, FGF7, and FGF2 on mixed populations of embryonic day 17.5 murine fetal pulmonary cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels. The morphogenic effects of the FGFs alone and in various combinations were assessed by whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. FGF10/7 significantly increased epithelial budding and proliferation; however, only FGF10 alone induced widespread budding. FGF7 alone induced dilation of epithelial structures but not widespread budding. FGF2 alone had a similar dilation, but not budding, effect in epithelial structures, and, in addition, significantly enhanced endothelial tubular morphogenesis and network formation, as well as mesenchymal proliferation. The combination of FGF10/7/2 induced robust budding of epithelial structures and the formation of uniform endothelial networks in parallel. These data suggest that appropriate combinations of exogenous FGFs chosen to target specific FGF receptor isoforms will allow for control of lung epithelial and mesenchymal cell behavior in the context of an engineered system. We propose that tissue-engineered fetal distal lung constructs could provide a potential source of tissue or cells for lung augmentation in pediatric pulmonary pathologies, such as pulmonary hypoplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In addition, engineered systems will provide alternative in vitro venues for the study of lung developmental biology and pathobiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); however, there were rare researches about the changes of neutrophils and their influence on the prognosis of BPD. Hence, we aimed to explore the changes in the number of peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs), and the relationship between these changes and susceptibility to pulmonary infection among children with BPD., METHODS: Firstly, the gene expression of lung tissues and the number of PBNs were respectively detected by RNA sequencing and complete blood count in the 85% O2-induced BPD model rats. Then it was analyzed the number of PBNs after birth and the incidence of pneumonia within 6 months of corrected age (CA) after discharge among full-term infants (FTIs: gestational age [GA] between 370/7 and 416/7 weeks, n = 88), preterm infants with (PTIs-BPD: GA <32 weeks, n = 35) or without BPD (PTIs-nBPD: GA <32 weeks, n = 41)., RESULTS: The levels of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs were significantly decreased in the lungs of BPD rats. Moreover, the number of PBNs was also decreased in BPD rats. The number of PBNs at birth in FTIs was significantly greater than that in PTIs-BPD or in PTIs-nBPD (p < 0.001), while those between PTIs-BPD and PTIs-nBPD showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). Although the peripheral blood neutrophils decreased overall after birth in both PTIs-nBPD and PTIs-BPD groups, only the reduction in the PTIs-BPD group was significant (p < 0.001). Importantly, at 36-37 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA), the number of PBNs in PTIs-BPD was significantly fewer than that in PTIs-nBPD (p < 0.001). In addition, PTIs-BPD had a significantly higher incidence of pneumonia than PTIs-nBPD within 6 months of CA after discharge (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The number of PBNs in PTIs-BPD decreased progressively when compared to that in PTIs-nBPD, which might contribute to their susceptibility to pulmonary infection.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and its receptor, the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), have been associated with lung remodeling in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The goal of this study was to target TGF-alpha overexpression to the saccular phase of lung morphogenesis and determine early alterations in gene expression. Conditional lung-specific TGF-alpha bitransgenic mice and single-transgene control mice were generated. TGF-alpha overexpression was induced by doxycycline (Dox) treatment from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) to E18.5. After birth, all bitransgenic pups died by postnatal day 7 (P7). Lung histology at E18.5 and P1 showed abnormal lung morphogenesis in bitransgenic mice, characterized by mesenchymal thickening, vascular remodeling, and poor apposition of capillaries to distal air spaces. Surfactant levels (saturated phosphatidylcholine) were not reduced in bitransgenic mice. Microarray analysis was performed after 1 or 2 days of Dox treatment during the saccular (E17.5, E18.5) and alveolar phases (P4, P5) to identify genes induced by EGFR signaling that were shared or unique to each phase. We found 196 genes to be altered (>1.5-fold change; P < 0.01 for at least 2 time points), with only 32% similarly altered in both saccular and alveolar phases. Western blot analysis and immunostaining showed that five genes selected from the microarrays (egr-1, SP-B, SP-D, S100A4, and pleiotrophin) were also increased at the protein level. Pathological changes in TGF-alpha-overexpressing mice bore similarities to premature infants born in the saccular phase who develop BPD, including remodeling of the distal lung septae and arteries.

AB  - Chorioamnionitis alters lung development, resulting in a paradoxical decrease in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome but an increase in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mechanism(s) underlying this disparity in the pulmonary outcomes is not known. We hypothesized that specific alterations in alveolar epithelial-mesenchymal interactions might explain this apparent disparity in the pulmonary outcome following chorioamnionitis. We determined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-driven epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that are essential for normal lung development and homeostasis. Lung explants from embryonic day 19.5 Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses were treated with LPS with or without a PTHrP pathway agonist, prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ(2)). LPS treatment affected the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the expression of the key markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal paracrine interactions in a time-dependent manner. At 6 h, there was a significant increase in the expression of PTHrP and the other key markers of alveolar homeostasis without any significant effect on alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA). In contrast, at 72 h, there was a significant decrease in the expression of PTHrP and the other key markers of alveolar homeostasis accompanied by a significant increase in alphaSMA expression. The cytokine and molecular changes at 72 h were completely prevented by the concomitant treatment with PGJ(2). We speculate that these data provide a likely mechanism for the acute stimulation of lung differentiation, accompanied paradoxically by BPD following chorioamnionitis, and suggest that by specifically targeting PTHrP signaling, the inflammation-induced molecular injury that is known to result in BPD can be prevented.

AB  - Pulmonary injury is associated with the disruption of alveologenesis in the developing lung and causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in prematurely born infants. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is an important regulator of cellular differentiation and early lung development, and its levels are increased in newborn lung injury. Although overexpression of TGF-beta in the lungs of newborn animals causes pathological features that are consistent with BPD, the role of endogenous TGF-beta in the inhibition of the terminal stage of lung development is incompletely understood. In this investigation, the hypothesis that O(2)-induced injury of the maturing lung is associated with TGF-beta-mediated disruption of alveologenesis and microvascular development was tested using a murine model of BPD. Here we report that treatment of developing mouse lungs with TGF-beta-neutralizing antibodies attenuates the increase in pulmonary cell phospho-Smad2 nuclear localization, which is indicative of augmented TGF-beta signaling, associated with pulmonary injury induced by chronic inhalation of 85% oxygen. Importantly, the neutralization of the abnormal TGF-beta activity improves quantitative morphometric indicators of alveologenesis, extracellular matrix assembly, and microvascular development in the injured developing lung. Furthermore, exposure to anti-TGF-beta antibodies is associated with improved somatic growth in hyperoxic mouse pups and not with an increase in pulmonary inflammation. These studies indicate that excessive pulmonary TGF-beta signaling in the injured newborn lung has an important role in the disruption of the terminal stage of lung development. In addition, they suggest that anti-TGF-beta antibodies may be an effective therapy for preventing some important developmental diseases of the newborn lung.

AB  - Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) secondary to preterm birth and surfactant deficiency is characterized by severe hypoxemia, lung injury, and impaired production of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Since hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate the effects of both NO and VEGF in part through regulation by prolyl-hydroxylase-containing domains (PHDs) in the presence of oxygen, we hypothesized that HIF-1alpha and -2alpha in the lung are decreased following severe RDS in preterm neonatal lambs. To test this hypothesis, fetal lambs were delivered at preterm gestation (115-day gestation, term = 145 days; n = 4) and mechanically ventilated for 4 h. Lambs developed respiratory failure characterized by severe hypoxemia despite treatment with mechanical ventilation with high inspired oxygen concentrations. Lung samples were compared with nonventilated control animals at preterm (115-day gestation; n = 3) and term gestation (142-day gestation; n = 3). We found that HIF-1alpha protein expression decreased (P < 0.05) and PHD-2 expression increased (P < 0.005) at birth in normal term animals before air breathing. Compared with age-matched controls, HIF-1alpha protein and HIF-2alpha protein expression decreased by 80% and 55%, respectively (P < 0.005 for each) in preterm lambs with RDS. Furthermore, VEGF mRNA was decreased by 40%, and PHD-2 protein expression doubled in RDS lambs. We conclude that pulmonary expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, and the downstream target of their regulation, VEGF mRNA, is impaired following RDS in neonatal lambs. We speculate that early disruption of HIF and VEGF expression after preterm birth and RDS may contribute to long-term abnormalities in lung growth, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Exposure of rat pups to 100% oxygen is a model for studying neonatal lung injury. Airway reactivity is increased in this model, in part due to impaired airway smooth muscle (ASM) relaxation. We compared biochemical determinants of ASM contractility in rat pups exposed to 100% oxygen for 7 days vs. littermates raised in room air. The baseline quantities of ASM contractile proteins, extent of phosphorylation of the 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain (LC(20)), and amount of the myosin-binding subunit of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase (MYPT) were all comparable between the two groups. Bethanechol-induced contraction increased the extent of phosphorylation of both LC(20) and MYPT in the hyperoxic group (45% and 70% over control, respectively). Relaxation after electrical field stimulation demonstrated greater phosphorylation of both LC(20) and MYPT in the hyperoxic group compared with controls (67% and 84%, respectively). To determine if hyperoxia induced changes in the isoforms of MYPT, isoform expression was also compared but differences were not found. To determine potential mechanisms whereby MYPT phosphorylation was increased by hyperoxia, separate tracheas were treated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. This treatment completely eliminated differences in MYPT phosphorylation between the groups. Because phosphorylation of MYPT impairs the phosphatase activity of myosin phosphatase, these data suggest that hyperoxic conditioning during early postnatal life impairs relaxation through prolonging LC(20) phosphorylation. This mechanism might contribute to increased ASM reactivity seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endostatin is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. Angiogenesis is central for the development of the human lung. The role of endostatin in the development of the human lung and its connection to chronic lung disease remain unclear. We set out to study the role of endostatin in the developing human lung and in acute and chronic lung injury in the preterm infant., METHODS: Nine fetuses, 14 control neonates without primary lung disease, 14 preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, and 8 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were included in the immunohistochemistry study. Tracheal aspirate-fluid samples of intubated very low birth weight infants during postnatal weeks 1 through 5 were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: Endothelial cell staining was positive for endostatin in all 45 samples. Staining of epithelial cells (cuboidal, bronchiolar, and alveolar) was seen mostly in fetuses, as well as in infants with late respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Staining in alveolar macrophages was most abundant in infants with late respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Endostatin was expressed consistently in tracheal aspirate fluid, being highest during the first postnatal day. Higher endostatin concentrations correlated with parameters reflecting lower lung maturity., CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pulmonary endostatin protein expression in immunohistochemistry and consistent endostatin protein appearance in tracheal aspirate fluid in human preterm infants indicate a role in the physiologic development of the lung. Preterm birth influences pulmonary endostatin protein expression, which may alter normal lung development and response to lung injury.

AB  - Many extremely preterm infants continue to suffer from bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which results from abnormal saccular-stage lung development. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) is required for saccular lung development and reduced in the lung tissue of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Although exposure to bacteria increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, no molecular target has been identified connecting inflammatory stimuli and abnormal lung development. In an experimental mouse model of saccular lung development, activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibited FGF-10 expression, leading to abnormal saccular airway morphogenesis. In addition, Toll-mediated FGF-10 inhibition disrupted the normal positioning of myofibroblasts around saccular airways, similar to the mislocalization of myofibroblasts seen in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Reduced FGF-10 expression may therefore link the innate immune system and impaired lung development in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Preterm newborns developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) show persistently low levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in sera. They also present higher free IGF-I concentrations in epithelial lining fluids (ELFs) and lung tissues. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is a metalloproteinase that dissociates three binding proteins from the active form of IGF-I, namely free IGF-I. The present study analyzes the ELF concentrations of free IGF-I, PAPP-A, and their ratios in preterm newborns developing or not BPD, defined as O(2) dependence at 36 wk postmenstrual age. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of 41 infants (34 without and 7 with BPD) were analyzed on the 2nd and 4th day after birth. Infants developing BPD showed increased ELF free IGF-I and decreased PAPP-A concentrations on both days 2 and 4 compared with newborns without BPD. A nonsignificant trend between these 2 days was observed for free IGF-I (increasing) and PAPP-A (decreasing). On the same days, the free IGF-I-to-PAPP-A ratio was always significantly higher in patients developing BPD. These differences were more significant than those of IGF-I or PAPP-A when individually evaluated. A multivariate analysis confirmed the significance for free IGF-I on day 4, whereas the ratio was confirmed on both days 2 and 4. The same ratio was significantly correlated with some indexes of disease severity, such as hours of oxygen administration, days of hospitalization, and ROP severity scores. Finally, the ratio between ELF free IGF-I and PAPP-A appears to be a useful marker for lung injury of premature newborns.

AB  - Chorioamnionitis is frequently associated with preterm birth and increases the risk of adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is a key regulator of lung development, airway remodeling, lung fibrosis, and regulation of inflammation, and all these processes contribute to the development of BPD. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a downstream mediator of some of the profibrotic effects of TGF-beta1, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis. TGF-beta1-induced CTGF expression can be blocked by TNF-alpha. We asked whether chorioamnionitis-associated antenatal inflammation would regulate TGF-beta1, the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway, and CTGF in preterm lamb lungs. Fetal sheep were exposed to 4 mg of intra-amniotic endotoxin or saline for 5 h, 24 h, 72 h, or 7 days before preterm delivery at 125 days gestation (full term = 150 days). Intra-amniotic endotoxin increased lung TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein expression. Elevated TGF-beta1 levels were associated with TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2. CTGF was selectively expressed in lung endothelial cells in control lungs, and intra-amniotic endotoxin caused CTGF expression to decrease to 30% of control values and TNF-alpha protein to increase. The antenatal inflammation-induced TGF-beta1 expression and Smad signaling in the fetal lamb lung may contribute to impaired lung alveolarization and reduced lung inflammation. Decreased CTGF expression may inhibit vascular development or remodeling and limit lung fibrosis during remodeling. These effects may contribute to the impaired alveolar and pulmonary vascular development that is the hallmark of the new form of BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data support the role of interferon (IFN)gamma and interleukin (IL)12 in perinatal complications. IFNgamma T(+874)A and IL12 p40 promoter CTCTAA/GC polymorphisms may have an effect on cytokine production., METHODS: DNA was extracted from dried blood samples of 153 low birthweight (LBW) infants and 172 healthy term infants. IFNgamma and IL12 genetic polymorphisms were determined to investigate the association between polymorphisms and ventilation characteristics, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and other perinatal disorders., RESULTS: The IFNgamma(+874)A allele was over-represented in LBW infants. Carriers of the IFNgamma(+874)T allele required mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation for time periods 41% and 35%, respectively, shorter than those required by those not carrying the IFNgamma(+874)T allele. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that carriers of the IFNgamma(+874)T allele were protected against BPD (odds ratio (OR) 0.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) (0.12 to 0.99))) and patent ductus arteriosus (OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.97)), whereas carriers of the IFNgamma(+874)A allele were at higher risk of severe hypotension (OR 3.40 (95% CI 1.01 to 11.52)) and respiratory distress syndrome (OR 4.03 (95% CI 1.30 to 12.50)). Carriers of the IL12 GC allele were protected against pneumonia (OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.75)). Carriers of the IL12 CTCTAA allele were at higher risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC; OR 2.37 (95% CI 1.01 to 5.53))., CONCLUSIONS: Carrier state of the IFNgamma(+874)A allele presents an increased risk for premature birth and lung damage, as well as other perinatal complications. The risks of pneumonia and NEC are higher in heterozygotic carriers of the IL12 CTCTAA/GC polymorphism. Further studies are needed to determine whether these associations are the result of altered cytokine-producing capacity in infants carrying the tested alleles.

AB  - Rationale: Gestational cigarette smoke (CS) impairs lung angiogenesis and alveolarization, promoting transgenerational development of asthma and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a proangiogenic, pro-alveolarization, and anti-asthmatic gasotransmitter is synthesized by cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST). Objective: Determine if gestational CS exposure affected the expression of H2S synthesizing enzymes in the mouse lung and human placenta. Methods: Mice were exposed throughout gestational period to secondhand CS (SS) at approximating the dose of CS received by a pregnant woman sitting in a smoking bar for 3 h/days during pregnancy. Lungs from 7-days old control and SS-exposed pups and human placenta from mothers who were either non-smokers or smokers during pregnancy were analyzed for expression of the enzymes. Measurements: Mouse lungs and human placentas were examined for the expression of CSE, CBS, and 3MST by immunohistochemical staining, qRT-PCR and/or Western blot (WB) analyses. Results: Compared to controls, mouse lung exposed gestationally to SS had significantly lower levels of CSE, CBS, and 3MST. Moreover, the SS-induced suppression of CSE and CBS in F1 lungs was transmitted to the F2 generation without significant change in the magnitude of the suppression. These changes were associated with impaired epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-a process required for normal lung angiogenesis and alveolarization. Additionally, the placentas from mothers who smoked during pregnancy, expressed significantly lower levels of CSE, CBS, and 3MST, and the effects were partially moderated by quitting smoking during the first trimester. Conclusions: Lung H2S synthesizing enzymes are downregulated by gestational CS and the effects are transmitted to F2 progeny. Smoking during pregnancy decreases H2S synthesizing enzymes is human placentas, which may correlate with the increased risk of asthma/BPD in children.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease affecting preterm neonates, is associated with significant childhood and adult health problems. Histopathologic features of BPD include impaired vascular and distal airway development. We previously showed that activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) by inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs) is feasible and that it stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that enhancement of angiogenesis by activation of HIFs improves lung growth and function in prematurely born neonates in vivo. Preterm baboons (125 day+14 day pro re nata O2 model, corresponding to 27 human gestational weeks) were treated for 14 days with intravenous (i.v.) FG-4095, a PHD inhibitor. Notably, 77% of diminished total alveolar surface area in untreated controls was recovered by FG-4095 treatment. Functional significance of the structural changes was indicated by improved oxygenation and lung compliance in FG-4095-treated newborns. Surfactant proteins B and C and saturated phosphatidylcholine were unchanged. Incidence of spontaneous ductus arteriosus closure was increased, likely contributing to lower ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow in FG-4095 group. These findings indicate that HIF stimulation by PHD inhibition ameliorates pathological and physiological consequences of BPD.

AB  - Oxygen toxicity is one of the major risk factors in the development of the chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Using proteomic analysis, we discovered that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (mtALDH or ALDH2) was downregulated in neonatal rat lung after hyperoxic exposure. To study the role of mtALDH in hyperoxic lung injury, we overexpressed mtALDH in human lung epithelial cells (A549) and found that mtALDH significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced cell death. Compared with control cells (Neo-A549), the necrotic cell death in mtALDH-overexpressing cells (mtALDH-A549) decreased from 25.3 to 6.5%, 50.5 to 9.1%, and 52.4 to 15.1% after 24-, 48-, and 72-h hyperoxic exposure, respectively. The levels of intracellular and mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mtALDH-A549 cells after hyperoxic exposure were significantly lowered compared with Neo-A549 cells. mtALDH overexpression significantly stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation partially eliminated the protective effect of mtALDH in hyperoxia-induced cell death, suggesting ERK activation by mtALDH conferred cellular resistance to hyperoxia. mtALDH overexpression augmented Akt phosphorylation and maintained the total Akt level in mtALDH-A549 cells under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation by LY294002 in mtALDH-A549 cells significantly increased necrotic cell death after hyperoxic exposure, indicating that PI3K-Akt activation by mtALDH played an important role in cell survival after hyperoxia. Taken together, these data demonstrate that mtALDH overexpression attenuates hyperoxia-induced cell death in lung epithelial cells through reduction of ROS, activation of ERK/MAPK, and PI3K-Akt cell survival signaling pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine, in prematurely born children who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), if respiratory morbidity, healthcare utilisation, and cost of care during the preschool years were influenced by use of supplementary oxygen at home after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit., DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Four tertiary neonatal intensive care units., PATIENTS: 190 children, median gestational age 27 weeks (range 22-31), 70 of whom received supplementary oxygen when discharged home., INTERVENTIONS: Review of hospital and general practitioner records together with a parent completed respiratory questionnaire., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare utilisation, cost of care, cough, wheeze, and use of an inhaler., RESULTS: Seventy children had supplementary oxygen at home (home oxygen group), but only one had a continuous requirement for home oxygen beyond 2 years of age. There were no significant differences in the gestational age or birth weight of the home oxygen group compared with the rest of the cohort. However, between 2 and 4 years of age inclusive, the home oxygen group had more outpatient attendances (p = 0.0021) and specialist attendances (p = 0.0023), and, for respiratory problems, required more prescriptions (p<0.0001). Their total cost of care was higher (p<0.0001). In addition, more of the home oxygen group wheezed more than once a week (p = 0.0486) and were more likely to use an inhaler (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Children with BPD who have supplementary oxygen at home after discharge have increased respiratory morbidity and healthcare utilisation in the preschool years.

AB  - Development of lung microvasculature is critical for distal airway formation. Both processes are arrested in the lungs of preterm newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic form of lung disease. We hypothesized that activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) augments lung vascular development. Pulmonary angiogenic factors were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry in preterm baboons (125 days+14 days pro re nata O2 model) treated for 14 days with intravenous FG-4095, an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs) that initiates HIF degradation. HIF-1alpha, but not HIF-2alpha, mRNA and protein were increased (8- and 3-fold, respectively) in FG-4095-treated baboons relative to untreated controls. Expression of PHD-1, -2, and -3 was unchanged. Of note, mRNA and/or protein for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were increased by FG-4095. Moreover, PECAM-1-expressing capillary endothelial cells detected by immunohistochemistry were augmented in FG-4095-treated baboons to levels comparable to those in fetal age-matched controls. Alveolar septal cell expression of Ki67, a proliferative marker, and VEGF were similar in untreated controls and FG-4095-treated neonates. These results indicate that HIF stimulation by PHD inhibition enhances lung angiogenesis in the primate model of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a major cause of morbidity in premature infants. An imbalance between neutrophil elastase and its inhibitors has been implicated in BPD. Serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN)B1 is an inhibitor of neutrophil proteases, including neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (cat G). Recent studies suggest that SERPINB1 could provide protection in the airways by regulating excess protease activity associated with inflammatory lung disorders. In this study, we determined the distribution and ontogeny of SERPINB1 in the baboon lung and characterized the expression of SERPINB1 in baboon models of BPD. SERPINB1 expression was detected in the conducting airway and glandular epithelial cells in addition to neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells. SERPINB1 mRNA and protein expression increased with advancing gestational age and in the new BPD model. In contrast, SERPINB1 expression levels were decreased in the old BPD model. Furthermore, SERPINB1 was detected as a high-molecular-mass (HMM) complex in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from the BPD group. Analysis of the HMM complex by coimmunoprecipitation showed that these complexes were formed between SERPINB1 and NE or cat G. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ion trap mass spectrometry verified the presence of SERPINB1 in HMM complexes. Finally, NE activity level was compared between new and old baboon models of BPD and was found to be significantly lower in new BPD. Thus SERPINB1 upregulation in new BPD may be protective by contributing to the regulation of neutrophil proteases NE and cat G.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants exposed to O2 with mechanical ventilation often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease (CLD). The pathogenesis of BPD/CLD involves dysmorphic microvasculature and disrupted alveolarization. This may be due to impaired vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor expression., METHODS: To examine the ontogeny of VEGF and VEGF receptors in baboon lungs from 125 to 185 (term) days gestation and to determine whether exposure to O2 and mechanical ventilation alter these ontogenic profiles, we examined lung specimens from three O2-exposed groups: (1) animals delivered at 125 days gestation and exposed to O2 for 14 days as needed; (2) animals delivered at 140 days gestation and exposed to O2 for 10 days as needed; and (3) animals delivered at 140 days gestation and exposed to 100% O2 for 10 days. Lungs from gestational age-matched controls were also examined at 125, 140, 160, 175, and 185 (term) days., RESULTS: VEGF189 was the most abundant splice variant in the lungs at all stages of development. Extremely premature baboons developing BPD/CLD had higher lung VEGF121 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression. However, transcripts for VEGF189, VEGF165, and VEGF receptors (Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [Flt-1], kinase-insert domain receptor [KDR]/fetal liver kinase-1 [Flk-1], and neuropilin 1) were suppressed in the BPD models., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that impaired VEGF and VEGF receptor mRNA expression in lungs from extremely premature baboons developing BPD/CLD may contribute to dysmorphic microvasculature and disrupted alveolarization.

AB  - Lucinactant, formerly known as KL(4) surfactant, is a novel synthetic lung surfactant containing phospholipids and an engineered peptide, sinapultide, which is designed to mimic the actions of human surfactant protein B. It has been developed for use in the prevention or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a common problem in premature infants, which results from a deficiency or degradation of pulmonary surfactant. Lucinactant is administered intratracheally soon after birth as a replacement surfactant. In the pivotal randomized, double-blind, prophylaxis trial in premature infants, the incidence of RDS at 24 hours after birth was significantly lower in lucinactant recipients than in recipients of colfosceril palmitate, a synthetic non-protein-containing surfactant. RDS-related mortality at 14 days was significantly lower in lucinactant recipients than in recipients of colfosceril palmitate or beractant, a bovine-derived surfactant. In another randomized, double-blind, prophylaxis trial in premature infants, the rate of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days of age in lucinactant recipients was not inferior to that in recipients of poractant alfa, a porcine-derived surfactant. Lucinactant was generally well tolerated. Adverse events were transient and related to the administration procedure. There were no differences in the incidences of complications of prematurity between lucinactant and the other surfactants.

AB  - Chronic early gestational chorioamnionitis is associated with development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. A single intra-amniotic exposure to endotoxin decreased alveolarization and reduced expression of endothelial proteins in 125-day gestational age preterm lambs. We hypothesized that prolonged exposure to intra-amniotic endotoxin would cause progressive lung inflammation and inhibit alveolar and pulmonary vascular development. Endotoxin (1 mg/day) or saline was administered via an intra-amniotic osmotic pump from 80 to 108 days of gestational age (continuous pump) or by four weekly 10-mg intra-amniotic endotoxin injections starting at 100 days of gestational age (multiple dose). Lung morphometry, lung inflammation, vascular effects, and lung maturation were measured at delivery. The continuous pump lambs delivered at 100 days (approximately 70% of total endotoxin exposure) had lung inflammation, fewer saccules, and decreased endothelial proteins endothelial nitric oxide synthase and VEGF receptor 2 expression compared with controls. The continuous pump (delivered at 138 days) and multiple dose lambs (delivered at 130 and 145 days) had mild persistent lung inflammation and no significant differences in lung morphometry or expression of endothelial proteins compared with controls. Surfactant saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes were increased in all endotoxin-exposed groups, but lung function was not changed relative to controls. Contrary to our hypothesis, a prolonged fetal exposure to intra-amniotic endotoxin caused mild persistent inflammation but did not lead to progressive structural abnormalities in lungs of near-term gestation lambs.

AB  - Clinical studies have associated increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and EGF receptor with lung remodeling in diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is characterized by disrupted alveolar and vascular morphogenesis, inflammation, and remodeling. To determine whether transient increases in TGF-alpha are sufficient to disrupt postnatal lung morphogenesis, we utilized neonatal transgenic mice conditionally expressing TGF-alpha. Expression of TGF-alpha from postnatal days 3 to 5 disrupted postnatal alveologenesis, causing permanent enlargement of distal air spaces in neonatal and adult mice. Lung volume-to-body weight ratios and lung compliance were increased in adult TGF-alpha transgenic mice, whereas tissue and airway elastance were reduced. Elastin fibers in the alveolar septae were fragmented and disorganized. Pulmonary vascular morphogenesis was abnormal in TGF-alpha mice, with attenuated and occasionally tortuous arterial branching. The ratios of right ventricle weight to left ventricle plus septal weight were increased in TGF-alpha mice, indicating pulmonary hypertension. Electron microscopy showed gaps in the capillary endothelium and extravasation of erythrocytes into the alveolar space of TGF-alpha mice. Hemorrhage and inflammatory cells were seen in distal air spaces at 1 mo of age. In adult TGF-alpha mice, alveolar remodeling, nodules, proteinaceous deposits, and inflammatory cells were seen. Immunostaining for pro-surfactant protein C showed that type II cells were abundant in the nodules, as well as neutrophils and macrophages. Trichrome staining showed that pulmonary fibrosis was minimal, apart from areas of nodular remodeling in adult TGF-alpha mice. Transient induction of TGF-alpha during early alveologenesis permanently disrupted lung structure and function and caused chronic lung disease.

AB  - AIMS: Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Thioredoxin reductase-1 (Txnrd1) inhibition activates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent responses. Txnrd1 activity is selenium (Se) dependent and Se deficiency is common in prematurity. Auranofin (AFN), a Txnrd1 inhibitor, decreases IL-1beta levels and increases Nrf2 activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated alveolar macrophages. In lung epithelia, AFN-induced Nrf2 activation is Se dependent. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of Txnrd1 inhibition in alveolar macrophages are Se dependent., MAIN METHODS: To establish Se sufficient (Se+) and deficient (Se-) conditions, alveolar (MH-S) macrophages were cultured in 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) +/- 25 nM Na2SeO3. Se- (2.5% FBS) and Se+ (2.5% FBS + 25 nM Na2SeO3) cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 0.05 mug/mL LPS and/or 0.5 muM AFN. Nrf2 activation was determined by measuring NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (Nqo1) and glutathione levels. IL-1beta mRNA (Il1b) and protein levels were measured using qRT-PCR and ELISA. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc., KEY FINDINGS: We detected an independent effect of AFN, but not LPS, on Nqo1 expression and GSH levels in Se+ and Se- cells. LPS significantly increased Il1b and IL-1beta levels in both groups. AFN-mediated attenuation of this effect was not impacted by Se status., SIGNIFICANCE: The beneficial effects of Txnrd1 inhibition in alveolar macrophages are Se-independent and therefore unlikely to be diminished by clinical Se deficiency.

AB  - TNF-alpha has been associated with chorioamnionitis and the subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. We asked whether bioactive recombinant ovine TNF-alpha could induce chorioamnionitis, lung inflammation, lung maturation, and systemic effects in fetal sheep. We compared the responses to IL-1alpha, a cytokine known to induce these responses in preterm sheep. Intra-amniotic TNF-alpha caused no chorioamnionitis, no lung maturation, and a very small increase in inflammatory cells in the fetal lung after 5 h, 2 days (d), and 7 d. In contrast, IL-1alpha induced inflammation and lung maturation. TNF-alpha given into the airways at birth increased granulocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of ventilated preterm lungs and decreased the mRNA for surfactant protein C but did not adversely effect postnatal lung function. An intravascular injection of IL-1alpha caused a systemic inflammatory response in fetal sheep, whereas there was no fetal response to intravascular TNF-alpha. Fetal and newborn preterm sheep are minimally responsive to TNF-alpha. Therefore, the presence of a mediator such as TNF-alpha in a developing animal does not necessarily mean that it is causing the responses anticipated from previous results in adult animals.

AB  - Antenatal inflammation may be an important triggering event in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia but may also accelerate fetal lung maturation. We examined the effects of intra-amniotic (IA) interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-1 beta on maturation of the fetal sheep lung. These cytokine effects were compared with IA endotoxin, a potent proinflammatory stimulus that accelerated lung maturation. Date-bred ewes received 15 or 150 microg recombinant ovine IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta or 10 mg Escherichia coli endotoxin by IA injection at 118 days gestation (term = 150 days), and fetuses were delivered at 125 days. IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta improved lung function and increased alveolar saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) and surfactant protein mRNA expression at the higher dose. The maturation response to IL-1 alpha was greater than that to IL-1 beta, which was similar to endotoxin response. Inflammation was also more pronounced after IL-1 alpha treatment. Only endotoxin animals had residual inflammation of the fetal membranes at 7 days. Lung compliance, lung volume, and alveolar Sat PC were positively correlated with residual alveolar wash leukocyte numbers 7 days after IL-1 treatment, suggesting a link between lung inflammation and maturation.

AB  - Ventilation-induced lung injury has been related to cytokine production. Immaturity and barotrauma are important contributors to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants. In the present study, stretch of organotypic cultured fetal rat lung cells was used to simulate ventilation of preterm newborns. Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml) and/or mechanical stretch. After 4 h, stretch enhanced LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 production in a force- and frequency-dependent manner. The maximal effect of stretch was seen with 5% elongation at 40 cycles/min. In contrast, after 1 h of stimulation, stretch alone significantly increased MIP-2 production, which was not blocked by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. At both the 1- and 4-h time points, only LPS increased MIP-2 mRNA levels. Stretch-induced MIP-2 release was associated with cell injury as measured by lactate dehydrogenase release and was not inhibited by gadolinium, a stretch-activated ion channel blocker. Taken together, these results suggest that the major effect of stretch on MIP-2 production from fetal rat lung cells is to stimulate its secretion.

AB  - The direct effects of hyperoxia on collagen production by fetal lung fibroblasts are unknown and would be important to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. We studied the effect of hyperoxia on 1) proliferation, 2) mRNA levels for type I and III procollagens, and 3) net collagen production in primary cultures of fetal rat lung fibroblasts. Fibroblasts from 19-day-old rat fetuses (term is 22 days) were obtained. Test plates were incubated in hyperoxia and controls in room air for varying time periods. Cell viability in both conditions was >97% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Fibroblast proliferation in nonconfluent cultures was found to be significantly reduced with exposure to hyperoxia (P < 0.001). Steady-state levels of type I and III procollagen mRNAs, analyzed on Northern blots hybridized to [32P]cDNA probes, were significantly decreased in hyperoxia (P < 0.01). This effect was noted as early as 4 h of exposure to hyperoxia and persisted for 5 days. There was a significant inverse correlation between duration of exposure to O2 and steady-state levels of mRNA for alpha1(I)-procollagen (r = -0.904) and alpha1(III)-procollagen (r = -0.971). There were no significant changes in steady-state levels of beta-actin mRNA. We also found a significant decrease in collagen synthesis in hyperoxia-exposed fibroblasts (P < 0.05). We conclude that hyperoxia directly effects a reduction in fetal lung fibroblast proliferation and net collagen production at a pretranslational level.

AB  - Lung injuries, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, alter the surfactant system. We developed a newborn rabbit model of acute, followed by chronic, hyperoxic injury to study surfactant protein (SP) gene expression. Initial litters were exposed to >95% O2 until 50% died (LD50; 7-11 days old). Subsequent litters were exposed to >95% O2 for 8 days, followed by 60% O2 until 22-36 days. Controls were exposed to room air. LD50 animals displayed acute pulmonary inflammation, edema, protein leak, and surfactant dysfunction. These changes resolved, and fibrosis developed by 22 days. Whole lung SP-A mRNA expression (measured by membrane hybridization) was twice control levels at 4 days of >95% O2, with specific elevations in terminal bronchioles and type II cells at 4 days and the LD50 by in situ hybridization. Whole lung SP-B and SP-C mRNA were unchanged from control throughout exposure. However, in situ hybridization showed elevations in SP-B and SP-C mRNA in type II cells in inflamed areas at the LD50. SP mRNA alterations resolved by 22-36 days. The surfactant system recovers from acute hyperoxic injury, despite continued 60% O2 exposure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Living-donor lobar lung transplantation offers an alternative for patients with a life expectancy of less than a few months. We report on our intermediate results with respect to recipient survival, complications, pulmonary function, and hemodynamic reserve., METHODS: Thirty-eight living-donor lobar lung transplants were performed in 27 adult and 10 pediatric patients for cystic fibrosis (32), pulmonary hypertension (two), pulmonary fibrosis (one), viral bronchiolitis (one), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (one), and posttransplantation obliterative bronchiolitis (one). Seventy-six donors underwent donor lobectomies., RESULTS: There were 14 deaths among the 37 patients, with an average follow-up of 14 months. Predominant cause of death was infection, consistent with the large percentage of patients with cystic fibrosis in our population. The overall incidence of rejection was 0.07 episodes/patient-month, representing 0.8 episodes/patient. Postoperative pulmonary function testing generally showed a steady improvement that plateaued by postoperative months 9 to 12. Fourteen patients who were followed up for at least 1 year underwent right heart catheterization; pressures and pulmonary vascular resistances were within normal ranges. Bronchiolitis obliterans was definitively diagnosed in three patients. Among the 76 donors, complications in the postoperative period included postpericardiotomy syndrome (three), atrial fibrillation (one), and surgical reexploration (three)., CONCLUSIONS: We believe that these data support an expanded role for living-donor lobar lung transplantation. Our intermediate data are encouraging with respect to the functional outcome and survival of these critically ill patients, who would have died without this option.

AB  - Vitamin A (retinol) may play an important role in lung maturation: 1) premature delivery is simultaneously a source of vitamin A deficiency and increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), due to deficit in pulmonary surfactant; 2) neonatal supplementation with retinol reduces the risk of BPD; and 3) fetal rat lung stores retinol in late gestation just before the onset of surfactant synthesis. To test the hypothesis of an implication of retinoids in the control of pulmonary surfactant synthesis, experiments were designed in the pregnant rat, aiming either at enhancing fetal lung vitamin A stores, bringing the active metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), or inhibiting the conversion of retinol to RA with aid of citral. Maternal administration of a single dose of 50,000 IU of retinyl palmitate on day 16 (term 22 days) increased 22 and 29%, respectively, the total phospholipid (TPL) and disaturated fraction of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in extracted fetal surfactant on day 19 but did not change surfactant protein (SP) A concentration. Chronic administration of retinyl palmitate to the mother from day 16 through 20 increased disaturated PC content on day 21 but decreased SP-A concentration. Fetal lung surfactant phospholipids were increased by chronic administration of RA and considerably reduced by citral (-31 and -35% for TPL and PC concns, respectively). RA also enhanced labeled choline incorporation into fetal lung PC on day 20. Given once on day 17, it accelerated the appearance of surfactant precursors on day 18.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Aims: mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) is one of the most promising cell therapies to treat immune related diseases such as GvHD, Crohn's disease, osteoarthritis as well as to support function of heart, liver, and central nervous system. Many advanced clinical trials has been taking place to investigate the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy, however, it remains challenging to compare the results of these trials due to variations in culture conditions and tissue origins. These variations pose the urgent need of a standardized large-scale production and quality control of these cells become more urgent, as the use of MSCs are spreading around the globe and disease backgrounds. Numerous culture protocols for MSCs are available using FBS-containing, human platelet lysate/plasma supplementing, or serum-free xeno-free condition, either commercial or self-prepared media. In this study, we have established a standardized expansion protocol that can be used for MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AD), and umbilical cord (UC). Method(s): we tested commercial xeno-free, serum-free media (MesenCultTM-ACF Plus Medium/Stem Cell Technologies, MSC NutriStem XF Medium/BI, Stempro MSC SFM Medium/ThermoFisher, PowerStem MSC1 Medium/PAN, and StemMACSTM MSC Expansion Media/Miltenyi) in order to identify a common culture condition for all of these MSC sources. The cells were analysed for their population doubling time from P2 to P6, expression of surface markers including the positive markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, and the negative markers CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19, and HLA-DR. Karyotype was conducted at early and later passage (P3 and P6, respectively). MSCs were tested for their differentiation capacity into osteoblast/osteocyte, adipocyte, and chondrocyte lineages. Bacterial and fungal sterility and mycoplasma test were performed and endotoxin concentration was determined before the cells were transfused into patients. Result(s): using UC for the primary screening, we identified two medium candidates that supported the isolation and culture of UC-MSCs. MSCs derived from BM and AD are capable of expansion in these media as well. However, one candidate induced an increased HLA-DR expression so that it failed to fulfill the minimal criteria of MSCs (Dominici et al., 2006). The last one showed the best results for MSCs from all tested tissues. Under our established protocol, MSCs grew exponentially until P6, which was the highest analyzed passage. The cells expressed CD73, CD90, CD105 in more than 95% cells and showed less than 2% of negative markers (CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19, and HLA-DR). Karyotype analysis confirmed no chromosomal aberrations of the cultured cells. The cells were able to differentiate into osteoblast/osteocyte, adipocyte, and chondrocyte lineages. We are now conducting phase 1 clinical trial to address the safety and feasibility of UC-MSCs in the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conclusion(s): we have established a standardized protocol for the xeno-free, serum-free culture of MSCs from different sources. BM-, AD-, and UC-derived MSCs expand in large-scale and maintain their cellular characteristics, karyotype integrity, and can be applied for cell therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both progestogens and cerclage are individually effective in preterm birth prevention in high risk pregnancies. However, national and international guidelines cite a lack of data available to comment on the potential benefit of concurrent progestogen therapy after cerclage has been placed. Studies to date have been small with mixed results regarding benefit of concurrent progestogen with cerclage leaving uncertainty regarding best clinical practice., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether cerclage with progestogen therapy was superior to cerclage alone in the prevention of spontaneous preterm birth in singleton pregnancies., METHODS: This is an international retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies, without major anomaly or aneuploidy, and with cerclage placed at 10 different institutions in the United States and Colombia from June 2016 to June 2020. Exclusion criteria were lack of documentation regarding whether progestogen was prescribed, unavailable delivery outcome, and pregnancy termination (spontaneous or induced) before 16 weeks' gestation. The exposure of interest was progestogen use with cerclage placement, which included those who continued to use progestogen or who started progestogen after cerclage. The comparison group consisted of those without progestogen use after cerclage placement, which included those who had no progestogen use during the entire pregnancy or who initiated progestogen and then stopped it after cerclage placement. Progestogen type, cerclage indication, maternal baseline characteristics, and maternal/neonatal outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth at <37 weeks. The secondary outcomes were spontaneous preterm birth at <34 weeks, gestational age at delivery, and a composite neonatal outcome including >=1 of the following: perinatal mortality, confirmed sepsis, grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. There were planned subgroup analyses by cerclage indication, progestogen type (vaginal progesterone vs 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate), preterm birth history, and site. Continuous variables were compared in adjusted analyses with analysis of covariance, and categorical variables were compared with multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders with adjusted odds ratio. A Cox regression survival curve was generated to compare latency to spontaneous delivery, censored after 37 weeks., RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 699 singletons met the inclusion criteria: 561 in the progestogen with cerclage group and 138 with cerclage alone. Baseline characteristics were similar, except the higher likelihood of previous spontaneous preterm birth in the progestogen group (61% vs 41%; P<.001). Within the progestogen group, 52% were on 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate weekly, 44% on vaginal progesterone daily, and 3% on oral progesterone daily. Progestogen with cerclage was associated with a significantly lower frequency of spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks (31% vs 39%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.59 [0.39-0.89]; P=.01) and <34 weeks (19% vs 27%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.55 [0.35-0.87]; P=.01), increased latency to spontaneous delivery (hazard ratio for spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks, 0.66 [0.49-0.90]; P=.009), and lower frequency of perinatal death (7% vs 16%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.37 [0.20-0.67]; P=.001). In planned subgroup analyses, association with reduced odds of preterm birth <37 weeks persisted in those on vaginal progesterone, those without a previous preterm birth, those with ultrasound- or examination-indicated cerclage, those who started progestogen therapy before cerclage, and in sites restricted to the United States., CONCLUSION: Use of progestogen with cerclage was associated with reduced rates of spontaneous preterm birth and early spontaneous preterm birth compared with cerclage alone. Although this study was not sufficiently powered for subgroup analysis, the strength of evidence for benefit appeared greatest for those with ultrasound- or examination-indicated cerclage, and with vaginal progesterone.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, is characterized by impaired lung development with sustained functional abnormalities due to alterations of airways and the distal lung. Although clinical studies have shown striking associations between antenatal stress and BPD, little is known about the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. Whether dysanapsis, the concept of discordant growth of the airways and parenchyma, contributes to late respiratory disease as a result of antenatal stress is unknown. We hypothesized that antenatal endotoxin (ETX) impairs juvenile lung function as a result of altered central airway and distal lung structure, suggesting the presence of dysanapsis in this preclinical BPD model. Fetal rats were exposed to intraamniotic ETX (10 mug) or saline solution (control) 2 days before term. We performed extensive structural and functional evaluation of the proximal airways and distal lung in 2-week-old rats. Distal lung structure was quantified by stereology. Conducting airway diameters were measured using micro-computed tomography. Lung function was assessed during invasive ventilation to quantify baseline mechanics, response to methacholine challenge, and spirometry. ETX-exposed pups exhibited distal lung simplification, decreased alveolar surface area, and decreased parenchyma-airway attachments. ETX-exposed pups exhibited decreased tracheal and second- and third-generation airway diameters. ETX increased respiratory system resistance and decreased lung compliance at baseline. Only Newtonian resistance, specific to large airways, exhibited increased methacholine reactivity in ETX-exposed pups compared with controls. ETX-exposed pups had a decreased ratio of FEV in 0.1 second to FVC and a normal FEV in 0.1 second, paralleling the clinical definition of dysanapsis. Antenatal ETX causes abnormalities of the central airways and distal lung growth, suggesting that dysanapsis contributes to abnormal lung function in juvenile rats.

AB  - Biallelic variants in neuroblastoma-amplified sequence (NBAS) cause an extremely broad spectrum of phenotypes. Clinical features range from isolated recurrent episodes of liver failure to multisystemic syndrome including short stature, skeletal osteopenia and dysplasia, optic atrophy, and a variable immunological, cutaneous, muscular, and neurological abnormalities. Hemizygous variants in CUL4B cause syndromic X-linked intellectual disability characterized by limitations in intellectual functions, developmental delays in gait, cognitive, and speech functioning, and other features including short stature, dysmorphism, and cerebral malformations. In this study, we report on a 4.5-month-old preterm infant with a complex phenotype mainly characterized by placental-related severe intrauterine growth restriction, post-natal growth failure with spontaneous bone fractures, which led to a suspicion of osteogenesis imperfecta, and lethal bronchopulmonary dysplasia with pulmonary hypertension. Whole exome sequencing identified compound heterozygosity for a known frameshift and a novel missense variant in NBAS and hemizygosity for a known CUL4B nonsense mutation. In vitro functional studies on the novel NBAS missense substitution demonstrated altered Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum retrograde vesicular trafficking and reduced collagen secretion, likely explaining part of the patient's phenotype. We also provided a comprehensive overview of the phenotypic features of NBAS and CUL4B deficiency, thus updating the recently emerging NBAS genotype-phenotype correlations. Our findings highlight the power of a genome-first approach for an early diagnosis of complex phenotypes. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors for neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) with the outcomes of General Movement (GM) Assessment (GMA) in pre-term infants at 3-5 months of age. We sought to identify the risk factors associated with the predictors of psychomotor development in pre-term newborns, such as normal fidgety movements (FMs), absent FMs, or abnormal FMs, assessed during the fidgety period of motor development., Methods: The SYNAGIS program (prophylactic of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection) was used to identify risk factors for the development of neuromotor deficits in 164 pre-term infants who were at high risk of developing these deficits. Based on the GMA, all participants were divided into three groups of infants who presented: (1) normal FMs; (2) absent FMs; and (3) abnormal FMs., Results: The results of the current study suggest that abnormal GMs not only indicate commonly known factors like birth asphyxia (BA), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grades 3-4, but also predict the development of motor impairments. In the present study, several specific risk factors including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), infertility treatments, maternal acute viral/bacterial infections during pregnancy, and elevated bilirubin levels were identified as attributes of an atypical fidgety movement pattern., Conclusions: Additional clinical data, such as risk factors for NDI associated with early predictors of psychomotor development in pre-term newborns, i.e., absent or abnormal FMs, may be helpful in predicting neurological outcomes in pre-term infants with developmental concerns in the 1st month of life.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence and poor prognosis of late-onset sepsis (LOS) in very low birth weight infant (VLBWI). Methods: This prospective, multicenter observational cohort study was conducted based on the data from Sina-Northern Neonatal Network (SNN). The general data, perinatal information and poor prognosis of 6 639 VLBWI, who were admitted to the 35 neonatal intensive care units from 2018 to 2021, were collected and analyzed. According to the occurrence of LOS during hospitalization, the VLBWI were assigned to the LOS group and non-LOS group. The LOS group was further divided into 3 subgroups according to the occurrence of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and purulent meningitis. The Chi-square test or Fisher exact probability method, independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test and multivariate Logistic regression model were used to analyze the relationship between LOS and poor prognosis in VLBWI. Results: A total of 6 639 eligible VLBWI were enrolled, including 3 402 cases (51.2%) of males and 1 511 cases (22.8%) with LOS. The incidences of LOS in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI) and extremely preterm infants were 33.3% (392/1 176) and 34.2% (378/1 105), respectively. There were 157 cases (10.4%) who died in the LOS group and 48 cases (24.9%) in the subgroup of LOS complicated with NEC. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that LOS complicated with NEC was associated with increased mortality and incidence of grade III-IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and extrauterin growth retardation (EUGR) (ORadjust=5.27, 2.59, 3.04, 2.04; 95%CI 3.60-7.73, 1.49-4.50, 2.11-4.37, 1.50-2.79; all P<0.01); LOS complicated with purulent meningitis was also associated with increased mortality and incidence of grade III-IV IVH or PVL, and moderate or severe BPD (ORadjust=2.22, 8.13, 3.69, 95%CI 1.30-3.37, 5.22-12.67, 2.49-5.48; all P<0.01); the infants without NEC or purulent meningitis in the LOS group was only associated with increased incidence of moderate or severe BPD (ORadjust=2.20, 95%CI 1.83-2.65, P<0.001). After ruling out contaminated bacteria, a total of 456 cases showed positive blood culture, including 265 cases (58.1%) of Gram-negative bacteria, 126 cases (27.6%) of Gram-positive bacteria, and 65 cases (14.3%) of fungi. The most common pathogenic bacteria was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=147, 32.2%), followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=72, 15.8%) and subsequently Escherichia coli (n=39, 8.6%). Conclusions: The incidence of LOS is high in VLBWI. Klebsiella pneumoniae is the most common pathogenic bacteria, followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Escherichia coli. LOS is associated with a poor prognosis for moderate to severe BPD. The prognosis of LOS complicated with NEC is poor with the highest mortality, and the risk of brain damage is significantly increased when LOS complicated with purulent meningitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract microbial dysbiosis can exacerbate inflammation and conversely inflammation may cause dysbiosis. Dysbiotic microbiome metabolites may lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyperoxia and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction alters lung microbiome and metabolome, mediating BPD lung injury sequence., METHODS: C57BL6/J mice were exposed to 21% (normoxia) or 70% (hyperoxia) oxygen during postnatal days (PND) 1-14. Pups were injected with LPS (6 mg/kg) or equal PBS volume, intraperitoneally on PND 3, 5, and 7. At PND14, the lungs were collected for microbiome and metabolomic analyses (n = 5/group)., RESULTS: Microbiome alpha and beta diversity were similar between groups. Metabolic changes included hyperoxia 31 up/18 down, LPS 7 up/4 down, exposure interaction 8. Hyperoxia increased Intestinimonas abundance, whereas LPS decreased Clostridiales, Dorea, and Intestinimonas; exposure interaction affected Blautia. Differential co-expression analysis on multi-omics data identified exposure-altered modules. Hyperoxia metabolomics response was integrated with a published matching transcriptome, identifying four induced genes (ALDOA, GAA, NEU1, RENBP), which positively correlated with BPD severity in a published human newborn cohort., CONCLUSIONS: We report hyperoxia and LPS lung microbiome and metabolome signatures in a clinically relevant BPD model. We identified four genes correlating with BPD status in preterm infants that are promising targets for therapy and prevention., IMPACT: Using multi-omics, we identified and correlated key biomarkers of hyperoxia and LPS on murine lung micro-landscape and examined their potential clinical implication, which shows strong clinical relevance for future research. Using a double-hit model of clinical relevance to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, we are the first to report integrated metabolomic/microbiome landscape changes and identify novel disease biomarker candidates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxygen therapy in preterm neonates is associated with airway hyperreactivity. The role of Rho/Rho-kinase smooth muscle signaling in hyperoxia-induced airway hyperreactivity remains understudied. We hypothesized that inhibition of Rho-kinase will attenuate airway hyperreactivity induced by neonatal hyperoxia., METHODS: Newborn rats were raised in hyperoxia (>95% O2 ) or ambient air (AA) for 7 days. Subgroups were injected with a Rho-kinase inhibitor: Y-27632 (10 mg.kg-1 .day-1 ) or fasudil (10 mg.kg-1 .day-1 ), or a FP receptor antagonist - AS604872 (30 mg.kg-1 .day-1 ). After exposures, tracheal cylinders were prepared for in vitro wire myography. Contraction to methacholine or PGF2alpha was measured in the presence or absence of tissue-bath Y-27632, fasudil, or AS604872. Lung PGF2alpha levels, Rho-kinase protein level and Rho-kinase 1 activity were measured by ELISA., RESULTS: Tracheal smooth muscle contraction was significantly greater in hyperoxic compared to AA groups. Both, Y-27632 and fasudil significantly decreased contractility to MCh or PGF2alpha in hyperoxic groups versus hyperoxic controls (p < 0.001), but did not alter AA group responses. Inhibition of FP receptors attenuated responses to PGF2alpha . Hyperoxia significantly increased lung PGF2alpha compared to AA (p < 0.01), but Rho-kinase inhibition did not influence PGF2alpha level. Rho-kinase protein level (p < 0.001) and activity (p < 0.01), were increased by hyperoxia, but blockade of FP receptor reduced the Rho-kinase 1 activity (p < 0.05) under hyperoxic condition., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an active role of Rho/Rho-kinase signaling on hyperoxia-induced airway hyperreactivity. These findings suggest that Rho-kinase inhibitors might serve as an effective therapy for hyperoxia-induced airway hyperreactivity. Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the effect of dexamethasone (Dex), hydrocortisone (Hc), and methylprednisolone (Mpz) at equivalent doses on somatic growth, lung healing, and neurotoxicity in a hyperoxic rat model. We hypothesized that Mpz and Hc would be superior to Dex with less neurotoxicity by exerting similar therapeutic efficacy on the injured lung., METHODS: Neonatal rats were randomized to control, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), Dex, Hc, and Mpz groups. All drugs were administered daily following day 15 over 7 days. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of the lung and brain were performed on day 22., RESULTS: All types had much the same impact on lung repair. Oxidative markers in the lung were similar in the steroid groups. While nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor and heat-shock protein 70 dropped following steroid treatment, no difference was noted in other biochemical markers in the brain between the study groups. Apoptotic activity and neuron loss in the parietal cortex and hippocampus were noted utmost in Dex, but alike in other BPD groups., CONCLUSIONS: Mpz does not appear to be superior to Dex or Hc in terms of pulmonary outcomes and oxidative damage in the brain, but safer than Dex regarding apoptotic neuron loss., IMPACT: This is the first study that compared the pulmonary efficacy and neurotoxic effects of Dex, Hc, and Mpz simultaneously in an established BPD model. This study adds to the literature on the importance of possible antioxidant and protective effects of glucocorticoid therapy in an oxidative stress-exposed brain. Mpz ended up with no more additional neuron loss or apoptosis risk by having interchangeable effects with others for the treatment of established BPD. Mpz and Hc seem safe as a rescue therapy in terms of adverse outcomes for established BPD in which lung and brain tissue is already impaired. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - Despite marked improvements in the survival of extremely low birth weight preterm infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a prevalent morbidity. BPD has evolved pathologically and epidemiologically but the definition has failed to keep up. The majority of the definitions of BPD still use the respiratory support provided to the infants at a single timepoint. The lack of a uniform definition of BPD presently reflects the changing BPD pathogenesis and phenotype and limits defining the epidemiology. To address the epidemiology of BPD, the definition should be clarified; even the newer definitions have not been validated entirely. The definition needs to be meaningful clinically and be predictive of long-term respiratory outcomes. We believe the definition should have a composite assessment like a score (quantitative measurement) and include the different phenotypes (qualitative measurements) so that optimally they can be applied to the different phases of BPD and at different timepoints. Furthermore, the definitions need to be easy to measure and assess so that generalizability is enhanced. Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Objective: To study the short-term outcomes and their related risk factors of extremely preterm infants (EPI) and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI) in Guangdong province. Methods: The neonatal and corresponding maternal medical records of 2 392 cases of EPI and ELBWI discharged from 26 tertiary hospitals in Guangdong province during 2013-2017 were collected. Chi-square test or linear-by-linear association chi-square was used to analyze the following data on an annual basis: (1) the proportion of EPI and ELBWI in all discharged infants and preterm infants; (2) the difference in survival rate of EPI and ELBWI in different regions and types of hospital; and (3) the difference in incidence of complications. A binary Logistic regression model was established to analyze the death-related risk factors. Results: From 2013 to 2017, the enrolled infants each year were 331, 418, 458, 574 and 611, respectively. Totally, there were 1 352 (56.5%) male infants. The gestational age was (27.7+/-1.9) weeks, and the birth weight was (919+/-158) g. The proportion of EPI and ELBWI in all discharged infants increased from 2013 to 2017 (chi(2)=68.636, P<0.01), and so did the proportion in all discharged preterm infants (chi(2)=73.463, P<0.01). The overall survival rate was 60.4% (1 445/2 392), which increased from 2013 to 2017 (chi(2)=11.424, P<0.01). Besides, the survival rate was higher in the Pearl River Delta region than that in the non-Pearl River Delta region (61.7% (1 325/2 146) vs. 48.8% (120/246), chi(2)=15.505, P<0.01), and also higher in women and children specialist hospitals than that in general hospitals (66.5% (702/1 056) vs. 55.6% (743/1 336), chi(2)=29.104, P<0.01). The overall incidence of complications was 89.0% (2 130/2 392) for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), 72.2% (1 041/1 442) for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), 40.5% (625/1 544) for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), 12.3% (237/1 922) for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), 31.0% (578/1 865) for periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH), 34.1% (656/1 922) for nosocomial infection, 26.9% (625/2 327) for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and 4.4% (82/1 865) for periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). From 2013 to 2017, the incidence of PVL decreased (chi(2)=6.093, P=0.014), but the incidence of BPD and PDA increased (chi(2)=24.476 and 11.741, respectively, both P<0.01). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that Apgar score <=7 at 5-minute (OR=1.830, 95%CI 1.373-2.437, P<0.01), NRDS (OR=1.407, 95%CI 1.222-1.621, P<0.01), invasive assisted ventilation (OR=1.825, 95%CI 1.241-2.683, P<0.01), maternal cervical insufficiency (OR=2.044, 95%CI 1.002-4.169, P=0.049), and medical care withdrawal (OR=25.532, 95%CI 18.867-34.553, P<0.01) increased the risk of early neonatal death, while the increase in gestational age (OR=0.869, 95%CI 0.802-0.941, P<0.01), discharged from Guangzhou and Shenzhen (OR=0.606, 95%CI 0.451-0.813, P<0.01), antenatal use of steroids (OR=0.624, 95%CI 0.471-0.828, P<0.01), premature rupture of membranes (OR=0.667, 95%CI 0.466-0.955, P=0.027), and pulmonary surfactant treatment (OR=0.532, 95%CI 0.419-0.676, P<0.01) could decrease the risk. For the mortality in the late or post-neonatal period, placenta previa (OR=2.355, 95%CI 1.006-5.516, P=0.048), cervical insufficiency (OR=3.306, 95%CI 1.259-8.679, P=0.015), PV-IVH (OR=1.486, 95%CI 1.135-1.946, P<0.01), invasive assisted ventilation (OR=2.143, 95%CI 1.208-3.801, P<0.01), and medical care withdrawal (OR=286.532, 95%CI 87.840-934.661, P<0.01) increased the risk, while the increase of birthweight (OR=0.997, 95%CI 0.996-0.999, P<0.01) decreased the risk. Conclusions: The survival rate of EPI and ELBWI increases annually, but the incidence of complications is still high. Invasive assisted ventilation, medical care withdrawal and maternal cervical insufficiency are associated with mortality in both early and late neonatal or post-neonatal period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature neonates frequently require oxygen supplementation as a therapeutic intervention that, while necessary, also exposes the lung to significant oxidant stress. We hypothesized that hyperoxia has a deleterious effect on alveolar epithelial barrier function rendering the neonatal lung susceptible to injury and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of exposure to 85% oxygen on neonatal rat alveolar barrier function in vitro and in vivo. Whole lung was measured using wet-to-dry weight ratios and bronchoalveolar lavage protein content and cultured primary neonatal alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) were measured using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular flux measurements. Expression of claudin-family tight junction proteins, E-cadherin and the Snail transcription factor SNAI1 were measured by Q-PCR, immunoblot and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy., RESULTS: Cultured neonatal AECs exposed to 85% oxygen showed impaired barrier function. This oxygen-induced increase in paracellular leak was associated with altered claudin expression, where claudin-3 and -18 were downregulated at both the mRNA and protein level. Claudin-4 and -5 mRNA were also decreased, although protein expression of these claudins was largely maintained. Lung alveolarization and barrier function in vivo were impaired in response to hyperoxia. Oxygen exposure also significantly decreased E-cadherin expression and induced expression of the SNAI1 transcription factor in vivo and in vitro., CONCLUSIONS: These data support a model in which hyperoxia has a direct impact on alveolar tight and adherens junctions to impair barrier function. Strategies to antagonize the effects of high oxygen on alveolar junctions may potentially reverse this deleterious effect. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of preterm birth characterized by blunted post-natal lung development. BPD can be modelled in mice by exposure of newborn mouse pups to elevated oxygen levels. Little is known about the mechanisms of perturbed lung development associated with BPD. The advent of transgenic mice, where genetic rearrangements can be induced in particular cell-types at particular time-points during organogenesis, have great potential to explore the pathogenic mechanisms at play during arrested lung development. Many inducible, conditional transgenic technologies available rely on the application of the estrogen-receptor modulator, tamoxifen. While tamoxifen is well-tolerated and has been widely employed in adult mice, or in healthy developing mice; tamoxifen is not well-tolerated in combination with hyperoxia, in the most widely-used mouse model of BPD. To address this, we set out to establish a safe and effective tamoxifen dosing regimen that can be used in newborn mouse pups subjected to injurious stimuli, such as exposure to elevated levels of environmental oxygen. Our data reveal that a single intraperitoneal dose of tamoxifen of 0.2 mg applied to newborn mouse pups in 10 mul Miglyol vehicle was adequate to successfully drive Cre recombinase-mediated genome rearrangements by the fifth day of life, in a murine model of BPD. The number of recombined cells was comparable to that observed in regular tamoxifen administration protocols. These findings will be useful to investigators where tamoxifen dosing is problematic in the background of injurious stimuli and mouse models of human and veterinary disease.

AB  - Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) dramatically increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm babies, a disease characterized by arrested alveolarization and abnormal microvascular angiogenesis. We have previously described a rodent low protein diet (LPD) model of IUGR inducing impaired alveolarization, but failed to demonstrate any modification of the classical factors involved in lung development. We performed a genome-wide microarray analysis in 120 rat pups with LPD-induced IUGR and their controls, at three key time points of the alveolarization process: postnatal day 4 (P4): start of alveolarization; P10: peak of the alveolarization process and P21: end of the alveolarization process. Results were analysed using Arraymining, DAVID and KEGG software and validated by qRT-PCR and western blots. Considering a cut-off of 2:1 as significant, 67 transcripts at P4, 102 transcripts at P10 and 451 transcripts at P21 were up-regulated, and 89 transcripts at P4, 25 transcripts at P10 and 585 transcripts at P21 were down-regulated. Automatic functional classification identified three main modified pathways, 'cell adhesion molecules', 'cardiac muscle contraction' and 'peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor' (PPAR). Protein analysis confirmed involvement of the PPAR pathway, with an increase of FABP4, an activator of this pathway, at P4 and an increase of adiponectin at P21. Other data also suggest involvement of the PPAR pathway in impaired alveolarization. Our results show that deregulation of the PPAR pathway may be an important component of the mechanism inducing impaired alveolarization observed in IUGR. The complete dataset is available as GEO profiles on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( www.ncbi.nih.gov/geo/, GEO Accession No. GSE56956).

AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a lung disease in preterm infants. We aimed to explore the role of cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) on histopathologic changes of lung tissues, as well as the viability, apoptosis, and inflammation of lung cells in rats with hyperoxia-induced BPD., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperoxia-induced BPD in neonatal rats and hyperoxia-induced A549 cells were constructed. The mRNA expression of CDC2 was detected by qRT-PCR. The fibrosis score of lung tissues was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The viability and apoptosis of A549 cells were detected by cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry. The protein expressions of bcl-2, bax, and caspase-3 were measured by western blot. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1beta in A549 cells were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The pcDNA3.1-CDC2 was injected into rats to determine the role of CDC2 in hyperoxia-induced BPD in vivo., RESULTS: The expression of CDC2 was decreased in lung tissues of neonatal rats with hyperoxia-induced BPD and hyperoxia-induced A549 cells. The fibrosis score was increased in the lung tissues of neonatal rats with hyperoxia-induced BPD. Overexpression of CDC2 increased the viability and protein expression of bcl-2; and inhibited the apoptosis, inflammation, and protein expression of bax and caspase-3 in hyperoxia-induced A549 cells. Up-regulation of CDC2 alleviated the histopathologic changes in lung tissues of neonatal rats with hyperoxia-induced BPD., CONCLUSION: Overexpression of CDC2 promoted the viability and inhibited the apoptosis and inflammation of hyperoxia-induced cells, and alleviated the histopathologic changes of lung tissues in neonatal rats with hyperoxia-induced BPD. © Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2020.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or chronic lung disease is one of the principal causes of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Early identification of infants at the greater risk of developing BPD may allow a targeted approach for reducing disease severity and complications. The trigger cause of the disease comprehends the impairment of the alveolar development and the increased angiogenesis. Nevertheless, the molecular pathways characterizing the disease are still unclear. Therefore, the use of the metabolomics technique, due to the capability of identifying instantaneous metabolic perturbation, might help to recognize metabolic patterns associated with the condition., METHODS: The purpose of this study is to compare urinary metabolomics at birth in 36 newborns with a gestational age below 29 weeks and birth weight <1500 g (very low birth weight - VLBW), admitted in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) divided into two groups: the first group (18 cases) consisting of newborns who have not yet developed the disease, but who will subsequently develop it and the second group (18 controls) consisting of newborns not affected by BPD. Urine samples were collected within 24-36 h of life and immediately frozen at -80 degreeC., RESULTS: The (1)H-NMR spectra were analyzed using a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model coupled with orthogonal Signal Correction. Using this approach it was possible with urine at birth to discriminate newborns that will be later have a diagnosis of BPD with a high statistics power. In particular, we found five important discriminant metabolites in urine in BPD newborns: lactate, taurine, TMAO, myoinositol (which increased) and gluconate (which decreased)., CONCLUSION: These preliminary results seem to be promising for the identification of predictor's biomarkers characterizing the BPD condition. These data may suggest that BPD is probably the result of an abnormal development (respiratory bud, vascular tree, hypodysplasia of pneumocytes) and could be considered a congenital disease (genetics plus intrauterine epigenetics). Early identification of infants at the greater risk of developing BPD may allow a targeted approach for reducing disease severity and complications.

AB  - We present two patients with Atelosteogenesis Type I (AO type I) caused by two novel Filamin B (FLNB) mutations affecting the same FLNB residue: c.542G > A, predicting p.Gly181Asp and c.542G > C, predicting p.Gly181Arg. Both children had typical manifestations of AO type I, with severe rhizomelic shortening of the extremities, limited elbow and knee extension with mild webbing, pectus excavatum, broad thumbs with brachydactyly that was most marked for digits 3-5, dislocated hips and bilateral talipes equinovarus. Facial features included proptosis, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, cleft palate, and retromicrognathia. The clinical course of one child was influenced by airway instability and bronchopulmonary dysplasia that complicated intubation and prevented separation from ventilator support. Respiratory insufficiency with tracheal hypoplasia, laryngeal stenosis, and pulmonary hypoplasia have all been described in patients with AO type I and we conclude that compromised pulmonary function is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in this condition.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial chronic lung disease of premature infants. BPD can be attributed to the dysregulation of normal lung development due to ventilation and oxygen toxicity, resulting in pathologic complications of impaired alveolarization and vascularization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and are implicated in diverse biological processes and diseases. The objectives of this study are to identify the changed miRNAs and their target genes in neonatal rat lungs in response to hyperoxia exposure. Using miRNA microarray and real-time PCR analyses, we found downregulation of five miRNAs, miR-342, miR-335, miR-150, miR-126*, and miR-151*, and upregulation of two miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-34a. Some of these miRNAs had the highest expression during embryonic and early postnatal development. DNA microarray analysis yielded several genes with conserved binding sites for these altered miRNAs. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein b (GPNMB) was experimentally verified as a target of miR-150. In summary, we identified seven miRNAs that were changed in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal lungs. These results provide a basis for deciphering the mechanisms involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of proteins that contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - It has been proposed that during human evolution, development of obligate bipedalism, narrow birth canal cross-sectional area and the large brain have forced an adjustment in duration of pregnancy (scaling of gestational age; Plunkett 2011). Children compared to other mammals are born with proportionally small brains (compared to adult brains), suggesting shortening of pregnancy duration during recent evolution. Prevalence of both obstructed delivery and premature birth is still exceptionally high. In near term infants, functional maturity and viability is high, and gene variants predisposing to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) are rare. Advanced antenatal and neonatal treatment practices during the new era of medicine allowed survival of also very preterm infants (gestation <32 weeks). Genetic factors may play a major role in predisposing these infants to common pulmonary (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]; RDS) and intracerebral (intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH], cerebral palsy [CP]) diseases. Fetal genes also influence the susceptibility to preterm labor and premature birth. Specific genes associating with diseases in preterm infants may also contribute to the susceptibility to preterm birth. Understanding and applying the knowledge of genetic interactions in normal and abnormal perinatal-neonatal development requires large, well-structured population cohorts, studies involving the whole genome and international interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Distal alveolar morphogenesis is marked by differentiation of alveolar type (AT)-II to AT-I cells that give rise to the primary site of gas exchange, the alveolar/vascular interface. Endothelial-Monocyte Activating Polypeptide (EMAP) II, an endogenous protein with anti-angiogenic properties, profoundly disrupts distal lung neovascularization and alveolar formation during lung morphogenesis, and is robustly expressed in the dysplastic alveolar regions of infants with Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Determination as to whether EMAP II has a direct or indirect affect on ATII -> ATI trans-differentiation has not been explored., METHOD: In a controlled nonvascular environment, an in vitro model of ATII -> ATI cell trans-differentiation was utilized to demonstrate the contribution that one vascular mediator has on distal epithelial cell differentiation., RESULTS: Here, we show that EMAP II significantly blocked ATII -> ATI cell transdifferentiation by increasing cellular apoptosis and inhibiting expression of ATI markers. Moreover, EMAP II-treated ATII cells displayed myofibroblast characteristics, including elevated cellular proliferation, increased actin cytoskeleton stress fibers and Rho-GTPase activity, and increased nuclear:cytoplasmic volume. However, EMAP II-treated cells did not express the myofibroblast markers desmin or alphaSMA., CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that EMAP II interferes with ATII -> ATI transdifferentiation resulting in a proliferating non-myofibroblast cell. These data identify the transdifferentiating alveolar cell as a possible target for EMAP II's induction of alveolar dysplasia.

AB  - Preterm infants exposed to oxygen and mechanical ventilation are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a multifactorial chronic lung disorder characterized by arrested alveolar development and nonsprouting, dysmorphic microvascular angiogenesis. The molecular regulation of this BPD-associated pathological angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. In this study, the authors used focused microarray technology to characterize the angiogenic gene expression profile in postmortem lung samples from short-term ventilated preterm infants (born at 24 to 27 weeks' gestation) and age-matched control infants. Microarray analysis identified differential expression of 13 of 112 angiogenesis-related genes. Genes significantly up-regulated in ventilated lungs included the antiangiogenic genes thrombospondin-1, collagen XVIII alpha-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), as well as endoglin, transforming growth factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2). Increased expression of thrombospondin-1 in ventilated lungs was verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunolocalized primarily to intravascular platelets and fibrin aggregates. Down-regulated genes included proangiogenic angiogenin and midkine, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-B, VEGF receptor-2, and the angiopoietin receptor TEK/Tie-2. In conclusion, short-term ventilated lungs show a shift from traditional angiogenic growth factors to alternative, often antisprouting regulators. This angiogenic shift may be implicated in the regulation of dysmorphic angiogenesis and, consequently, deficient alveolarization characteristic of infants with BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and emphysema are characterized by arrested alveolar development or loss of alveoli; both are significant global health problems and currently lack effective therapy. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) prevent adult lung injury, but their therapeutic potential in neonatal lung disease is unknown., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that intratracheal delivery of BMSCs would prevent alveolar destruction in experimental BPD., METHODS: In vitro, BMSC differentiation and migration were assessed using co-culture assays and a modified Boyden chamber. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of BMSCs was assessed in a chronic hyperoxia-induced model of BPD in newborn rats., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In vitro, BMSCs developed immunophenotypic and ultrastructural characteristics of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) (surfactant protein C expression and lamellar bodies) when co-cultured with lung tissue, but not with culture medium alone or liver. Migration assays revealed preferential attraction of BMSCs toward oxygen-damaged lung versus normal lung. In vivo, chronic hyperoxia in newborn rats led to air space enlargement and loss of lung capillaries, and this was associated with a decrease in circulating and resident lung BMSCs. Intratracheal delivery of BMSCs on Postnatal Day 4 improved survival and exercise tolerance while attenuating alveolar and lung vascular injury and pulmonary hypertension. Engrafted BMSCs coexpressed the AEC2-specific marker surfactant protein C. However, engraftment was disproportionately low for cell replacement to account for the therapeutic benefit, suggesting a paracrine-mediated mechanism. In vitro, BMSC-derived conditioned medium prevented O(2)-induced AEC2 apoptosis, accelerated AEC2 wound healing, and enhanced endothelial cord formation., CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs prevent arrested alveolar and vascular growth in part through paracrine activity. Stem cell-based therapies may offer new therapeutic avenues for lung diseases that currently lack efficient treatments.

AB  - RATIONALE: Preterm infants exposed to mechanical ventilation and oxygen are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a multifactorial chronic lung disorder characterized by arrested alveolar development. Studies have described disruption of microvascular development in BPD, characterized by primitive angioarchitectural patterns reminiscent of the canalicular/saccular stages of lung development. The molecular regulation of this BPD-associated dysangiogenesis remains undetermined., OBJECTIVES: Endoglin (CD105), a hypoxia-inducible transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor, has been implicated as an important regulator of angiogenesis in various neoplastic and nonneoplastic conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of endoglin and other angiogenesis-related factors in ventilated preterm human lungs., METHODS: We have studied endoglin protein and mRNA expression in postmortem lungs of short-term and long-term ventilated preterm infants. Control subjects were age-matched infants who had lived for less than 1 hour., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lungs of short-term ventilated preterm infants showed significant upregulation of endoglin mRNA and protein levels, immunolocalized to the microvasculature. Similar but more variable endoglin upregulation was noted in lungs of long-term ventilated infants with BPD. The mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-1, and their respective receptors were significantly lower in ventilated lungs than in age-matched nonventilated control lungs., CONCLUSIONS: BPD is associated with a shift from traditional angiogenic growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-1) to alternative regulators such as endoglin, which may contribute to BPD-associated microvascular dysangiogenesis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolar dysplasia, and evidence indicates that interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory lung diseases. Nonetheless, the significance and mechanism of IRF4 in BPD remain unelucidated. Consequently, we established a mouse model of BPD through hyperoxia exposure, and ELISA was employed to measure interleukin-17 A (IL-17 A) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression levels in lung tissues. Western blotting was adopted to determine the expression of IRF4, surfactant protein C (SP-C), and podoplanin (T1alpha) in lung tissues. Flow cytometry was utilized for analyzing the percentages of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and FOXP3+RORgammat+ Tregs in CD4+ T cells in lung tissues to clarify the underlying mechanism. Our findings revealed that BPD mice exhibited disordered lung tissue structure, elevated IRF4 expression, decreased SP-C and T1alpha expression, increased IL-17 A and IL-6 levels, reduced proportion of FOXP3+ Tregs, and increased proportion of FOXP3+RORgammat+ Tregs. For the purpose of further elucidating the effect of IRF4 on Treg phenotype switching induced by hyperoxia in lung tissues, we exposed neonatal mice with IRF4 knockout to hyperoxia. These mice exhibited regular lung tissue structure, increased proportion of FOXP3+ Tregs, reduced proportion of FOXP3+RORgammat+ Tregs, elevated SP-C and T1alpha expression, and decreased IL-17 A and IL-6 levels. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that IRF4-mediated Treg phenotype switching in lung tissues exacerbates alveolar epithelial cell injury under hyperoxia exposure. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - The present study investigated the role of montelukast (MK) during the progression of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and the underlying mechanism of action. A rat model of BPD was induced by hyperoxia and subsequently, the rats were treated with 10 mg/kg MK. On day 14 post-hyperoxia induction, lung function was assessed by detecting the mean linear intercept (MLI; the average alveolar diameter), the radial alveolar count (RAC; alveolar septation and alveologenesis) and the lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratio. Type II alveolar epithelial (AEC II) cells were isolated from normal rats to investigate the mechanism underlying the effect of MK on BPD in vitro. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were performed to measure the expression levels of surfactant protein C (SP-C), E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, collagen I (Col I), matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)1/3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and Smad3. MK significantly reduced the MLI and the LW/BW ratio, and increased the RAC of the BPD group compared with the control group. MK upregulated the expression of SP-C and E-cadherin, and downregulated the expression levels of N-cadherin and Vimentin in the lung tissues of the rat model of BPD, as well as in TGF-beta1- and hyperoxia-induced AEC II cells. In addition, MK reduced the expression of Col I, MMP1, MMP3, TGF-beta1 and Smad3 in the lung tissues of the rat model of BPD, as well as in TGF-beta1- and hyperoxia-induced AEC II cells. The present study demonstrated that MK improved BPD by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition via inactivating the TGF-beta1/Smads signaling pathway.

AB  - RATIONALE: Lungs of adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as newborns are simplified and exhibit reduced function much like that observed in people who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as infants. Because survivors of BPD also show increased risk for symptomatic respiratory infections, we investigated how neonatal hyperoxia affected the response of adult mice infected with influenza A virus infection., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether neonatal hyperoxia increased the severity of influenza A virus infection in adult mice., METHODS: Adult female mice exposed to room air or hyperoxia between Postnatal Days 1 and 4 were infected with a sublethal dose of influenza A virus., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes observed in airways of infected mice that had been exposed to hyperoxia as neonates was significantly greater than in infected siblings that had been exposed to room air. Enhanced inflammation correlated with increased levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2) in lavage fluid, whereas infection-associated changes in IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, KC, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and production of virus-specific antibodies, were largely unaffected. Increased mortality of mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia occurred by Day 14 of infection, and was associated with persistent inflammation and fibrosis., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the disruptive effect of hyperoxia on neonatal lung development also reprograms key innate immunoregulatory pathways in the lung, which may contribute to exacerbated pathology and poorer resistance to respiratory viral infections typically seen in people who had BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants despite improved treatment modalities. Pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, inhibits multiple processes that lead to neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, including inflammation, coagulation, and edema. Using a preterm rat model, we investigated the effects of pentoxifylline on hyperoxia-induced lung injury and survival. Preterm rat pups were exposed to 100% oxygen and injected subcutaneously with 0.9% saline or 75 mg/kg pentoxifylline twice a day. On day 10, lung tissue was harvested for histology, fibrin deposition, and mRNA expression, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected for total protein concentration. Pentoxifylline treatment increased mean survival by 3 days (P = 0.0018) and reduced fibrin deposition by 66% (P < 0.001) in lung homogenates compared with untreated hyperoxia-exposed controls. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in lung homogenates was decreased, but the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase-12, tissue factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were similar in both groups. Total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was decreased by 33% (P = 0.029) in the pentoxifylline group. Pentoxifylline treatment attenuates alveolar fibrin deposition and prolongs survival in preterm rat pups with neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, probably by reducing capillary-alveolar protein leakage.

AB  - Extracellular matrix proteins have a prominent role in both ontogenesis and fibrogenesis in the human lung. The aim of this study was to analyse the expression of newly formed precursor proteins and mRNA of collagen types I and III in developing human lung tissues from 12 to 40 weeks of gestation, and also in neonatal disorders such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Lung tissues were obtained at autopsy from 60 non-malformed cases. All tissues were analysed by immunohistochemistry and 24 were also investigated by mRNA in situ hybridization. The precursor proteins and mRNA of both collagens were expressed in abundance in pulmonary arteries and veins during all developmental periods. In RDS and BPD, precursor proteins and mRNAs of both collagen types were increased within alveolar walls. The cells in these locations showed alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and variable desmin immunoreactivity. Collagen I and III precursor proteins and mRNA were also observed in pleura, bronchi, bronchioles, and around chondrocytes during all developmental periods and in diseased lung. In conclusion, collagens I and III were expressed in a similar way in and around various cell types in the developing lung and their expression was increased within alveolar walls in RDS and BPD. Myofibroblast-type cells appeared to produce mRNA for both types of collagen in alveoli. Copyright 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Impaired neovascularization is associated with the pathologic presentation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To determine if neovascularization and factors that negatively influence blood vessel formation play a role in the evolution of BPD, we examined the temporospatial distribution of a protein known to inhibit fetal lung neovascularization with associated dysplastic lung formation, endothelial-monocyte activating polypeptide (EMAP) II. Immunohistochemical analysis of EMAP II in lung tissues of human infants with BPD indicated an elevation in EMAP II abundance as compared with control. Utilizing a baboon model, western analysis indicated that EMAP II was increased twofold in those baboons with pathologic signs of BPD as compared with gestational controls. Consistent with our findings in human tissues, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization demonstrate that EMAP II is highly expressed in the perivascular stroma and dysplastic lung periphery in neonatal baboons with BPD as compared with controls. Lastly, there is a premature acceleration in EMAP II's perivascular distribution in term newborn baboon as compared with gestational control. The marked increase in EMAP II's temporal expression, its distribution in the perivascular and dysplastic alveolar regions of the lungs, and the interruption in vasculogenesis in BPD suggest that neovascularization and factors that negatively influence blood vessel formation may play a role in BPD evolution.

AB  - Hyperoxia is an important factor in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and is associated with growth arrest and impaired alveolar septal development in the neonatal lung. p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) (p21), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, acts as a checkpoint regulator in the cell cycle during periods of stress and is induced in neonatal lung during hyperoxia exposure. To determine if p21 protects against lung injury during neonatal lung development, we placed newborn p21 knockout (p21(-/-)) and p21 wild-type (p21(+/+)) mice in 85-90% O(2) for 4 d. We found that newborn p21(-/-) mice exposed to O(2) had decreased survival in hyperoxia compared with p21(+/+) mice (P < 0.01). At 2 and 6 wk after exposure to neonatal hyperoxia, p21(-/-) O(2) lung had significantly larger alveoli then p21(-/-) control lung, as assessed by mean alveolar size and mean linear intercept. Pulmonary function tests at 6 wk demonstrated increased lung volume in both p21(-/-) and p21(+/+) O(2) mice consistent with altered lung growth from neonatal exposure to hyperoxia. Antibodies to nitrotyrosine, a marker for oxidative stress revealed that at 2 and 6 wk of age, p21(-/-) O(2) lung had significantly more oxidative stress than p21(-/-) and p21(+/+) control and p21(+/+) O(2) lung. We therefore conclude that p21 confers some additional protection to the lung during exposure to neonatal hyperoxia. Furthermore, p21 may be important during recovery from lung injury because it is associated with lower levels of oxidative stress and increased oxidative stress may contribute to alveolar growth abnormalities in the p21(-/-) O(2) lung.

AB  - Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein expressed in human tissues during organogenesis and in fibrotic and neoplastic processes. We hypothesized that its expression would increase in human lung in neonatal disorders such as infant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Tenascin-C expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH). The extent of tenascin-C immunoreactivity was scored as absent (0), low (+), moderate (++), strong (+++), or very strong (++++) separately in different types of pulmonary cells in controls (seven cases), RDS (19 cases), and BPD (12 cases). In controls, tenascin-C expression was low (+) underneath alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, moderate (++) in intima of veins, and strong (+++) around chondrocytes. In RDS, tenascin-C expression was moderate (++) or strong (+++) underneath both bronchiolar and often detached alveolar epithelium underlying hyaline membranes in the walls of dilated alveoli. In particular, the patients with RDS who survived for 1 day or more had strong expression of tenascin-C within alveolar walls. In patients with BPD, tenascin-C was very strongly (++++) expressed in the remodeled fibrotic alveolar walls underneath regenerative epithelium. Increased expression of tenascin-C mRNA was seen below the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelia in RDS and BPD. The cells in these locations showed alpha-smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity, suggesting a myofibroblast phenotype. In conclusion, tenascin-C is highly expressed in the walls of alveoli and bronchioli in RDS and BPD, suggesting an association between the expression of this protein and the presence of these disorders.

AB  - Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen in the neonatal period may impair lung growth and is a major contributing factor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Cell death from hyperoxic injury may occur through either an apoptotic or nonapoptotic pathway, and we were interested in determining the type of cell death that occurs in the lung of neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia. We found increased levels of Bax messenger RNA, a gene associated with apoptosis, in the lungs of neonatal mice born and raised in 92% hyperoxia. We next determined the extent of apoptosis taking place in the lungs of neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia using terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling in 3.5-, 4.5-, and 5.5-d-old neonatal lung. The number of apoptotic cells in peripheral lung was significantly higher in the 3.5-, 4.5-, and 5.5-d-old mice treated with oxygen compared with that in the room-air control mice. Further, the number of apoptotic cells in the lung increased with longer exposure duration. In murine lung bronchus cells exposed to hyperoxia, growth arrest occurred after 48 h of oxygen exposure. Using annexin V binding, necrotic cell death was found to be the major form of cell death in these cells after 72 h of hyperoxic exposure. We conclude that 92% hyperoxia causes significant lung injury in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia, and that the number of apoptotic cells in the lung increases the longer the duration of exposure. The increase in apoptosis from hyperoxic exposure during a critical period of lung development may be an important factor in the impaired lung growth and remodeling that occur in animals exposed to high oxygen concentrations. Finally, it appears that hyperoxic injured cells in neonatal lung undergo both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common problem in premature babies. Long-term sequelae are the main concerns., METHODS: A retrospective review of all BPD children born in Queen Mary Hospital, a teaching hospital of the University of Hong Kong, from January 1987 to December 1995 was conducted. Children with cerebral palsy, immunodeficiency, congenital heart disorders, renal or liver failure were excluded from analysis. Chest radiography (CXR), electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry were routinely performed., RESULTS: Fifty-five children completed the study. The female to male ratio was 1:1.1. The mean gestational age was 28 weeks. Twenty-five children were born with a birthweight of less than 1001 g. Mean age at assessment was 5.4 years. Twenty-four children (44%) demonstrated signs or symptoms of current asthma. Only seven children managed to perform the spirometry satisfactorily. One child had low forced vital capacity and one had hyperresponsive airway. The only risk factor found to be associated with current asthma was the birth month, with those children born early in the year at higher risk of developing current asthma. Seventeen of 48 children (35%) had a bodyweight below the third percentile at the corrected age of 1 year. Eleven of these seventeen children (65%) demonstrated catch-up growth at assessment. Abnormal CXR was found in 25 of 40 children (63%). All had normal pulse oximetry and ECG., CONCLUSIONS: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia children had a significantly higher risk than the general population of developing current asthma (odds ratio 4.7; 95% confidence interval 3.4-6.5; P<0.0001). The importance of birth month suggests that early life experience is important in the pathogenesis of asthma, even in BPD children. The long-term growth of BPD children was much better than previously reported.

AB  - 1. The neuroendocrine system of the lungs has no clear function. However, previous studies of one of its products, somatostatin, have implicated it in lung liquid removal at birth. The present study extends this concept by investigating the effects of dopamine, a major product of this system, on lung liquid reabsorption. 2. The effects of dopamine on fetal lung liquid production and reabsorption were tested on in vitro lungs from fetal guinea-pigs of 60 +/- 2 days of gestation (term = 67 days). Dopamine was placed in the outer bathing saline during the middle hour of 3 h incubations. Fluid movements across the pulmonary epithelium were monitored by a dye dilution method, and changes in rates over 1 h intervals were tested for significance by analysis of variance and regression analysis. 3. Dopamine was able to reduce fluid production or cause reabsorption (based on 42 preparations). Control preparations and those given 10-8 M dopamine showed no significant changes; those given higher concentrations showed significant reductions in production or reabsorption (P < 0.025 to P < 0.0005), according to dose (42.6 +/- 10.8% reduction at 10-7 M; 75.4 +/- 5.9% reduction at 10-6 M; 92.1 +/- 7.0% reduction at 10-5 M and 121.4 +/- 12.8% (reabsorption) at 10-4 M dopamine). The linear log dose-response curve (r = 0.99) showed a theoretical threshold at 1.7 x 10-9 M dopamine. 4. Effects were mediated through specific dopamine receptors (based on 78 preparations). Dopamine at 10-6 M was tested together with each of three dopamine receptor antagonists at 10-5 M. The general dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol and the more specific D2 receptor blocker domperidone both abolished responses, but the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 was without effect. This suggested that D2 dopamine receptors mediated the responses, and that responses were not due to conversion of dopamine to adrenaline or noradrenaline. 5. There was no evidence that responses involved amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport (based on 54 preparations). Apical amiloride at 10-6, 10-5 or 10-4 M, and the more specific Na+ channel blocker benzamil (10-5 M), had no effect on responses to dopamine, in contrast to their effects on responses to adrenaline in sheep. 6. It is suggested that internal release of dopamine by the neuroendocrine system of the lungs may influence lung liquid reabsorption at birth. This system, which also produces somatostatin, another agent active on lung liquid production, is maximally developed and activated at birth; it is also deficient in hyaline membrane disease.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe cytokine profiles of human neonatal pulmonary cells isolated by tracheal aspiration (TA) and by deep pulmonary lavage (DPL). We hypothesized that mRNA phenotyping, using the technique of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), would reveal differences in cytokine expression patterns between cells from proximal and distal airway compartments. We reasoned that cells derived by DPL may reflect pathogenic pathways indicative for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the premature infant. Here we have described the detection of mRNA for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Fourteen paired TA and DPL samples from six premature infants were collected at 1, 7, or 28 d of age. Two of 14 samples were negative for beta-actin (a ubiquitous mRNA) by RT-PCR and were excluded from further analysis. Each of the remaining 12 samples expressed IL-8. Furthermore, each cytokine could be expressed by TA or DPL cells. Cytokine mRNA phenotype profiles were found to differ between TA and DPL cells in four of five paired samples. Our results show that cells retrieved from these two pulmonary compartments are sources for these cytokines and suggest that RT-PCR of TA/DPL cells can be used to test hypothetical predictive markers for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Rationale: Antenatal inflammation with placental dysfunction is strongly associated with high bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) risk in preterm infants. Whether antenatal or postnatal HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) augmentation can preserve lung structure and function and prevent pulmonary hypertension after intrauterine inflammation is controversial. Objectives: To determine whether antenatal or postnatal prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor (PHi) therapy increases lung HIF expression, preserves lung growth and function, and prevents pulmonary hypertension in a rat model of chorioamnionitis-induced BPD caused by antenatal inflammation. Methods: Endotoxin (ETX) was administered to pregnant rats by intraamniotic injection at Embryonic Day 20, and pups were delivered by cesarean section at Embryonic Day 22. Selective PHi drugs, dimethyloxalylglycine or GSK360A, were administered into the amniotic space at Embryonic Day 20 or after birth by intraperitoneal injection for 2 weeks. Placentas and lung tissue were collected at birth for morphometric and Western blot measurements of HIF-1a, HIF-2a, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) protein contents. At Day 14, lung function was assessed, and tissues were harvested to determine alveolarization by radial alveolar counts, pulmonary vessel density, and right ventricle hypertrophy (RVH). Measurements and Main Results:  Antenatal PHi therapy preserves lung alveolar and vascular growth and lung function and prevents RVH after intrauterine ETX exposure. Antenatal administration of PHi markedly upregulates lung HIF-1a, HIF-2a, VEGF, and eNOS expression after ETX exposure. Conclusions: HIF augmentation improves lung structure and function, prevents RVH, and improves placental structure following antenatal ETX exposure. We speculate that antenatal or postnatal PHi therapy may provide novel strategies to prevent BPD due to antenatal inflammation.

AB  - Long-term growth failure and altered body composition are common consequences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesized that these chronic findings are preceded by uncompensated, acute early growth failure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia on body composition and growth of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants during the first six postnatal weeks. Arm muscle and fat accretion and changes in weight, length and head circumference were evaluated in 16 very-low-birth-weight infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia and compared with 16 birth-weight-matched control infants without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. During the 1st wk, both groups experienced similarly low nutritional intakes, wasting of arm muscle and fat stores, and reduced weight, length and head circumference growth velocities, compared with intrauterine growth standards. Between wk 2 and 4, infants with developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia consumed less protein and energy (P < 0.05), accreted less arm fat and muscle (P < 0.05), and grew more slowly than control infants in all measured variables (P < 0.05). When infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had achieved full enteral feedings and had similar protein-energy intakes to control infants, they demonstrated similar rates of growth and arm muscle and fat accretion, but did not demonstrate catch-up growth. These data support the speculation that early reductions in muscle and fat accretion and growth velocity contribute to the long-term growth failure in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Prevention may require greater attention to defining and delivering optimal nutritional therapy to physiologically unstable premature infants in the immediate postnatal period.

AB  - Corticosteroids result in protein wasting in human adults and rats. To determine to what extent this therapy affects protein metabolism in preterm infants, we studied 10 very low birth weight infants before a gradually tapered dexamethasone regimen was started and at day 4 of treatment (dexamethasone dosage 0.35 +/- 0.09 mg.kg-1.day-1), and seven infants at day 19 of treatment (dexamethasone dosage, 0.10 +/- 0.01 mg.kg-1.day-1). Protein breakdown and turnover rates were increased at day 4 of treatment but not any more at day 19 of treatment. Protein synthesis rate was not significantly affected during dexamethasone therapy. Weight gain was severely diminished during the first week of treatment but not during the next 2 weeks. We conclude that nitrogen balance during high dosages of dexamethasone is significantly lower because of an increase in proteolysis and not because of a suppression of synthesis.

AB  - A human lung polychlorinated biphenyl binding protein (PCB-BP,M(r) 13 kd) has recently been purified from lavage fluid. Polyclonal monospecific antibodies against PCB-BP were produced and used for immunohistochemical staining in sections of human lung tissue. PCB-BP was found to localize preferentially to the nonciliated (Clara) cells of the lung, whereas the alveolar cells and ciliated cells of the larger airways were devoid of staining. Tracheal aspirates from infants receiving mechanical ventilation were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation and Western immunoblotting. The antibodies to human PCB-BP detected a single band of the expected molecular weight, and a quantitative analysis of the ontogeny of PCB-BP in tracheal aspirates was performed by construction of Western immunoblot standard curves. A significant increase in the levels of PCB-BP in late gestation (gestational weeks 39 to 41) was demonstrated. In similar experiments, levels of PCB-BP in tracheal aspirates obtained from infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at the postconceptional age of less than 38 weeks were found to be significantly elevated as compared with a normal study group of similar gestational age (21.8 +/- 4.8 vs 3.1 +/- 0.8 ng of PCB-BP per microgram of total protein, p < 0.005). It is suggested that the high levels of PCB-BP at the postconceptional age of less than 38 weeks observed in infants with BPD may reflect inflammatory injury and regeneration of airway epithelium, associated with proliferation of Clara cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which often presents with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is among the most common morbidities affecting extremely premature infants and is a leading cause of severe vision impairment in children worldwide. Activations of the inflammasome cascade and microglia have been implicated in playing a role in the development of both ROP and BPD. Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) is pivotal in inflammasome assembly. Utilizing mouse models of both oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and BPD, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that hyperoxia induces ASC speck formation, which leads to microglial activation and retinopathy, and that inhibition of ASC speck formation by a humanized monoclonal antibody, IC100, directed against ASC, will ameliorate microglial activation and abnormal retinal vascular formation., METHODS: We first tested ASC speck formation in the retina of ASC-citrine reporter mice expressing ASC fusion protein with a C-terminal citrine (fluorescent GFP isoform) using a BPD model that causes both lung and eye injury by exposing newborn mice to room air (RA) or 85% O2 from postnatal day (P) 1 to P14. The retinas were dissected on P14 and retinal flat mounts were used to detect vascular endothelium with AF-594-conjugated isolectin B4 (IB4) and citrine-tagged ASC specks. To assess the effects of IC100 on an OIR model, newborn ASC citrine reporter mice and wildtype mice (C57BL/6 J) were exposed to RA from P1 to P6, then 75% O2 from P7 to P11, and then to RA from P12 to P18. At P12 mice were randomized to the following groups: RA with placebo PBS (RA-PBS), O2 with PBS (O2-PBS), O2 + IC100 intravitreal injection (O2-IC100-IVT), and O2 + IC100 intraperitoneal injection (O2-IC100-IP). Retinal vascularization was evaluated by flat mount staining with IB4. Microglial activation was detected by immunofluorescence staining for allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF-1) and CD206. Retinal structure was analyzed on H&E-stained sections, and function was analyzed by pattern electroretinography (PERG). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the retinas was performed to determine the transcriptional effects of IC100 treatment in OIR., RESULTS: ASC specks were significantly increased in the retinas by hyperoxia exposure and colocalized with the abnormal vasculature in both BPD and OIR models, and this was associated with increased microglial activation. Treatment with IC100-IVT or IC100-IP significantly reduced vaso-obliteration and intravitreal neovascularization. IC100-IVT treatment also reduced retinal microglial activation, restored retinal structure, and improved retinal function. RNA-seq showed that IC100 treatment corrected the induction of genes associated with angiogenesis, leukocyte migration, and VEGF signaling caused by O2. IC100 also corrected the suppression of genes associated with cell junction assembly, neuron projection, and neuron recognition caused by O2., CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the crucial role of ASC in the pathogenesis of OIR and the efficacy of a humanized therapeutic anti-ASC antibody in treating OIR mice. Thus, this anti-ASC antibody may potentially be considered in diseases associated with oxygen stresses and retinopathy, such as ROP. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

AB  - Our previous studies indicated that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) alleviates hyperoxia-induced lung injury and suggested the possible involvement of autophagy in this process. Herein, we aimed to further explore the potential involvement of tumor protein p53 (TP53) and autophagy in the mode of action of CGRP against hyperoxia-induced lung injury in vitro and in vivo. The study conducted tests on type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) and rats that were subjected to hyperoxia treatment or combined treatment of hyperoxia with CGRP, CGRP inhibitor, rapamycin (an autophagy agonist), 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor), TP53 silencing/inhibitor (pifithrin-alpha), or expression vector/activator (PRIMA-1 (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-3-quinuclidinone)) and their corresponding controls. We found that oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy were all increased by hyperoxia treatment in vitro. However, treating AECII cells with CGRP reversed hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis but further promoted autophagy. In addition, the combined treatment with rapamycin or TP53 silencing with CGRP promoted the effect of CGRP, while contrary results were obtained with combined therapy with 3-MA or TP53 overexpression. In vivo, the number of hyperoxia-induced autophagosomes was promoted in the lung tissue of neonatal rats. Furthermore, hyperoxia increased the expression levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha 1 (also known as protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1)) but inhibited TP53 and mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR); these expression trends were regulated by CGRP treatment. In conclusion, we showed that CGRP can attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats by enhancing autophagy and regulating the TP53/AMPK/MTOR crosstalk axis. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine nutritional intake profiles and growth trajectories of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants who develop severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study using multiple logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations (GEE) to adjust for matching., RESULTS: Cumulative and mean fluid intakes were higher (p = 0.003) and caloric intakes lower (p < 0.0001) through week two in infants who developed severe BPD (n = 120) versus those without severe BPD (n = 104). Mean caloric intake through week 12 was lower in infants who developed severe BPD (102 +/- 10.1 vs. 107 +/- 8.5 kcal/kg/day, p < 0.0001). In the logistic regression models, lower mean caloric intake through week 12 was associated with increased risk of developing severe BPD. Linear growth reduced the odds of BPD by ~30% for each Z-score point., CONCLUSIONS: Higher fluid and lower total caloric intakes and reductions in linear growth were independently associated with an increased risk of developing severe BPD in ELBW infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common late morbidity for premature infants. Continuous neuromuscular blockade (CNMB) is suggested for the most unstable phase of BPD, despite no outcome data. We explored the association between duration of CNMB for severe BPD and mortality., DESIGN: Medical record review of children <5 years old admitted from 2016 to 2022 with BPD and one or more course of CNMB for >=14 days., RESULTS: Twelve children received a total of 20 episodes of CNMB for >=14 days (range 14-173 d) during their hospitalization. Most (10/12) were born at <28 weeks' gestation and most (11/12) with birth weight <1,000 g; 7/12 were of Black race/ethnicity. All were hospitalized since birth. Most (10/12) were initially transferred from an outside neonatal intensive care unit (ICU), typically after a >60-day hospitalization (9/12). Half (6/12) of them had a >=60-day stay in our neonatal ICU before transferring to our pediatric ICU for, generally, >=90 days (8/12). The primary study outcome was survival to discharge: 2/12 survived. Both had shorter courses of CNMB (19 and 25 d); only one child who died had a course <=25 days. Just two infants had increasing length Z-scores during hospitalization; only one infant had a final length Z-score > - 2., CONCLUSION: In this case series of infants with severe BPD, there were no survivors among those receiving >=25 days of CNMB. Linear growth, an essential growth parameter for infants with BPD, decreased in most patients. These data do not support the use of >=25 days of CNMB to prevent mortality in infants with severe BPD., KEY POINTS: . This is a case series of neuromuscular blockade for severe BPD.. . Neuromuscular blockade did not improve linear growth.. . Ten out of 12 infants who were on prolonged neuromuscular blockade died.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant human IGF-1/binding protein-3 (rhIGF-1/BP3) is currently being tested in phase II clinical trials in premature infants to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but its impact on the neonatal intestine remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether rhIGF-1/BP3 protects against necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in mice and to investigate the mechanisms involved., METHODS: Neonatal mice were dam fed or injected intraperitoneally with rhIGF-1/BP3 (or vehicle) and submitted to an experimental NEC model. Serum IGF-1 was assessed by ELISA and intestinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression by Western blot. Intestinal endothelial cell proliferation, and enterocyte proliferation and migration were examined by immunofluorescence. Pup survival and histological intestinal injury were determined., RESULTS: In pups exposed to experimental NEC, serum IBP3-bound IGF-1 level was decreased. Exogenous rhIGF-1/BP3 preserved VEGF and VEGFR2 protein expression, decreased vascular permeability, and preserved endothelial cell proliferation in the small intestine. Furthermore, rhIGF-1/BP3 promoted enterocyte proliferation and migration, which effects were attenuated by inhibiting VEGFR2 signaling, decreased enterocyte apoptosis and decreased systemic and intestinal inflammation. rhIGF-1/BP3 improved survival and reduced the incidence of severe intestinal injury in experimental NEC., CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous rhIGF-1/BP3 protects neonatal mice against experimental NEC via multiple mechanisms., IMPACT: Exogenous rhIGF-1/BP3 preserves intestinal microvascular development and integrity, promotes enterocyte proliferation and migration, decreases local and systemic inflammation, and protects neonatal mice against NEC. The article adds pre-clinical evidence of a protective role for rhIGF-1/BP3 on the premature gut. It provides evidence supporting the use of rhIGF1/BP3 in premature neonates to protect against NEC.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulates gene expression and governs many important biological processes. However, the function of m6A in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains poorly characterized. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of m6A RNA methylation regulators on the development of BPD. BPD-related transcriptome data were downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed m6A methylation regulators between BPD and control group were identified. Consensus clustering was conducted for the classification of BPD and association between clusters and BPD phenotypes were explored. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and immune-related DEGs was performed. The GSEA, GO and KEGG analyses were used to interpret the functional enrichments. The composition of immune cell subtypes in BPD subsets was predicted by CIBERSORT analysis. Compared with the control group, expression of most m6A regulators showed significant alteration, especially for IGF2BP1/2/3. BPD was classified into 2 subsets, and cluster 1 was correlated with severe BPD. Furthermore, the results of functional enrichment analyses showed a disturbed immune-related signaling pathway. Based on CIBERSORT analysis, we found that the proportion of immune cell subsets changed between cluster 1 and cluster 2. Our study revealed the implication of m6A methylation regulators in the development of BPD, which might provide a novel insight for the diagnosis and treatment of BPD. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the impact of perinatal factors on cord serum club cell protein (CC16) and the association of CC16 with mechanical ventilation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm neonates., STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study including 60 neonates born with gestational age (GA) < 34 weeks. The impact of categorical perinatal factors on cord blood levels of CC16 was examined with univariate and multivariate regression analyses., RESULTS: In neonates with GA < 32 weeks, cord blood CC16 concentrations were significantly lower compared to neonates with GA between 320/7 and 336/7 weeks (5.4 +/- 2.5 compared to 7.6 +/- 2.9 ng/mL, p = 0.039). Neonates with prolonged rupture of membranes had significantly lower CC16 compared to those without prolonged rupture of membranes (4.0 +/- 1.9 compared to 7.2 +/- 2.2, p < 0.001). Finally, neonates with BPD had significantly lower CC16, compared to neonates without BPD (4.2 +/- 2.1 compared to 7.0 +/- 2.2 ng/mL, p = 0.004). Prolonged rupture of membranes was significantly negatively associated with CC16 (b = -2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.49 to -4.85, p = 0.017), after adjusting for GA (b = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03-0.42, p = 0.022), mode of conception, and mode of delivery. Finally, higher CC16 levels were significantly inversely associated with BPD (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.88, p = 0.028), after adjusting for GA (b = 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.78, p = 0.015), and birth weight., CONCLUSION: Prolonged rupture of membranes was significantly negatively associated with cord serum CC16, after adjusting for GA, conception, and delivery mode, and CC16 was significantly inversely associated with BPD, after adjusting for GA and birth weight., KEY POINTS: . Neonates with prolonged rupture of membranes had lower CC16 levels.. . CC16 was significantly negatively associated with BPD.. . CC16 could be a biomarker of lung injury and BPD.. Copyright Thieme.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease in premature infants and hyperoxia exposure is a major cause. In hyperoxic lung injury animal model, alveolar simplification and pro-inflammatory cells infiltration are the main pathophysiologic changes. Caffeine is a drug used to treat apnea in premature infants. Early use of caffeine can decrease the rate and the severity of BPD while the mechanisms are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of caffeine on inflammation and lung development in neonatal mice with hyperoxic lung injury and to explore the possible mechanism., METHODS: Following 14 d of 75% oxygen exposure in newborn mouse, the BPD model was established. Caffeine at a dose of 1 g/L was added in drinking water to nursing mouse. We measured the concentration of caffeine in serum and oxidative stress in lung by commercially available kits. Adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) expression and lung inflammation were measured by Immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Apoptosis and surfactant protein-C (SFTPC) levels were measured by immunofluorescence. The inflammasome and NF-kappaB pathway proteins were assessed by western blotting., RESULTS: We found that the caffeine concentration in plasma at present dose significantly decreased the expression of A2AR protein in mice lung. Caffeine treatment significantly reduced oxidative stress, improved weight gain, promoted alveolar development, attenuated inflammatory infiltration and lung injury in hyperoxia-induced lung injury mice. Moreover, caffeine decreased the cell apoptosis in lung tissues, especially the Type II alveolar epithelial cell. The expression of NLRP3 inflammasome protein and NF-kappaB pathway were significantly inhibited by caffeine treatment., CONCLUSION: Caffeine treatment can protect hyperoxia-induced mice lung from oxidative injury by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kappaB pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preterm infants have high zinc (Zn) requirements and are generally believed to be in a negative Zn balance in the early period of life. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of high-dose Zn supplementation in very low birth weight (VLBW: infants with birth weight < 1.5 kg) infants on feeding intolerance and development of mortality and/or morbidities including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS)., STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective randomized trial. VLBW preterm infants with gestational age of <32 weeks were randomly allocated on the seventh day of life to receive extra amount of supplemental Zn along with the enteral feedings (9 + 3 mg), besides regular low-dose supplementation (3 mg), from enrollment until discharge. Outcome measures were feeding intolerance, NEC (stage >= 2), LOS, and mortality., RESULTS: A total of 195 infants (97 from study group and 98 from control group) were analyzed. A total of 46 (47.4%) infants in the study group and 64 (65.3%) infants in the control group ended up with feeding intolerance (p = 0.012). NEC was observed in 11 infants (11.2%) in the control group and only 1 infant (1%) in the study group (p = 0.003). There was a negative correlation between high-dose Zn supplementation and number of culture-proven LOS episodes (p = 0.041). This significance was also present for clinical sepsis, being higher in the control group (p = 0.029). No relationship between high-dose Zn supplementation and mortality and other morbidities (hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage) was observed., CONCLUSION: Zn supplementation for VLBW infants is found to be effective to decrease feeding intolerance, NEC, and LOS episodes in this vulnerable population. Current data support the supplementation of VLBW infants with higher than regular dose of Zn., KEY POINTS: . Higher dose of Zn supplementation is shown to be a beneficial intervention in VLBW infants.. . Zn may decrease feeding intolerance, sepsis or NEC.. . Higher than regular dose of Zn seems to be safe..

AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of Herpesviridae. It has been reported that HCMV is reactivated in the breast milk of HCMV-seropositive lactating women. As we have reported various aspects of the roles of indigenous microbiota, its role in the murine CMV (MCMV) reactivation was examined in this study. MCMV was latently infected in the salivary gland, mammary tissues, and colon in the pregnant mice. When the salivary gland, mammary tissues, and colon were removed 5 days after delivery, MCMV reactivation of latent infection in each organ was confirmed by the detection of MCMV IE1 mRNA using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. MCMV reactivation was observed in 100% of the mice during pregnancy. Next, for the elimination of intestinal microbiota, the pregnant mice were treated with low-dose or high-dose non-absorbable antibiotics. Although the numbers of aerobe/anaerobe in cecal content in low-dose antibiotic-treated mice were comparable to those in untreated controls, high-dose antibiotic treatment decreased the number of aerobe/anaerobe microbes from ca.9.0 Log10 to ca.3.0 Log10 (cfu/g). However, it could not be confirmed in 16S rRNA analysis that specific bacterial phylum or genus was eliminated by this high-dose treatment. Interestingly, MCMV reactivation was also observed in 100% of low-dose antibiotic-treated mice, whereas, in high-dose antibiotic-treated mice, MCMV reactivation was not observed in the salivary gland or colon. MCMV IE1 mRNA was detected only in 33% of the mammary tissues of those high-dose-treated mice. These results suggest that the indigenous microbiota played a crucial role in the reactivation of latent infection. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection via breast milk is a serious problem for very preterm infants such as developing a sepsis-like syndrome, cholestasis, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, among others. It has been reported that HCMV is reactivated in the breast milk of HCMV-seropositive lactating women. In this study, the roles of indigenous microbiota in the murine CMV (MCMV) reactivation were examined using a mouse model. In MCMV latently infected mice, MCMV reactivation was observed in 100% of the mice during pregnancy. For the elimination of intestinal microbiota, MCMV-latent mice were treated with non-absorbable antibiotics. After delivery, MCMV reactivation was not observed in antibiotic-treated mice. This result suggested that the indigenous microbiota played a crucial role in the reactivation of latent infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease in premature infants with alveolar simplification and pulmonary vascular development disorder as the main pathological feature and hyperoxia as the main etiology. Autophagy is a highly conserved cytological behavior of self-degrading cellular components and is accompanied by oxidative stress. Studies have reported that autophagy is regulated by FOXO1 posttranslational modification. However, whether autophagy can be involved in the regulation of endothelial cell injury induced by hyperoxia and its mechanism are still unclear., STUDY DESIGN: We have activated and inhibited autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells under hyperoxia and verified the role of autophagy in endothelial cell-related functions from both positive and negative aspects., RESULTS: Our research showed that the expression level of autophagy-related proteins decreased, accompanied by decreased cell migration ability and tube formation ability and increased cell reactive oxygen species level and cell permeability under hyperoxia conditions. Using an autophagy agonist alleviated hyperoxia-induced changes and played a protective role. However, inhibition of autophagy aggravated the cell damage induced by hyperoxia. Moreover, the decrease in autophagy proteins was accompanied by the upregulation of FOXO1 phosphorylation and acetylation., CONCLUSION: We concluded that autophagy was a protective mechanism against endothelial cell injury caused by hyperoxia. Autophagy might participate in this process by coregulating posttranslational modifications of FOXO1., KEY POINTS: . Hyperoxia induces vascular endothelial cell injury.. . Autophagy may has a protective role under hyperoxia conditions. . . FOXO1 posttranslational modification may be involved in the regulation of autophagy.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at increased risk for dysfunctional immune responses in the postnatal period. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that thymic function is altered in infants with BPD and changes in the expression of thymic function-related genes affect thymic development., STUDY DESIGN: Included in the study were infants who had a gestational age <=32 weeks and survived to a postmenstrual age of >=36 weeks. The clinical features and thymic size were comparatively studied between infants with and without BPD. Thymic function and the expression of thymic function-related genes were determined in BPD infants at birth, week 2, and 4 of life. The thymic size was ultrasonographically assessed in terms of the thymic index (TI) and thymic weight index (TWI). T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and gene expression were quantitatively determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: Compared to non-BPD infants, their BPD counterparts had a shorter GA, lower birth weight, lower Apgar scores at birth, and were more likely to be of the male gender. BPD infants had an elevated incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. TI was 1.73 +/- 0.68 versus 2.87 +/- 0.70 cm3 and TWI was 1.38 +/- 0.45 versus 1.72 +/- 0.28 cm3/kg in the BPD group versus the non-BPD group (p < 0.05). In BPD infants, no significant changes were observed in thymic size, lymphocyte counts, and TREC copy numbers at the first 2 weeks (p > 0.05), but they all exhibited a significant increase at week 4 (p < 0.05). BPD infants presented a trend toward increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and decreased expression of forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) from birth to week 4 (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, no significant difference was found in IL-2 or IL-7 expression at all time points (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: For preterm infants with BPD, reduced thymic size at birth might be associated with impaired thymic function. Thymic function was developmentally regulated in the BPD process., KEY POINTS: . For preterm infants with BPD, reduced thymic size at birth might be associated with impaired thymic.. . BPD infants had an elevated incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.. . Thymic function was developmentally regulated in the BPD process.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postnatal corticosteroids are used in the critical care of preterm infants for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We aimed to investigate the effects of early postnatal dexamethasone therapy and dose on cardiac maturation and morphology in preterm lambs., METHODS: Lambs were delivered prematurely at ~128 days of gestational age and managed postnatally according to best clinical practice. Preterm lambs were administered dexamethasone daily at either a low-dose (n = 9) or a high-dose (n = 7), or were naive to steroid treatment and administered saline (n = 9), over a 7-day time-course. Hearts were studied at postnatal Day 7 for gene expression and assessment of myocardial structure., RESULTS: High-dose dexamethasone treatment in the early postnatal period led to marked differences in cardiac gene expression, altered cardiomyocyte maturation and reduced cardiomyocyte endowment in the right ventricle, as well as increased inflammatory infiltrates into the left ventricle. Low-dose exposure had minimal effects on the preterm heart., CONCLUSION: Neonatal dexamethasone treatment led to adverse effects in the preterm heart in a dose-dependent manner within the first week of life. The observed cardiac changes associated with high-dose postnatal dexamethasone treatment may influence postnatal growth and remodeling of the preterm heart and subsequent long-term cardiac function.

AB  - Premature birth disrupts normal lung development and places infants at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease increasing in incidence which disrupts lung health throughout the lifespan. The TGFbeta superfamily has been implicated in BPD pathogenesis, however, what cell lineage it impacts remains unclear. We show that Tgfbr2 is critical for AT1 cell fate maintenance and function. Loss of Tgfbr2 in AT1 cells during late lung development leads to AT1-AT2 cell reprogramming and altered pulmonary architecture, which persists into adulthood. Restriction of fetal lung stretch and associated AT1 cell spreading through a model of oligohydramnios enhances AT1-AT2 reprogramming. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis reveal the necessity of Tgfbr2 expression in AT1 cells for extracellular matrix production. Moreover, TGFbeta signaling regulates integrin transcription to alter AT1 cell morphology, which further impacts ECM expression through changes in mechanotransduction. These data reveal the cell intrinsic necessity of TGFbeta signaling in maintaining AT1 cell fate and reveal this cell lineage as a major orchestrator of the alveolar matrisome.

AB  - Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have impaired alveolar gas exchange due to alveolar simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. Advances in clinical care have improved survival for infants with BPD, but the overall incidence of BPD remains unchanged because we lack specific therapies to prevent this disease. Recent work has suggested a role for increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signaling and myofibroblast populations in BPD pathogenesis, but the functional significance of each remains unclear. Here, we utilize multiple murine models of alveolar simplification and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing to identify shared mechanisms that could contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a profound loss of myofibroblasts in two models of BPD and identifies gene expression signatures of increased TGFbeta signaling, cell cycle arrest, and impaired proliferation in myofibroblasts. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we find no evidence that increased TGFbeta signaling in the lung mesenchyme contributes to alveolar simplification. In contrast, this is likely a failed compensatory response, since none of our approaches to inhibit TGFb signaling protect mice from alveolar simplification due to hyperoxia while several make simplification worse. In contrast, we find that impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature in several murine models of BPD, and we show that inhibiting myofibroblast proliferation is sufficient to cause pathologic alveolar simplification. Our results underscore the importance of impaired myofibroblast proliferation as a central feature of alveolar simplification and suggest that efforts to reverse this process could have therapeutic value in BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of perinatal and neonatal risk factors on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and to examine the association of fertility treatments on the risk for ROP in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm twins., METHODS: The population-based observational study consisted of VLBW twins born at 24-29 weeks gestational age (GA). Data from the Israel national database (1995-2020) were applied. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression using the General Estimating Equation were used for assessment of risk factors., RESULTS: The study population comprised 4092 infants of whom 2374 (58%) were conceived following fertility treatments. ROP was diagnosed in 851 (20.8%) infants. The odds for ROP approximately doubled with each week decrease in GA: at 24 weeks, Odds Ratio (OR) 58.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31.83-105.68); 25 weeks, OR 25.88 (95% CI 16.76-39.96); 26 weeks, OR 12.69 (95% CI 8.84-18.22) compared to 29 weeks GA. Each decrease in one birthweight z-score was associated with 1.82-fold increased risk for ROP (OR, 1.82, 95% CI 1.59-2.08). Infertility treatments were not associated with ROP. Neonatal morbidities significantly associated with ROP were surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (OR, 2.04, 95% CI 1.31-3.19); surgically treated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (OR, 1.63, 95% CI 1.12-2.37); sepsis (OR, 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.71) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR, 1.52, 95% CI 1.22-1.90)., CONCLUSION: Among preterm VLBW twins, poor intrauterine growth and surgical interventions for NEC and PDA were associated with high odds for ROP. This study does not support an association of fertility treatments with increased risk for ROP. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

AB  - Oxidative stress, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sequentially occur in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and all result in DNA damage. When DNA damage becomes irreparable, tumor suppressors increase, followed by apoptosis or senescence. Although cellular senescence contributes to wound healing, its persistence inhibits growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that cellular senescence contributes to BPD progression. Human autopsy lungs were obtained. Sprague-Dawley rat pups exposed to 95% oxygen between Postnatal Day 1 (P1) and P10 were used as the BPD phenotype. N-acetyl-lysyltyrosylcysteine-amide (KYC), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), and Foxo4 dri were administered intraperitoneally to mitigate myeloperoxidase oxidant generation, ER stress, and cellular senescence, respectively. Lungs were examined by histology, transcriptomics, and immunoblotting. Cellular senescence increased in rat and human BPD lungs, as evidenced by increased oxidative DNA damage, tumor suppressors, GL-13 stain, and inflammatory cytokines with decreased cell proliferation and lamin B expression. Cellular senescence-related transcripts in BPD rat lungs were enriched at P10 and P21. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed increased cellular senescence in several cell types, including type 2 alveolar cells. In addition, Foxo4-p53 binding increased in BPD rat lungs. Daily TUDCA or KYC, administered intraperitoneally, effectively decreased cellular senescence, improved alveolar complexity, and partially maintained the numbers of type 2 alveolar cells. Foxo4 dri administered at P4, P6, P8, and P10 led to outcomes similar to TUDCA and KYC. Our data suggest that cellular senescence plays an essential role in BPD after initial inducement by hyperoxia. Reducing myeloperoxidase toxic oxidant production, ER stress, and attenuating cellular senescence are potential therapeutic strategies for halting BPD progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary hypertension is frequent in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Echocardiography is easy to perform, non-invasive, and recommended by guidelines even though solely it is not enough. Catheterisation is gold standard but invasive, expensive, and not cost effective. Therefore, we aimed to assess to find out the role of biomarkers besides echocardiography in the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in preterm with bronchopulmonary dysplasia., METHODS: This study is done during the time period January 2016-2017. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was assessed by echocardiography at 36 weeks later repeated at 3rd and 6th months. We also repeated biomarkers at 3rd and 6th months. The infants born <= 28 weeks in Erciyes University hospital who were diagnosed bronchopulmonary dysplasia were included. Infants with genetic syndromes, structural lung, and CHDs were excluded. Patients without bronchopulmonary dysplasia but having pulmonary hypertension due to other reasons and patients having echocardiograms without adequate images were excluded., RESULTS: At initial, 21/59 patients had bronchopulmonary dysplasia-pulmonary hypertension (Group 1), 21/59 had no bronchopulmonary dysplasia-pulmonary hypertension (Group 2), and 17/59 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia without pulmonary hypertension (Group 3). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were found high in Group 1 (36 mmHg; p <0.001, 1.25 Woods Unit; p < 0.0017, respectively). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion values of Group 1 were low. Median serum kallistatin levels of Group 1 were lower than the other groups (230.5 (114.5-300.5) microg/ml; p < 0.005). During the study period, pulmonary hypertension of 14/21 bronchopulmonary dysplasia-pulmonary hypertension resolved, six patients in Group 3 developed pulmonary hypertension. However, there was no difference in the biomarkers of these six patients., CONCLUSION: In the diagnosis and the follow-up of pulmonary hypertension in bronchopulmonary dysplasia patients, besides echocardiography kallistatin, gelsolin, NT-probrain natriuretic peptide, homocysteine, and cystatin-C levels can be used. Further studies were required with large sample sizes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an abnormality that occurs in premature neonate lung development. The pathophysiology is uncertain, but the inflammatory response to lung injury may be the responsible pathway. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of interleukins 6, 8, 10, and 17 through the anatomopathological and immunohistochemical study of the lungs of premature neonates with BPD. Thirty-two cases of neonatal autopsies from the Pathology Department of the Clinics Hospital of the Universidade Federal do Parana, who presented between 1991 and 2005 were selected. The sample included neonates less than 34 weeks of gestational age who underwent oxygen therapy and had pulmonary formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Pulmonary specimens were later classified into three groups according to histopathological and morphometric changes (classic BPD, new BPD, and without BPD) and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. The antibodies selected for the study were anti-IL-6, anti-IL-8, anti-IL-10, and anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies. IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 showed no significant differences in tissue expression among the groups. IL-17A had higher tissue immunoreactivity in the group without BPD compared with the classic BPD group (1686 vs. 866 mum2, p = 0.029). This study showed that the involvement of interleukins 6, 8, and 10 might not be significantly different between the two types of BPD. We speculated that IL-17A could be a protective factor in this disease. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity affecting very preterm infants. Gut fungal and bacterial microbial communities contribute to multiple lung diseases and may influence BPD pathogenesis., METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational cohort study comparing the multikingdom fecal microbiota of 144 preterm infants with or without moderate to severe BPD by sequencing the bacterial 16S and fungal ITS2 ribosomal RNA gene. To address the potential causative relationship between gut dysbiosis and BPD, we used fecal microbiota transplant in an antibiotic-pseudohumanized mouse model. Comparisons were made using RNA sequencing, confocal microscopy, lung morphometry, and oscillometry., RESULTS: We analyzed 102 fecal microbiome samples collected during the second week of life. Infants who later developed BPD showed an obvious fungal dysbiosis as compared to infants without BPD (NoBPD, p = 0.0398, permutational multivariate ANOVA). Instead of fungal communities dominated by Candida and Saccharomyces, the microbiota of infants who developed BPD were characterized by a greater diversity of rarer fungi in less interconnected community architectures. On successful colonization, the gut microbiota from infants with BPD augmented lung injury in the offspring of recipient animals. We identified alterations in the murine intestinal microbiome and transcriptome associated with augmented lung injury., CONCLUSIONS: The gut fungal microbiome of infants who will develop BPD is dysbiotic and may contribute to disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Oxidative stress is an important contributor to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that is the most common morbidity in very preterm infants. Mitochondrial functional differences due to inherited and acquired mutations influence the pathogenesis of disorders in which oxidative stress plays a critical role. We previously showed using mitochondrial-nuclear exchange (MNX) mice that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations modulate hyperoxia-induced lung injury severity in a model of BPD. In this study, we studied the effects of mtDNA variations on mitochondrial function including mitophagy in alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) from MNX mice. We also investigated oxidant and inflammatory stress as well as transcriptomic profiles in lung tissue in mice and expression of proteins such as PINK1, Parkin and SIRT3 in infants with BPD. Our results indicate that AT2 from mice with C57 mtDNA had decreased mitochondrial bioenergetic function and inner membrane potential, increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and were exposed to higher levels of oxidant stress during hyperoxia compared to AT2 from mice with C3H mtDNA. Lungs from hyperoxia-exposed mice with C57 mtDNA also had higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to lungs from mice with C3H mtDNA. We also noted changes in KEGG pathways related to inflammation, PPAR and glutamatergic signaling, and mitophagy in mice with certain mito-nuclear combinations but not others. Mitophagy was decreased by hyperoxia in all mice strains, but to a greater degree in AT2 and neonatal mice lung fibroblasts from hyperoxia-exposed mice with C57 mtDNA compared to C3H mtDNA. Finally, mtDNA haplogroups vary with ethnicity, and Black infants with BPD had lower levels of PINK1, Parkin and SIRT3 expression in HUVEC at birth and tracheal aspirates at 28 days of life when compared to White infants with BPD. These results indicate that predisposition to neonatal lung injury may be modulated by variations in mtDNA and mito-nuclear interactions need to be investigated to discover novel pathogenic mechanisms for BPD.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced inflammation contributes significantly to developmental lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is known to be a major driver of inflammation in lung diseases such as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis, but its role in BPD has not been previously investigated. Therefore, to determine whether PAF signaling independently modulates neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and BPD pathogenesis, lung structure was assessed in 14 day-old C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and PAF receptor knockout (PTAFR KO) mice that were exposed to 21% (normoxia) or 85% O 2 (hyperoxia) from postnatal day 4. Lung morphometry showed that PTAFR KO mice had attenuated hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification when compared to WT mice. Functional analysis of gene expression data from hyperoxia-exposed vs. normoxia-exposed lungs of WT and PTAFR KO showed that the most upregulated pathways were the hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia pathway in WT mice, NAD signaling pathway in PTAFR KO mice, and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis as well as other pro-fibrotic pathways such as tumor microenvironment and oncostatin-M signaling in both mice strains, indicating that PAF signaling may contribute to inflammation but may not be a significant mediator of fibrotic processes during hyperoxic neonatal lung injury. Gene expression analysis also indicated increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as CXCL1, CCL2 and IL-6 in the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed WT mice and metabolic regulators such as HMGCS2 and SIRT3 in the lungs of PTAFR KO mice, suggesting that PAF signaling may modulate BPD risk through changes in pulmonary inflammation and/or metabolic reprogramming in preterm infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also known as neonatal chronic lung disease, is an important cause of respiratory illness in preterm newborns that results in significant morbidity and mortality. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered with many biological functions. However, the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of BPD remains poorly understood. Here, we established a mouse lung injury model that mimicked human BPD. Subsequently, we found the lncRNA H19 expression level was significantly increased in BPD compared with normal lung tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Next, we observed that overexpression of lncRNA H19 enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In addition, we also found that dysfunction of lncRNA H19 altered the expression of inflammatory factors. Thus, our study validates that lncRNA H19 contributes to the progression of BPD by regulating MAPK signaling pathway, which could be used as a potential target for treating BPD.

AB  - Soybean oil-based intravenous fat emulsions (IVFEs) have been the predominant parenteral nutrition IVFE used in the United States for neonates over the past 45 years. Even though this emulsion has proven useful in supplying infants with energy for growth and essential fatty acids, there have been concerns over its composition in the development of several morbidities, ranging from sepsis to liver disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and impaired neurodevelopment and growth. The exact mechanisms that drive these morbidities in preterm infants are multifactorial, but potential contributors include high omega-6 (n-6) fatty acid composition, low docosahexaenoic acid and antioxidant supplementation, and the presence of potentially harmful nonnutritive components (eg, phytosterols). To address these issues, new-generation IVFEs with various types and amounts of fat have been developed containing greater amounts of the medium-chain fatty acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, lower concentrations of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, supplemental vitamin E, and low or negligible amounts of phytosterols. This review examines the clinical outcomes associated with different morbidities of parenteral nutrition in neonates who have received either soybean oil-based or new-generation IVFEs and addresses whether the proposed benefits of new-generation IVFEs have improved outcomes in the neonatal population.

AB  - While diagnoses of hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in preterm infants may be based on criteria similar to those in term infants, management approaches often differ. In preterm infants, HRF can be classified as 'early' or 'late' based on an arbitrary threshold of 28 postnatal days. Among preterm infants with late HRF, the pulmonary vascular abnormalities associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) represent a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), sildenafil, prostacyclin and endothelin receptor blockers have been used to manage infants with both early and late HRF. However, evidence is lacking for most therapies currently in use. Chronic oral sildenafil therapy for BPD-associated PH has demonstrated some preliminary efficacy. A favorable response to iNO has been documented in some preterm infants with early PH following premature prolonged rupture of membranes and oligohydramnios. Management is complicated by a lack of clear demarcation between interventions designed to manage respiratory distress syndrome, prevent BPD and treat HRF. Heterogeneity in clinical phenotype, pathobiology and genomic underpinnings of BPD pose challenges for evidence-based management recommendations. Greater insight into the spectrum of disease phenotypes represented by BPD can optimize existing therapies and promote development of new treatments. In addition, better understanding of an individual's phenotype, genotype and biomarkers may suggest targeted personalized interventions. Initiatives such as the Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program provide a framework to address these challenges using genetic, environmental, physiological and clinical data as well as large repositories of patient samples.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The European Paediatric Pulmonary Vascular Disease (PVD) Network is a registered, non-profit organisation that strives to define and develop effective, innovative diagnostic methods and treatment options in all forms of paediatric pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease, including specific forms such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, persistent PH of the newborn, and related cardiac dysfunction., METHODS: The writing group members conducted searches of the PubMed/MEDLINE bibliographic database (1990-2015) and held five face-to-face meetings with votings. Clinical trials, guidelines, and reviews limited to paediatric data were searched using the terms 'pulmonary hypertension' and 5-10 other keywords, as outlined in the other nine articles of this special issue. Class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) were assigned based on European Society of Cardiology/American Heart Association definitions and on paediatric data only, or on adult studies that included >10% children., RESULTS: A total of 9 original consensus articles with graded recommendations (COR/LOE) were developed, and are summarised here. The topics included diagnosis/monitoring, genetics/biomarker, cardiac catheterisation, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance/chest CT, associated forms of PH, intensive care unit/ventricular assist device/lung transplantation, and treatment of paediatric PAH., CONCLUSIONS: The multipaper expert consensus statement of the European Paediatric PVD Network provides a specific, comprehensive, detailed but practical framework for the optimal clinical care of children with PH.

AB  - Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is the most common neonatal form and mostly reversible after a few days with improvement of the underlying pulmonary condition. When pulmonary hypertension (PH) persists despite adequate treatment, the severity of parenchymal lung disease should be assessed by chest CT. Pulmonary vein stenosis may need to be ruled out by cardiac catheterisation and lung biopsy, and genetic workup is necessary when alveolar capillary dysplasia is suspected. In PPHN, optimisation of the cardiopulmonary situation including surfactant therapy should aim for preductal SpO2between 91% and 95% and severe cases without post-tricuspid-unrestrictive shunt may receive prostaglandin E1 to maintain ductal patency in right heart failure. Inhaled nitric oxide is indicated in mechanically ventilated infants to reduce the need for extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and sildenafil can be considered when this therapy is not available. ECMO may be indicated according to the ELSO guidelines. In older preterm infant, where PH is mainly associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or in term infants with developmental lung anomalies such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia or cardiac anomalies, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction/left atrial hypertension or pulmonary vein stenosis, can add to the complexity of the disease. Here, oral or intravenous sildenafil should be considered for PH treatment in BPD, the latter for critically ill patients. Furthermore, prostanoids, mineralcorticoid receptor antagonists, and diuretics can be beneficial. Infants with proven or suspected PH should receive close follow-up, including preductal/postductal SpO2measurements, echocardiography and laboratory work-up including NT-proBNP, guided by clinical improvement or lack thereof.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by developmental arrest of the alveolar tissue. Oxidative stress is causally associated with development of BPD. The effects of hydrogen have been reported in a wide range of disease models and human diseases especially caused by oxidative stress. We made a rat model of BPD by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the amniotic fluid at E16.5. The mother started drinking hydrogen-rich water from E9.5 and also while feeding milk. Hydrogen normalized LPS-induced abnormal enlargement of alveoli at P7 and P14. LPS increased staining for nitrotyrosine and 8-OHdG of the lungs, and hydrogen attenuated the staining. At P1, LPS treatment decreased expressions of genes for FGFR4, VEGFR2, and HO-1 in the lungs, and hydrogen increased expressions of these genes. In contrast, LPS treatment and hydrogen treatment had no essential effect on the expression of SOD1. Inflammatory marker proteins of TNFalpha and IL-6 were increased by LPS treatment, and hydrogen suppressed them. Treatment of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells with 10% hydrogen gas for 24 hr decreased production of reactive oxygen species in both LPS-treated and untreated cells. Lack of any known adverse effects of hydrogen makes hydrogen a promising therapeutic modality for BPD. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016; 51:928-935. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), serious brain injury, and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) as predictors of poor long-term outcome in very low birth weight infants., STUDY DESIGN: We examined the associations between counts of the 3 morbidities and long-term outcomes in 1514 of 1791 (85%) infants with birth weights of 500-1250 g who were enrolled in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial from October 1999, to October 2004, had complete morbidity data, and were alive at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). BPD was defined as use of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA. Serious brain injury on cranial ultrasound included grade 3 and 4 hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leucomalacia, porencephalic cysts, or ventriculomegaly of any cause. Poor long-term outcome was death after 36 weeks PMA or survival to 5 years with 1 or more of the following disabilities: motor impairment, cognitive impairment, behavior problems, poor general health, deafness, and blindness., RESULTS: BPD, serious brain injury, and severe ROP occurred in 43%, 13%, and 6% of the infants, respectively. Each of the 3 morbidities was similarly and independently correlated with poor 5-year outcome. Rates of death or disability (95% CI) in children with none, any 1, any 2, and all 3 morbidities were 11.2% (9.0%-13.7%), 22.9% (19.6%-26.5%), 43.9% (35.5%-52.6%), and 61.5% (40.6%-79.8%), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: In very low birth weight infants who survive to 36 weeks PMA, a count of BPD, serious brain injury, and severe ROP predicts the risk of a late death or survival with disability at 5 years.

AB  - Elective closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) is usually recommended during preschool ages. However, ASD may contribute to deteriorating health in the presence of significant comorbidity and, thus, may need earlier closure. There is a lack of clarity regarding the indications for and outcomes after ASD closure in infancy and early childhood. We investigated the benefits and safety of surgical ASD closure in symptomatic patients under 2 years of age. Retrospective chart review was conducted in patients who underwent surgical ASD closure within the first 2 years of life. Of 31 symptomatic ASD patients, 22 had persistent respiratory symptoms, 24 failure to thrive, and 9 pulmonary hypertension. Overall, 26 patients (84.0%) showed clinical improvement after ASD closure, including improved respiratory status (17/22; 77.3%), resumption of normal growth (15/24; 62.5%), and resolution of pulmonary hypertension (7/7; 100%, 2 patients unable to assess postoperatively). Two medically complicated patients died a few months after surgery unrelated to surgical complications. Four out of 8 ventilator-dependent patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 1 month after ASD closure. Closure of ASD did not improve those patients with highly advanced lung disease and/or medically complex conditions including underlying genetic abnormalities. Surgical complications were uncommon. Postoperative hospital stay was 4 to 298 days (median 8 days). The majority of our patients demonstrated significant clinical improvement after ASD closure. Early ASD closure is safe and beneficial for symptomatic infants and young children with associated underlying pulmonary abnormalities, especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen is often applied in clinical practice to enhance oxygenation in acute or chronic lung injury. However, hyperoxic exposure is associated with increased reactive oxygen species production, which can be toxic to pulmonary endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells. Oxidative stress activates the pathways of the mitogen-activated protein kinases family: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), C-Jun-terminal protein kinase (JNK1/2), and p38 kinase. Several studies have suggested that ERK activation in lung cells has a protective effect in response to hyperoxia, through stimulation of DNA repair and antioxidant mechanisms, and prolonged cell survival. Conversely, JNK1/2 and p38 kinase have been most frequently reported to have roles in induction of apoptotic responses. Moreover, exogenous factors, such as ATP, retinoic acid, substance P, thioredoxin, inosine and laminin, can have cytoprotective effects against hyperoxia-induced cell damage, through promotion of ERK activation and/or limiting JNK and p38 involvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Changes in nutritional strategies over the past decade have been shown to improve postnatal growth in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. We showed 10 years ago that the majority of these ELBW infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) suffer postnatal growth failure. We theorized that recent changes in nutritional support strategies would positively affect growth outcomes in ELBW infants with BPD., STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 88 ELBW infants with BPD. Nutritional data, postnatal growth and BPD severity were compared across three cohorts: (1) weight gain <=14 g kg(-1) per day, (2) 14.1 to 16 g kg(-1) per day and (3) >=16 g kg(-1) per day from return to birth weight through discharge. We also compared these to a historical cohort., RESULT: In all, 73% of current subjects grew at or above fetal rates. There was less extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) by weight and head circumference for those ELBW infants with BPD receiving higher amounts of protein. Aggressive early TPN and receipt of caloric-dense milk seemed to be the 'new' nutritional strategies improving growth for current ELBW infants with BPD compared with those 10 years ago., CONCLUSION: Despite a diagnosis of BPD, improved nutritional strategies have enhanced postnatal growth in infants at high risk for EUGR.

AB  - Inhaled nitric oxide is being evaluated as a preventative therapy for patients at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Nitric oxide (NO), in the presence of superoxide, forms peroxynitrite, which reacts with tyrosine residues on proteins to form 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). However, NO can also act as an antioxidant and was recently found to improve the oxidative balance in preterm infants. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of a therapeutically relevant concentration (10 ppm) of NO to a hyperoxic exposure would lead to decreased 3-NT formation in the lung. FVB mouse pups were exposed to either room air (21% O(2)) or >95% O(2) with or without 10 ppm NO within 24 h of birth. In the first set of studies, body weights and survival were monitored for 7 days, and exposure to >95% O(2) resulted in impaired weight gain and near 100% mortality by 7 days. However, the mortality occurred earlier in pups exposed to >95% O(2) + NO than in pups exposed to >95% O(2) alone. In a second set of studies, lungs were harvested at 72 h. Immunohistochemistry of the lungs at 72 h revealed that the addition of NO decreased alveolar, bronchial, and vascular 3-NT staining in pups exposed to both room air and hyperoxia. The lung nitrite levels were higher in animals exposed to >95% oxygen + NO than in animals exposed to >95% oxygen alone. The protein levels of myeloperoxidase, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 were assessed after 72 h of exposure and found to be greatest in the lungs of pups exposed to >95% O(2). This hyperoxia-induced protein expression was significantly attenuated by the addition of 10 ppm NO. We propose that in the presence of >95% O(2), peroxynitrite formation results in protein nitration; however, adding excess NO to the >95% O(2) exposure prevents 3-NT formation by NO reacting with peroxynitrite to produce nitrite and NO(2). We speculate that the decreased protein nitration observed with the addition of NO may be a potential mechanism limiting hyperoxic lung injury.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe complication of preterm births, which develops due to exposure to supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Published studies demonstrated that the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) is decreased in mouse and human BPD lungs and that adoptive transfer of EPC is an effective approach in reversing the hyperoxia-induced lung damage in mouse model of BPD. Recent advancements in macrophage biology identified the specific sub-types of circulating and resident macrophages mediating the developmental and regenerative functions in the lung. Several studies reported the successful application of macrophage therapy in accelerating regenerative capacity of damaged tissues and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of other transplantable progenitor cells. In the present study, we explored the efficacy of combined cell therapy with EPC and resident alveolar macrophages (rAM) in hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model. rAM and EPC were purified from neonatal mouse lungs and used for adoptive transfer to the recipient neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia. Adoptive transfer of rAM alone did not result in engraftment of donor rAM into the lung tissue, but increased the mRNA level and protein concentration of proangiogenic CXCL12 chemokine in recipient mouse lungs. Depletion of rAM by chlodronate-liposomes decreased the retention of donor EPC after their transplantation into hyperoxia-injured lungs. Adoptive transfer of rAM in combination with EPC enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of EPC as evidenced by increased retention of EPC, increased capillary density, improved arterial oxygenation and alveolarization in hyperoxia-injured lungs. Dual therapy with EPC and rAM has promise in human BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early and precise diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is essential to improve the prognosis of preterm infants with BPD. Studying ferroptosis-related genes for diagnostic markers of BPD was the objective of this study., METHODS: Using the GEO database and the FerrDb database, we obtained the GSE32472 dataset and screened the ferroptosis-related differentially expressed mRNAs (FRDE-mRNAs). By using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), possible biological functions and pathways were identified for FRDE-mRNAs. Three machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, Random Forest) were used to recognize hub genes, as well as CIBERSORT for exploring the immune landscape of BPD and controls. Functional predictions for hub genes were made using single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)., RESULTS: Twenty three FRDE-mRNAs were obtained and were mainly involved in autophagy, fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis. The four hub genes (LPIN1, ACADSB, WIPI1 and SLC7A11) screened were utilized to construct a diagnostic nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves demonstrateld that the nomogram exhibited good predictive performance. Eight types of immune cell markers differed significantly between BPD and controls., CONCLUSION: We developed a diagnostic model for BPD, which could facilitate the early diagnosis and timely intervention of BPD., IMPACT: The role of ferroptosis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is rarely reported. The ferroptosis-related genes (LPIN1, ACADSB, WIPI1 and SLC7A11) we identified could serve as early diagnostic biomarkers for BPD. Immune cell infiltration features in BPD and signaling pathways associated with marker genes give new insight into the disease process and provide a basis for further research. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a significant challenge in neonatal care, the pathogenesis of which potentially involves altered lipid metabolism. Given the critical role of lipids in lung development and the injury response, we hypothesized that specific lipid species could serve as therapeutic agents in BPD. This study aimed to investigate the role of the lipid Phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0/14:0) in modulating BPD pathology and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. Our approach integrated in vitro and in vivo methodologies to assess the effects of PC (16:0/14:0) on the histopathology, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and molecular markers in lung tissue. In a hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model, we observed a reduction in alveolar number and an enlargement in alveolar size, which were ameliorated by PC (16:0/14:0) treatment. Correspondingly, in BPD cell models, PC (16:0/14:0) intervention led to increased cell viability, enhanced proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and elevated surfactant protein C (SPC) expression. RNA sequencing revealed significant gene expression differences between BPD and PC (16:0/14:0) treated groups, with a particular focus on Cldn1 (encoding claudin 1), which was significantly enriched in our analysis. Our findings suggest that PC (16:0/14:0) might protect against hyperoxia-induced alveolar type II cell damage by upregulating CLDN1 expression, potentially serving as a novel therapeutic target for BPD. This study not only advances our understanding of the role of lipids in BPD pathogenesis, but also highlights the significance of PC (16:0/14:0) in the prevention and treatment of BPD, offering new avenues for future research and therapeutic development.

AB  - While perinatal medicine advancements have bolstered survival outcomes for premature infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to threaten their long-term health. Gene-environment interactions, mediated by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, take center stage in BPD pathogenesis. Recent discoveries link methylation variations across biological pathways with BPD. Also, the potential reversibility of histone modifications fuels new treatment avenues. The review also highlights the promise of utilizing mesenchymal stem cells and their exosomes as BPD therapies, given their ability to modulate non-coding RNA, opening novel research and intervention possibilities. IMPACT: The complexity and universality of epigenetic modifications in the occurrence and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were thoroughly discussed. Both molecular and cellular mechanisms contribute to the diverse nature of epigenetic changes, suggesting the need for deeper biochemical techniques to explore these molecular alterations. The utilization of innovative cell-specific drug delivery methods like exosomes and extracellular vesicles holds promise in achieving precise epigenetic regulation. Copyright © 2024.

AB  - Marine oils, such as fish oil or algal oil, are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, especially the essential fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Algal oil is high in DHA and low in EPA, whereas fish oil has more EPA than DHA. DHA and EPA are normal components of breastmilk where concentrations reflect maternal intake. The DHA level in breastmilk is typically between 0.2% and 0.3% in Western countries.[1] This is usually sufficient to meet the DHA requirements of term breastfed infants, but not the higher requirements of preterm infants, where additional maternal supplementation is needed.[2] Maternal supplementation increases breastmilk levels of DHA and EPA, although it appears that milk concentrations depend more on long-term than short-term (past 3-days) intake.[3-5] Higher milk levels result in higher infant plasma and erythrocyte levels of omega-3 fatty acid-derived phospholipid. One study found that breastmilk DHA was a better predictor of infant erythrocyte DHA than direct supplementation of the infants with fish oil.[6] Current dietary recommendations for nursing mothers is 250 to 375 mg daily of DHA plus EPA.[7] Lactating women require a daily dosage of about 1000 mg DHA plus EPA to reach a milk DHA plus EPA of 1 gram/dL at 4 weeks postpartum.[8] Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been studied for reduction of postpartum depression in nursing mothers and for improving various infant outcomes. A meta-analysis of 35 randomized, controlled trials found that women with a diagnosis of severe depression obtained benefit from omega-3 fatty acids, but those with mild depression did not.[9] Several meta-analyses have been performed on fish oil supplementation during breastfeeding. They found no beneficial effect of omega-3-fatty acid supplementation during breastfeeding on infant problem-solving ability, intelligence, socioemotional, psychomotor or motor development, visual acuity, growth or language development, academic performance, risks of attention deficit disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, or depression.[10-13] The most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis found that supplementation improved measures of cognitive development in the infant or child by 6 to 11%.[13] Two meta-analyses found that maternal supplementation with omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids during lactation had little or no beneficial effect on childhood allergic diseases.[14,15] A more recent large study found that supplementation of nursing mothers with DHA 1.2 grams daily did not improve their infants' neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months of age in breastfed, preterm neonates, but subgroup analyses suggested a potential benefit for language in preterm neonates born before 27 weeks' gestational age.[16] Although DHA supplementation increases anti-inflammatory components and reduced inflammatory prostaglandins in milk, supplementation of mothers with preterm infants did not decrease the frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks gestational age.[17,18] Weak evidence for improved vision and attention was found in one study.[10,11] Long-term follow-up of a small group of children whose mothers received fish oil supplements during lactation found that boys had a delayed puberty, shorter average height, and higher systolic blood pressure at age 13 years, but no differences in self-rated socioemotional outcomes or physical activity at 13 years of age.[19,20] Other studies found that maternal fish oil supplementation during pregnancy and lactation reduced oxidative stress in their breastfed infants.[21,22] Supplementation of nursing mothers with fish oil of about 800 mg of DHA plus EPA for 6 months altered the infant intestinal microbiome in a way that might decrease resistance to colonization with pathogens. However, no increase in infant illnesses were seen.[23] Infants breastfed by overweight or obese mothers who took 3 grams of fish oil daily had greater ponderal index and reduced insulin resistance compared to placebo at 3 months of age.[24] Fish oil up to 3 grams daily is "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) as a food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The most common complaint is burping a fishy taste after ingestion. However, breast milk odor is not changed by maternal fish oil consumption.[25] Rarely, allergic reactions are reported with nut oil-derived omega-3 fatty acids in patients allergic to nuts. Dietary supplements do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Manufacturers are responsible to ensure the safety, but do not need to prove the safety and effectiveness of dietary supplements before they are marketed. Dietary supplements may contain multiple ingredients, and differences are often found between labeled and actual ingredients or their amounts. A manufacturer may contract with an independent organization to verify the quality of a product or its ingredients, but that does not certify the safety or effectiveness of a product. Because of the above issues, clinical testing results on one product may not be applicable to other products. More detailed information about dietary supplements is available elsewhere on the LactMed Web site.

AB  - The advent of next generation sequencing has rapidly challenged the paediatric respiratory physician's understanding of lung microbiology and the role of the lung microbiome in host health and disease. In particular, the role of "microbial key players" in paediatric respiratory disease is yet to be fully explained. Accurate profiling of the lung microbiome in children is challenging since the ability to obtain lower airway samples coupled with processing "low-biomass specimens" are both technically difficult. Many studies provide conflicting results. Early microbiota-host relationships may be predictive of the development of chronic respiratory disease but attempts to correlate lower airway microbiota in premature infants and risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have produced mixed results. There are differences in lung microbiota in asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF). The increased abundance of oral taxa in the lungs may (or may not) promote disease processes in asthma and CF. In CF, correlation between microbiota diversity and respiratory decline is commonly observed. When one considers other pathogens beyond the bacterial kingdom, the contribution and interplay of fungi and viruses within the lung microbiome further increase complexity. Similarly, the interaction between microbial communities in different body sites, such as the gut-lung axis, and the influence of environmental factors, including diet, make the co-existence of host and microbes ever more complicated. Future, multi-omics approaches may help uncover novel microbiome-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets in respiratory disease and explain how we can live in harmony with our microbial companions.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and serious complication associated with preterm birth. The pathogenesis of BPD is incompletely understood, and there is an unmet clinical need for effective treatments. The role of autophagy as a potential cytoprotective mechanism in BPD remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the role and regulation of autophagy in experimental models of BPD. Regulation and cellular distribution of autophagic activity during postnatal lung development and in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury (nHILI) were assessed in the autophagy reporter transgenic GFP-LC3 (GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) mouse model. Autophagic activity and its regulation were also examined in a baboon model of BPD. The role of autophagy in nHILI was determined by assessing lung morphometry, injury, and inflammation in autophagy-deficient Beclin 1 heterozygous knockout mice (Becn1+/-). Autophagic activity was induced during alveolarization in control murine lungs and localized primarily to alveolar type II cells and macrophages. Hyperoxia exposure of neonatal murine lungs and BPD in baboon lungs resulted in impaired autophagic activity in association with insufficient AMPK (5'-AMP-activated protein kinase) and increased mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) activation. Becn1+/- lungs displayed impaired alveolarization, increased alveolar septal thickness, greater neutrophil accumulation, and increased IL-1beta concentrations when exposed to nHILI. Becn1+/- alveolar macrophages isolated from nHILI-exposed mice displayed increased expression of proinflammatory genes. In conclusion, basal autophagy is induced during alveolarization and disrupted during progression of nHILI in mice and BPD in baboons. Becn1+/- mice are more susceptible to nHILI, suggesting that preservation of autophagic activity may be an effective protective strategy in BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains one of the most serious challenges in the care of the very preterm infants, affecting approximately one-quarter of infants born <1500g birth weight and 30% <1000g. Oxygen toxicity may contribute to its pathogenesis. Vitamin A concentrations are lower in BPD infants which may result in a reduction of the antioxidant protection. It has been found to up regulate genes necessary for fetal lung growth and increase surfactant production in animal models and is also involved in the modulation of immunological and inflammatory responses by regulation of cytokine production. Retinoic acid plays a key role in lung development improving alveolar septation. Evidence exists that vitamin A supplementation for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, beyond that routinely given in multivitamin preparations, is associated with a reduction in death or BPD. So, parenteral administration of vitamin A to the newborn is one of the current recommended preventive therapies for BPD (number needed to treat 12; 95% CI:6-94; The information on long-term neurodevelopmental status suggests no evidence of either benefit or harm. Estimates for cerebral palsy range from a number needed to treat of 11 to a number needed to harm of 33. Nowadays, is seems that administration of antenatal vitamin A to the mother in late pregnancy associated with neonatal supplementation can better prevent the development of BPD in areas of endemic vitamin A deficiency. The benefits, in terms of vitamin A status, safety and acceptability of delivering vitamin A in an intravenous emulsion compared with repeat intramuscular injections, the association of vitamin A prenatal and postnatal, as well as the effectiveness and safety of administered high dose vitamin A in ELBW infants waits evaluation and should be assessed in further trials.

AB  - The type of care a preterm baby receives within the first few hours of life can have a significant impact on their long-term outcome. The phrase "golden hour," first used in trauma patients, has been adopted to refer to neonatal care at this crucial time. Early delivery room respiratory support in preterm infants has been extensively investigated and may make a significant contribution to reducing the risk of long-term lung damage, other morbidities and even death. One of the difficult choices in the current era is to determine whether or not to intubate a preterm baby in order to give surfactant very soon after birth. Many babies can be supported by non-invasive methods of delivering oxygen, such as continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), which avoid intubation. There is evidence that surfactant can be administered to these non-intubated babies using less invasive administration techniques that may reduce the risk of morbidity associated with intubation. At present it is not clear which is the best strategy. This review aims to explore which delivery room respiratory support techniques are likely to give optimal disease-free survival in preterm infants. We have compared early invasive intubation and surfactant administration techniques, with less invasive surfactant administration techniques and non-invasive respiratory support techniques. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm babies is caused by a deficiency of lung surfactant. The risk of RDS increases with decreasing gestational age, and is almost inevitable in babies born at less than 28 weeks gestation. Without surfactant the lungs become stiff and the alveoli collapse at end-expiration, and untreated RDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Surfactant is a naturally produced surface-active lipoprotein complex mixed with proteins, which reduces the surface tension at the alveolar liquid surface. Surfactant allows alveoli to stay open in expiration and substantially reduces the work of breathing. It also reduces shearing forces on immature alveolar membrane, preventing membrane rupture and protein leak into the alveolar space with resulting lung damage. RDS in preterm babies can be prevented by administration of exogenous animal derived surfactant therapy, and this substantially reduces mortality and respiratory morbidity for this population, including improved survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days. However, the optimal dose (including the use of single or multiple administration) and mode of administration of surfactant remains controversial and may make a significant contribution to the chances of long term lung damage, other morbidities or death. The various techniques of administration can be grouped into three categories: conventional endotracheal intubation (where the baby is intubated, surfactant is administered and the baby then continues on mechanical ventilation); endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration followed by immediate extubation (also called Intubate, Surfactant, Rapid Extubation, and known as InSuRE or ISX); surfactant administration without endotracheal intubation via a thin endotracheal catheter during spontaneous breathing or with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) (known as Minimally Invasive Surfactant Therapy, MIST or Less Invasive Surfactant Administration, LISA, or Avoidance of Mechanical Ventilation, AMV). This review aims to explore which administration technique and dosing regimen is likely to give optimal outcomes in preterm infants. Low flow oxygen is frequently used in neonatal units, as an integral part of respiratory support in preterm babies. The goal of oxygen therapy is to achieve adequate delivery of oxygen to the tissues without causing oxygen toxicity. In addition to delivering oxygen via a ventilator or CPAP circuit, there are several different methods of low-flow oxygen administration: head box oxygen, incubator, facemask, nasal prongs, nasal cannula and nasopharyngeal catheter. Oxygen can be delivered humidified or non-humidified, and the method of titration can be automated or manual. It is important to know, the efficacy, potential risks, and the impact on lung function of the different methods when used in preterm babies. The aim of this review is to determine the optimal type of oxygen delivered, method of administration and method of titration in preterm babies requiring respiratory support. The lungs of preterm babies are structurally immature, deficient of surfactant and not supported by a rigid chest wall. They are therefore highly susceptible to injury from the different types of respiratory support available for use in this population. Whereas pressure support ventilation (PSV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been used in neonatology for many years, newer modes of ventilation such as volume targeted ventilation (VTV) and, more recently, heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) have become popular. This review will look at the evidence available to assess the effectiveness of the different types of assisted ventilation techniques in preterm babies. Inhaled nitric oxide is a potent, selective pulmonary vasodilator. It has a clearly defined role in the management of pulmonary hypertension in term babies, where it has been shown to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, its role in preterm babies requiring invasive respiratory support is less well defined. Recently, a number of studies have been published looking at the effect of inhaled nitric oxide on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm babies and its potential role in hypoxic respiratory failure. This review aims to determine the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm babies requiring invasive ventilation, both in hypoxic respiratory failure and in the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia In the NMA for the outcome of mortality prior to discharge and BPD at 36 weeks PMA there was no evidence to suggest a difference between between CPAP, NIPPV, BiPAP/SiPAP, or Hi Flow. Similarly, pairwise analyses did not identify any meaningful differences between non-invasive ventilation techniques. The committee acknowledged two existing non-UK economic evaluations comparing CPAP with NIPPV and Hi Flow, respectively. However, these analyses did not include all non-invasive ventilation techniques of interest. Given the lack of differences in the clinical effectiveness between non-invasive ventilation techniques and the lack of existing economic evidence the committee considered it important to compare the costs of the techniques to aid considerations of cost effectiveness. Generally the NHS Reference Costs (DHSC, 2018) is the recommended source of unit cost data that should be used to aid considerations of cost effectiveness. However, the committee explained that the neonatal activity payments are based on the level of activity (that is, intensive care, high dependency and special care) rather than procedures. As a result, costings of non-invasive ventilation techniques were undertaken to aid considerations of cost effectiveness and included equipment acquisition costs, maintenanece costs and consumable costs. The results of conventional pairwise meta-analyses of direct evidence alone do not help to fully inform which invasive and non-invasive ventilation technique is most effective in preterm babies requiring respiratory support. Each pairwise comparison does not fully inform the choice between the different treatments and having a series of discrete pairwise comparisons can be incoherent and difficult to interpret. In addition, direct comparisons of treatments of clinical interest are not fully available, for all comparisons. To overcome these issues, a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed. Advantages of performing this type of analysis are as follows. It allows the synthesis of evidence on multiple treatments compared directly and indirectly without breaking randomisation. If treatment A has never been compared to treatment B in a head to head trial, but these two interventions have been compared to a common comparator, then an indirect treatment comparison can be derived using the relative effects of the two treatments versus the common comparator. Indirect estimates can be calculated whenever there is a path linking two treatments through a set of common comparators. All the randomised evidence is considered simultaneously within the same model. For every intervention in a connected network, a relative effect estimate (with its 95% credible intervals, CrIs) between any two interventions can be estimated. These estimates provide a useful clinical summary of the results and facilitate the formation of recommendations based on all relevant evidence, whilst appropriately accounting for uncertainty. Ranks of interventions may also be calculated. Estimates from the NMA can be used to directly parameterise treatment effectiveness in cost-effectiveness modelling of multiple treatments. Conventional fixed effect meta-analysis assumes that the relative effect of one treatment compared to another is the same across an entire set of trials. In a random effects model, it is assumed that the relative effects are different in each trial but that they are from a single common distribution and that this distribution is common across all sets of trials. NMA requires an additional assumption over conventional meta-analysis. The additional assumption is that intervention A has the same effect on people in trials of intervention A compared to intervention B as it does for people in trials of intervention A versus intervention C and so on. Thus, in an NMA, the assumption is that intervention A has the same effect across trials of A versus B, A versus C and so on. The terms indirect treatment comparisons, mixed treatment comparisons and NMA are used interchangeably. We use the term NMA as the network consists of both indirect treatment comparisons (some trials have a common comparator and some do not) and mixed treatment comparisons (with at least one closed loop, combination of direct and indirect evidence). The purpose of this analysis was to assess the consistency assumption in the network meta-analysis (NMA) model used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation techniques in specialist neonatal respiratory care (SNRC) for babies born preterm. The outcomes included in this analysis were 1) mortality prior to discharge and 2) bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).

The outcomes included in this analysis were 1) mortality prior to discharge and 2) Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks PMA. Copyright © NICE 2019.

AB  - Oxygen levels in preterm babies are monitored with the aim of ensuring both adequate tissue oxygenation and to minimise the risk of oxygen toxicity and oxidative stress, and oxygen delivery is adjusted to achieve a certain target oxygen level. Liberal (higher oxygen level targeting) and restrictive (lower oxygen level targeting) in preterm babies are both thought to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and there is variation in practice regarding the optimal target oxygen range which will minimise these competing risks. This review will look at the evidence for the effectiveness of higher versus lower oxygen saturation target ranges in preterm babies, including the incidence of mortality, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotising enterocolitis, and neurodevelopmental impairment, to determine the optimal target oxygen range. Preterm babies frequently require oxygen therapy in order to maintain oxygen levels which are considered to be in the normal range. The goal of treatment is to maintain normoxia because there is evidence to show that both too much oxygen (hyperoxia) and too little oxygen (hypoxia) carry risks, and ideally babies should be monitored continually with an accurate non-invasive method. The gold standard method of measuring oxygen levels in preterm babies is through blood gas sampling from an arterial specimen. However, this technique has risks associated with the need for indwelling arterial lines, and removal of multiple blood samples, and it is not generally possible to maintain this method over long periods of time. The alternative methods of non-invasive oxygen monitoring include transcutaneous measurement, and measuring oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry. Transcutaneous monitors use a small probe which contains an oxygen sensing electrode attached to the skin. The skin has to be "arterialised" by warming in order to ensure that the oxygen tension between the superficial skin and that of the tissue supplied by the capillaries below comes into equilibrium, allowing sampling of the gas which lies just above the skin surface. This method produces a result which is expressed (like a blood gas) in terms of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). This method requires more user knowledge to calibrate and set up, and the probes require frequent re-siting to avoid marking the fragile skin of the preterm baby. Pulse oximeters use a combination of two wavelengths of light which are passed through tissue (e.g. the finger, earlobe, or infant foot) and then detected as they emerge. The absorption of the electromagnetic energy by the interrogated tissue varies according to the percentage of oxygen which is bound to haemoglobin. The value of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) is calculated from the ratio of the absorption at the two wavelengths. The absorption also varies with the cardiac rhythm, and this is used to extract only the portion which is "pulsatile". Pulse oximetry is a safe technique but there is a degree of uncertainty over its accuracy, particularly in the higher range of oxygen saturations. The aim of this review is to determine which method of measuring oxygen levels is the most accurate at detecting hyperoxia and hypoxia and to evaluate the risks and benefits associated with each method, in order to determine which is the most appropriate for use in various clinical situations. Carbon dioxide is cleared by healthy lung tissue, and can build up when there is respiratory failure. Cerebral blood flow is affected by carbon dioxide levels, and alterations in cerebral blood flow predispose a preterm baby's vulnerable brain to peri/intraventricular haemorrhage (P/IVH) and/or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Monitoring of carbon dioxide levels is crucial during artificial ventilation, but evidence of lung injury induced by volutrauma has led to efforts to reduce this damage, with "permissive hypercapnia" (allowing elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood) becoming a common lung protective strategy in ventilated preterm babies. However, the safety and the optimal range of carbon dioxide values for permissive hypercapnia are not clear. This review aims to identify the optimal levels of carbon dioxide in the management of preterm babies in order to improve outcomes. Preterm babies are regularly monitored to ensure adequate systemic perfusion (oxygen supply to tissues). In combination with clinical observations, biochemical parameters, urine output and clinical examination, blood pressure (BP) can be used as a surrogate marker for systemic perfusion. Depending on the clinical condition of the baby, blood pressure may be continuously monitored via an indwelling arterial catheter placed in either an umbilical or peripheral artery, and in more stable babies it may be measured non-invasively using the oscillometric (cuff-reading) technique. The optimal target range for BP in babies of different gestational ages and weights is not precisely known, but observational studies have defined a "normal" range present in babies who have an uncomplicated course. Identifying babies with reduced tissue oxygen supply who would benefit from intervention is clinically difficult, as it is not known what specific BP range is associated with adequate perfusion and better long term outcomes. This review aims to compare outcomes with the use of invasive monitoring versus oscillometric measurements, and between different target blood pressure ranges in preterm babies on invasive respiratory support, to identify if a specific approach to both blood pressure monitoring and blood pressure management is associated with better outcomes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a prevalent and chronic lung disease affecting premature newborns, results in vascular rarefaction and alveolar simplification. Although the vasculature has been recognized as a main player in this disease, the recently found capillary heterogeneity and cellular dynamics of endothelial subpopulations in BPD remain unclear. Here, we show Cap2 cells are damaged during neonatal hyperoxic injury, leading to their replacement by Cap1 cells which, in turn, significantly decline. Single-cell RNA-seq identifies the activation of numerous p53 target genes in endothelial cells, including Cdkn1a (p21) . While global deletion of p53 results in worsened vasculature, endothelial-specific deletion of p53 reverses the vascular phenotype and improves alveolar simplification during hyperoxia. This recovery is associated with the emergence of a transitional EC state, enriched for oxidative stress response genes and growth factors. These findings implicate the p53 pathway in EC type transition during injury-repair and highlights the endothelial contributions to BPD.

AB  - Decreased selenium (Se) levels during childhood and infancy are associated with worse respiratory health. Se is biologically active after incorporation into Se-containing antioxidant enzymes (AOE) and proteins. It is unknown how decreased maternal Se during pregnancy and lactation impacts neonatal pulmonary selenoproteins, growth, and lung development. Using a model of neonatal Se deficiency that limits Se intake to the dam during pregnancy and lactation, we evaluated which neonatal pulmonary selenoproteins are decreased in both the saccular (postnatal day 0, P0) and early alveolar (postnatal day 7, P7) stages of lung development. We found that Se deficient (SeD) pups weigh less and exhibit impaired alveolar development compared to Se sufficient (SeS) pups at P7. The activity levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (Txnrd) were decreased at P0 and P7 in SeD lungs compared to SeS lungs. Protein content of GPx1, GPx3 and Txnrd1 were decreased in SeD lungs at P0 and P7, whereas Txnrd2 content was unaltered compared to SeS controls. The expression of NRF-2 dependent genes and several non-Se containing AOE were similar between SeS and SeD lungs. SeD lungs exhibited a decrease in selenoprotein N, an endoplasmic reticulum protein implicated in alveolar development, at both time points. We conclude that exposure to Se deficiency during pregnancy and lactation impairs weight gain and lung growth in offspring. Our data identify multiple selenoproteins in the neonatal lung that are vulnerable to decreased Se intake, which may impact oxidative stress and cell signaling under physiologic conditions as well as after oxidative stressors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The objective of this study was to examine whether the genetic depletion of the PDK4 gene attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal mice., METHODS: Neonatal PDK4-/- mice and wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to oxygen concentrations of 21% (normoxia) and 95% (hyperoxia) for the first 4 days of life. Pulmonary histological assessments were performed, and the mRNA levels of lung PDK4, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 were assessed. The levels of inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue were quantified., RESULTS: Following convalescence from neonatal hyperoxia, PDK4-/- mice exhibited improved lung alveolarization. Notably, PDK4-/- mice displayed significantly elevated MCP-1 protein levels in pulmonary tissues following 4 days of hyperoxic exposure, whereas WT mice showed increased IL-6 protein levels under similar conditions. Furthermore, neonatal PDK4-/- mice subjected to hyperoxia demonstrated markedly higher MCP-1 mRNA expression at 4 days of age compared to WT mice, while IL-6 mRNA expression remained unaffected in PDK4-/- mice., CONCLUSIONS: Newborn PDK4-/- mice exhibited notable recovery from hyperoxia-induced lung injury, suggesting the potential protective role of PDK4 depletion in mitigating lung damage.

AB  - Fetal and neonatal exposures to perinatal oxidative stress (OS) are key mediators of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To characterize these exposures, adductomics is an exposure science approach that captures electrophilic addition products (adducts) in blood protein. Adducts are bound to the nucleophilic cysteine loci of human serum albumin (HSA), which has a prolonged half-life. We conducted targeted and untargeted adductomics to test the hypothesis that adducts of OS vary with BPD. We studied 205 preterm infants (<=28 weeks) and 51 full-term infants from an ongoing birth cohort. Infant plasma was collected at birth (cord blood), 1-week, 1-month, and 36-weeks postmenstrual age. HSA was isolated from plasma, trypsin digested, and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify previously annotated (known) and unknown adducts. We identified 105 adducts in cord and postnatal blood. A total of 51 known adducts (small thiols, direct oxidation products, and reactive aldehydes) were increased with BPD. Postnatally, serial concentrations of several known OS adducts correlated directly with supplemental oxygen exposure. The application of large-scale adductomics elucidated OS-mediated pathways of BPD. This is the first study to investigate the "neonatal-perinatal exposome" and to identify oxidative stress-related exposure biomarkers that may inform antioxidant strategies to protect the health of future generations of infants.

AB  - Extremely preterm infants are often treated with supraphysiological oxygen, which contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). These same infants exhibit compromised antioxidant capacities due in part to selenium (Se) deficiency. Se is essential for basal and inducible antioxidant responses. The present study utilized a perinatal Se deficiency (SeD) mouse model to identify the combined effects of newborn hyperoxia exposure and SeD on alveolarization and antioxidant responses, including the identification of affected developmental pathways. Se-sufficient (SeS) and SeD C3H/HeN breeding pairs were generated, and pups were exposed to room air or 85% O2 from birth to 14 d. Survival, antioxidant protein expression, and RNA seq analyses were performed. Greater than 40% mortality was observed in hyperoxia-exposed SeD pups. Surviving SeD pups had greater lung growth deficits than hyperoxia-exposed SeS pups. Gpx2 and 4 protein and Gpx activity were significantly decreased in SeD pups. Nrf2-regulated proteins, Nqo1 and Gclc were increased in SeD pups exposed to hyperoxia. RNA seq revealed significant decreases in the Wnt/beta-catenin and Notch pathways. Se is a biologically relevant modulator of perinatal lung development and antioxidant responses, especially in the context of hyperoxia exposure. The RNA seq analyses suggest pathways essential for normal lung development are dysregulated by Se deficiency.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure is estimated to kill 600 000 people worldwide annually. The WHO recommends that smoke-free indoor public environments are enforced through national legislation. Such regulations have been shown to reduce SHS exposure and, consequently, respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity. Evidence of particular health benefit in children is now emerging, including reductions in low birthweight deliveries, preterm birth and asthma exacerbations. We aim to comprehensively assess the impact of smoke-free legislation on fetal, infant and childhood outcomes. This can inform further development and implementation of global policy and strategies to reduce early life SHS exposure., METHODS: Two authors will search online databases (1975-present; no language restrictions) of published and unpublished/in-progress studies, and references and citations to articles of interest. We will consult experts in the field to identify additional studies. Studies should describe associations between comprehensive or partial smoking bans in public places and health outcomes among children (0-12 years): stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, perinatal mortality, congenital anomalies, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, upper and lower respiratory infections and wheezing disorders including asthma. The Cochrane Effectiveness Practice and Organisational Care (EPOC)-defined study designs are eligible. Study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane 7-domain-based evaluation for randomised and clinical trials, and EPOC criteria for quasiexperimental studies. Data will be extracted by two reviewers and presented in tabular and narrative form. Meta-analysis will be undertaken using random-effects models, and generic inverse variance analysis for adjusted effect estimates. We will report sensitivity analyses according to study quality and design characteristics, and subgroup analyses according to coverage of ban, age group and parental/maternal smoking status. Publication bias will be assessed., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics assessment is not required., RESULTS: Will be presented in one manuscript. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42013003522.

AB  - Clinically, intrauterine hypoxia is the foremost cause of perinatal morbidity and developmental plasticity in the fetus and newborn infant. Under hypoxia, deviations occur in the lung cell epigenome. Epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA expression) control phenotypic programming and are associated with physiological responses and the risk of developmental disorders, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This developmental disorder is the most frequent chronic pulmonary complication in preterm labor. The pathogenesis of this disease involves many factors, including aberrant oxygen conditions and mechanical ventilation-mediated lung injury, infection/inflammation, and epigenetic/genetic risk factors. This review is focused on various aspects related to intrauterine hypoxia and epigenetic programming in lung development and disease, summarizes our current knowledge of hypoxia-induced epigenetic programming and discusses potential therapeutic interventions for lung disease.

AB  - Rationale: Advances in neonatal critical care have greatly improved the survival of preterm infants, but the long-term complications of prematurity, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cause mortality and morbidity later in life. Although VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) improves lung structure and function in rodent BPD models, severe side effects of VEGF therapy prevent its use in patients with BPD. Objectives: To test whether nanoparticle delivery of proangiogenic transcription factor FOXM1 (forkhead box M1) or FOXF1 (forkhead box F1), both downstream targets of VEGF, can improve lung structure and function after neonatal hyperoxic injury. Methods: Newborn mice were exposed to 75% O2 for the first 7 days of life before being returned to a room air environment. On Postnatal Day 2, polyethylenimine-(5) myristic acid/polyethylene glycol-oleic acid/cholesterol nanoparticles containing nonintegrating expression plasmids with Foxm1 or Foxf1 cDNAs were injected intravenously. The effects of the nanoparticles on lung structure and function were evaluated using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and the flexiVent small-animal ventilator. Measurements and Main Results: The nanoparticles efficiently targeted endothelial cells and myofibroblasts in the alveolar region. Nanoparticle delivery of either FOXM1 or FOXF1 did not protect endothelial cells from apoptosis caused by hyperoxia but increased endothelial proliferation and lung angiogenesis after the injury. FOXM1 and FOXF1 improved elastin fiber organization, decreased alveolar simplification, and preserved lung function in mice reaching adulthood. Conclusions: Nanoparticle delivery of FOXM1 or FOXF1 stimulates lung angiogenesis and alveolarization during recovery from neonatal hyperoxic injury. Delivery of proangiogenic transcription factors has promise as a therapy for BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is a rare and lethal disorder mainly involving the vascular development of the lungs. Since its first description, significant achievements in research have led to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of ACD/MPV and genetic studies have identified associations with genomic alterations in the locus of the transcription factor FOXF1. This in turn has increased the awareness among clinicians resulting in over 200 cases reported so far, including genotyping of patients in most recent reports. Collectively, this promoted a better stratification of the patient group, leading to new perspectives in research on the pathogenesis. Here, we provide an overview of the clinical aspects of ACD/MPV, including guidance for clinicians, and review the ongoing research into the complex molecular mechanism causing this severe lung disorder.

AB  - Neurotrophins (NTs) are four small proteins produced by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells; they include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). NTs can exert their action through both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms by interacting with specific receptors. Initial studies on NTs have identified them only as functional molecules of the nervous system. However, recent research have shown that some tissues and organs (such as the lungs, skin, and skeletal and smooth muscle) as well as some structural cells can secrete and respond to NTs. In addition, NTs perform several roles in normal and pathological conditions at different anatomical sites, in both fetal and postnatal life. During pregnancy, NTs are produced by the mother, placenta, and fetus. They play a pivotal role in the pre-implantation process and in placental and embryonic development; they are also involved in the development of the brain and respiratory system. In the postnatal period, it appears that NTs are associated with some diseases, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), asthma, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is one of the most common causes of neonatal respiratory failure and mortality. The risk of developing RDS decreases with both increasing gestational age and birth weight., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in newborn infants., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2012 to May 2013, 100 newborn infants were divided into two groups: RDS group (50 cases) and control group (50 cases). According to the findings of chest x-ray, there were 10 cases of grade II RDS, 15 grade III cases, and 25 grade IV cases in RDS group. Lung ultrasound was performed at bedside by a single expert. The ultrasound indexes observed in this study included pleural line, A-line, B-line, lung consolidation, air bronchograms, bilateral white lung, interstitial syndrome, lung sliding, lung pulse etc., RESULTS: In all of the infants with RDS, lung ultrasound consistently showed generalized consolidation with air bronchograms, bilateral white lung or alveolar-interstitial syndrome, pleural line abnormalities, A-line disappearance, pleural effusion, lung pulse, etc. The simultaneous demonstration of lung consolidation, pleural line abnormalities and bilateral white lung, or lung consolidation, pleural line abnormalities and A-line disappearance co-exists with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Besides, the sensitivity was 80% and specificity 100% of lung pulse for the diagnosis of neonatal RDS., CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that using an ultrasound to diagnose neonatal RDS is accurate and reliable too. A lung ultrasound has many advantages over other techniques. Ultrasound is non-ionizing, low-cost, easy to operate, and can be performed at bedside, making this technique ideal for use in NICU.

AB  - Sick neonates are at high risk for growth failure and poorer neurodevelopment than their healthy counterparts. The etiology of postnatal growth failure in sick infants is likely multi-factorial and includes undernutrition due to the difficulty of feeding them during their illness and instability. Illness also itself induces fundamental changes in cellular metabolism that appear to significantly alter nutritional demand and nutrient handling. Inflammation and physiologic stress play a large role in inducing the catabolic state characteristic of the critically ill newborn infant. Inflammatory and stress responses are critical short-term adaptations to promote survival, but are not conducive to promoting long-term growth and development. Conditions such as sepsis, surgery, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic lung disease and intrauterine growth restriction and their treatments are characterized by altered energy, protein and micronutrient metabolism that result in nutritional requirements that are different from those of the healthy, growing term or preterm infant.

AB  - This study investigated maternal psychological distress, perceptions of social supports, and parenting strains after the birth of a very low birthweight (VLBW) infant. Compared to mothers of term infants, mothers of VLBW infants had significantly higher incidence of psychological distress during the neonatal period, but did not differ from mothers of term infants in their feelings of role restriction, parenting competence, or social supports. Lower general social support predicted high distress levels, but only for mothers of VLBW infants. Mothers with a low sense of parenting competence, but support from spouse/partners reported lower maternal distress.

AB  - Objective: Evaluate the impact of a sodium (Na) supplementation protocol based upon urine Na concentration on growth parameters and morbidities., Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of infants 260/7-336/7 weeks gestational age (GA) cared for before (2012-15, n = 225) and after (2016-20, n = 157) implementation of the protocol. Within- and between-group changes over time were assessed using repeated measures generalized linear models., Results: For infants 260/7-296/7 weeks GA, utilization of the protocol was associated with increased mean body weight z-score at 8-weeks postnatal age, increased mean head circumference z-score at 16-weeks postnatal age, and decreased time on mechanical ventilation (all p < 0.02). No impact on growth was identified for infants 30-336/7 weeks GA. Incidences of hypertension, hypernatremia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and culture positive sepsis were unaffected by the protocol., Conclusion: Protocolized Na supplementation results in improved growth and reduced time on invasive mechanical ventilation in extremely preterm infants without increasing incidence of morbidities.

AB  - Background and Objective: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity associated with prematurity and remains a significant clinical challenge. Bioinformatic approaches, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have emerged as novel methods for studying the underlying mechanisms driving BPD pathogenesis. These methods can be used alongside clinical data to develop a better understanding of BPD and potentially identify the most at risk neonates within the first few weeks of neonatal life. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in bioinformatics for BPD research., Methods: We conducted a literature review of bioinformatics approaches for BPD using PubMed. The following keywords were used: "biomedical informatics", "bioinformatics", "bronchopulmonary dysplasia", and "omics"., Key Content and Findings: This review highlighted the importance of omic-approaches to better understand BPD and potential avenues for future research. We described the use of machine learning (ML) and the need for systems biology methods for integrating large-scale data from multiple tissues. We summarized a handful of studies that utilized bioinformatics for BPD in order to better provide a view of where things currently stand, identify areas of ongoing research, and concluded with challenges that remain in the field., Conclusions: Bioinformatics has the potential to enable a more comprehensive understanding of BPD pathogenesis, facilitating a personalized and precise approach to neonatal care. As we continue to push the boundaries of biomedical research, biomedical informatics (BMI) will undoubtedly play a key role in unraveling new frontiers in disease understanding, prevention, and treatment.

AB  - Interrupted lung angiogenesis is a hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); however, druggable targets that can rescue this phenotype remain elusive. Thus, our investigation focused on amphiregulin (Areg), a growth factor that mediates cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, and repair. While Areg promotes lung branching morphogenesis, its effect on endothelial cell (EC) homeostasis in developing lungs is understudied. Therefore, we hypothesized that Areg promotes the proangiogenic ability of the ECs in developing murine lungs exposed to hyperoxia. Lung tissues were harvested from neonatal mice exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia to determine Areg expression. Next, we performed genetic loss-of-function and pharmacological gain-of-function studies in normoxia- and hyperoxia-exposed fetal murine lung ECs. Hyperoxia increased Areg mRNA levels and Areg+ cells in whole lungs. While Areg expression was increased in lung ECs exposed to hyperoxia, the expression of its signaling receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, was decreased, indicating that hyperoxia reduces Areg signaling in lung ECs. Areg deficiency potentiated hyperoxia-mediated anti-angiogenic effects. In contrast, Areg treatment increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and exerted proangiogenic effects. In conclusion, Areg promotes EC tubule formation in developing murine lungs exposed to hyperoxia.

AB  - Infants with the most severe forms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) may require long-term invasive positive pressure ventilation for survival, therefore necessitating tracheostomy. Although life-saving, tracheostomy has also been associated with high mortality, postoperative complications, high readmission rates, neurodevelopmental impairment, and significant caregiver burden, making it a highly complex and challenging decision. However, for some infants tracheostomy may be necessary for survival and the only way to facilitate a timely and safe transition home. The specific indications for tracheostomy and the timing of the procedure in infants with severe BPD are currently unknown. Hence, centers and clinicians display broad variations in practice with regard to tracheostomy, which presents barriers to designing evidence-generating studies and establishing a consensus approach. As the incidence of severe BPD continues to rise, the question remains, how do we decide on tracheostomy to provide optimal outcomes for these patients?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury is characterized by mixed histopathologic changes with inflammation and fibrosis, such as observed in human patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although no curative therapies for these lung diseases exist, stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential therapeutic option. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are endogenous pluripotent- and macrophage-like stem cells distributed in various adult and fetal tissues as stage-specific embryonic antigen-3-positive cells. They selectively home to damaged tissue by sensing sphingosine-1-phosphate and replace the damaged/apoptotic cells by in vivo differentiation. Clinical trials for some human diseases suggest the safety and therapeutic efficacy of intravenously injected human leukocyte antigen-mismatched allogenic Muse cells from adult bone marrow (BM) without immunosuppressant. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of human Muse cells from preterm and term umbilical cord (UC), and adult BM in a rat BLM-induced lung injury model., METHODS: Rats were endotracheally administered BLM to induce lung injury on day 0. On day 3, human preterm UC-Muse, term UC-Muse, or adult BM-Muse cells were administered intravenously without immunosuppressants, and rats were subjected to histopathologic analysis on day 21. Body weight, serum surfactant protein D (SP-D) levels, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored. Histopathologic lung injury scoring by the Ashcroft and modified American Thoracic Society document scales, quantitative characterization of engrafted Muse cells, RNA sequencing analysis, and in vitro migration assay of infused Muse cells were performed., RESULTS: Rats administered preterm- and term-UC-Muse cells exhibited a significantly better recovery based on weight loss, serum SP-D levels, SpO2, and histopathologic lung injury scores, and a significantly higher rate of both Muse cell homing to the lung and alveolar marker expression (podoplanin and prosurfactant protein-C) than rats administered BM-Muse cells. Rats receiving preterm-UC-Muse cells showed statistically superior results to those receiving term-UC-Muse cells in many of the measures. These findings are thought to be due to higher expression of genes related to cell migration, lung differentiation, and cell adhesion., CONCLUSION: Preterm UC-Muse cells deliver more efficient therapeutic effects than term UC- and BM-Muse cells for treating BLM-induced lung injury in a rat model.

AB  - The synthesis and secretion of surfactant proteins (SPs) is an important sign of lung maturation. Furthermore, the morbidity of lung developmental diseases, including respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia which are mainly caused by immature lung development and lack of SPs, is increasing. As is well known, multiple microRNAs (miRs/miRNAs) are able to influence lung development via numerous different signaling pathways. However, few studies examine the association between the miRNAs and lung developmental diseases. A previous study has demonstrated that miR-431 was significantly (F=33.49; P<0.001) downregulated in the lung tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats at 3 time points, embryonic day 19, embryonic day 21 and postnatal day 3. The present study reported that the regulation of miR-431 may influence the expression of SPs. Thus, the further potential mechanisms of miR-431 in negatively regulating lung development were examined in the present study. Stable A549 cell lines overexpressing or knocking down SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) transfected with miR-431 overexpressed or knocked down, and their control groups were established. Subsequently, the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), SMAD4 and SPs (SP-A, SP-B and SP-C) at the RNA and protein levels were validated respectively by reverse transcription quantitative PCR and western blotting. miR-431 exhibited a decreased expression, while BMP4 and SPs exhibited increased expression at the mRNA and protein levels in the SMAD4 knockdown group. Meanwhile, the expression of SPs were reduced in the SMAD4-knockdown group via overexpressing miR-431 and increased in the SMAD4-overexpression group via inhibiting miR-431. The present results indicate that SMAD4 negatively regulates the expression of SPs, and that miR-431 negatively regulates the expression of SPs through inhibiting the BMP4/activin/transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway by targeting SMAD4.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mode of delivery for twins born before 32 weeks of gestation remains controversial. Our purpose is to conduct a meta-analysis of twin pregnancies less than 32 weeks or twin weight less than 1500 g, so as to find a suitable delivery mode., METHODS: We searched PubMed database, Cochrane Library database, and EMBASE database through December 2022. This protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023386946) prior to initiation. Studies that compared vaginal delivery to cesarean section for newborns less than 32 weeks of gestation or birthweight under 1500 g were included. The primary result was neonatal mortality rate. Secondary result was neonatal morbidity. The quality of literatures included in the research was evaluated in accordance with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) literature quality evaluation scale. We use odds ratio (OR) as the effect index for binary variables. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. P < 0. 05 indicated statistically significant difference., RESULTS: Our search generated 5310 articles, and a total of 8 articles comprising a total of 14,703 newborns were included in the analysis. The odds ratios of neonatal mortality rate were for twins delivered by vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57-1.24, P = 0.38). The 5-min Apgar score < 7 (95% CI 0.44-1.75, P = 0.72), necrotizing enterocolitis (95% CI 0.81-1.19, P = 0.82), intraventricular hemorrhage (95% CI 0.41-1.86, P = 0.71), periventricular leukomalacia (95% CI 0.16-4.52, P = 0.84), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (95% CI 0.88-1.36, P = 0.42), and respiratory distress syndrome (95% CI 0.23-2.01, P = 0.48) were not statistically significant between the two groups., CONCLUSION: We have observed that vaginal delivery does not confer an increased risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality in twins born before 32 weeks of gestation. However, the current results are affected by substantial heterogeneity and confounding factors. We still need high-quality randomized-controlled studies require to address this important question.

AB  - Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is expressed in several human organs. In particular, it is highly expressed in the placenta, prostate, and liver. The expression of GDF15 increases under cellular stress and pathological conditions. Although numerous transcription factors directly up-regulate the expression of GDF15, the receptors and downstream mediators of GDF15 signal transduction in most tissues have not yet been determined. Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha-like protein was recently identified as a specific receptor that plays a mediating role in anorexia. However, the specific receptors of GDF15 in other tissues and organs remain unclear. As a marker of cell stress, GDF15 appears to exert different effects under different pathological conditions. Cell senescence may be an important pathogenetic process and could be used to assess the progression of various lung diseases, including COVID-19. As a key member of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype protein repertoire, GDF15 seems to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, although the specific molecular mechanism linking GDF15 expression with ageing remains to be elucidated. Here, we focus on research progress linking GDF15 expression with the pathogenesis of various chronic lung diseases, including neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that GDF15 may be a key biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, in this review, we aimed to provide new insights into the molecular biological mechanism and emerging clinical data associated with GDF15 in lung-related diseases, while highlighting promising research and clinical prospects.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: With the development of perinatal and neonatal intensive care medicine, the survival rate of very premature infants increases year by year. However, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) increases year by year, which seriously affects the survival prognosis of very premature infants. How to prevent and treat BPD effectively has become the focus of neonatologists. This study aims to provide ideas for the prevention and treatment of BPD in very preterm infants via analyzing the clinical characteristics of BPD., METHODS: A total of 472 cases of very premature infants admitted to the Divison of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were retrospectively selected and assigned into a BPD group (n=147) and a non-BPD group (n=325) according to the diagnosis of BPD. Clinical data of each group were collected to find out the clinical characteristics of BPD in very preterm infants. Basic information, maternal pregnancy data, laboratory findings, nutritional support, respiratory support patterns and duration, and systemic complications were included., RESULTS: Compared with the non-BPD group, gestational age, birth weight, head circumference and body length in the BPD group were lower, the Apgar score in 1st min and 5th min and average body weight growth rate were lower (all P<0.05); the ratios of male, very low birth weight (VLBW), and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) in the BPD group were higher than those in the non-BPD group (all P<0.5); the incidence of maternal cervical insufficiency and the rate of using embryo transfer technology in the BPD group were higher than those in the non-BPD group, and the rate of using prenatal hormone in the BPD group was lower than that in the non-BPD group (all P<0.05). The positive rate of sputum culture in the BPD group was higher than that in the non-BPD group (P<0.05), and the white blood cell count, neutrophil ratio, and procalcitonin in the BPD group were higher than those in the non-BPD group (all P<0.05). The period of fasting, minimal feeding, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and partial parenteral nutrition (PPN) in the BPD group were longer than those in the non-BPD group (all P<0.05). The duration of nasal catheter oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation in the BPD group was longer than that in the non-BPD group, and the rates of mechanical ventilation at Day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after birth were higher than those in the non-BPD group (all P<0.05). The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, apnea of prematurity, respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, pleural effusion, persistent pulmonary hypertension, hemodynamic patent ductus arteriosus, cytomegalovirus infection, neonatal necrotic enterocolitis, cholestasis, anemia, abnormal blood system, hypothyroidism, retinopathy of prematurity, and internal environment disorders in the BPD group were significantly higher than those in non-BPD group (all P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences between very premature infants with BPD and those without BPD in general information, maternal history, inflammatory indicators, nutritional support, respiratory support, comorbidities and complication rates. To ensure normal fetal development, reducing the inflammatory reaction of very premature infants, establishing enteral nutrition as early as possible, shortening the time of mechanical ventilation, and reducing the occurrence of complications are beneficial to decrease the incidence of BPD in very premature infants and improve the long-term prognosis of BPD.

AB  - Various studies have shown that oropharyngeal colostrum application (OPCA) is beneficial to preterm neonates. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether OPCA reduces the incidence of culture-proven neonatal sepsis in preterm neonates. Randomized controlled trials comparing OPCA with placebo or standard care in preterm neonates were included. Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and CENTRAL were searched for studies published up to June 15, 2023. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, version 2, for risk of bias assessment, the random-effects model (RevMan 5.4) for meta-analysis, and Gradepro software for assessing the certainty of evidence. Twenty-one studies involving 2393 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Four studies had a low risk of bias, whereas seven had a high risk. Oropharyngeal colostrum significantly reduced the incidence of culture-proven sepsis (18 studies, 1990 neonates, risk ratio [RR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.65, 0.94), mortality (18 studies, 2117 neonates, RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.90), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (17 studies, 1692 neonates, RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.82), feeding intolerance episodes (four studies, 445 neonates, RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.92), and the time to full enteral feeding (19 studies, 2142 neonates, mean difference: -2 to 21 days, 95% CI: -3.44, -0.99 days). There was no reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, hospital stay duration, time to full oral feeding, weight at discharge, pneumonia, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The certainty of the evidence was high for the outcomes of culture-positive sepsis and mortality, moderate for NEC, low for time to full enteral feeding, and very low for feeding intolerance. OPCA reduces culture-positive sepsis and mortality (high certainty), NEC (moderate certainty), and time to full enteral feeding (low certainty) in preterm neonates. However, scarcity of data from extremely premature infants limits the generalizability of these results to this population. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease common in extreme preterm infants and is characterized by alveolar simplification. Current BPD research mainly focuses on alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, myofibroblasts, and the endothelium. However, a notable gap exists in the involvement of AT1 cells, which constitute a majority of the alveolar surface area. In this issue of the JCI, Callaway and colleagues explored the role of TGF-beta signaling in AT1 cells for managing the AT1-to-AT2 transition and its involvement in the integration of mechanical forces with the pulmonary matrisome during development. The findings implicate AT1 cells in the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Objective To explore the phenotypic conversion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the lungs of mice with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-affected mice. Methods A total of 20 newborn C57BL/6 mice were divided into air group and hyperoxia group, with 10 mice in each group. The BPD model was established by exposing the newborn mice to hyperoxia. Lung tissues from five mice in each group were collected on postnatal days 7 and 14, respectively. Histopathological changes of the lung tissues was detected by HE staining. The expression level of surfactant protein C (SP-C) in the lung tissues was examined by Western blot analysis. Flow cytometry was performed to assess the proportion of FOXP3+ Tregs and RORgammat+FOXP3+ Tregs in CD4+ lymphocytes. The concentrations of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-6 in lung homogenate were measured by using ELISA. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between FOXP3+Treg and the expression of SP-C and the correlation between RORgammat+FOXP3+ Tregs and the content of IL-17A and IL-6. Results The hyperoxia group exhibited significantly decreased levels of SP-C and radical alveolar counts in comparison to the control group. The proportion of FOXP3+Tregs was reduced and that of RORgammat+FOXP3+Tregs was increased. IL-17A and IL-6 concentrations were significantly increased. SP-C was positively correlated with the expression level of RORgammat+FOXP3+ Tregs. RORgammat+FOXP3+ Tregs and IL-17A and IL-6 concentrations were also positively correlated. Conclusion The number of FOXP3+ Tregs in lung tissue of BPD mice is decreased and converted to RORgammat+ FOXP3+ Tregs, which may be involved in hyperoxy-induced lung injury.

AB  - The past decades have seen markedly improved survival of increasingly immature preterm infants, yet major health complications persist. This is particularly true for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, which has become the most common sequelae of prematurity and a significant predictor of respiratory morbidity throughout childhood as well as adult life, neurodevelopmental disability, cardiovascular disease, and even death. The need for novel approaches to reduce BPD and related complications of prematurity has never been more critical. Thus, despite major advances in the use of antenatal steroids, surfactant therapy, and improvements in respiratory support, there is a persistent need for developing therapeutic strategies that more specifically reflect our growing understanding of BPD in the post-surfactant age, or the "new BPD." In contrast with the severe lung injury leading to marked fibroproliferative disease from the past, the "new BPD" is primarily characterized by an arrest of lung development as related to more extreme prematurity. This distinction and the continued high incidence of BPD and related sequelae suggest the need to identify therapies that target critical mechanisms that support lung growth and maturation in conjunction with treatments to improve respiratory outcomes across the lifespan. As the prevention of BPD and its severity remains a primary goal, we highlight the concept from preclinical and early clinical observations that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) can potentially support the natural sequence of lung growth as a replacement therapy after preterm birth. Data supporting this hypothesis are robust and include observations that low IGF-1 levels persist after extremely preterm birth in human infants and strong preclinical data from experimental models of BPD highlight the therapeutic benefit of IGF-1 in reducing disease. Importantly, phase 2a clinical data in extremely premature infants where replacement of IGF-1 with a human recombinant human IGF-1 complexed with its main IGF-1 binding protein 3, significantly reduced the most severe form of BPD, which is strongly associated with multiple morbidities that have lifelong consequences. As physiologic replacement therapy of surfactant heralded the success of reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, the paradigm has the potential to become the platform for discovering the next generation of therapies like IGF-1, which becomes deficient after extremely premature birth where endogenous production by the infant is not sufficient to maintain the physiologic levels adequate to support normal organ development and maturation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many preterm infants require respiratory support to maintain an optimal level of oxygenation, as oxygen levels both below and above the optimal range are associated with adverse outcomes. Optimal titration of oxygen therapy for these infants presents a major challenge, especially in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) with suboptimal staffing. Devices that offer automated oxygen delivery during respiratory support of neonates have been developed since the 1970s, and individual trials have evaluated their effectiveness., OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of automated oxygen delivery systems, embedded within a ventilator or oxygen delivery device, for preterm infants with respiratory dysfunction who require respiratory support or supplemental oxygen therapy., SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and clinical trials databases without language or publication date restrictions on 23 January 2023. We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles for other potentially eligible trials., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials and randomised cross-over trials that compared automated oxygen delivery versus manual oxygen delivery, or that compared different automated oxygen delivery systems head-to-head, in preterm infants (born before 37 weeks' gestation)., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our main outcomes were time (%) in desired oxygen saturation (SpO2) range, all-cause in-hospital mortality by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and neurodevelopmental outcomes at approximately two years' corrected age. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence., MAIN RESULTS: We included 18 studies (27 reports, 457 infants), of which 13 (339 infants) contributed data to meta-analyses. We identified 13 ongoing studies. We evaluated three comparisons: automated oxygen delivery versus routine manual oxygen delivery (16 studies), automated oxygen delivery versus enhanced manual oxygen delivery with increased staffing (three studies), and one automated system versus another (two studies). Most studies were at low risk of bias for blinding of personnel and outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting; and half of studies were at low risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. However, most were at high risk of bias in an important domain specific to cross-over trials, as only two of 16 cross-over trials provided separate outcome data for each period of the intervention (before and after cross-over). Automated oxygen delivery versus routine manual oxygen delivery Automated delivery compared with routine manual oxygen delivery probably increases time (%) in the desired SpO2 range (MD 13.54%, 95% CI 11.69 to 15.39; I2 = 80%; 11 studies, 284 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies assessed in-hospital mortality. Automated oxygen delivery compared to routine manual oxygen delivery may have little or no effect on risk of severe ROP (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.94; 1 study, 39 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes. Automated oxygen delivery versus enhanced manual oxygen delivery There may be no clear difference in time (%) in the desired SpO2 range between infants who receive automated oxygen delivery and infants who receive manual oxygen delivery (MD 7.28%, 95% CI -1.63 to 16.19; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 19 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed in-hospital mortality, severe ROP, or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Revised closed-loop automatic control algorithm (CLACfast) versus original closed-loop automatic control algorithm (CLACslow) CLACfast allowed up to 120 automated adjustments per hour, whereas CLACslow allowed up to 20 automated adjustments per hour. CLACfast may result in little or no difference in time (%) in the desired SpO2 range compared to CLACslow (MD 3.00%, 95% CI -3.99 to 9.99; 1 study, 19 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed in-hospital mortality, severe ROP, or neurodevelopmental outcomes. OxyGenie compared to CLiO2 Data from a single small study were presented as medians and interquartile ranges and were not suitable for meta-analysis., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Automated oxygen delivery compared to routine manual oxygen delivery probably increases time in desired SpO2 ranges in preterm infants on respiratory support. However, it is unclear whether this translates into important clinical benefits. The evidence on clinical outcomes such as severe retinopathy of prematurity are of low certainty, with little or no differences between groups. There is insufficient evidence to reach any firm conclusions on the effectiveness of automated oxygen delivery compared to enhanced manual oxygen delivery or CLACfast compared to CLACslow. Future studies should include important short- and long-term clinical outcomes such as mortality, severe ROP, bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotising enterocolitis, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. The ideal study design for this evaluation is a parallel-group randomised controlled trial. Studies should clearly describe staffing levels, especially in the manual arm, to enable an assessment of reproducibility according to resources in various settings. The data of the 13 ongoing studies, when made available, may change our conclusions, including the implications for practice and research. Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite considerable improvement in outcomes for preterm infants, rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remain high, affecting an estimated 33% of very low birthweight infants, with corresponding long-term respiratory and neurosensory issues. Systemic corticosteroids can address the inflammation underlying BPD, but the optimal regimen for prevention of this disease, balancing of the benefits with the potentially meaningful risks of systemic corticosteroids, continues to be a medical quandary. Numerous studies have shown that systemic corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, effectively treat or prevent BPD. However, concerning short and long-term side effects have been reported and the optimal approach to corticosteroid treatment remains unclear., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether differences in efficacy and safety exist between high-dose dexamethasone, moderate-dose dexamethasone, low-dose dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and placebo in the prevention of BPD, death, the composite outcome of death or BPD, and other relevant morbidities, in preterm infants through a network meta-analysis, generating both pairwise comparisons between all treatments and rankings of the treatments., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library for all systematic reviews of systemic corticosteroids for the prevention of BPD and searched for completed and ongoing studies in the following databases in January 2023: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trial databases., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in preterm infants (< 37 weeks' gestation) at risk for BPD that evaluated systemic corticosteroids (high-dose [>= 4 mg/kg cumulative dose] dexamethasone, moderate-dose [>= 2 to < 4 mg/kg] dexamethasone, low-dose [< 2 mg/kg] dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone) versus control or another systemic corticosteroid., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Our main information sources were the systematic reviews, with reference to the original manuscript only for data not included in these reviews. Teams of two paired review authors independently performed data extraction, with disagreements resolved by discussion. Data were entered into Review Manager 5 and exported to R software for network meta-analysis (NMA). NMA was performed using a frequentist model with random-effects. Two separate networks were constructed, one for early (= seven days) treatment initiation, to reflect the different patient populations evaluated. We assessed the certainty of evidence derived from the NMA for our primary outcomes using principles of the GRADE framework modified for application to NMA., MAIN RESULTS: We included 59 studies, involving 6441 infants, in our analyses. Only six of the included studies provided direct comparisons between any of the treatment (dexamethasone or hydrocortisone) groups, forcing network comparisons between treatments to rely heavily on indirect evidence through comparisons with placebo/no treatment groups. Thirty-one studies evaluated early corticosteroid treatment, 27 evaluated late corticosteroid treatment, and one study evaluated both early and late corticosteroid treatments. Early treatment (prior to seven days after birth): Benefits:NMA for early treatment showed only moderate-dose dexamethasone to decrease the risk of BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) compared with control (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.80; moderate-certainty evidence), although the other dexamethasone dosing regimens may have similar effects compared with control (high-dose dexamethasone, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.01; low-certainty evidence; low-dose dexamethasone, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.03; low-certainty evidence). Other early treatment regimens may have little or no effect on the risk of death at 36 weeks' PMA. Only moderate-dose dexamethasone decreased the composite outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' PMA compared with control (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98; moderate-certainty evidence)., HARMS: Low-dose dexamethasone increased the risk for cerebral palsy (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.28; moderate-certainty evidence) compared with control. Hydrocortisone may decrease the risk of major neurosensory disability versus low-dose dexamethasone (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.01; low-certainty evidence). Late treatment (at seven days or later after birth): Benefits: NMA for late treatment showed high-dose dexamethasone to decrease the risk of BPD both versus hydrocortisone (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.85; low-certainty evidence) and versus control (RR 0.72, CI 0.59 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). The late treatment regimens evaluated may have little or no effect on the risk of death at 36 weeks' PMA. High-dose dexamethasone decreased risk for the composite outcome of death or BPD compared with all other treatments (control, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.80, high-certainty evidence; hydrocortisone, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84, low-certainty evidence; low-dose dexamethasone, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88, low-certainty evidence; moderate-dose dexamethasone, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93, low-certainty evidence)., HARMS: No effect was observed for the outcomes of major neurosensory disability or cerebral palsy. The evidence for the primary outcomes was of overall low certainty, with notable deductions for imprecision and heterogeneity across the networks., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While early treatment with moderate-dose dexamethasone or late treatment with high-dose dexamethasone may lead to the best effects for survival without BPD, the certainty of the evidence is low. There is insufficient evidence to guide this therapy with regard to plausible adverse long-term outcomes. Further RCTs with direct comparisons between systemic corticosteroid treatments are needed to determine the optimal treatment approach, and these studies should be adequately powered to evaluate survival without major neurosensory disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Telomeres shorten after each cell division. Since preterm-born babies are delivered early and often suffer from inflammatory conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), their telomere length may be altered., OBJECTIVES: We assessed associations of early and current life factors with telomere length in saliva samples obtained from 7-12-year-old children born at <=34 weeks' gestation and term-born controls., STUDY DESIGN: Relative telomere length was measured by qPCR on extracted DNA. Groups were compared using independent t-tests or ANOVA with post-hoc correction. Linear regression analysis was also used., RESULTS: 534 children had satisfactory telomere data including 383 who were preterm-born (mean (SD) birthweight 1732g (558g), gestation 31.1 (2.6) weeks) and 151 term-born (3464g (510g); 39.8 (1.3) weeks). Telomere length was longer in children who had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) at birth: mean (SD): 464.6 (166.3) vs. 418.6 (110.7) in the no-IUGR group; in females: 440.2 (130.1) vs. 405.7 (101.5) in males; and in the least deprived group (397.8 (95.0) vs. 437.6 (121.9) most vs least deprivation quintile). Differences were most notable in females with IUGR. However, telomere length was not different between the preterm and term groups; the BPD and no BPD groups nor was it related to lung function or cardiovascular measurements. In multivariable regression analyses, telomere length was associated with sex, IUGR and deprivation with the greatest difference observed in females with IUGR., CONCLUSIONS: Telomere length was associated with sex, IUGR and deprivation, especially in females with IUGR, but not with prematurity, BPD, lung function or cardiovascular measurements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been implicated as a protective factor in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and is known to be regulated by MicroRNA-451 (miR-451). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of miR-451 and the MIF signaling pathway in in vitro and in vivo models of BPD., METHODS: Studies were conducted in mouse lung endothelial cells (MLECs) exposed to hyperoxia and in a newborn mouse model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. Lung and cardiac morphometry as well as vascular markers were evaluated., RESULTS: Increased expression of miR-451 was noted in MLECs exposed to hyperoxia and in lungs of BPD mice. Administration of a miR-451 inhibitor to MLECs exposed to hyperoxia was associated with increased expression of MIF and decreased expression of angiopoietin (Ang) 2. Treatment with the miR-451 inhibitor was associated with improved lung morphometry indices, significant reduction in right ventricular hypertrophy, decreased mean arterial wall thickness and improvement in vascular density in BPD mice. Western blot analysis demonstrated preservation of MIF expression in BPD animals treated with a miR-451 inhibitor and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), Ang1, Ang2 and the Ang receptor, Tie2., CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that inhibition of miR-451 is associated with mitigation of the cardio-pulmonary phenotype, preservation of MIF expression and increased expression of several vascular growth factors.

AB  - Small ubiquitin-like modifier mediated modification (SUMOylation) is a critical post-translational modification that has a broad spectrum of biological functions, including genome replication and repair, transcriptional regulation, protein stability, and cell cycle progression. Perturbation or deregulation of a SUMOylation and deSUMOylation status has emerged as a new pathophysiological feature of lung diseases. In this review, we highlighted the link between SUMO pathway and lung diseases, especially the sumoylated substrate such as C/EBPalpha in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP), PPARgamma in pneumonia, TFII-I in asthma, HDAC2 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), KLF15 in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH), SMAD3 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and YTHDF2 in cancer. By exploring the impact of SUMOylation in pulmonary diseases, we intend to shed light on its potential to inspire the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, holding promise for improving patient outcomes and overall respiratory health.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a condition characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, which has the potential to be life-limiting. The etiology of pediatric PH varies. When compared with adult cohorts, the etiology is often multifactorial, with contributions from prenatal, genetic, and developmental factors. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the causes and classification of pediatric PH, describe current therapeutics in pediatric PH, and discuss upcoming and necessary research in pediatric PH., METHODS: PubMed was searched for articles relating to pediatric pulmonary hypertension, with a particular focus on articles published within the past 10 years. Literature was reviewed for pertinent areas related to this topic., FINDINGS: The evaluation and approach to pediatric PH are unique when compared with that of adults, in large part because of the different, often multifactorial, causes of the disease in children. Collaborative registry studies have found that the most common disease causes include developmental lung disease and subsets of pulmonary arterial hypertension, which includes genetic variants and PH associated with congenital heart disease. Treatment with PH-targeted therapies in pediatrics is often guided by extrapolation of adult data, small clinical studies in pediatrics, and/or expert consensus opinion. We review diagnostic considerations and treatment in some of the more common pediatric subpopulations of patients with PH, including developmental lung diseases, congenital heart disease, and trisomy 21., IMPLICATIONS: The care of pediatric patients with PH requires consideration of unique pediatric-specific factors. With significant variability in disease etiology, ongoing efforts are needed to optimize treatment strategies based on disease phenotype and guide evidence-based practices. Copyright © 2023.

AB  - Microorganisms that make up the local microbiota (such as Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp.) play a crucial role in the modulation of diseases and health states by taking place not only in the gut but also in many parts of our body. There is also interference between the gut and the lung via the gut-lung axis. The relationship between respiratory diseases and lung microbiota, which become more of an issue of particular importance in recent years, shows that probiotics play an essential role in maintaining the balance of microorganisms in the respiratory tract. However, studies on probiotics' prophylactic or therapeutic application in chronic lung diseases are limited. In this review, the literature between 1977 and 2022 was surveyed. General information about human microbiota was accessed in earlier sources, and especially in the past decade, research on lung microbiota has been reached. The relationship between lung microbiota and important respiratory diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, allergy-asthma, influenza, lung cancer, and COVID-19 infection, was scrutinized after mentioning human microbiota, the gut-lung axis, and respiratory tract microbiota. The mechanism of action of probiotics and the formulation approaches of probiotics in terms of pharmaceutical technology were reviewed. Finally, future perspectives on lung-targeted administration of probiotic bacteria with prophylactic or therapeutic potential, or both, were presented.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also known as chronic lung disease, is the most common respiratory morbidity in preterm infants. "Old" or "classic" BPD, as per the original description, is less common now. "New BPD", which presents with distinct clinical and pathological features, is more frequently observed in the current era of advanced neonatal care, where extremely premature infants are surviving because of medical advancements. The pathogenesis of BPD is complex and multifactorial and involves both genetic and environmental factors. This review provides an overview of the pathology of BPD and discusses the influence of several prenatal and postnatal factors on its pathogenesis, such as maternal factors, genetic susceptibility, ventilator-associated lung injury, oxygen toxicity, sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and nutritional deficiencies. This in-depth review draws on existing literature to explore these factors and their potential contribution to the development of BPD.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of nano-sized membranous structures increasingly recognized as mediators of intercellular and inter-organ communication. EVs contain a cargo of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, and their cargo composition is highly dependent on the biological function of the parental cells. Their cargo is protected from the extracellular environment by the phospholipid membrane, thus allowing for safe transport and delivery of their intact cargo to nearby or distant target cells, resulting in modification of the target cell's gene expression, signaling pathways and overall function. The highly selective, sophisticated network through which EVs facilitate cell signaling and modulate cellular processes make studying EVs a major focus of interest in understanding various biological functions and mechanisms of disease. Tracheal aspirate EV-miRNA profiling has been suggested as a potential biomarker for respiratory outcome in preterm infants and there is strong preclinical evidence showing that EVs released from stem cells protect the developing lung from the deleterious effects of hyperoxia and infection. This article will review the role of EVs as pathogenic messengers, biomarkers, and potential therapies for neonatal lung diseases. Copyright © 2023 Wu, Benny, Duara, Williams, Tan, Schmidt and Young.

AB  - Background: Surgical closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) is infrequently indicated during infancy. We evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who underwent surgical ASD closure during infancy., Methods: A single-center retrospective review was performed for 39 patients (19 males) who underwent surgical ASD closure during infancy between 1993 and 2020. The median body weight percentile at the time of operation was 9.3., Results: During a median follow-up of 60.9 months, 4 late deaths occurred due to chronic respiratory failure. A preoperative history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was the only risk factor for late mortality identified in Cox regression (hazard ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-163.04; p=0.015). The 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients with preoperative history of BPD (97.0% vs. 50.0%, p<0.001) and preoperative ventilatory support (97.1% vs. 40.4%, p<0.001). There were significant postoperative increases in left ventricular end-diastolic (p=0.017), end-systolic (p=0.014), and stroke volume (p=0.013) indices. A generalized estimated equation model showed significantly better postoperative improvement in body weight percentiles in patients with lower weight percentiles at the time of operation (<10th percentile, p=0.01) and larger indexed ASD diameter (>=45 mm/m2, p=0.025)., Conclusion: Patients with ASD necessitating surgical closure during infancy are extremely small preoperatively and remain small even after surgical closure. However, postoperative somatic growth was more prominent in smaller patients with larger defects, which may be attributable to an increase in postoperative cardiac output due to changes in ventricular septal configuration. The benefits of ASD closure in patients with BPD are undetermined.

AB  - Inflammation causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common lung disease of preterm infants. One reason this disease lacks specific therapies is the paucity of information on the mechanisms regulating inflammation in developing lungs. We address this gap by characterizing the lymphatic phenotype in an experimental BPD model because lymphatics are major regulators of immune homeostasis. We hypothesized that hyperoxia (HO), a major risk factor for experimental and human BPD, disrupts lymphatic endothelial homeostasis using neonatal mice and human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). Exposure to 70% O2 for 24-72 h decreased the expression of prospero homeobox 1 (Prox1) and vascular endothelial growth factor c (Vegf-c) and increased the expression of heme oxygenase 1 and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone]1 in HDLECs, and reduced their tubule formation ability. Next, we determined Prox1 and Vegf-c mRNA levels on postnatal days (P) 7 and 14 in neonatal murine lungs. The mRNA levels of these genes increased from P7 to P14, and 70% O2 exposure for 14 d (HO) attenuated this physiological increase in pro-lymphatic factors. Further, HO exposure decreased VEGFR3+ and podoplanin+ lymphatic vessel density and lymphatic function in neonatal murine lungs. Collectively, our results validate the hypothesis that HO disrupts lymphatic endothelial homeostasis.

AB  - High-risk preterm infants are affected by a higher incidence of cognitive developmental deficits due to the unavoidable risk factor of oxygen toxicity. Caffeine is known to have a protective effect in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia associated with improved neurologic outcomes, although very early initiation of therapy is controversial. In this study, we used newborn rats in an oxygen injury model to test the hypothesis that near-birth caffeine administration modulates neuronal maturation and differentiation in the hippocampus of the developing brain. For this purpose, newborn Wistar rats were exposed to 21% or 80% oxygen on the day of birth for 3 or 5 days and treated with vehicle or caffeine (10 mg/kg/48 h). Postnatal exposure to 80% oxygen resulted in a drastic reduction of associated neuronal mediators for radial glia, mitotic/postmitotic neurons, and impaired cell-cycle regulation, predominantly persistent even after recovery to room air until postnatal day 15. Systemic caffeine administration significantly counteracted the effects of oxygen insult on neuronal maturation in the hippocampus. Interestingly, under normoxia, caffeine inhibited the transcription of neuronal mediators of maturing and mature neurons. The early administration of caffeine modulated hyperoxia-induced decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus and showed neuroprotective properties in the neonatal rat oxygen toxicity model.

AB  - Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) has been reported to inhibit signaling leading to the release of high mobility group box 1 protein, a damage-associated molecular pattern. The present study aimed to determine the longitudinal change in HRG levels in extremely preterm infants and assess whether complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were associated with differences in HRG levels. In this multicenter, prospective, observational study, we measured serum HRG levels every 2 weeks from birth to 8 weeks of age. Serum HRG was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We included 19 extremely preterm infants in the study and 74 samples were analyzed. The median gestational age was 26.0 weeks, and the median birth weight was 858 g. Serum HRG levels showed a significant upward trend after birth (p < 0.001); median HRG concentrations at birth and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age were 1.07, 1.11, 2.86, 6.05, and 7.49 microg/mL, respectively. Onset of BPD was not associated with differences in serum HRG levels. Further, the serum HRG levels increased significantly after birth in extremely preterm infants.

AB  - Ferroptosis has emerged as a significant factor in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Nevertheless, our understanding of the potential involvement of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in BPD remains incomplete. In this study, we leveraged the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to investigate this aspect. We identified 20 differentially expressed FRGs that are associated with BPD, shedding light on their potential role in the condition. LASSO along with SVM-RFE algorithms found that 12 genes: MEG3, ACSL1, DPP4, GALNT14, MAPK14, CD82, SMPD1, NR1D1, PARP3, ACVR1B, H19, and SLC7A11 were closely related to ferroptosis modulation and immunological response. These genes were used to create a nomogram with good predictive power and were found to be involved in BPD-linked pathways. In addition, the marker genes-based prediction model performed well in external validation data sets. The study also showed a significance between BPD and control samples in terms of immune cell infiltration. These findings may help improve our understanding of FRGs in BPD and lead to the development of more effective immunotherapies. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - AIMS: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe respiratory complication in preterm infants. This study reveals the molecular mechanism of autophagic agonists regulating the Nrf2-ARE pathway via p62 to improve alveolar development in BPD rats., MAIN METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly exposed to a hyperoxic environment (FiO2 = 0.85) for 14 days and rapamycin (RAPA) was intraperitoneally injected on alternate days into hyperoxia-exposed mice. Alveolar development was assessed using HE and RAC values. Markers associated with the p62-Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway were detected by western blot, immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR. Co-localization of proteins was determined using double immunofluorescence staining., KEY FINDINGS: At the levels of lung tissue and primary type II alveolar epithelial cells, the enhanced binding between phosphorylated p62 and Keap1 disrupted the nuclear transport of Nrf2. The activated Nrf2 was insufficient to reverse alveolar simplification. The autophagy agonist was able to inhibit p62 phosphorylation, promote Keap1 degradation, increase Nrf2 nuclear transport, augment downstream antioxidant enzyme expression, and enhance antioxidant capacity, thereby improving the simplification of alveolar structure in BPD rats., SIGNIFICANCE: The use of autophagy agonists to enhance the Nrf2-ARE pathway activity and promote alveolar development could be a novel target in antioxidant therapy for BPD.

AB  - Long-term exposure to hyperoxia can leading to the bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The progression of BPD is primarily driven by the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, and the regulation of autophagy has an impact on apoptosis. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanism of an autophagy-promoting peptide (Tat-P) in ameliorating BPD. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Tat-P promoted autophagy and partially prevented apoptosis caused by exposure to hyperoxia. Further investigation into the mechanism revealed that Tat-P competitively binds to GAPR1, displacing the Beclin1 protein and thereby inhibiting the apoptosis. In vivo experiments conducted on Sprague-Dawley pups exposed to high oxygen levels demonstrated that Tat-P promoted autophagy and reduced apoptosis in lung tissues and ameliorated BPD-related phenotypes. Our findings elucidate the underlying mechanisms and effects of Tat-P in enhancing autophagy and preventing apoptosis. This study presents an approach for the prevention and treatment of BPD.

AB  - In premature infants receiving parenteral nutrition, oxidative stress is a trigger for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which is an important factor in the development of adult lung diseases. Neonatal vitamin C and glutathione deficiency is suspected to induce permanent modification of redox metabolism favoring the development of neonatal and adult lung diseases. A total of 64 3-day-old guinea pigs were fed an oral diet that was either complete or deficient in vitamin C (VCD), cysteine (CD) (glutathione-limiting substrate) or both (DD) for 4 days. At 1 week of age, half of the animals were sacrificed while the other started a complete diet until 12 weeks of age. At 1 week, the decrease in lung GSH in all deficient groups was partially explained by the oxidation of liver methionine-adenosyltransferase. mRNA levels of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), glutathione-reductase (Gsr) and glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) were significantly lower only in CD but not in DD. At 12 weeks, glutathione levels were increased in VCD and CD. Keap1, Gsr and Glrx mRNA were increased, while glutathione-reductase and glutaredoxin proteins were lower in CD, favoring a higher glutathionylation status. Both neonatal deficiencies result in a long-term change in glutathione metabolism that could contribute to lung diseases' development.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common respiratory complication of prematurity as younger and smaller infants are surviving beyond the immediate neonatal period. The recognition that oxidative stress (OS) plays a key role in BPD pathogenesis has been widely accepted since at least the 1980s. In this article, we examine the interplay between OS and genetic regulation and review 'omics' data related to OS in BPD. Data from animal models (largely models of hyperoxic lung injury) and from human studies are presented. Epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated several genes related to OS to be differentially expressed in murine models that mimic BPD as well as in premature infants at risk of BPD development and infants with established lung disease. Alterations in the genetic regulation of antioxidant enzymes is a common theme in these studies. Data from metabolomics and proteomics have also demonstrated the potential involvement of OS-related pathways in BPD. A limitation of many studies includes the difficulty of obtaining timely and appropriate samples from human patients. Additional 'omics' studies could further our understanding of the role of OS in BPD pathogenesis, which may prove beneficial for prevention and timely diagnosis, and aid in the development of targeted therapies.

AB  - Despite efforts to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, some preterm infants require positive pressure support after 36 weeks' post-menstrual age. Infants with severe BPD typically experience progressive mismatch of ventilation and perfusion, which manifests as respiratory distress, hypoxemia in room air, hypercarbia, and growth failure. Lung compliance varies, but lung resistance generally increases with prolonged exposure to positive pressure ventilation and other sources of inflammation. Serial lung radiographs reveal a heterogeneous pattern, with areas of both hyperinflation and atelectasis; in extreme cases, macrocystic changes may be noted. Efforts to wean the respiratory support are often unsuccessful, and trials of high frequency ventilation, exogenous corticosteroids, and diuretics are common. The incidence of pulmonary hypertension increases with the severity of BPD, as does the mortality rate. Therefore, periodic screening and efforts to mitigate the risk of PH is fundamental to the management of longstanding BPD. Failure of conventional, lung-protective strategies (e.g., high rate/low tidal-volume and/or high frequency ventilation) warrants consideration of ventilatory strategies individualized to the disease physiology. Non-invasive modes of respiratory support may be successful in infants with mild to moderate BPD phenotypes. However, infants with moderate to severe BPD phenotypes often require invasive respiratory support, and pressure-limited or volume-targeted conventional ventilation may be better suited to the physiology than high-frequency ventilation. The consistent provision of adequate support is fundamental to the management of longstanding BPD and is best achieved with a stepwise increase in ventilator support until comfortable spontaneous respirations are achieved. Adequately supported infants typically experience improvements in both oxygenation and ventilation, which, if sustained, may arrest and generally reverses the course of a potentially lethal lung disease. Care should be individualized to address the most likely pulmonary mechanics, including variable lung compliance, elevated airway resistance, and variable airway obstruction.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) is a pulmonary illness with a high burden of morbidity and mortality around the world. Chronic lung diseases also represent life-threatening situations. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a type of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and is highly abundant in lung tissues. MALAT1 can function as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to impair the microRNA (miRNA) inhibition on targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In this review, we summarized that MALAT1 mainly participates in pulmonary cell biology and lung inflammation. Therefore, MALAT1 can positively or negatively regulate ALI and chronic lung diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and pulmonary hypertension (PH)). Besides, we also found a MALAT1-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA regulatory network in acute and chronic lung diseases. Through this review, we hope to cast light on the regulatory mechanisms of MALAT1 in ALI and chronic lung disease and provide a promising approach for lung disease treatment.

AB  - Background: Children living with chronic comorbid conditions are at increased risk for severe COVID-19, though there is limited evidence regarding the risks associated with specific conditions and which children may benefit from targeted COVID-19 therapies. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with severe disease among hospitalized children with COVID-19 in Canada., Methods: We conducted a national prospective study on hospitalized children with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection via the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) from April 2020-May 2021. Cases were reported voluntarily by a network of >2800 paediatricians. Hospitalizations were classified as COVID-19-related, incidental infection, or infection control/social admissions. Severe disease (among COVID-19-related hospitalizations only) was defined as disease requiring intensive care, ventilatory or hemodynamic support, select organ system complications, or death. Risk factors for severe disease were identified using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for age, sex, concomitant infections, and timing of hospitalization., Findings: We identified 544 children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 60.7% with COVID-19-related disease and 39.3% with incidental infection or infection control/social admissions. Among COVID-19-related hospitalizations (n=330), the median age was 1.9 years (IQR 0.1-13.3) and 43.0% had chronic comorbid conditions. Severe disease occurred in 29.7% of COVID-19-related hospitalizations (n=98/330 including 60 admitted to intensive care), most frequently among children aged 2-4 years (48.7%) and 12-17 years (41.3%). Comorbid conditions associated with severe disease included pre-existing technology dependence requirements (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-2.95), body mass index Z-scores >=3 (aRR 1.90, 95% CI 1.10-3.28), neurologic conditions (e.g. epilepsy and select chromosomal/genetic conditions) (aRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.32-2.57), and pulmonary conditions (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia and uncontrolled asthma) (aRR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12-2.39)., Interpretation: While severe outcomes were detected at all ages and among patients with and without comorbidities, neurologic and pulmonary conditions as well as technology dependence were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. These findings may help guide vaccination programs and prioritize targeted COVID-19 therapies for children., Funding: Financial support for the CPSP was received from the Public Health Agency of Canada.

AB  - Both "new" and "old" bronchopulmonary dysplasia features overlap in preterm infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The optimal ventilation strategy for infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia has not been clarified yet. Principally, the lung is a multi-com- partmental heterogeneous tissue with regionally varying compliance and resistance. Generally, 2 critical strategical errors are common while ventilating infants with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia: (i) ventilatory management as if they are still in the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome and (ii) early extubation attempts with the aim of reducing ventilator-induced lung injury. Considering the heterogeneous character of bronchopulmo- nary dysplasia, although there is no unique formulation for optimal ventilation, the most physi- ologically appropriate ventilation mode may be the combined mode of volume-guaranteed synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation and pressure support ventilation. With the volume-guaranteed synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation mode, slow compart- ments of the lung with high resistance and low compliance can be adequately ventilated, while fast compartments having relatively normal resistance and compliance can be venti- lated well with the pressure support ventilation mode. The following settings are advisable: frequency = 12-20 breaths per minute, tidal volume = 10-15 mL/min, positive end expiratory pressure = 7-12 cmH2O, and inspiratory to expiratory time ratio = 1 : 5. Higher oxygen satura- tions such as 92%-95% should be targeted to avoid subsequent pulmonary hypertension. In conclusion, there is no evidence-based ventilation recommendation for infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, given the changing pattern of the disease and the underlying pathophysiology, these infants should not be ventilated as if they were in the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome.

AB  - Background: Respiratory distress is a clinical finding often seen in neonates. Common causes of respiratory distress in this population include respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, infection, aspiration, and cardiac etiologies. We present the case of a neonate who presented with respiratory distress with no identifiable cause on initial workup. The patient was eventually found to have a variant of a genetic mutation that predisposed the infant to this presentation. Case Report: A term male infant born via spontaneous vaginal delivery was admitted to the pediatric service at 3 weeks of age because of tachypnea. Chest x-ray showed perihilar infiltrates. Septic screen, thyroid function test, sweat test, echocardiogram, intracranial ultrasound, and modified barium swallow were normal. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed ground glass opacities in the upper and lower lobes. Airway evaluation showed no evidence of obstruction or anatomic abnormalities. Bronchoscopy showed no masses or tracheomalacia. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for infection. The infant was treated with intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and furosemide but continued to be tachypneic and required supplemental oxygen. Genetic studies were obtained to assess for surfactant deficiencies, and the patient was transferred to another center for a higher level of care. Genetic evaluation was positive for NKX2.1 variance mutation C.190C. The patient's symptoms improved, and he was weaned to room air by 3 months of age. Conclusion:  When evaluating a child with unexplained pulmonary disease, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for interstitial lung disease including surfactant protein mutations.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in premature infants. However, there is a lack of effective treatment. Mesenchymal stromal cells derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs), as nano- and micron-sized heterogeneous vesicles secreted by MSCs, are the main medium for information exchange between MSCs and injured tissue and organ, playing an important role in repairing tissue and organ injury. EVs include exosomes, microvesicles and so on. They are rich with various proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Now, EVs are considered as a new way of cell-to-cell communication. EVs mainly induce regeneration and therapeutic effects in different tissues and organs through the biomolecules they carry. The surface membrane protein or loaded protein and nucleic acid molecules carried by EVs, can activate the signal transduction of target cells and regulate the biological behavior of target cells after binding and cell internalization. MSC-EVs can promote the development of pulmonary vessels and alveoli and reduce pulmonary hypertension (PH) and inflammation and play an important role in the repair of lung injury in BPD. The regeneration potential of MSC-EVs is mainly due to the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis, immunoregulation, anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress. As a new type of cell-free therapy, MSC-EVs have non-immunogenic, and are small in size and go deep into most tissues. What's more, it has good biological stability and can be modified and loaded with drugs of interest. Obviously, MSC-EVs have a good application prospect in the treatment of lung injury and BPD. However, there are still many challenges to make MSC-EVs really enter clinical application. Copyright © 2022 Xi, Ju and Wang.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The transcriptional repressor B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) has been reported to inhibit inflammation. So far, experimental evidence for the role of BCL6 in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is lacking. Our study investigated the roles of BCL6 in the progression of BPD and its downstream mechanisms., METHODS: Hyperoxia or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to mimic the BPD mouse model. To investigate the effects of BCL6 on BPD, recombination adeno-associated virus serotype 9 expressing BCL6 (rAAV9-BCL6) and BCL6 inhibitor FX1 were administered in mice. The pulmonary pathological changes, inflammatory chemokines and NLRP3-related protein were observed. Meanwhile, BCL6 overexpression plasmid was used in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and NLRP3-related protein were detected., RESULTS: Either hyperoxia or LPS suppressed pulmonary BCL6 mRNA expression. rAAV9-BCL6 administration significantly inhibited hyperoxia-induced NLRP3 upregulation and inflammation, attenuated alveolar simplification and dysregulated angiogenesis in BPD mice, which were characterized by decreased mean linear intercept, increased radical alveolar count and alveoli numbers, and the upregulated CD31 expression. Meanwhile, BCL6 overexpression promoted proliferation and angiogenesis, inhibited apoptosis and inflammation in hyperoxia-stimulated HPMECs. Moreover, administration of BCL6 inhibitor FX1 arrested growth and development. FX1-treated BPD mice exhibited exacerbation of alveolar pathological changes and pulmonary vessel permeability, with upregulated mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrogenic factors. Furthermore, both rAAV9-BCL6 and FX1 administration exerted a long-lasting effect on hyperoxia-induced lung injury (>=4 wk)., CONCLUSIONS: BCL6 inhibits NLRP3-mediated inflammation, attenuates alveolar simplification and dysregulated pulmonary vessel development in hyperoxia-induced BPD mice. Hence, BCL6 may be a target in treating BPD and neonatal diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alveologenesis is the final stage of lung development to form air-exchanging units between alveoli and blood vessels. Genetic susceptibility or hyperoxic stress to perturb this complicated process can cause abnormal enlargement of alveoli and lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-associated emphysema. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) signaling is crucial for alveolar myofibroblast (MYF) proliferation and its deficiency is associated with risk of BPD, but posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating PDGFRalpha synthesis during lung development remain largely unexplored. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 2 (CPEB2) is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein and translational regulator. Because CPEB2-knockout (KO) mice showed emphysematous phenotypes, we investigated how CPEB2-controlled translation affects pulmonary development and function., METHODS: Respiratory and pulmonary functions were measured by whole-body and invasive plethysmography. Histological staining and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze morphology, proliferation, apoptosis and cell densities from postnatal to adult lungs. Western blotting, RNA-immunoprecipitation, reporter assay, primary MYF culture and ectopic expression rescue were performed to demonstrate the role of CPEB2 in PDGFRalpha mRNA translation and MYF proliferation., RESULTS: Adult CPEB2-KO mice showed emphysema-like dysfunction. The alveolar structure in CPEB2-deficient lungs appeared normal at birth but became simplified through the alveolar stage of lung development. In CPEB2-null mice, we found reduced proliferation of MYF progenitors during alveolarization, abnormal deposition of elastin and failure of alveolar septum formation, thereby leading to enlarged pulmonary alveoli. We identified that CPEB2 promoted PDGFRalpha mRNA translation in MYF progenitors and this positive regulation could be disrupted by H2O2, a hyperoxia-mimetic treatment. Moreover, decreased proliferating ability in KO MYFs due to insufficient PDGFRalpha expression was rescued by ectopic expression of CPEB2, suggesting an important role of CPEB2 in upregulating PDGFRalpha signaling for pulmonary alveologenesis., CONCLUSIONS: CPEB2-controlled translation, in part through promoting PDGFRalpha expression, is indispensable for lung development and function. Since defective pulmonary PDGFR signaling is a key feature of human BPD, CPEB2 may be a risk factor for BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common respiratory disorder among preterm infants, particularly low-birth-weight infants (LBWIs) and very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs). Although BPD was first reported 50 years ago, no specific drugs or efficient measures are yet available for prevention or treatment. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) belongs to the insulin family. It promotes mitosis and stimulates cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, the primary factors involved in pulmonary development during the fetal and postnatal periods. Several studies have reported that IGF-1 exerts certain effects on BPD genesis and progression by regulating BPD-related biological processes. In addition, exogenous addition of IGF-1 can alleviate lung inflammation, cell apoptosis and eliminate alveolar development disorders in children with BPD. These findings suggest that IGF-1 could be a new target for treating BPD. Here, we summarize and analyze the definition, pathogenesis, and research status of BPD, as well as the pathogenesis of IGF-1 in BPD and the latest findings in related biological processes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension, or BPD-PH, are serious chronic lung disorders of prematurity, without curative therapies. Hyperoxia, a known causative factor of BPD-PH, activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha1 in neonatal murine lungs; however, whether this phenomenon potentiates or mitigates lung injury is unclear. Thus, we hypothesized that (1) endothelial AMPKalpha1 is necessary to protect neonatal mice against hyperoxia-induced BPD-PH, and (2) AMPKalpha1 knockdown decreases angiogenesis in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). We performed lung morphometric and echocardiographic studies on postnatal day (P) 28 on endothelial AMPKalpha1-sufficient and -deficient mice exposed to 21% O2 (normoxia) or 70% O2 (hyperoxia) from P1-P14. We also performed tubule formation assays on control- or AMPKalpha1-siRNA transfected HPMECs, exposed to 21% O2 or 70% O2 for 48 h. Hyperoxia-mediated alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH were significantly amplified in endothelial AMPKalpha1-deficient mice. AMPKalpha1 siRNA knocked down AMPKalpha1 expression in HPMECs, and decreased their ability to form tubules in normoxia and hyperoxia. Furthermore, AMPKalpha1 knockdown decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in hyperoxic conditions. Our results indicate that AMPKalpha1 is required to reduce hyperoxia-induced BPD-PH burden in neonatal mice, and promotes angiogenesis in HPMECs to limit lung injury.

AB  - NRF2 protects against oxidant-associated airway disorders via cytoprotective gene induction. To examine if NRF2 is an important determinant of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) susceptibility after neonate lung injury, Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) and wild-type (Nrf2+/+) mice neonatally exposed to hyperoxia were infected with RSV. To investigate the prenatal antioxidant effect on neonatal oxidative lung injury, time-pregnant Nrf2-/- and Nrf2+/+ mice were given an oral NRF2 agonist (sulforaphane) on embryonic days 11.5-17.5, and offspring were exposed to hyperoxia. Bronchoalveolar lavage and histopathologic analyses determined lung injury. cDNA microarray analyses were performed on placenta and neonatal lungs. RSV-induced pulmonary inflammation, injury, oxidation, and virus load were heightened in hyperoxia-exposed mice, and injury was more severe in hyperoxia-susceptible Nrf2-/- mice than in Nrf2+/+ mice. Maternal sulforaphane significantly alleviated hyperoxic lung injury in both neonate genotypes with more marked attenuation of severe neutrophilia, edema, oxidation, and alveolarization arrest in Nrf2-/- mice. Prenatal sulforaphane altered different genes with similar defensive functions (e.g., inhibition of cell/perinatal death and inflammation, potentiation of angiogenesis/organ development) in both strains, indicating compensatory transcriptome changes in Nrf2-/- mice. Conclusively, oxidative injury in underdeveloped lungs NRF2-dependently predisposed RSV susceptibility. In utero sulforaphane intervention suggested NRF2-dependent and -independent pulmonary protection mechanisms against early-life oxidant injury.

AB  - Preterm babies are highly susceptible to oxidative stress (OS) due to an imbalance between the oxidant and antioxidant systems. The generation of free radicals (FR) induces oxidative damage to multiple body organs and systems. OS is the main factor responsible for the development of typical premature infant diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, kidney damage, eryptosis, and also respiratory distress syndrome and patent ductus arteriosus. Many biomarkers have been detected to early identify newborns at risk of developing a free radical-mediated disease and to investigate new antioxidant strategies. This review reports the current knowledge on OS in the preterm newborns and the newest findings concerning the use of OS biomarkers as diagnostic tools, as well as in implementing antioxidant therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these diseases and their sequelae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) occurs in premature neonates with respiratory distress who require supplemental oxygen in the first days after birth. BPD involves uniform arrest of alveolar development and variable interstitial cellularity and/or fibroproliferation. Previous studies by our lab showed that the enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and its product Ang1-7 exerting action on the receptor Mas oncogene in what is known as ACE-2/Mas axis is protective to lung cells. We also showed that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas lung injury, an effect caused by ACE-2 enzyme shedding mediated by TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17). However, no reports yet exist about the regulation of ACE-2 in the alveolar epithelia in hyperoxic lung injury., OBJECTIVE: In this study we aim to define the effects of hyperoxic lung injury on the protective ACE-2 enzyme in the human lung alveolar epithelial cell line A549., DESIGN/METHODS: Cultured A549 cells were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) for 3 or 7 days in serum-free nutrient media. Cells were lysed and culture media were collected to test for cellular ACE-2 enzymatic activity and for ACE-2, Mas receptor, TACE/ADAM17, and ubiquitin proteins abundance by immunoblotting. Cells were harvested in Trizol for RNA extraction and ACE-2 qRT-PCR. Whole cell extracts of A549 cell line was used for ACE-2 immunoprecipitation and subsequent ubiquitin immunoblotting., RESULTS: Total ubiquitinated proteins were increased by hyperoxia treatment, while ACE-2 and Mas receptor proteins abundance and ACE-2 enzymatic activity were decreased significantly in A549 cells exposed to hyperoxia relative to the normoxia controls. The percent decrease in ACE-2 activity corresponded with increased time of hyperoxic gas exposure. However, in contrast to our data from lung fibroblasts, no significant change was noted in ACE-2 protein released into the media or in ACE-2 mRNA levels by the hyperoxic treatment. Ubiquitin immunoreactive bands were detectable in the ACE-2 immunoprecipitate., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that hyperoxic exposure of the lung epithelial cells decreases the protective enzyme ACE-2 by cell type specific mechanisms independent of shedding by TACE/ADAM17. The data also suggest a regulatory level of ACE-2 downstream of transcription may involve ACE-2 ubiquitination and targeting for degradation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease most commonly occurring in premature infants, and its pathological manifestations are alveolar hypoplasia and dysregulation of pulmonary vasculature development. The effective treatment for BPD has not yet been established. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs do not encode proteins, but can perform its biological functions at the RNA level. Non-coding RNAs play an important role in the incidence and development of BPD by regulating the expression of genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation and other cell activities of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. Here we summarize the role of non-coding RNAs in BPD, which provides possible molecular marker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of BPD. Copyright © 2021 Xi and Wang.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a significant clinical challenge in neonatal medicine. BPD is clearly a multifactorial disease with numerous antenatal and postnatal components influencing lung development. Extremely immature infants are born in the late canalicular or early saccular stage and usually receive intensive care until the early alveolar stage of lung development, resulting in varying magnitudes of impairment of alveolar septation, lung fibrosis, and abnormal vascular development. The interactions between T lymphocytes, the genome and the epigenome, the microbiome and the metabolome, as well as nutrition and therapeutic interventions such as the exposure to oxygen, volutrauma, antibiotics, corticosteroids, caffeine and omeprazole, play an important role in pathogenesis and disease progression. While our general understanding of these interactions thanks to basic research is improving, this knowledge is yet to be translated into comprehensive prevention and clinical management strategies for the benefit of preterm infants developing BPD and later during infancy and childhood suffering from the disease itself and its sequelae. In this review, we summarise existing evidence on the interplay between T lymphocytes, lung multi-omics and currently used therapeutic interventions in BPD, and highlight avenues for potential future immunology related research in the field.

AB  - Infants suffering from neonatal chronic lung disease, i.e., bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are facing long-term consequences determined by individual genetic background, presence of infections, and postnatal treatment strategies such as mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity. The adverse effects provoked by these measures include inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, altered growth factor signaling, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Both, acute and long-term consequences are determined by the capacity of the immature lung to respond to the challenges outlined above. The subsequent impairment of lung growth translates into an altered trajectory of lung function later in life. Here, knowledge about second and third hit events provoked through environmental insults are of specific importance when advocating lifestyle recommendations to this patient population. A profound exchange between the different health care professionals involved is urgently needed and needs to consider disease origin while future monitoring and treatment strategies are developed.

AB  - Over the last decade, the use of proteomics in the setting of prematurity has increased and has enabled researchers to successfully identify biomarkers for an array of associated morbidities. The objective of this scoping review was to identify the existing literature, as well as any knowledge gaps related to proteomic biomarker discoveries in the setting of prematurity. A scoping review was conducted using PubMed, Embase and Medline databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The study selection process yielded a total of 700 records, of which 13 studies were included in this review. Most studies used a tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) proteomics approach to identify key biomarkers. The corresponding studies identified proteins associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), late onset sepsis (LOS) and gestational age. This scoping review demonstrates the limited use of proteomics to identify biomarkers associated with severe complications of prematurity. Further research is warranted to identify biomarkers of other important morbidities associated with prematurity, such as intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and cerebral palsy, and to investigate the mechanisms associated with these outcomes.

AB  - Background: In extremely premature infants, postnatal growth restriction (PNGR) is common and increases the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Mechanisms by which poor nutrition impacts lung development are unknown, but alterations in the gut microbiota appear to play a role. In a rodent model, PNGR plus hyperoxia causes BPD and PH and increases intestinal Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-negative organisms that stimulate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We hypothesized that intestinal dysbiosis activates intestinal TLR4 triggering systemic inflammation which impacts lung development., Methods: Rat pups were assigned to litters of 17 (PNGR) or 10 (normal growth) at birth and exposed to room air or 75% oxygen for 14 days. Half of the pups were treated with the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 from birth or beginning at day 3. After 14 days, pulmonary arterial pressure was evaluated by echocardiography and hearts were examined for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Lungs and serum samples were analyzed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry., Results: Postnatal growth restriction + hyperoxia increased pulmonary arterial pressure and RVH with trends toward increased plasma IL1beta and decreased IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NFkappaB, in lung tissue. Treatment with the TLR4 inhibitor attenuated PH and inflammation., Conclusion: Postnatal growth restriction induces an increase in intestinal Enterobacteriaceae leading to PH. Activation of the TLR4 pathway is a promising mechanism by which intestinal dysbiosis impacts the developing lung.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a devastating lung disorder of preterm infants as a result of an aberrant reparative response following exposures to various antenatal and postnatal insults. Despite sophisticated medical treatment in this modern era, the incidence of BPD remains unabated. The current strategies to prevent and treat BPD have met with limited success. The emergence of stem cell therapy may be a potential breakthrough in mitigating this complex chronic lung disorder. Over the last two decades, the human placenta and umbilical cord have gained increasing attention as a highly potential source of stem cells. Placenta-derived stem cells (PDSCs) and umbilical cord-derived stem cells (UCDSCs) display several advantages such as immune tolerance and are generally devoid of ethical constraints, in addition to their stemness qualities. They possess the characteristics of both embryonic and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. Recently, there are many preclinical studies investigating the use of these cells as therapeutic agents in neonatal disease models for clinical applications. In this review, we describe the preclinical and clinical studies using PDSCs and UCDSCs as treatment in animal models of BPD. The source of these stem cells, routes of administration, and effects on immunomodulation, inflammation and regeneration in the injured lung are also discussed. Lastly, a brief description summarized the completed and ongoing clinical trials using PDSCs and UCDSCs as therapeutic agents in preventing or treating BPD. Due to the complexity of BPD, the development of a safe and efficient therapeutic agent remains a major challenge to both clinicians and researchers.

AB  - Recent advances in neonatology have led to the increased survival of extremely low-birth weight infants. However, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not improved proportionally, partly due to increased survival of extremely premature infants born at the late-canalicular stage of lung development. Due to minimal surfactant production at this stage, these infants are at risk for severe respiratory distress syndrome, needing prolonged ventilation. While the etiology of BPD is multifactorial with antenatal, postnatal, and genetic factors playing a role, ventilator-induced lung injury is a major, potentially modifiable, risk factor implicated in its causation. Infants with BPD are at a higher risk of developing complications including sepsis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, respiratory failure, and death. Long-term problems include increased risk of hospital readmissions, respiratory infections, and asthma-like symptoms during infancy and childhood. Survivors who have BPD are also at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. While the ultimate solution for avoiding BPD lies in the prevention of preterm births, strategies to decrease its incidence are the need of the hour. It is time to focus on gentler modes of ventilation and the use of less invasive surfactant administration techniques to mitigate lung injury, thereby potentially decreasing the burden of BPD. In this article, we discuss the use of non-invasive ventilation in premature infants, with an emphasis on studies showing an effect on BPD with different modes of non-invasive ventilation. Practical considerations in the use of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation are also discussed, considering the significant heterogeneity in clinical practices and management strategies in its use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the improvements in survival rates for preterm infants, not only the rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) but also those of long-term respiratory complications of premature birth are increasing, resulting in financial and health burdens in developed countries. Thus far, the risk factors of respiratory morbidities in extremely preterm infants remain unknown. Furthermore, the definition and the predictive ability of BPD for long-term respiratory outcomes are yet to be determined., OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study, Extreme Prematurity and Pulmonary Outcomes Program in Saitama, is to develop the diagnostic criteria for BPD and to determine the prognostic factors contributing to the long-term pulmonary outcomes manifesting in extremely preterm infants., METHODS: The Extreme Prematurity and Pulmonary Outcomes Program in Saitama is an observational prospective cohort study performed by a consortium of six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Saitama, Japan. The subjects included in this study are infants (from each clinical center) with gestational ages 22 to 27 weeks. The target is 400 subjects. This study aims to determine the definition of BPD and other perinatal factors that accurately predict the long-term pulmonary outcomes in survivors of extreme prematurity. Moreover, the association between BPD and postprematurity respiratory disease will be investigated using generalized linear models., RESULTS: The protocol and consent forms were evaluated and approved on September 5, 2019, by the Ethics Committee of Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University. Enrollment began on April 1, 2020. It is expected to end on March 31, 2023. The follow-up for 1 year corrected age is expected to continue through the middle of 2024., CONCLUSIONS: The Extreme Prematurity and Pulmonary Outcomes Program in Saitama incorporates aspects of neonatal care in secondary- and tertiary-level NICUs to develop existing research studies on the definition of BPD, objective biomarkers, and outcome measures of respiratory morbidity in extremely preterm infants beyond NICU hospitalization, thereby leading to a novel understanding of the nature and natural history of BPD and potential mechanistic and therapeutic targets in at-risk subjects., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/22948.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperoxia in pre-term neonates is a known risk factor of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyperoxia is known to cause oxidative stress, inflammatory changes that leads to surfactant deactivation, and decreased surfactant expression. The previous research has shown short term exposure to hyperoxia increases surfactant protein expression but decreased expression in long term exposure. Local tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is associated with tissue injury and repair and it may play a role in BPD. Endogenous peptide angiotensin 1-7 acts on the MAS receptor. The activation of the MAS receptor was previously shown to have protective pulmonary responses. However, the effect of MAS receptor activation on surfactant proteins in hyperoxic conditions has not been tested., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of hyperoxia with or without MAS receptor activation on Surfactant proteins., METHODS: Human epithelial cell line A549 and human primary alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) were cultured to sub-confluence (60-75%) and treated with hyperoxia (95% oxygen) and normoxia (21% oxygen) for 72 hours with or without the MAS receptor agonist (AVE0991) in serum-free F-12 nutrient media. Cells were lysed and cell lysates were collected for western blot. The statistical analysis was done using Student-Newman-Keuls Multiple comparison test., RESULTS: Surfactant protein concentration increased in AVE treated group under the hyperoxic condition when compared to the control group in both A549 cells and human primary AECs. Surfactant protein was in higher concentration in AVE0991 treated cells in both hyperoxic and normoxic conditions when compared to the non-treated control group., CONCLUSIONS: MAS receptor activation via AVE0991 causes an increase in Surfactant protein concentration in both hyperoxic and normoxic conditions. As per our experiments, hyperoxic conditions decrease the production of surfactant protein when compared to normoxic conditions. These results may reveal a novel potential drug for BPD treatment and decrease its severity.

AB  - This work is focused on the potential use of pulmonary surfactant to deliver full-length recombinant human surfactant protein SP-D (rhSP-D) using the respiratory air-liquid interface as a shuttle. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a collectin protein present in the pulmonary surfactant (PS) system, involved in innate immune defense and surfactant homeostasis. It has been recently suggested as a potential therapeutic to alleviate inflammatory responses and lung diseases in preterm infants suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, none of the current clinical surfactants used for surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) to treat RDS contain SP-D. The interaction of SP-D with surfactant components, the potential of PS as a respiratory drug delivery system and the possibility to produce recombinant versions of human SP-D, brings the possibility of delivering clinical surfactants supplemented with SP-D. Here, we used an in vitro setup that somehow emulates the respiratory air-liquid interface to explore this novel approach. It consists in two different compartments connected with a hydrated paper bridge forming a continuous interface. We firstly analyzed the adsorption and spreading of rhSP-D alone from one compartment to another over the air-liquid interface, observing low interfacial activity. Then, we studied the interfacial spreading of the protein co-administered with PS, both at different time periods or as a mixed formulation, and which oligomeric forms of rhSP-D better traveled associated with PS. The results presented here demonstrated that PS may transport rhSP-D long distances over air-liquid interfaces, either as a mixed formulation or separately in a close window time, opening the doors to empower the current clinical surfactants and SRT.

AB  - Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is a divergent member of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and is ubiquitously expressed, under normal physiological conditions. GDF15 expression increases during many pathological states and serves a marker of cellular stress. GDF15 has multiple and even paradoxical roles within a pathological condition, as its effects can be dose- and time-dependent and vary based on the targeted tissues and downstream pathways. GDF15 has emerged as one of the most recognized proteins as part of the senescence associated secretory phenotype. Cellular senescence plays a major role in many lung diseases across the life-span from bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the premature neonate to COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in aged adults. GDF15 levels have been reported to be as a useful biomarker in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension and predict disease severity, decline in lung function and mortality. Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) in the brain stem has been identified as the only validated GDF15 receptor and mediates GDF15-mediated anorexia and wasting. The mechanisms and pathways by which GDF15 exerts its pulmonary effects are being elucidated. GDF15 may also have an impact on the lung based on the changes in circulating levels or through the central action of GDF15 activating peripheral metabolic changes. This review focuses on the role of GDF15 in different lung diseases across the lifespan and its role in cellular senescence. Copyright © 2020 Al-Mudares, Reddick, Ren, Venkatesh, Zhao and Lingappan.

AB  - Club cell secretory protein (CC16) is encoded by the SCGB1A1 gene. It is also known as CC10, secretoglobin, or uteroglobin. CC16 is a 16 kDa homodimeric protein secreted primarily by the non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, which can be detected in the airways, circulation, sputum, nasal fluid, and urine. The biological activities of CC16 and its pathways have not been completely understood, but many studies suggest that CC16 has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. The human CC16 gene is located on chromosome 11, p12-q13, where several regulatory genes of allergy and inflammation exist. Studies reveal that factors such as gender, age, obesity, renal function, diurnal variation, and exercise regulate CC16 levels in circulation. Current findings indicate CC16 not only may reflect the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, but also could serve as a potential biomarker in several lung diseases and a promising treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this review, we summarize our current understanding of CC16 in pulmonary diseases.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be derived from various tissue sources, such as the bone marrow (BMSCs), adipose tissue (ADSCs), umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and umbilical cord blood (UCB-MSCs). Clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the potential of MSCs in ameliorating neonatal diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In preclinical studies, MSC therapy has been tested for the treatment of various neonatal diseases affecting the heart, eye, gut, and brain as well as sepsis. Up to date, the number of clinical trials using MSCs to treat neonatal diseases is still limited. The data reported thus far positioned MSC therapy as safe with positive outcomes. However, most of these trials are still preliminary and generally smaller in scale. Larger trials with more appropriate controls and a longer follow-up period need to be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the therapy more conclusively. This review discusses the current application of MSCs in treating neonatal diseases, its mechanism of action and future direction of this novel therapy, including the potential of using MSC-derived extracellular vesicles instead of the cells to treat various clinical conditions in the newborn.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of pre-term birth with long lasting sequelae. Since its first description more than 50 years ago, many large randomized controlled trials have been conducted, aiming to improve evidence-based knowledge on the optimal strategies to prevent and treat BPD. However, most of these intervention studies have been performed on a population level without regard for the variation in clinical and biological diversity (e.g., gestational age, ethnicity, gender, or disease progression) between patients that is driven by the complex interaction of genetic pre-disposition and environmental exposures. Nevertheless, clinicians provide daily care such as lung protective interventions on an individual basis every day despite the fact that research supporting individualized or precision medicine for monitoring or treating pre-term lungs is immature. This narrative review summarizes four potential developments in pulmonary research that might facilitate the process of individualizing lung protective interventions to prevent development of BPD. Electrical impedance tomography and electromyography of the diaphragm are bedside monitoring tools to assess regional changes in lung volume and ventilation and spontaneous breathing effort, respectively. These non-invasive tools allow a more individualized optimization of invasive and non-invasive respiratory support. Investigation of the genomic variation in caffeine metabolism in pre-term infants can be used to optimize and individualize caffeine dosing regimens. Finally, volatile organic compound analysis in exhaled breath might accurately predict BPD at an early stage of the disease, enabling clinicians to initiate preventive strategies for BPD on an individual basis. Before these suggested diagnostic or monitoring tools can be implemented in daily practice and improve individualized patient care, future research should address and overcome their technical difficulties, perform extensive external validation and show their additional value in preventing BPD.

AB  - Majority of extremely preterm infants require positive pressure ventilatory support at the time of delivery or during the transitional period. Most of these infants present with respiratory distress (RD) and continue to require significant respiratory support in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains as one of the major morbidities among survivors of the extremely preterm infants. BPD is associated with long-term adverse pulmonary and neurological outcomes. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and supplemental oxygen are two major risk factors for the development of BPD. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown to decrease the need for IMV and reduce the risk of BPD when compared to IMV. This article reviews respiratory management with current NIV support strategies in extremely preterm infants both in delivery room as well as in the NICU and discusses the evidence to support commonly used NIV modes including nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), bi-level positive pressure (BI-PAP), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and newer NIV strategies currently being studied including, nasal high frequency ventilation (NHFV) and non-invasive neutrally adjusted ventilatory assist (NIV-NAVA). Randomized, clinical trials have shown that early NIPPV is superior to NCPAP to decrease the need for intubation and IMV in preterm infants with RD. It is also important to understand that selection of the device used to deliver NIPPV has a significant impact on its success. Ventilator generated NIPPV results in significantly lower rates of extubation failures when compared to Bi-PAP. Future studies should address synchronized NIPPV including NIV-NAVA and early rescue use of NHFV in the respiratory management of extremely preterm infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended periods of hypocarbia in preterm infants may be associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To evaluate the current anesthetic practice in preterm neonates, we retrospectively reviewed the intraoperative course with regard to [Formula: see text] and ventilation during non-cardiac surgical procedures in infants <60 weeks postmenstrual age., METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study during non-cardiac surgical procedures in neonates. Hyperventilation was defined as a [Formula: see text] <= 35 mm Hg, significant hyperventilation as a [Formula: see text] <= 30 mm Hg, and extreme hyperventilation as a [Formula: see text] <= 25 mm Hg., RESULTS: The study cohort included 112 neonates, with a median postnatal age of 40 weeks, median gestational age of 38 weeks, and median weight of 5 kg. Thirty-seven subjects (33%) had at least one arterial blood gas value that demonstrated hyperventilation. Thirteen (12%) were noted to have significant hyperventilation ([Formula: see text] <= 30 mm Hg) and 2 had extreme hyperventilation ([Formula: see text] <= 25 mm Hg)., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of at least one arterial blood gas that demonstrated inadvertent hyperventilation in neonates was high during intraoperative care. These data may provide the baseline for future studies that address more rigorous monitoring and control of [Formula: see text] during intraoperative care. Although the duration of the anesthetic care and surgical procedure is brief compared with the neonatal ICU length of stay because there is no demonstrated benefit of hypocapnia and, in fact, well-documented harm associated with hyperventilation in neonates, care should be directed at limiting inadvertent hyperventilation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the leading cause of chronic lung disease in preterm neonates. Extracellular matrix (ECM) abnormalities reshape lung development, contributing to BPD progression. In the present study, we first discovered that the ECM component fibronectin was reduced in the pulmonary tissues of model mice with BPD induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hyper-oxygen. Meanwhile, interleukin-33 (IL-33) and other inflammatory cytokines were elevated in BPD lung tissues. LPS stimulated the production of IL-33 in alveolar epithelial cells via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), protein 38 (p38), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) protein 65 (p65). Following the knockout of either IL-33 or its receptor suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) in mice, BPD disease severity was improved, accompanied by elevated fibronectin. ST2 neutralization antibody also relieved BPD progression and restored the expression of fibronectin. IL-33 induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which degraded fibronectin in alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, DNase-mediated degradation of NETs was protective against BPD. Finally, a fibronectin inhibitor directly decreased fibronectin and caused BPD-like disease in the mouse model. Our findings may shed light on the roles of IL-33-induced NETs and reduced fibronectin in the pathogenesis of BPD. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the interplay between neutrophil heterogeneity in neonates in health and disease states. Olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4) marks a subset of neutrophils that have been described in adults and pediatric patients but not neonates, and this subset is thought to play a role in modulating the host inflammatory response., METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of neonates who were born between June 2020 and December 2021 at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center NICU. Olfactomedin-4-positive (OLFM4+) neutrophils were identified in the peripheral blood using flow cytometry., RESULTS: OLFM4+ neutrophil percentage was not correlated with gestational age or developmental age. Neonates with sepsis had a higher percentage than those without the condition, 66.9% (IQR 24.3-76.9%) versus 21.5% (IQR 10.6-34.7%), respectively, p = 0.0003. At birth, a high percentage of OLFM4+ neutrophils was associated with severe chorioamnionitis at 49.1% (IQR 28.2-61.5%) compared to those without it at 13.7% (IQR 7.7-26.3%), p < 0.0001. Among neonates without sepsis, the percentages of OLFM4+ neutrophils were lower in the BPD/early death group compared to those without BPD, 11.8% (IQR 6.3-29.0%) versus 32.5% (IQR 18.5-46.1%), p = 0.003, and this retained significance in a multiple logistic regression model that included gestational age, birthweight, and race., CONCLUSION: This is the first study describing OLFM4+ neutrophils in neonates and it shows that this neutrophil subpopulation is not influenced by gestational age but is elevated in inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and severe chorioamnionitis, and lower percentage at birth is associated with developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD] is the most common complication of extremely preterm delivery and its optimal management remains challenging because of a lack of evidence to guide management. There has been improvement in the management of evolving BPD in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The threshold for provision of home oxygen therapy, often occurring because of a preference for earlier discharge from the NICU, creates tensions for clincians and families. Once discharged in supplemental oxygen, the approaches for the weaning of this therapy vary considerably across the world. Regardless of guidelines and multidisciplinary team support, up to a third of families of an infant with BPD elect to withdraw home oxygen therapy independently of medical advice. There is a pressing need to derive evidence to better inform practice, generate international consensus and undertake large, appropriately funded, longitudinal studies of BPD with clinically meaningful outcomes (respiratory, cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental) from infancy to adulthood.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) still represents an important burden of neonatal care. The definition of the disease is currently undergoing several revisions, and, to date, BPD is actually defined by its treatment rather than diagnostic or clinic criteria. BPD is associated with many prenatal and postnatal risk factors, such as maternal smoking, chorioamnionitis, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), parenteral nutrition, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation. Various experimental models have shown how these factors cause distorted alveolar and vascular growth, as well as alterations in the composition and differentiation of the mesenchymal cells of a newborn's lungs, demonstrating a multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, inflammation and oxidative stress are the common denominators of the mechanisms that contribute to BPD development. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) constitutes the most prominent and best studied candidate for vascular development. Animal models have confirmed the important regulatory roles of epithelial-expressed VEGF in lung development and function. This educational review aims to discuss the inflammatory pathways in BPD onset for preterm newborns, focusing on the role of VEGFA and providing a summary of current and emerging evidence.

AB  - More and more very low birth weight (VLBW) infants around the world survive nowadays, with consequently larger numbers of children developing prematurity-related morbidities, especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is a multifactorial disease and its rising incidence in recent years means that general pediatricians are much more likely to encounter a child born extremely preterm, possibly with BPD, in their clinical practice. Short- and long-term sequelae in VLBW patients may affect not only pulmonary function (principally characterized by an obstructive pattern), but also other aspect including the neurological (neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders), the sensorial (earing and visual impairment), the cardiological (systemic and pulmonary hypertension, reduced exercise tolerance and ischemic heart disease in adult age), nutritional (feeding difficulties and nutritional deficits), and auxological (extrauterine growth restriction). For the most premature infants at least, a multidisciplinary follow-up is warranted after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit in order to optimize their respiratory and neurocognitive potential, and prevent respiratory infections, nutritional deficiencies or cardiovascular impairments. Conclusion: The aim of this review is to summarize the main characteristics of preterm and BPD infants, providing the general pediatrician with practical information regarding these patients' multidisciplinary complex follow-up. We explore the current evidence on respiratory outcomes and their management that actually does not have a definitive available option. We also discuss the available investigations, treatments, and strategies for prevention and prophylaxis to improve the non-respiratory outcomes and the quality of life for these children and their families, a critical aspect not always considered. This comprehensive approach, added to the increased needs of a VLBW subjects, is obviously related to very high health-related costs that should be beared in mind. What is Known: * Every day, a general pediatrician is more likely to encounter a former very low birth weight infant. * Very low birth weight and prematurity are frequently related not only with worse respiratory outcomes, but also with neurological, sensorial, cardiovascular, renal, and nutritional issues. What is New: * This review provides to the general pediatrician a comprehensive approach for the follow-up of former premature very low birth weight children, with information to improve the quality of life of this special population.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells are multipotent adult cells that can be extracted from numerous tissues, including the lungs. Lung-resident MSCs (LR-MSCs) are localized to perivascular spaces where they act as important regulators of pulmonary homeostasis, mediating the balance between lung injury/damage and repair processes. LR-MSCs support the integrity of the lung tissue via modulation of the immune response and release of trophic factors. However, in the context of chronic lung diseases, the ability of LR-MSCs to maintain pulmonary homeostasis and facilitate repair is diminished. In this setting, LR-MSC can contribute to the pathogenesis of disease, through their altered secretory and immunomodulatory properties. In addition, they are capable of differentiating into myofibroblasts, thereby contributing to the fibrotic aspects of numerous lung diseases. For example, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a variety of factors can stimulate their differentiation into myofibroblasts including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Hedgehog (HH), and Wingless/integrated (Wnt) signaling. Here, we review the current literature on the characterization of LR-MSCs and describe their roles in pulmonary homeostasis/repair and in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease.

AB  - Prediction models could identify infants at the greatest risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and allow targeted preventative strategies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with external validation of identified models. Studies using predictors available before day 14 of life to predict BPD in very preterm infants were included. Two reviewers assessed 7628 studies for eligibility. Meta-analysis of externally validated models was followed by validation using 62,864 very preterm infants in England and Wales. A total of 64 studies using 53 prediction models were included totalling 274,407 infants (range 32-156,587/study). In all, 35 (55%) studies predated 2010; 39 (61%) were single-centre studies. A total of 97% of studies had a high risk of bias, especially in the analysis domain. Following meta-analysis of 22 BPD and 11 BPD/death composite externally validated models, Laughon's day one model was the most promising in predicting BPD and death (C-statistic 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.81) and good calibration). Six models were externally validated in our cohort with C-statistics between 0.70 and 0.90 but with poor calibration. Few BPD prediction models were developed with contemporary populations, underwent external validation, or had calibration and impact analyses. Contemporary, validated, and dynamic prediction models are needed for targeted preventative strategies. IMPACT: This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of all BPD prediction models developed to address the uncertainty of which model is sufficiently valid and generalisable for use in clinical practice and research. Published BPD prediction models are mostly outdated, single centre and lack external validation. Laughon's 2011 model is the most promising but more robust models, using contemporary data with external validation are needed to support better treatments. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of preterm delivery, with significant morbidity and mortality in a neonatal intensive care setting. Research in this field aims to identify the mechanisms of late lung development with possible therapeutic targets and the improvement of medical management. Rabbits represent a suitable lab preclinical tool for mimicking the clinical BPD phenotype. Rabbits are born at term in the alveolar phase as occurs in large animals and humans and in addition, they can be delivered prematurely in contrast to mice and rats. Continuous exposure to high oxygen concentration (95% O2) for 7 days induces functional and morphological lung changes in preterm rabbits that resemble those observed in BPD-affected babies. The preclinical research pays great attention to optimize the experimental procedures, reduce the number of animals used in experiments and, where possible, replace animal models with alternative assays, following the principle of the 3 Rs (Replace, Reduce and Refine). The use of in vitro assays based on the ex vivo culture of Precision Cut Lung Slices (PCLS) goes in this direction, representing a good compromise between controlled and flexible in vitro models and the more physiologically relevant in vivo ones. This work aims to set up morphological analyses to be applied in preclinical tests using preterm rabbits derived PCLS, cultured up to 7 days in different oxygen conditions, as a model. After a preliminary optimization of both lung preparation and histological processing methods of the lung slices of 300 microm, the morphological analysis was conducted evaluating a series of histomorphometric parameters derived from those widely used to follow the phases of lung development and its alterations in vivo. Our histomorphometric results demonstrated that the greatest differences from pseudo-normoxia and hyperoxia exposed samples at day 0, used as starting points to compare changes due to treatments and time, are detectable after 4 days of in vitro culture, representing the most suitable time point for analysis in preclinical screening. The combination of parameters suitable for evaluating PCLS morphology in vitro resulted to be Tissue Density and Septal Thickness. Shape Factor and Roughness, evaluated to highlight the increasing complexity of the airspaces, due to the formation of septal crests, gave useful information, however, without significant differences up to day 4. Other parameters like Mean Linear Intercept and Septal Density did not allow to highlight significant differences between different oxygen conditions and time points. Instead, Radial Alveolar Count, could not be applied to PCLS, due to the tissue changes following agar infusion and culture conditions. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the 1970s, when the initial reports of neonatal hypertension related to renal artery thromboembolism were published, other secondary causes of neonatal hypertension have been reported. Those infants with no identifiable cause of hypertension were labeled with a variety of terms. Herein, we describe such infants as having idiopathic neonatal hypertension (INH). Most, but not all, of these hypertensive infants were noted to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). More recently, reports described common clinical characteristics seen in INH patients, whether or not they had BPD. This phenotype includes low plasma renin activity, presentation near 40 weeks postmenstrual age, and a favorable response to treatment with spironolactone. A small prospective study in INH patents showed evidence of mineralocorticoid receptor activation due to inhibition of 11beta-HSD2, the enzyme that converts cortisol to the less potent mineralocorticoid-cortisone. Meanwhile, phthalate metabolites have been shown to inhibit 11beta-HSD2 in human microsomes. Premature infants can come in contact with exceptionally large phthalate exposures, especially those infants with BPD. This work describes a common low-renin phenotype, commonly seen in patients categorized as having INH. Further, we review the evidence that hypertension in INH patients with the low-renin phenotype may be mediated by phthalate-associated inhibition of 11beta-HSD2. Lastly, we review the implications of these findings regarding identification, treatment, and prevention of the low-renin hypertension phenotype seen in premature infants categorized as having INH.

AB  - Perinatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is defined as lung injury in preterm infants caused by various factors, resulting in serious respiratory dysfunction and high mortality. The administration of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) to treat/prevent BPD has proven to have certain therapeutic effects. However, MSCs can only weakly regulate macrophage function, which is strongly involved in the development of BPD. 7ND-MSCs are MSCs transfected with 7ND, a truncated version of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) that promotes macrophage activation, using a lentiviral vector. In the present study, we show in a BPD rat model that 7ND-MSC administration, but not MSCs alone, ameliorated the impaired alveolarization evaluated by volume density and surface area in the lung tissue, as well as pulmonary artery remodeling and pulmonary hypertension induced by BPD. In addition, 7ND-MSCs, but not MSCs alone, reduced M1 macrophages and the messenger RNA expressions of interleukin-6 and CCL2 in the lung tissue. Thus, the present study showed the treatment effect of 7ND-MSCs in a BPD rat model, which was more effective than that of MSCs alone. Copyright © 2020 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy.

AB  - Neonatal infections are responsible for 20% of neonatal deaths yearly. In this review, we focused on the origins of the commoner neonatal infections, and we define the role of obstetricians. Regarding group B Streptococcus, a key measure for the prevention of neonatal infection is the vaginal-rectal culture screening at term pregnancy. Intravenous penicillin is the first-line prophylaxis at the start of labor, with intravenous ampicillin as an alternative. First-generation cephalosporins or clindamycin are recommended in case of penicillin allergy. Concerning urinary tract infections (UTIs), guidelines recommend complete urinalysis and urine culture in the first trimester of pregnancy for the screening of asymptomatic bacteriuria. For lower UTIs, guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin as first-choice antibiotic. Amoxicillin or cefalexin are second-line antibiotics. For upper UTIs, guidelines recommend cephalexin per os as first line. Candida spp. colonization affects 20% of pregnant women; however, congenital fetal candidosis and Candida amnionitis are rare. First-line treatment in case of symptomatic vaginitis during pregnancy or asymptomatic colonization during the third trimester is vaginal clotrimazole. Fluconazole is not approved in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Genital mycoplasmas colonization during pregnancy is usually asymptomatic and associated with bacterial vaginosis. Colonization is related to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pneumonia, chorioamnionitis, and sepsis. Macrolides are the first-line treatment along with lactobacillus supplementation. In cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, and metronidazole are required to prevent intra-amniotic infection. Intra-amniotic infection affects 1 to 5% of deliveries at term and one-third of preterm ones and is associated with perinatal death, early-onset neonatal sepsis, RDS, BPD, pneumonia, meningitis, and prematurity-related diseases. Guidelines recommend a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin, and in case of caesarean section, an additional dose of clindamycin or metronidazole is required. In conclusion, obstetricians should be aware that the treatment of maternal infection during pregnancy can prevent potentially lethal infections in the newborn. KEY POINTS: . Part of neonatal infections starts from maternal infections that must be treated during pregnancy.. . Streptococcus group B and asymptomatic bacteriuria should be investigated in pregnancy and treated.. . Mycoplasma and ureaplasma vaginal colonization during pregnancy is related to negative neonatal outcomes.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and poor neurodevelopmental outcome after preterm birth are closely associated. However, mechanistic links are uncertain. We are exploring the hypothesis that decreased circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 after preterm birth due to the abrupt end of supply by the placenta impairs growth during critical windows of development in most organs, including the lung and brain. Throughout gestation, the fetus uses glycolysis as its main source of energy. Metabolism is mainly stopped at pyruvate, which serves as a "metabolic crossroad", allowing for the production of amino acids and other "building blocks" for new cells. Metabolic pathways are differentially regulated in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The ratio between pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) determines the biochemical activity which irreversibly metabolizes pyruvate to acetyl-co-A. Metabolites in the nucleus modulate epigenetic remodeling, an essential mechanism of normal growth and maturation during development. IGF-1 has been shown to contribute significantly to the development of virtually all organs, especially related to the regulation of microvascular growth, based on extensive studies of the brain, retina, lung, and intestine. With a preterm birth, the abrupt withdrawal of the placental supply of IGF-1 and its local production directly affects metabolism and microvascular development, which may contribute to a high risk for organ maldevelopment and injury after birth. We speculate that reduced bioavailability of IGF-1 is a possible link between lung and brain development disruption and increases susceptibility for major pulmonary and neurocognitive morbidities in preterm babies. KEY POINTS: . Metabolic changes inherent to prterm birth may cause epigenetic changes which cause "dysmaturational" development.. . IGF-1 may be the potential link between BPD and brain development.. . The ratio between pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase determines the biochemical activity..

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update on the current understanding of the role of wingless/integrase-1 (Wnt) signaling in pediatric allergic asthma and other pediatric lung diseases., RECENT FINDINGS: The Wnt signaling pathway is critical for normal lung development. Genetic and epigenetic human studies indicate a link between Wnt signaling and the development and severity of asthma in children. Mechanistic studies using animal models of allergic asthma demonstrate a key role for Wnt signaling in allergic airway inflammation and remodeling. More recently, data on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis points to the Wnt signaling pathway as an important regulator., SUMMARY: Current data indicates that the Wnt signaling pathway is an important mediator in allergic asthma and BPD pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to characterize the roles of individual Wnt signals in childhood disease, and to identify potential novel therapeutic targets to slow or prevent disease processes.

AB  - Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are proteins that are involved in signaling through the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor (IGFR). They can also interact with other receptors including growth factor receptors. Thus, they represent a critical node for the transduction and regulation of multiple signaling pathways in response to extracellular stimuli. In addition, IRSs play a central role in processes such as inflammation, growth, metabolism, and proliferation. Previous studies have highlighted the role of IRS proteins in lung diseases, in particular asthma. Further, the members of the IRS family are the common proteins of the insulin growth factor signaling cascade involved in lung development and disrupted in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, there is no study focusing on the relationship between IRS proteins and BPD yet. Unfortunately, there is still a significant gap in knowledge in this field. Thus, in this review, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge with the major goal of exploring the possible roles of IRS in BPD and asthma to foster new perspectives for further investigations.

AB  - Premature infants commonly receive adult packed red blood cells (pRBCs) during their hospital stay. As adult erythrocytes differ substantially from those of preterm infants, transfusion of adult pRBCs into preterm infants can be considered inappropriate for the physiology of a preterm infant. An absence of standardisation of transfusion protocols makes it difficult to compare and interpret pertinent clinical data, as reflected by unclear associations between pRBC transfusion and complications related to prematurity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurodevelopmental impairment, retinopathy of prematurity, or necrotising enterocolitis. The difficulty in interpreting clinical data is further increased by differences in study designs that either overestimate pRBC-associated complications of prematurity or have not yet been designed to directly link pRBC transfusions to their respective complications. Thus, neonatal transfusion practice has become an ongoing difficulty, in which differences in transfusion guidelines hinder the ability to generate comparable clinical data, and heterogeneity in clinical data prevents the implementation of standardised transfusion protocols. To overcome these issues, novel approaches with biochemical-clinical translational designs could enable clinicians to gather causal evidence instead of circumstantial correlation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neonatal hypertension is increasingly recognized as improvements in neonatal intensive care have led to increased survival of premature infants. Among infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the rates of hypertension are much higher than the general neonatal population. However, the etiology and pathophysiology of this increased risk of hypertension in neonates with lung disease remain unclear., RECENT FINDINGS: Among infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the rates of hypertension are much higher than the general neonatal population. New studies suggest outcomes in neonates with BPD with hypertension are usually good, with resolution of hypertension in most infants with lung disease. Several potential mechanisms of hypertension in this patient population have been recently proposed. This review focuses on the recent epidemiologic data on prevalence of hypertension in neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, reviews the typical clinical course, and discusses available strategies for management of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia that develop hypertension.

AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a cytoplasmic transcription factor that is well-known for regulating xenobiotic metabolism. Studies in knockout and transgenic mice indicate that the AHR plays a vital role in the development of liver and regulation of reproductive, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, and immune homeostasis. In this focused review on lung diseases associated with acute injury and alveolar development, we reviewed and summarized the current literature on the mechanistic role(s) and therapeutic potential of the AHR in acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pre-clinical studies indicate that endogenous AHR activation is necessary to protect neonatal and adult lungs against hyperoxia- and cigarette smoke-induced injury. Our goal is to provide insight into the high translational potential of the AHR in the meaningful management of infants and adults with these lung disorders that lack curative therapies.

AB  - Alveologenesis requires the coordinated modulation of the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments to generate mature alveolar saccules for efficient gas exchange. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction during alveologenesis are poorly understood. Here, we report that Wnts produced by epithelial cells are crucial for neonatal alveologenesis. Deletion of the Wnt chaperone protein Wntless homolog (Wls) disrupts alveolar formation, resulting in enlarged saccules in Sftpc-Cre/Nkx2.1-Cre; Wlsloxp/loxp mutants. Although commitment of the alveolar epithelium is unaffected, alpha-SMA+ mesenchymal cells persist in the alveoli, accompanied by increased collagen deposition, and mutants exhibit exacerbated fibrosis following bleomycin challenge. Notably, alpha-SMA+ cells include a significant number of endothelial cells resembling endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which is also present in Ager-CreER; Wlsloxp/loxp mutants following early postnatal Wls deletion. These findings provide initial evidence that epithelial-derived Wnts are crucial for the differentiation of the surrounding mesenchyme during early postnatal alveologenesis. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - Intraperitoneal adhesions complicate over half of abdominal-pelvic surgeries with immediate, short, and long-term sequelae of major healthcare concern. The pathogenesis of adhesion development is similar to the pathogenesis of wound healing in all tissues, which if unchecked result in production of fibrotic conditions. Given the similarities, we explore the published literature to highlight the similarities in the pathogenesis of intra-abdominal adhesion development (IPAD) and other fibrotic diseases such as keloids, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and pulmonary, intraperitoneal, and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Following a literature search using PubMed database for all relevant English language articles up to November 2020, we reviewed relevant articles addressing the genetic and epidemiological similarities and differences in the pathogenesis and pathobiology of fibrotic diseases. We found genetic and epidemiological similarities and differences between the pathobiology of postoperative IPAD and other diseases that involve altered fibroblast-derived cells. We also found several genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms that are up- or downregulated and whose products directly or indirectly increase the propensity for postoperative adhesion development and other fibrotic diseases. An understanding of the similarities in pathophysiology of adhesion development and other fibrotic diseases contributes to a greater understanding of IPAD and these disease processes. At a very fundamental level, blocking changes in the expression or function of genes necessary for the transformation of normal to altered fibroblasts may curtail adhesion formation and other fibrotic disease since this is a prerequisite for their development. Similarly, applying measures to induce apoptosis of altered fibroblast may do the same; however, apoptosis should be at a desired level to simultaneously ameliorate development of fibrotic diseases while allowing for normal healing. Scientists may use such information to develop pharmacologic interventions for those most at risk for developing these fibrotic conditions. Copyright © 2021. Society for Reproductive Investigation.

AB  - Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) is an important thiol transferase that catalyses the deglutathionylation of proteins through its active site. Deletion of Grx1 increases levels of glutathione-protein adducts and improves ischaemic revascularization. In this study, we investigated whether the absence of Grx1 ameliorates pathological changes in blood vessels and alveoli in a mouse model exposed to hyperoxic conditions. High oxygen exposure for three consecutive weeks increased the levels of Grx1 in the lungs of hyperoxic mice from control levels, while Grx1 levels in Grx1 knockout (KO) mice were significantly reduced under high oxygen conditions. Exposure to 85% oxygen for 21 days reduced alveolarization in wild-type (WT) mice but increased the numbers of alveoli and the survival rate of Grx1 KO littermates. Importantly, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expressions were increased in Grx1 KO mice after hyperoxia treatment, and these effects were probably attributable to increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression. On the other hand, in response to nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibition by Grx1 ablation, chemokine and caspase-3 levels were reduced, although the Bcl-2:Bax ratio was increased. Here, we provide evidence that Grx1 plays an important role in regulating pathological damage under hyperoxic conditions by promoting HIF-1alpha stability and inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway in vivo. Our study highlights the functional importance of the Grx1/protein S-glutathionylation (PSSG) redox module in the regulation of ischaemic revascularization, indicating potential clinical and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) can be endogenously formed in the presence of oxidative stress and may be elevated in inflammatory lung disease. There is lack of evidence of its relationship with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants. The objective of the study is to evaluate the relationship between blood CO-Hb levels in the first 14 days of life (DOL) in ELBW infants and the development of BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). This is a retrospective cohort study of 58 ELBW infants born at LAC-USC Medical Center between June 2015 and and June 2019 who survived to 36 weeks PMA. CO-Hb values were collected daily from DOL 1 to DOL 14. BPD definition using the recent 2019 NICHD criteria was used. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the association between blood CO-Hb levels and BPD. Receiver operator curve was used to evaluate the ability of the median fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) level used at DOL 11-14 in discriminating absent to mild BPD versus moderate to severe BPD. 58 ELBW infants were included in the study. 24 (41%) were diagnosed with moderate to severe BPD, while 34 (59%) were diagnosed with no to mild BPD. Severity of BPD was fairly discriminated by FiO2 at DOL 11-14, but not with CO-Hb levels at any point within the first 14 DOL. The role and mechanism of CO-Hb production in this population need to be further studied. Copyright © American Federation for Medical Research 2022. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

AB  - We describe the prevalence of Pneumocystis jirovecii in mother-infant pairs of very low birth weight newborns <32 weeks gestation. Molecular and microscopic methods were used for detection of P. jirovecii in patients' specimens. Pneumocystis DNA was detected in 8 nasopharyngeal aspirates (14%) of 56 newborns and in 7 oral washes (21%) of 34 mothers. Pneumocystis detection immediately after birth suggests the possibility of its transplacental transmission. Compared to noncolonized infants, more frequent occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was seen in colonized infants (P = .02), suggesting a potential clinical importance of this pathogen in abnormal lung development.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension has emerged as a life-threatening disease in preterm infants suffering from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Its development is closely linked to respiratory disease, as vasculogenesis and alveologenesis are closely interconnected. Once clinically significant, BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) can be challenging to manage, due to poor reversibility and multiple comorbidities frequently associated. The pulmonary vascular disease process underlying BPD-PH is the result of multiple innate and acquired factors, and emerging evidence suggests that it progressively develops since birth and, in certain instances, may begin as early as fetal life. Therefore, early recognition and intervention are of great importance in order to improve long-term outcomes. Based on the most recent knowledge of BPD-PH pathophysiology, we review state-of-the-art screening and diagnostic imaging techniques currently available, their utility for clinicians, and their applicability and limitations in this specific population. We also discuss some biochemical markers studied in humans as a possible complement to imaging for the detection of pulmonary vascular disease at its early stages and the monitoring of its progression. In the second part, we review pharmacological agents currently available for BPD-PH treatment or under preclinical investigation, and discuss their applicability, as well as possible approaches for early-stage interventions in fetuses and neonates. IMPACT: BPD-associated PH is a complex disease involving genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as environmental exposures starting from fetal life. The value of combining multiple imaging and biochemical biomarkers is emerging, but requires larger, multicenter studies for validation and diffusion. Since "single-bullet" approaches have proven elusive so far, combined pharmacological regimen and cell-based therapies may represent important avenues for research leading to future cure and prevention.

AB  - Preeclampsia is a devastating medical complication of pregnancy that can lead to significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. It is currently believed that there is abnormal placentation in as early as the first trimester in women destined to develop preeclampsia. Although the etiology of the abnormal placentation is being debated, numerous epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that imbalances in circulating angiogenic factors released from the placenta are responsible for the maternal signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. In particular, circulating levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, an antiangiogenic factor, are markedly increased in women with preeclampsia, whereas free levels of its ligand, placental, growth factor are markedly diminished. Alterations in these angiogenic factors precede the onset of clinical signs of preeclampsia and correlate with disease severity. Recently, the availability of automated assays for the measurement of angiogenic biomarkers in the plasma, serum, and urine has helped investigators worldwide to demonstrate a key role for these factors in the clinical diagnosis and prediction of preeclampsia. Numerous studies have reported that circulating angiogenic biomarkers have a very high negative predictive value to rule out clinical disease among women with suspected preeclampsia. These blood-based biomarkers have provided a valuable tool to clinicians to accelerate the time to clinical diagnosis and minimize maternal adverse outcomes in women with preeclampsia. Angiogenic biomarkers have also been useful to elucidate the pathogenesis of related disorders of abnormal placentation such as intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine fetal death, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and fetal hydrops. In summary, the discovery and characterization of angiogenic proteins of placental origin have provided clinicians a noninvasive blood-based tool to monitor placental function and health and for early detection of disorders of placentation. Uncovering the mechanisms of altered angiogenic factors in preeclampsia and related disorders of placentation may provide insights into novel preventive and therapeutic options.

AB  - Nutritional supplementations are a form of nutrition sources that may help in improving the health complexities of a person throughout his or her life span. Being also categorized as food supplementations, nutraceuticals are products that are extracted from edible sources with medical benefits as well as primary nutritional values. Nutraceuticals can be considered as functional foods. There are evidences that nutraceutical supplementations can alter the commensal gut microbiota and help to prevent or fight against chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases in adults, including neurological disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD], Parkinson's disease [PD], Multiple sclerosis [MS]) and metabolic disorders (Type-II diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). They can even lessen the complexities of preterm babies like extra-uterine growth restriction, necrotizing enterocolitis, infant eczema and allergy (during pregnancy) as well as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Molecular perception of inflammatory and apoptotic modulators regulating the pathogenesis of these health risks, their control and management by probiotics and prebiotics could further emphasize the scientific overview of their utility. In this study, the pivotal role of nutraceutical supplementations in regulating or modulating molecular pathways in the above non-communicable diseases is briefly described. This work also gives an overall introduction of the sophisticated genome-editing techniques and advanced delivery systems in therapeutic activities applicable under these health risks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs) regulate both vasculogenesis, the development of blood vessels from precursor cells, and angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from preexisting vessels. In the fetal lung, high-affinity receptors for VEGF are expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and myocytes, suggesting a paracrine role for VEGF in modulating activities in adjacent vascular endothelium. Previous studies have shown that vascular growth is impaired in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine tracheal (T-VEGF) and gastric (G-VEGF) levels in premature infants in the first and third day of life and examine if these levels were associated with the development of BPD., DESIGN/METHODS: Tracheal aspirates from intubated infants and gastric samples from others were obtained on postnatal days 1 (D1) and 3 (D3) from 43 preterm infants (<2000 g birth weight, <=34 wks gestation). VEGF was quantified by a VEGF Elisa Kit. Demographic, clinical, and pulmonary outcome data were collected including information on respiratory support (oxygenation index (OI) and ventilatory index (VI)) and on the development of BPD, determined at 36 weeks PMA using NICHD criteria., RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 1060 +/- 379 g and gestational age 27.5 +/- 2.8 wks. BPD was diagnosed in 26 infants who were less mature than the 17 controls without BPD. Day 1 and day 3T-VEGF concentrations did not correlate, but day 3 levels correlated with gestational age (r = 0.75, p < .05). BPD infants, characterized by longer ventilator, CPAP and oxygen days, had day 1T-VEGF levels similar to control infants (126.6 +/- 194.7 vs. 149.7 +/- 333.2 pg/ml) but day 3 levels were significantly lower (168.9 +/- 218.8 vs. 1041.6 +/- 676.7 pg/ml). Day 1G-VEGF levels reflected tracheal samples, trending lower in BPD infants. Mode of delivery, race, sex, antenatal steroid administration, chorioamnionitis, sepsis, or growth restriction did not impact VEGF levels. However, lower VEGF levels were associated with a lower VI and lower OI: Day 3 OI correlated with day 3T-VEGF (r = 0.72, p > .05), albeit not significantly. T-VEGF increased from day 1 to day 3 in controls and decreased in BPD infants. There was no relationship between oxygen, CPAP and ventilator days and day 1 or day 3T-VEGF levels., CONCLUSIONS: BPD may be associated with low-serum VEGF levels during the first week of life. This finding is likely related to decreased expression in the lungs of the less mature infants, who are at the highest risk for BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and inflammation play a critical role in the etiopathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive effect of Chrysin (CH), an antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiapoptotic and antifibrotic drug, on hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a neonatal rat model., METHODS: Forty infant rats were divided into four groups labeled the Control, CH, BPD, and BPD + CH. The control and CH groups were kept in a normal room environment, while the BPD and BPD + CH groups were kept in a hyperoxic (90-95%) environment. At the end of the study, lung tissue was evaluated with respect to apoptosis, histopathological damage and alveolar macrophage score as well as oxidant capacity, antioxidant capacity, and inflammation., RESULTS: Compared to the BPD + CH and control groups, the lung tissues of the BPD group displayed substantially higher levels of MDA, TOS, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta (p < 0.05). While the BPD + CH group showed similar levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta as the control group, MDA and TOS levels were higher than the control group, and significantly lower than the BPD group (p < 0.05). The BPD group exhibited considerably lower levels of TAS, SOD, GSH, and GSH-Px in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05). The BPD and BPD + CH groups exhibited higher mean scores of histopathological damage and alveolar macrophage when compared to the control and CH groups (p <= 0.0001). Both scores were found to be lower in the BPD + CH group in comparison to the BPD group (p <= 0.0001). The BPD + CH group demonstrated a significantly lower average of TUNEL and caspase-3 positive cells than the BPD group., CONCLUSION: We found that prophylaxis with CH results in lower histopathological damage score and reduces apoptotic cell count, inflammation and oxidative stress while increasing anti-oxidant capacity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Almost half of all school-age children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have asthma-like symptoms and more suffer from lung function deficits. While air pollution and indoor respiratory irritants are known to affect high-risk populations of children, few studies have objectively evaluated environmental contributions to long-term respiratory morbidity in this population. This study aimed to examine the role of indoor environmental exposures on respiratory morbidity in children with BPD., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Air quality, Environment and Respiratory Ouctomes in BPD (AERO-BPD) study is a prospective, single-centre observational study that will enrol a unique cohort of 240 children with BPD and carefully characterise participants and their indoor home environmental exposures. Measures of indoor air quality constituents will assess the relationship of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), nitric oxide (NO), temperature and humidity, as well as dust concentrations of allergens, with concurrently measured respiratory symptoms and lung function.Adaptations to the research protocol due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic included remote home environment and participant assessments., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Study protocol was approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Committee on Clinical Investigation. Dissemination will be in the form of peer-reviewed publications and participant information products., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04107701. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - Due to heightened awareness and advanced genetic tools, inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are increasingly recognized in children. However, diagnosing of IEI in premature infants is challenging and, subsequently, reports of IEI in premature infants remain rare. This review focuses on how common disorders of prematurity, such as sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, can clinically overlap with presenting signs of IEI. We present four recent cases from a single neonatal intensive care unit that highlight diagnostic dilemmas facing neonatologists and clinical immunologists when considering IEI in preterm infants. Finally, we present a conceptual framework for when to consider IEI in premature infants and a guide to initial workup of premature infants suspected of having IEI.

AB  - Premature infants are exposed to increased generation of reactive oxygen species, and on the other hand, they have a deficient antioxidant defense system. Oxidative insult is a salient part of lung injury that begins as acute inflammatory injury in respiratory distress disease and then evolves into chronic and structural scarring leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oxidative stress is also involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension in newborns through the modulation of the vascular tone and the response to pulmonary vasodilators, with consequent decrease in the density of the pulmonary vessels and thickening of the pulmonary arteriolar walls. Oxidative stress has been recognized as both a trigger and an endpoint for several events, including inflammation, hypoxia, hyperoxia, drugs, transfusions, and mechanical ventilation, with impairment of pulmonary function and prolonged lung damage. Redoxomics is the most fascinating new measure to address lung damage due to oxidative stress. The new challenge is to use omics data to discover a set of biomarkers useful in diagnosis, prognosis, and formulating optimal and individualized neonatal care. The aim of this review was to examine the most recent evidence on the relationship between oxidative stress and lung diseases in preterm newborns. What is currently known regarding oxidative stress-related lung injury pathogenesis and the available preventive and therapeutic strategies are also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia continues to cause important respiratory morbidity throughout life, and new therapies are needed. The common denominator of all BPD cases is preterm birth, however most preclinical research in this area focusses on the effect of hyperoxia or mechanical ventilation. In this study we investigated if and how prematurity affects lung structure and function in neonatal rabbits., METHODS: Pups were delivered on either day 28 or day 31. For each gestational age a group of pups was harvested immediately after birth for lung morphometry and surfactant protein B and C quantification. All other pups were hand raised and harvested on day 4 for the term pups and day 7 for the preterm pups (same corrected age) for lung morphometry, lung function testing and qPCR. A subset of pups underwent microCT and dark field imaging on day 0, 2 and 4 for terms and on day 0, 3, 5 and 7 for preterms., RESULTS: Preterm pups assessed at birth depicted a more rudimentary lung structure (larger alveoli and thicker septations) and a lower expression of surfactant proteins in comparison to term pups. MicroCT and dark field imaging revealed delayed lung aeration in preterm pups, in comparison to term pups. Preterm birth led to smaller pups, with smaller lungs with a lower alveolar surface area on day 7/day 4. Furthermore, preterm birth affected lung function with increased tissue damping, tissue elastance and resistance and decreased dynamic compliance. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) was significantly decreased in preterm pups, however in the absence of structural vascular differences., CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth affects lung structure and function at birth, but also has persistent effects on the developing lung. This supports the use of a preterm animal model, such as the preterm rabbit, for preclinical research on BPD. Future research that focuses on the identification of pathways that are involved in in-utero lung development and disrupted by pre-term birth, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for BPD.

AB  - The simplification of alveoli leads to various lung pathologies such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema. Deep insight into the process of emergence of the secondary septa during development and regeneration after pneumonectomy, and into the contribution of the drivers of alveologenesis and neo-alveolarization is required in an efficient search for therapeutic approaches. In this review, we describe the formation of the gas exchange units of the lung as a multifactorial process, which includes changes in the actomyosin cytoskeleton of alveocytes and myofibroblasts, elastogenesis, retinoic acid signaling, and the contribution of alveolar mesenchymal cells in secondary septation. Knowledge of the mechanistic context of alveologenesis remains incomplete. The characterization of the mechanisms that govern the emergence and depletion of alphaSMA will allow for an understanding of how the niche of fibroblasts is changing. Taking into account the intense studies that have been performed on the pool of lung mesenchymal cells, we present data on the typing of interstitial fibroblasts and their role in the formation and maintenance of alveoli. On the whole, when identifying cell subpopulations in lung mesenchyme, one has to consider the developmental context, the changing cellular functions, and the lability of gene signatures.

AB  - Nasal or noninvaisve intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) refers to well-established noninvasive respiratory support strategies combining a continuous distending pressure with intermittent pressure increases. Uncertainty remains regarding the benefits provided by the various devices and techniques used to generate NIPPV. Our included meta-analyses of trials comparing NIPPV with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in preterm infants demonstrate that both primary and postextubation NIPPV are superior to CPAP to prevent respiratory failure leading to additional ventilatory support. This short-term benefit is associated with a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but not with mortality. Benefits are greatest when ventilator-generated, synchronized NIPPV is used.

AB  - In utero, the fetus and its lungs develop in a hypoxic environment, where HIF-1alpha and VEGFA signaling constitute major determinants of further development. Disruption of this homeostasis after preterm delivery and extrauterine exposure to high fractions of oxygen are among the key events leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production constitutes the initial driver of pulmonary inflammation and cell death, altered gene expression, and vasoconstriction, leading to the distortion of further lung development. From preclinical studies mainly performed on rodents over the past two decades, the deleterious effects of oxygen toxicity and the injurious insults and downstream cascades arising from ROS production are well recognized. This article provides a concise overview of disease drivers and different therapeutic approaches that have been successfully tested within experimental models. Despite current studies, clinical researchers are still faced with an unmet clinical need, and many of these strategies have not proven to be equally effective in clinical trials. In light of this challenge, adapting experimental models to the complexity of the clinical situation and pursuing new directions constitute appropriate actions to overcome this dilemma. Our review intends to stimulate research activities towards the understanding of an important issue of immature lung injury.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease in infants and is associated with increased mortality, respiratory morbidity, neurodevelopmental impairment, and increased healthcare costs. In parallel with advances made in the field of neonatal intensive care, the phenotype of BPD has evolved from a fibrocystic disease affecting late preterm infants to one of impaired parenchymal development and dysregulated vascular growth predominantly affecting infants born before 29 weeks' gestational age. BPD has been shown to have significant lifelong consequences. Adults with BPD have been found to have abnormal lung function tests, reduced exercise tolerance, and may be at increased risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence shows that BPD occurs secondary to genetic-environmental interactions in an immature lung. In this review, we evaluate the various clinical definitions, imaging modalities, and biomarker data that are helpful in making an early diagnosis of BPD. In addition, we evaluate recent evidence about the prevention and treatment of BPD. We discuss the invasive and non-invasive ventilation strategies and pharmacological agents used in the early, evolving, and established phases of BPD.

AB  - Lung transplantation may be considered as a final treatment option for diseases such as chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary fibrosis, and end-stage lung disease. The five-year survival rate of lung transplants is nearly 50%. Unfortunately, many patients will die before a suitable lung donor can be found. Importantly, the shortage of donor organs has been a significant problem in lung transplantation. The tissue engineering approach uses de- and recellularization of lung tissue to create functional lung substitutes to overcome donor lung limitations. Decellularization is hope for generating an intact ECM in the development of the engineered lung. The goal of decellularization is to prepare a suitable scaffold of lung tissue that contains an appropriate framework for the functionality of regenerated lung tissue. In this chapter, we aim to describe the decellularization protocols for lung tissue regenerative purposes. Copyright © 2021. Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Human Ureaplasma species are the most common microbes found in amniotic fluid and in the placenta after preterm birth, and have previously been correlated with chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, among other adverse birth and neonatal outcomes. Although these correlations exist, there still remains little explanation as to whether Ureaplasma plays a pathogenic role in the development of neonatal disease. In addition, Ureaplasma species are not usually identified on routine culture as they require special culture methods because of their fastidious growth requirements. Treatment of Ureaplasma with macrolides has been shown to effectively eradicate the bacteria in pregnant women and infants. However, it is unclear whether this leads to improved neonatal morbidity and mortality, or whether these generally represent commensal organisms. This review will synthesize the current perspectives about the proposed mechanisms of pathogenicity of Ureaplasma bacteria, its links to poor neonatal outcomes, and the role of screening and treatment in current clinical practice.

AB  - The feeding of colostrum and mother's transitional milk improves immune protection and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It also helps with gut maturation and decreases the risks of infection. The supply of nutrients from human milk (HM) is not adequate for preterm infants, even though preterm mother's milk contains higher concentrations of protein, sodium, zinc, and calcium than mature HM. The human milk fortifiers, particularly those with protein, calcium, and phosphate, should be used to supplement HM to meet the necessities of preterm infants. The management of fluid and electrolytes is a challenging aspect of neonatal care of preterm infants. Trace minerals such as iron, zinc, copper, iodine, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, chromium, and fluoride are considered essential for preterm infants. Vitamins such as A, D, E, and K play an important role in the prevention of morbidities, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Therefore, supplementation of HM with required nutrients is recommended for all preterm infants.

AB  - Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a major inflammatory protease released by neutrophils and is present in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, non-CF bronchiectasis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Although NE facilitates leukocyte transmigration to the site of infection and is required for clearance of Gram-negative bacteria, it also activates inflammation when released into the airway milieu in chronic inflammatory airway diseases. NE exposure induces airway remodeling with increased mucin expression and secretion and impaired ciliary motility. NE interrupts epithelial repair by promoting cellular apoptosis and senescence and it activates inflammation directly by increasing cytokine expression and release, and indirectly by triggering extracellular trap release and exosome release, which magnify protease activity and inflammation in the airway. NE inhibits innate immune function by digesting opsonins and opsonin receptors, degrading innate immune proteins such as lactoferrin, and inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis. Importantly, NE-directed therapies have not yet been effective in preventing the pathologic sequelae of NE exposure, but new therapies are being developed that offer both direct antiprotease activity and multifunctional anti-inflammatory properties.

AB  - Compromised alveolar development and pulmonary vascular remodeling are hallmarks of pediatric lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV). Although advances in surfactant therapy, corticosteroids, and antiinflammatory drugs have improved clinical management of preterm infants, those who suffer with severe vascular complications still lack viable treatment options. Paucity of the alveolar capillary network in ACDMPV causes respiratory distress and leads to mortality in a vast majority of infants with ACDMPV. The discovery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in 1997 brought forth the paradigm of postnatal vasculogenesis and hope for promoting vascularization in fragile patient populations, such as those with BPD and ACDMPV. The identification of diverse EPC populations, both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic in origin, provided a need to identify progenitor cell-selective markers that are linked to progenitor properties needed to develop cell-based therapies. Focusing on the future potential of EPCs for regenerative medicine, this review will discuss various aspects of EPC biology, beginning with the identification of hematopoietic, nonhematopoietic, and tissue-resident EPC populations. We will review knowledge related to cell surface markers, signature gene expression, and key transcriptional regulators and will explore the translational potential of EPCs for cell-based therapy for BPD and ACDMPV. The ability to produce pulmonary EPCs from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro holds promise for restoring vascular growth and function in the lungs of patients with pediatric pulmonary disorders.

AB  - The pulmonary vasculature consists of a large arterial and venous tree with a vast alveolar capillary network (ACN) in between. Both conducting blood vessels and the gas-exchanging capillaries are part of important human lung diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Morphological tools to investigate the different parts of the pulmonary vasculature quantitatively and in three dimensions are crucial for a better understanding of the contribution of the blood vessels to the pathophysiology and effects of lung diseases. In recent years, new stereological methods and imaging techniques have expanded the analytical tool box and therefore the conclusive power of morphological analyses of the pulmonary vasculature. Three of these developments are presented and discussed in this review article, namely (1) stereological quantification of the number of capillary loops, (2) serial block-face scanning electron microscopy of the ACN and (3) labeling of branching generations in light microscopic sections based on arterial tree segmentations of micro-computed tomography data sets of whole lungs. The implementation of these approaches in research work requires expertise in lung preparation, multimodal imaging at different scales, an advanced IT infrastructure and expertise in image analysis. However, they are expected to provide important data that cannot be obtained by previously existing methodology. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The addition of budesonide (Bud) 0.25 mg/kg to surfactant decreased the lung and systemic responses to mechanical ventilation in preterm sheep and the rates and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. We hypothesized that lower budesonide concentrations in surfactant will decrease injury while decreasing systemic corticosteroid exposure., METHODS: Preterm lambs received either (1) protective tidal volume (VT) ventilation with surfactant from birth or (2) injurious VT ventilation for 15 min and then surfactant treatment. Lambs were further assigned to surfactant mixed with (i) Saline, (ii) Bud 0.25 mg/kg, (iii) Bud 0.1 mg/kg, or (iv) Bud 0.04 mg/kg. All lambs were then ventilated with protective VT for 6 h., RESULTS: Plasma Bud levels were proportional to the dose received and decreased throughout ventilation. In both protective and injurious VT ventilation, <4% of Bud remained in the lung at 6 h. Some of the improvements in physiology and markers of injury with Bud 0.25 mg/kg were also found with 0.1 mg/kg, whereas 0.04 mg/kg had only minimal effects., CONCLUSIONS: Lower doses of Bud were less effective at decreasing lung and systemic inflammation from mechanical ventilation. The plasma Bud levels were proportional to dose given and the majority left the lung.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal Inflammatory Response Syndrome (FIRS) is a serious complication accompanied by increased neonatal mortality and morbidity. Early dia-gnosis of FIRS is essential to detect high risk infants. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) in cord blood and histologically proven funisitis;chorioamnionitis in high-risk infants after preterm birth., METHODS: Blood sampling for the measurement of inflammatory bio-markers was performed immediately after placental delivery and umbilical cutting. Umbilical and placental inflammatory changes were assessed using a recently released scoring system (Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus)., RESULTS: One hundred preterm infants (30.5 +/- 2.5 gestational week, birth weight 1,443 +/- 566 grams) and 21 health term infants were analyzed. Histologic chorioamnionitis was confirmed in 19% cases and chorioamnionitis with funisitis in 7% cases. Thirty-three infants (33%) fulfilled criteria of FIRS (funistis and/ or umbilical IL-6 > 11 ng/ L). The presence of FIRS correlated significantly with maternal leukocytosis (P < 0.001), preterm premature rupture of membrane (P < 0.001) and preterm uterine contraction (P < 0.0001). In comparison to preterm and healthy term infants we found statistically significant higher levels of umbilical inflammatory bio-markers (IL-6, PCT, CRP) in FIRS group (P < 0.0001). Composite mortality and morbidity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia) was higher in FIRS group (28.1 vs 22.4% in preterm group). However, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.53)., CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the correlation of umbilical inflammatory bio-markers levels (IL-6, PCT, CRP) and the presence of FIRS. We did not find significant adverse impact of FIRS on neonatal mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, our results could be influenced by the size of study group and strict inclusion criteria (only cases after C-section were analyzed).

AB  - Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a collectin protein synthesized by alveolar type II cells in the lungs. SP-D participates in the innate immune defense of the lungs by helping to clear infectious pathogens and modulating the immune response. SP-D has shown an anti-inflammatory role by down-regulating the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in different signaling pathways such as the TLR4, decreasing the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung, and modulating the oxidative metabolism in the lungs. Recombinant human SP-D (rhSP-D) has been successfully produced mimicking the structure and functions of native SP-D. Several in vitro and in vivo experiments using different animal models have shown that treatment with rhSP-D reduces the lung inflammation originated by different insults, and that rhSP-D could be a potential treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a rare disease for which there is no effective therapy up to date. BPD is a complex disease in preterm infants whose incidence increases with decreasing gestational age at birth. Lung inflammation, which is caused by different prenatal and postnatal factors like infections, lung hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation, among others, is the key player in BPD. Exacerbated inflammation causes lung tissue injury that results in a deficient gas exchange in the lungs of preterm infants and frequently leads to long-term chronic lung dysfunction during childhood and adulthood. In addition, low SP-D levels and activity in the first days of life in preterm infants have been correlated with a worse pulmonary outcome in BPD. Thus, SP-D mediated functions in the innate immune response could be critical aspects of the pathogenesis in BPD and SP-D could inhibit lung tissue injury in this preterm population. Therefore, administration of rhSP-D has been proposed as promising therapy that could prevent BPD.

AB  - Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by pulmonary inflammation leading to impaired alveolarization and vascular dysregulation, have an increased risk of abnormal lung function in infancy, childhood, and adulthood. These include a heightened risk of pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory illnesses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to disrupt normal lung development and function by interrupting alveolarization and vascularization resulting in the development of BPD. Among the various miRs involved in BPD, miR34a has been shown to have a significant role in BPD pathogenesis. Targeting miR34a or its downstream targets may be a promising therapeutic intervention for BPD. In this review, we summarize the data on cellular arrest, proliferation, differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis impacted by miR34a in the development of BPD pulmonary phenotypes while predicting the future perspective of miR34a in BPD.

AB  - Heme oxygenase (HO) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme catabolic pathway, which degrades heme into equimolar amounts of carbon monoxide, free iron, and biliverdin. Its inducible isoform, HO-1, has multiple protective functions, including immune modulation and pregnancy maintenance, showing dynamic alteration during perinatal periods. As its contribution to the development of perinatal complications is speculated, two functional polymorphisms of the HMOX1 gene, (GT)n repeat polymorphism (rs3074372) and A(-413)T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2071746), were studied for their association with perinatal diseases. We systematically reviewed published evidence on HMOX1 polymorphisms in perinatal diseases and clarified their possible significant contribution to neonatal jaundice development, presumably due to their direct effect of inducing HO enzymatic activity in the bilirubin-producing pathway. However, the role of these polymorphisms seems limited for other perinatal complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We speculate that this is because the antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effect is not directly mediated by HO but by its byproducts, resulting in a milder effect. For better understanding, subtyping each morbidity by the level of exposure to causative environmental factors, simultaneous analysis of both polymorphisms, and the unified definition of short and long alleles in (GT)n repeats based on transcriptional capacity should be further investigated.

AB  - The development, growth, and function of the cardiac, pulmonary, and vascular systems are closely intertwined during both fetal and postnatal life. In utero, placental, environmental, and genetic insults may contribute to abnormal pulmonary alveolarization and vascularization that increase susceptibility to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. However, the shared milieu of stressors may also contribute to abnormal cardiac or vascular development in the fetus and neonate, leading to the potential for cardiovascular dysfunction. Further, cardiac or pulmonary maladaptation can potentiate dysfunction in the other organ, amplify the risk for BPD in the neonate, and increase the trajectory for overall neonatal morbidity. Beyond infancy, there is an increased risk for systemic and pulmonary vascular disease including hypertension, as well as potential cardiac dysfunction, particularly within the right ventricle. This review will focus on the cardiovascular antecedents of BPD in the fetus, cardiovascular consequences of preterm birth in the neonate including associations with BPD, and cardiovascular impact of prematurity and BPD throughout the lifespan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm and low birth weight infants are born with low stores in zinc, which is a vital trace element for growth, cell differentiation and immune function. Preterm infants are at risk of zinc deficiency during the postnatal period of rapid growth. Systematic reviews in the older paediatric population have previously shown that zinc supplementation potentially improves growth and positively influences the course of infectious diseases. In paediatric reviews, the effect of zinc supplementation was most pronounced in those with low nutritional status, which is why the intervention could also benefit preterm infants typically born with low zinc stores and decreased immunity., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether enteral zinc supplementation, compared with placebo or no supplementation, affects important outcomes in preterm infants, including death, neurodevelopment, common morbidities and growth., SEARCH METHODS: Our searches are up-to-date to 20 February 2020. For the first search, we used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 29 September 2017), Embase (1980 to 29 September 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 29 September 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. We ran an updated search from 1 January 2017 to 20 February 2020 in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web, MEDLINE via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCOhost., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared enteral zinc supplementation versus placebo or no supplementation in preterm infants (gestational age < 37 weeks), and low birth weight babies (birth weight < 2500 grams), at any time during their hospital admission after birth. We included zinc supplementation in any formulation, regimen, or dose administered via the enteral route. We excluded infants who underwent gastrointestinal (GI) surgery during their initial hospital stay, or had a GI malformation or another condition accompanied by abnormal losses of GI juices, which contain high levels of zinc (including, but not limited to, stomas, fistulas, and malabsorptive diarrhoea)., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors separately screened abstracts, evaluated trial quality and extracted data. We synthesised effect estimates using risk ratios (RR), risk differences (RD), and standardised mean differences (SMD). Our primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and neurodevelopmental disability. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence., MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials with a total of 482 preterm infants; there was one ongoing trial. The five included trials were generally small, but of good methodological quality. Enteral zinc supplementation compared to no zinc supplementation Enteral zinc supplementation started in hospitalised preterm infants may decrease all-cause mortality (between start of intervention and end of follow-up period) (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97; 3 studies, 345 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were available on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months of (post-term) age. Enteral zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on common morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.40, 1 study, 193 infants; low-certainty evidence), retinopathy of prematurity (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.70, 1 study, 193 infants; low-certainty evidence), bacterial sepsis (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.04, 2 studies, 293 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), or necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.33, 1 study, 193 infants; low-certainty evidence). The intervention probably improves weight gain (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.64; 5 studies, 481 infants; moderate-certainty evidence); and may slightly improve linear growth (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.14, 3 studies, 289 infants; low-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on head growth (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.44, 3 studies, 289 infants; moderate-certainty evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Enteral supplementation of zinc in preterm infants compared to no supplementation or placebo may moderately decrease mortality and probably improve short-term weight gain and linear growth, but may have little or no effect on common morbidities of prematurity. There are no data to assess the effect of zinc supplementation on long-term neurodevelopment. Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The placenta is the single most reliable source for precise information on intrauterine environment, as well as maternal and fetal health. It mediates the physiology of two distinct yet highly interconnected individuals. The pathology that develops in the placenta, and the adaptations the placenta undergoes to mitigate this pathology, may influence the later life health of the mother and baby. Pathological placental examination provides a unique opportunity to explore and understand the intrauterine environment, as well as providing a record of events that may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A number of placental lesions have been described in association with various neonatal morbidities. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence for the association of placental pathologic lesions with neurodevelopmental outcomes infants with specific neonatal morbidities, including (1) neonatal encephalopathy, (2) bronchopulmonary dysplasia, (3) congenital heart diseases, and (4) autism spectrum disorders. For each of these disease processes, we will also propose specific research priorities in future studies. We conclude with a hospital-specific protocol for triaging which placentas should receive histological evaluation as a fundamental first step for the field of neuroplacentology to guide precision-based therapeutic approaches in the affected newborns. IMPACT: The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence for placental origins of neonatal diseases. We propose specific research priorities in the field of neuroplacentology in future studies. We also present a targeted hospital-based approach for triaging which placentas should receive histological evaluation.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a kind of pluripotent adult stem cell have shown great therapeutic potential in relation to many diseases in anti-inflammation and regeneration. The results of preclinical experiments and clinical trials have demonstrated that MSC-derived secretome possesses immunoregulatory and reparative abilities and that this secretome is capable of modulating innate and adaptive immunity and reprograming the metabolism of recipient cells via paracrine mechanisms. It has been recognized that MSC-derived secretome, including soluble proteins (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases), extracellular vesicles (EVs) and organelles, plays a key role in tissue repair and regeneration in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension, and silicosis. This review summarizes the known functions of MSC-EV modulation in lung diseases, coupled with the future challenges of MSC-EVs as a new pharmaceutical agent. The identification of underlying mechanisms for MSC-EV might provide a new direction for MSC-centered treatment in lung diseases.Graphical abstract.

AB  - Lung alveologenesis, formation of the alveolar region, allows sufficient gas exchange surface to be packed inside the chest cavity yet with orderly connection to the trachea. The real-life alveolar region, however, bears little resemblance to idealized cartoons owing to its three-dimensional nature, nonuniform shape, and mostly air-filled void. This morphological complexity is matched by its cellular complexity-comprised of intermixed and often tangled cells of the epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and immune lineages. Modern imaging, genetics, and genomics are shedding light on and updating traditional views of alveologenesis. Accordingly, this review describes a cell-centric 3-phase definition of alveologenesis and discusses its failure in diseases and possible reactivation during regeneration.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is quite infrequent in pediatric age and its most common etiologies include idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, PH related to congenital heart diseases, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (chronic lung disease), persistence of pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The developed for adult patients PH classification shows limitations when applied to pediatric subjects since the underlying causes are markedly different between the two ages. In 2011, the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute Panama Task Force outlined the first specific pediatric pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease diagnostic classification, including 10 main categories and 109 subcategories, thus testifying PH complex pathophysiology during newborns/children growth and development. The unique, distinctive features of pediatric PH were recognized also during the fifth World Symposium on pulmonary hypertension in 2013 and then confirmed in the recent 2018 sixth World Symposium. For the sake of uniformity, an attempt to adapt the adult classification to pediatric patients was made. However, all these commendable classifications are very complex and maybe not of quick comprehension for clinicians. A clinical simpler and simplified method is now suggested, comprising only five groups: neonatal, cardiac, developmental, idiopathic, and syndromic PH. This approach is not aimed at replacing the already existing classifications but is mainly based on the kind of specialized physician (neonatologist, pediatric cardiologist, pediatrician, pulmonologist, general practitioner) who first faces and looks after the child with suspected PH. What is dramatically known is that pediatric PH is a severe disease which, when untreated or undertreated, may lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease with long-term sequelae including neurodevelopmental delay. Although the precise mechanism of BPD is not well defined, oxidative stress is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis process of BPD. Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)-Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1)-ARE (Antioxidant Reaction Elements) signaling pathway is one of the main protective mechanisms of BPD, which can induce cytoprotective gene expression, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nicotinamide quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and so on. We exposed premature rats to hyperoxia and identified lung developmental retardation in preterm rats, with similar pathological changes as BPD. The expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in premature rats was significantly higher after hyperoxia exposure. To explore the changes of Nrf2 and HO-1 in premature rats and enhance their beneficial functions may provide new treatment strategies for infants at risk of BPD. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Objective To investigate dynamic changes of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in lungs of mice with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Methods Forty newborn C57BL/6 mice were randomized into air group and the hyperoxia group, 20 mice in each group. C57BL/6 newborn mice were delivered by caesarean section on the 19th day of pregnancy and exposed to 850 mL/L O2 for replication of the BPD model. Five mice in each group were sacrificed 1 day, 3, 7, 14 days after they were born for procurement of fresh lung tissues. HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of lung tissues. ELISA was used to detect the protein content of downstream cytokines interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-22 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in lung homogenate. Flow cytometry was used for measuring the proportion of ILC3 in lymphocytes as well as the proportions of IL-17+ ILC3 and IL-22+ ILC3 in the lung. Results The proportion of ILC3 in lung tissues reached the peak on the 7th day after birth. In contrast with the air group, the proportion of ILC3 in the hyperoxia group was significantly elevated at the same time points. The protein content of IL-17 and IL-22 in the hyperoxia group went up significantly in comparison with those in the air group at the same time points, while the GM-CSF content in the hyperoxia group showed no significant changes. The proportions of IL-17+ILC3 and IL-22+ILC3 in the hyperoxia group significantly increased as compared with those in the air group at the same time points. Conclusion The secretion of IL-17 and IL-22 derived from ILC3 is associated with BPD.

AB  - This review summarizes current understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction applicable to mechanisms of lung diseases and outlines challenges and future directions in this rapidly emerging field. Although the role of mitochondria extends beyond the term of cellular "powerhouse", energy generation remains the most fundamental function of these organelles. It is not counterintuitive to propose that intact energy supply is important for favorable cellular fate following pulmonary insult. In this review, the discussion of mitochondrial dysfunction focuses on those molecular mechanisms that alter cellular bioenergetics in the lungs: (a) inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain, (b) mitochondrial leak and uncoupling, (c) alteration of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, (d) mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and self-oxidation. The discussed lung diseases were selected according to their pathological nature and relevance to pediatrics: Acute lung injury (ALI), defined as acute parenchymal lung disease associated with cellular demise and inflammation (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS, Pneumonia), alveolar developmental failure (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, BPD or chronic lung disease in premature infants), obstructive airway diseases (Bronchial asthma) and vascular remodeling affecting pulmonary circulation (Pulmonary Hypertension, PH). The analysis highlights primary mechanisms of mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction contributing to the disease-specific pulmonary insufficiency and proposes potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Mammalian lungs have the ability to recognize external environments by sensing different compounds in inhaled air. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are rare, multi-functional epithelial cells currently garnering attention as intrapulmonary sensors; PNECs can detect hypoxic conditions through chemoreception. Because PNEC overactivation has been reported in patients suffering from respiratory diseases - such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other congenital diseases - an improved understanding of the fundamental characteristics of PNECs is becoming crucial in pulmonary biology and pathology. During the past decade, murine genetics and disease models revealed the involvement of PNECs in lung ventilation dynamics, mechanosensing and the type 2 immune responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing further unveiled heterogeneous gene expression profiles in the PNEC population and revealed that a small number of PNECs undergo reprogramming during regeneration. Aberrant large clusters of PNECs have been observed in neuroendocrine tumors, including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Modern innovation of imaging analyses has enabled the discovery of dynamic migratory behaviors of PNECs during airway development, perhaps relating to SCLC malignancy. This Review summarizes the findings from research on PNECs, along with novel knowledge about their function. In addition, it thoroughly addresses the relevant questions concerning the molecular pathology of pulmonary diseases and related therapeutic approaches. Copyright © 2020.

AB  - CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61, connective tissue growth factor, and nephroblastoma-1), previously named CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61) belongs to the CCN family of matricellular proteins. CCN1 plays critical roles in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. Recent studies have extensively characterized the important physiological and pathological roles of CCN1 in various tissues and organs. In this review, we summarize both basic and clinical aspects of CCN1 in pulmonary diseases, including acute lung injury (ALI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), lung infection, and lung cancer. We also emphasize the important challenges for future investigations to better understand the CCN1 and its role in physiology and pathology, as well as the questions that need to be addressed for the therapeutic development of CCN1 antagonists in various lung diseases.

AB  - Infection and persistent inflammation have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of brain injury and cerebral palsy, as well as other conditions associated with prematurity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The NLRP3 inflammasome-interleukin (IL)-1beta pathway has been extensively studied in adults and pre-clinical models, improving our understanding of innate immunity and offering an attractive therapeutic target that is already contributing to clinical management in many auto-inflammatory disorders. IL-1 blockade has transformed the course and outcome of conditions such as chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous, articular (CINCA/NOMID) syndrome. Inflammasome activation and upregulation has recently been implicated in neonatal brain and lung inflammatory disease and may be a novel therapeutic target. Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious chronic lung disease in premature newborns, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has developed into a promising approach to alleviate BPD. Small extracellular vesicles, which are an important therapeutic component of MSCs, have been reported to be effective in a mouse model of BPD. However, the affected cell types and detailed underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we found that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-sEVs) were successfully absorbed by lung tissue after intratracheal administration, and remained in the lungs for at least 72 h. The results showed that hucMSC-sEVs restored alveolar structure and lung function, and ameliorated pulmonary hypertension in a rat model of BPD. The number of Ki-67-positive lung cells were improved, while the number of TUNEL-positive lung cells were reduced in our hucMSC-sEV-treated BPD model. Additionally, SP-C staining (a marker of type II alveolar epithelial cells, TIIAECs) and CD31 staining (a marker of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, PVECs) were both increased in a hyperoxia-induced BPD model treated with hucMSC-sEVs. In vitro, under hyperoxic conditions, the tube-like structure formation was improved in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and the proliferation was increased and the apoptosis was attenuated in MLE-12 cells treated with hucMSC-sEVs. Furthermore, we observed downregulated expression of PTEN and cleaved-caspase3, and upregulated expression of p-Akt and vascular endothelial growth factor-A in our hucMSC-sEV-treated BPD model. In conclusion, hucMSC-sEVs improved alveolarization and angiogenesis in a rat BPD model by protecting TIIAECs and PVECs, which were associated with the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - Cochrane Neonatal was first established in 1993, as one of the original review groups of the Cochrane Collaboration. In fact, the origins of Cochrane Neonatal precede the establishment of the collaboration. In the 1980's, the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford, led by Dr. Iain Chalmers, established the "Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials" (ODPT), a register of virtually all randomized controlled trials in perinatal medicine to provide a resource for reviews of the safety and efficacy of interventions used in perinatal care and to foster cooperative and coordinated research efforts in the perinatal field [1]. An effort that was clearly ahead of its time, ODPT comprised four main elements: a register of published reports of trials; a register of unpublished trials; a register of ongoing and planned trials; and data derived from pooled overviews (meta-analyses) of trials. This core effort grew into the creation of the seminal books, "Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth" as well as "Effective Care of the Newborn Infant" [2,3]. As these efforts in perinatal medicine grew, Iain Chalmers thought well beyond perinatal medicine into the creation of a worldwide collaboration that became Cochrane [4]. The mission of the Cochrane Collaboration is to promote evidence-informed health decision-making by producing high-quality, relevant, accessible systematic reviews and other synthesized research evidence (www.cochrane.org). Cochrane Neonatal has continued to be one of the most productive review groups, publishing between 25 tpo to 40 new or updated systematic reviews each year. The impact factor has been steadily increasing over four years and now rivals most of the elite journals in pediatric medicine. Cochrane Neonatal has been a worldwide effort. Currently, there are 404 reviews involving 1206 authors from 52 countries. What has Cochrane done for babies? Reviews from Cochrane Neonatal have informed guidelines and recommendations worldwide. From January 2018 through June 2020, 77 international guidelines cited 221 Cochrane Neonatal reviews. These recommendations have included recommendations of the use of postnatal steroids, inhaled nitric oxide, feeding guidelines for preterm infants and other core aspects of neonatal practice. In addition, Cochrane Reviews has been the impetus for important research, including the large-scale trial of prophylactic indomethacin therapy, a variety of trials of postnatal steroids, trials of emollient ointment and probiotic trials [6]. While justifiably proud of these accomplishments, one needs to examine the future contribution of Cochrane Neonatal to the neonatal community. The future of Cochrane Neonatal is inexorably linked to the future of neonatal research. Obviously, there is no synthesis of trials data if, as a community, we fail to provide the core substrate for that research. As we look at the current trials' environment, fewer randomized controlled trial related to neonates are being published in recent years. A simple search of PubMed, limiting the search to "neonates" and "randomized controlled trials" shows that in the year 2000, 321 randomized controlled trials were published. These peaked five years ago, in 2015, with close to 900 trials being published. However, in 2018, only 791 studies are identified. Does this decrease represent a meaningful change in the neonatal research environment? Quite possibly. There are shifting missions of clinical neonatology at academic medical institutions, at least in the United States, with a focus on business aspects as well as other important competing clinical activities. Quality improvement has taken over as one of the major activities at both private and academic neonatal practices. Clearly, this is a needed improvement. All units at levels need to be dedicated to improving the outcomes of the sick and fragile population we care for. However, this need not be at the expense of formal clinical trials. It is understandable that this approach would be taken. Newer interventions frequently relate to complex systems of care and not the simple single interventions. Even trials that might traditionally have been done as randomized controlled trials, such as the introduction of a new mode of ventilation, are in reality complex challenges to the ability of institutions to create systems to adapt to these new technologies. Cost of doing trials has always been a barrier. The challenging regulatory and ethical environment contributes to these problems as well [7]. Despite these barriers, how does the research agenda of the neonatal community move forward in the 21st Century? We need to reassess how we create and disseminate our research findings. Innovative trial designs will allow us to address complex issues that we may not have tackled with conventional trials. Adaptive designs may allow us to look at potentially life-saving therapies in a way that feel more efficient and more ethical [8]. Clarifying issues such as the use of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants would be greatly served if we even knew whether or not there are hypoxemic preterm infant who would benefit from this therapy [9]. Current trials do not suggest so, yet current practice tells us that a significant number of these babies will receive inhaled nitric oxide [10-13]. Adaptive design, such as those done with trials of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), would allow us to quickly assess whether, in fact, these therapies are life-saving and allow us to consider whether or not further trials are needed [14,15]. Our understanding that many interventions involve entire systems approaches does not relegate us only to doing quality improvement work. Cluster designs may allow us to test more complex interventions that have usually been under the purview of quality improvement [16-18]. Cluster trials are well suited for such investigations and can be done with the least interruption to ongoing care. Ultimately, quality improvement is the application of the best evidence available (evidence-based medicine is "what to do" and evidence-based practice is "how to do"). [19,20]. Nascent efforts, such as the statement on "embedding necessary research into culture and health" (the ENRICH statement) call for the conduct of large, efficient pragmatic trials to evaluate neonatal outcomes, as in part called for in the ALPHA Collaboration [21,22]. This statement envisions an international system to identify important research questions by consulting regularly with all stakeholders, including patients, public health professionals, researchers, providers, policy makers, regulators, funders of industry. The ENRICH statement envisions a pathway to enable individuals, educational institutions, hospitals and health-care facilities to confirm their status as research-friendly by integrating an understanding of trials, other research and critical thinking and to teaching learning and culture, as well as an engagement with funders, professional organizations and regulatory bodies and other stake holders to raise awareness of the value of efficient international research to reduce barriers to large international pragmatic trials and other collaborative studies. In the future, if trials are to be done on this scale or trials are prospectively designed to be analyzed together, core outcome measures must be identified and standardized. That clinical trials supply estimates of outcomes that are relevant to patients and their families is critical. In addition, current neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple measures. A given measure can have multiple widely used definitions. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (or chronic lung disease just to add to the confusion) quickly comes to mind [23,24]. The use of multiple definitions when attempting to measure the same outcome prevents synthesis of trial results and meta-analysis and hinders efforts to refine our estimates of effects. Towards that end, Webbe and colleagues have set out to develop a core outcome set for neonatal research [25]. Key stakeholders in the neonatal community reviewed multiple outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative studies. Based on consensus, key outcome measures were identified, including survival, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, retinopathy or prematurity, gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life, adverse events, visual impairment or blindness, hearing impairment or deafness, chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Trials registration has to be a continued focus of the neonatal community. Trials registration allows for systematic reviewers to understand whether or not reporting bias has occurred [26]. It also allows for transparent incorporation of these core outcome measures. Ultimately, trials registration should include public reporting of all of these core outcomes and, in the future, access to data on an individual level such that more sophisticated individual patient data meta-analysis could occur. Lastly, there is no reason to see clinical trials and quality improvement as separate or exclusive activities. In fact, in the first NICQ Collaborative, conducted by Vermont Oxford Network, participation in a trial of postnatal steroids was considered part of the quality improvement best practices as opposed to simply choosing an as-of-yet unproven approach to use of this potent drug [27]. What role will Cochrane Neonatal play as we move forward in the 21st Century? As the neonatal community moves forward with its' research agenda, Cochrane Neonatal must not only follow but also lead with innovative approaches to synthesizing research findings. Cochrane Neonatal must continue to work closely with guideline developers. The relationship between systematic review production and guideline development is clearly outlined in reports from the Institute of Medicine [28,29]. Both are essential to guideline development; the systematic review group culling the evidence for the benefits and harms of a given intervention and the guideline group addressing the contextual issues of cost, feasibility, implementation and the values and preferences of individuals and societies. Most national and international guidelines groups now routinely use systematic reviews as the evidence basis for their guidelines and recommendations. Examples of the partnership between Cochrane Neonatal and international guideline development can be seen in our support of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the use of vitamin A or the soon to be published recommendations from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) on cord management in preterm and term infants [30]. In the future, we need to collaborate early in the guideline development process so that the reviews are fit for purpose and meet the needs of the guideline developers and the end users. Towards this end, all Cochrane Neonatal reviews now contain GRADE assessments of the key clinical findings reported in the systematic review [31]. Addition of these assessments addresses the critical issue of our confidence in the findings. We are most confident in evidence provided by randomized controlled trials but this assessment can be can be downgraded if the studies that reported on the outcome in question had a high risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency of results, or imprecision, or where there is evidence of reporting bias. Information provided by GRADE assessments is seen as critical in the process of moving from the evidence to formal recommendations [32]. We need to explore complex reviews, such as network (NMA) or multiple treatment comparison (MCT) meta-analyses, to address issues not formally addressed in clinical trials [33]. In conditions where there are multiple effective interventions, it is rare for all possible interventions to have been tested against each other [34]. A solution could be provided by network meta-analysis, which allows for comparing all treatments with each other, even if randomized controlled trials are not available for some treatment comparisons [34]. Network meta-analysis uses both direct (head-to-head) randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence as well as indirect evidence from RCTs to compare the relative effectiveness of all included interventions [35]. However, Mills and colleagues note that the methodological quality of MTCs may be difficult for clinicians to interpret because the number of interventions evaluated may be large and the methodological approaches may be complex [35]. Cochrane Neonatal must take a role in both the creation of such analyses and the education of the neonatal community regarding the pitfalls of such an approach. The availability of individual patient data will make more sophisticated analyses more available to the community. Although the current crop of individual patient data meta-analyses (including the reviews of elective high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and oxygen targets) have not differed substantially from the findings of the trials level reviews (suggesting that, in fact, sick neonates are more alike that unalike), there still will be a large role for individual patient data meta-analysis, at least to end the unfound conclusions that these therapies are effective in various subgroups (be it issues of sex, disease severity, or clinical setting) [36-39]. Future trials should take a lesson from the NeOProM Collaborative [37,39]. Given the difficulty in generating significant sample size and creating funding in any single environment, trials with similar protocols should be conducted in a variety of healthcare settings with an eye towards both study level and individual patient level meta-analysis at the conclusion of those trials, allowing for broader contribution to the trials data, more rapid accrual of sample size, and more precise results. We need to educate the neonatal community regarding the use and abuse of diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests are a critical component of healthcare but also contribute greatly to the cost of medical care worldwide. These costs include the cost of the tests themselves and the costs of misdiagnosis and treatment of individuals who will not benefit from those treatments. Clinicians may have a limited understanding of diagnostic test accuracy, the ability of a diagnostic test to distinguish between patients with and without the disease or target condition [41,42]. Efforts such as Choosing Wisely have tried to identify these deficiencies [40]. As Cochrane has increased the general literacy of both the medical and general population regarding the interpretation of the results of interventions on various diseases, so should Cochrane move forward and improve the understanding of diagnostic testing. We need to become more efficient at creating and maintaining our reviews. The time spent to produce systematic reviews is far too great. In average, it takes between 21/2 to 61/2 years to produce a systematic review, requiring intense time input for highly trained and expensive experts. Innovations in the ways in which we produce systematic reviews can make the review process more efficient by outsourcing some of the tasks or crowdsourcing to machine learning. We need to let the crowd and machine learning innovations help us sort the massive amounts of information needed to conduct systematic reviews. It can also allow for "live" updating of critical reviews where the research landscape is quickly changing [43]. Lastly, Cochrane Neonatal must focus more on users of the reviews and not necessarily authors of the reviews. Current Cochrane programming speaks of Cochrane training with an eye towards developing the skills of individuals who will conduct systematic reviews. While this is clearly needed and laudable, the fact of the matter is that most of the community will be "users" of the reviews. Individuals who need to understand how to use and interpret the findings of systematic reviews. These review users include clinicians, guideline developers, policy makers and families. Incorporation of GRADE guidelines has been a huge step in adding transparency to the level of uncertainty we have in our findings. From a family's perspective, we need to overcome the environment of mistrust or misunderstanding of scientific evidence and how we convey what we know, and our uncertainty about what we know, to parents and families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. A breach in the lung alveolar-epithelial barrier and impairment in lung function are hallmarks of acute and chronic pulmonary illness. This review is part two of our previous work. In part 1, we demonstrated that CdM is as effective as MSCs in modulating inflammation. Herein, we investigated the effects of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-conditioned media (CdM) on (i) lung architecture/function in animal models mimicking human lung disease, and (ii) performed a head-to-head comparison of CdM to MSCs., METHODS: Adhering to the animal Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation protocol, we conducted a search of English articles in five medical databases. Two independent investigators collected information regarding lung: alveolarization, vasculogenesis, permeability, histologic injury, compliance, and measures of right ventricular hypertrophy and right pulmonary pressure. Meta-analysis was performed to generate random effect size using standardized mean difference with 95% confidence interval., RESULTS: A total of 29 studies met inclusion. Lung diseases included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. CdM improved all measures of lung structure and function. Moreover, no statistical difference was observed in any of the lung measures between MSCs and CdM., CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of animal models recapitulating human lung disease, CdM improved lung structure and function and had an effect size comparable to MSCs.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic morbidity in preterm infants. In the absence of effective interventions, BPD is currently a major therapeutic challenge. Several risk factors are known for this multifactorial disease that results in disrupted lung development. Inflammation plays an important role and leads to persistent airway and pulmonary vascular disease. Since corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents, postnatal corticosteroids have been used widely for BPD prevention and treatment. However, the clinical responses vary to a great degree across individuals, and steroid-related complications remain major concerns. Emerging studies on the molecular mechanism of lung alveolarization during inflammatory stress will elucidate the complicated pathway and help discover novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, with the advances in metabolomics, there are new opportunities to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of BPD. Pharmacometabolomics is another novel field aiming to identify the metabolomic changes before and after a specific drug treatment. Through this "metabolic signature," a more precise treatment may be developed, thereby avoiding unnecessary drug exposure in non-responders. In the future, more clinical, genetic, and translational studies would be required to improve the classification of BPD phenotypes and achieve individualized care to enhance the respiratory outcomes in preterm infants.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading complication of preterm birth that affects infants born in the saccular stage of lung development at <32 weeks of gestation. Although the mechanisms driving BPD remain uncertain, exposure to hyperoxia is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Objectives: To determine the effects of hyperoxia on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and to define the mediators of activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling after hyperoxia injury. Methods: Three hyperoxia models were used: A three-dimensional organotypic coculture using primary human lung cells, precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), and a murine in vivo hyperoxia model. Comparisons of normoxia- and hyperoxia-exposed samples were made by real-time quantitative PCR, RNA in situ hybridization, quantitative confocal microscopy, and lung morphometry. Measurements and Main Results:  Examination of an array of Wnt ligands in the three-dimensional organotypic coculture revealed increased mesenchymal expression of WNT5A. Inhibition of Wnt5A abrogated the BPD transcriptomic phenotype induced by hyperoxia. In the PCLS model, Wnt5A inhibition improved alveolarization following hyperoxia exposure, and treatment with recombinant Wnt5a reproduced features of the BPD phenotype in PCLS cultured in normoxic conditions. Chemical inhibition of NF-kappaB with BAY11-7082 reduced Wnt5a expression in the PCLS hyperoxia model and in vivo mouse hyperoxia model, with improved alveolarization in the PCLS model. Conclusions: Increased mesenchymal Wnt5A during saccular-stage hyperoxia injury contributes to the impaired alveolarization and septal thickening observed in BPD. Precise targeting of Wnt5A may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BPD.

AB  - Lung injury is characterized by inflammatory processes demonstrated as loss of function of the pulmonary capillary endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells. Autophagy is an intracellular digestion system that work as an inducible adaptive response to lung injury which is a resultant of exposure to various stress agents like hypoxia, ischemia-reperfusion and xenobiotics which may be manifested as acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic lung injury (CLI), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), pulmonary fibrosis (PF), cystic fibrosis (CF) and radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). Numerous regulators like LC3B-II, Beclin 1, p62, HIF1/BNIP3 and mTOR play pivotal role in autophagy induction during lung injury possibly for progression/inhibition of the disease state. The present review focuses on the critical autophagic mediators and their potential cross talk with the lung injury pathophysiology thereby bringing to limelight the possible therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) are a lung resident stem cell population located at bronchioalveolar duct junctions that contribute to the maintenance of bronchiolar club cells and alveolar epithelial cells of the distal lung. Their transformed counterparts are considered to be likely progenitors of lung adenocarcinomas, which has been a major area of research in relation to BASCs. A critical limitation in addressing the function of BASCs in vivo has been the lack of a unique BASC marker, which has prevented specific targeting of BASCs in animal models of respiratory conditions. Recently, there have been several studies describing genetically modified mice that allow in vivo quantification, tracing, and functional analysis of BASCs to address this long-standing issue. These cutting-edge experimental tools will likely have significant implications for future experimental studies involving BASCs and the elucidation of their role in various lung diseases. To date, this has been largely explored in models of lung injury including naphthalene-induced airway injury, bleomycin-induced alveolar injury, hyperoxia-induced models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and influenza virus infection. These novel experimental mouse tools will facilitate the assessment of the impact of BASC loss on additional respiratory conditions including infection-induced severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as respiratory bacterial infections, both in early life and adulthood. These future studies may shed light on the potential broad applicability of targeting BASCs for a diverse range of respiratory conditions during lung development and in promoting effective regeneration and repair of the lung in respiratory diseases. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - In the current era, the survival of extremely low-birth-weight infants has increased considerably because of new advances in technology; however, these infants often develop chronic dysfunction of the lung, which is called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD remains an important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity despite newer and gentler modes of ventilation. BPD results from the exposure of immature lungs to various antenatal and postnatal factors that lead to an impairment in lung development and aberrant growth of lung parenchyma and vasculature. However, we still struggle with a uniform definition for BPD that can help predict various short- and long-term pulmonary outcomes. With new research, our understanding of the pathobiology of this disease has evolved, and many new mechanisms of lung injury and repair are now known. By utilizing the novel 'omic' approaches in BPD, we have now identified various factors in the disease process that may act as novel therapeutic targets in the future. New investigational agents being explored for the management and prevention of BPD include mesenchymal stem cell therapy and insulin-like growth factor 1. Despite this, many questions remain unanswered and require further research to improve the outcomes of premature infants with BPD. Copyright: © 2020 Sahni M and Bhandari V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fat emulsion is an important component of parenteral nutrition in premature infants. However, intravenous fat emulsions (IVFE) was reported to be associated with some serious complications, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Compared to conventional soybean oil-based IVFE, new-generation IVFE may protect against BPD but the results are conflicting., METHODS: Relevant literatures search was conducted and the summary effect estimates of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated with fixed-effects models., RESULTS: Of 22 studies involving 3781 infants were selected in this study and BPD was reported as part of the included studies. The pooled estimate for 13 studies, comparing administration of new-generation IVFE with conventional IVFE, indicated that new-generation IVFE was not associated with a reduced risk of BPD in preterm infants, compared with conventional IVFE (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.80-1.14); the pooled estimate for 18 studies, comparing administration of fish oil-containing IVFE with non-fish oil IVFE, indicated that fish oil-containing IVFE has no protective effect against the occurrence of BPD in preterm infants (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71-1.08)., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support that the new-generation IVFEs could prevent the incidence of BPD or fish oil-containing IVFEs could show a beneficial effect to BPD in premature infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and serious complication of preterm birth. Limited pharmacological and other medical interventions are currently available for the management of severely affected, very preterm infants. BPD can be modelled in preclinical studies using experimental animals, and experimental animal models have been extremely valuable in the development of hallmark clinical management strategies for BPD, including pulmonary surfactant replacement and single-course antenatal corticosteroids. A gradual move away from large animal models of BPD in favor of term-born rodents has facilitated the identification of a multitude of new mechanisms of normal and stunted lung development, but this has also potentially limited the utility of experimental animal models for the identification of pathogenic pathways and putative disease management targets in BPD. Indeed, more recent pharmacological interventions for the management of BPD that have been validated in randomized controlled trials have relied very little on preclinical data generated in experimental animal models. While rodent-based models of BPD have tremendous advantages in terms of the availability of genetic tools, they also have considerable drawbacks, including limited utility for studying breathing mechanics, gas exchange, and pulmonary hemodynamics; and they have a less relevant clinical context where lung prematurity and a background of infection are now rarely present in the pathophysiology under study. There is a pressing need to refine existing models to better recapitulate pathological processes at play in affected infants, in order to better evaluate new candidate pharmacological and other interventions for the management of BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac hormone released with an N-terminal fragment (NTproBNP) under conditions of ventricular pressure or volume overload. BNP has been proposed for use as a biomarker of cardiac dysfunction in premature infants in the setting of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HsPDA) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In adult settings the presence of proBNP and glycosylated isoforms may affect assay interpretation. However, there are limited data on how immature preterm physiology may affect BNP or NTproBNP levels and no published data on post-translational BNP processing in premature infants., METHODS: Pooled serial plasma samples from preterm infants born at less than 30 weeks gestation were analyzed for BNP congeners using Luminex R assay and high performance liquid chromatography. Samples were grouped according to clinical status: Group 1, no HsPDA and no BPD, Group 2 HsPDA and no/mild BPD, Group 3 HsPDA and moderate/severe BPD., RESULTS: Plasma from 15 infants was analyzed, and across all three groups NTproBNP predominated with minimal amounts of other isoforms; no glycosylation was detected., CONCLUSIONS: NTproBNP appears to be the predominant isoform across each of our clinical groups in our pooled sample analysis with no evidence of significant glycosylation. This suggests NTproBNP is likely to be a robust marker in this clinical setting. Copyright © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To explore the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive surfactant administration (MISA) in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Methods: In this multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial, 92 preterm infants with gestation age <=30 weeks and diagnosed with NRDS were enrolled in 8 level III neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region from 1(st) July 2017 to 31(st) December 2018. They were randomly assigned to minimally invasive surfactant administration (MISA) group or endotracheal intubation surfactant administration (EISA) group according to random number generated by computer. Infants in both groups received calf pulmonary surfactant preparation at a dose of 70-100 mg/kg. The data of demography, perinatal situation, medication administration, complications, clinical outcomes in the two groups were compared with Chi-square test, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Among the 92 preterm infants, 53 were males, 39 were females; 47 were in the MISA group (25 males), and 45 were in the EISA group (28 males). The gestational age and birth weight were (29.5+/-1.2) weeks and (1 271+/-242) g in all patients, (29.5+/-1.4) weeks and (1 285+/-256) g in the MISA group, and (29.6+/-0.9) weeks and (1 255+/-227) g in the EISA group. The duration of surfactant infusion and the length of whole procedure in the MISA group were significantly longer than that in the EISA group (60 (18, 270) s vs. 50 (30, 60) s, Z=3.009, P=0.003; 90 (60, 300) s vs. 60 (44, 270) s, Z=3.365, P=0.001). For the outcomes, the incidence of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were lower in the MISA group than in the EISA group (36% (17/47) vs. 67% (30/45), chi(2)=8.556, P=0.003; 26% (12/47) vs. 47% (21/45), chi(2)=4.464, P=0.035). Conclusions: Minimally invasive surfactant administration is applicable in preterm infants <=30 weeks gestational age with NRDS. Although the length of whole procedure is longer than route endotracheal administration, the benefit of decreasing the incidences of hsPDA and BPD outweighs this demerit.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a devastating chronic neonatal lung disease leading to serious adverse consequences. Nearly 15 million babies are born preterm accounting for >1 in 10 births globally. The aetiology of BPD is multifactorial and the survivors suffer lifelong respiratory morbidity. Lysophospholipids (LPL), which include sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are both naturally occurring bioactive lipids involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as cell survival, death, proliferation, migration, immune responses and vascular development. Altered LPL levels have been observed in a number of lung diseases including BPD, which underscores the importance of these signalling lipids under normal and pathophysiological situations. Due to the paucity of information related to LPLs in BPD, most of the ideas related to BPD and LPL are speculative. This article is intended to promote discussion and generate hypotheses, in addition to the limited review of information related to BPD already established in the literature.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Glycosylation patterns have the potential to affect the function of antibody, antibody half-life and transplacental transfer from mother to foetus. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how glycosylation patterns of antibodies may be altered during pregnancy, vaccination and infection., RECENT FINDINGS: During pregnancy, there is preferential transplacental transfer of natural killer (NK) cell-activating antibodies that are galactosylated and sialylated, against both bacterial and viral antigens. Markers of NK cell function are also associated with a higher abundance of galactosylation and sialylation in respiratory syncytial virus-specific IgG, compared with total IgG, in infants up to 7 months of age which may suggest a role for NK-cell activating antibodies as important mediators of immunity during early infancy. Differential glycosylation patterns have been observed in some respiratory conditions, as increased nongalactosylated antibodies have been associated with the development of chronic inflammatory bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Glycosylation patterns in children appear age-dependent, which could modulate the effector function of IgG. The clinical relevance of these findings needs to be established., SUMMARY: Glycosylation plays a key role in mediating antibody function. Glycosylation patterns associated with positive outcomes from infection in mothers and infants could inform the design of the next generation of vaccines for use in pregnancy and infancy.

AB  - Rationale: Growth and development during adolescence may modify the respiratory and vascular differences seen among extremely preterm (EP) individuals in childhood and early adolescence. Objectives: To assess the trajectory of respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes during transition to adulthood in a national longitudinal cohort study of births before 26 weeks of gestation in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Methods: A total of 129 EP participants and 65 control subjects attended for a center-based evaluation at 19 years of age. Standardized measures of spirometry, hemodynamics, functional capacity, and markers of inflammation were obtained from EP subjects with and without neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia and term-born control subjects at 19 years of age and compared with previous assessments. Measurements and Main Results:  Compared with the control group, the EP group was significantly impaired on all spirometric parameters (mean FEV1z-score, -1.08 SD [95% confidence interval, -1.40 to -0.77]) and had lower fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentrations (13.9 vs. 24.4 ppb; P < 0.001) despite a higher proportion with bronchodilator reversibility (27% vs. 6%). The EP group had significantly impaired exercise capacity. All respiratory parameters were worse after neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and respiratory function differences were similar at 11 and 19 years. The augmentation index was 6% higher in the EP group and associated with increased total peripheral resistance (difference in means, 96.4 [95% confidence interval, 26.6-166.2] dyne/s/cm-5) and elevation in central, but not peripheral, blood pressure. Central systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased more quickly during adolescence in the EP group than in the control group. Conclusions: Clinicians should address both cardiovascular and respiratory risks in adult survivors of extremely preterm birth.

AB  - The adverse effects of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) on respiratory diseases start in utero. In order to investigate whether maternal PM2.5 exposure could lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in offspring, PM2.5 was collected in Taiyuan, Shanxi, China during the annual heating period. Mice were mated and gestation day 0 (GD0) was considered the day on which a vaginal plug was observed. The plug-positive mice received 3 mg/kg b.w. PM2.5 by oropharyngeal aspiration every other day starting on GD0 and throughout the gestation period. Offspring were sacrificed at postnatal days (PNDs) 1, 7, 14 and 21. We assessed some typical BPD-like symptoms in offspring. The results showed that maternal PM2.5 exposure caused low birth weight, hypoalveolarization, decreased angiogenesis, suppressed production of secretory and surfactant proteins, and increased inflammation in the lungs of male offspring. However, maternal PM2.5 exposure induced only hypoalveolarization and inflammation in the lungs of female offspring. Furthermore, these alterations were reversed during postnatal development. Our results demonstrated that maternal exposure to PM2.5 caused reversible BPD-related consequences in offspring, and male offspring were more sensitive than females. However, these alterations were reversed during postnatal development. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the human Ureaplasma species are most frequently isolated from the amniotic fluid and placenta in these cases. Ureaplasma colonisation is associated with infertility, stillbirth, histologic chorioamnionitis, and neonatal morbidities, including congenital pneumonia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, meningitis and perinatal death. The human Ureaplasma spp. are separated into Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum with 14 known serotypes. The small genome has several genes, which code for surface proteins; most significantly the Multiple Banded Antigen (MBA) where an antigenic C-terminal domain elicits a host antibody response. Other genes code for various virulence factors such as IgA protease and urease. Ureaplasma spp. infection is diagnosed by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and commercial assays are available to improve turnaround time. Microbroth dilution assays are routinely used to test antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical Ureaplasma spp. especially against doxycycline, azithromycin, ofloxacin and josamycin. Resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines has been reported. A concise review of Ureaplasma spp. and their role in pregnancy outcomes, especially preterm birth, offers insight into the early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent long-term complications of Ureaplasma spp. infections.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which remains a major clinical problem for preterm infants, is caused mainly by hyperoxia, mechanical ventilation and inflammation. Many approaches have been developed with the aim of decreasing the incidence of or alleviating BPD, but effective methods are still lacking. Gasotransmitters, a type of small gas molecule that can be generated endogenously, exert a protective effect against BPD-associated lung injury; nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are three such gasotransmitters. The protective effects of NO have been extensively studied in animal models of BPD, but the results of these studies are inconsistent with those of clinical trials. NO inhalation seems to have no effect on BPD, although side effects have been reported. NO inhalation is not recommended for BPD treatment in preterm infants, except those with severe pulmonary hypertension. Both CO and H2S decreased lung injury in BPD rodent models in preclinical studies. Another small gas molecule, hydrogen, exerts a protective effect against BPD. The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) axis seems to play a central role in the protective effect of these gasotransmitters on BPD. Gasotransmitters play important roles in mammals, but further clinical trials are needed to explore their effects on BPD. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a heterogenous condition with poorly characterized disease subgroups. Objectives: To define the frequency of three disease components: moderate-severe parenchymal disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), or large airway disease, in a referral cohort of preterm infants with severe BPD. The association between each component and a primary composite outcome of death before hospital discharge, tracheostomy, or home pulmonary vasodilator therapy was assessed. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study of infants born at <32 weeks' gestation with severe BPD who underwent both chest computed tomography with angiography (CTA) and echocardiography between 40 and 50 weeks postmenstrual age between 2011 and 2015. Moderate-severe parenchymal lung disease was defined as an Ochiai score >=8 on CTA. PH was diagnosed by echocardiogram using standard criteria. Large airway disease was defined as tracheomalacia or bronchomalacia on bronchoscopy and/or tracheoscopy or CTA. Measurements and Main Results: Of 76 evaluated infants, 73 (96%) were classifiable into phenotypic subgroups: 57 with moderate-severe parenchymal disease, 48 with PH, and 44 with large airway disease. The presence of all three disease components was most common (n = 23). Individually, PH and large airway disease, but not moderate-severe parenchymal disease, were associated with increased risk for the primary study outcome. Having more disease components was associated with an incremental increase in the risk for the primary outcome (2 vs. 1: odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-17.2 and 3 vs. 1: odds ratio, 12.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-70.0). Conclusions: Infants with severe BPD are variable in their predominant pathophysiology. Disease phenotyping may enable better risk stratification and targeted therapeutic intervention.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains poorly understood. It is a multifactorial disease having a genetic-environmental basis. Although attempts have been made to identify a biomarker, none have been validated for clinical use to date. Metabolomics is a promising field of the "omics technologies" that could allow for better understanding of the pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of BPD as well as facilitate detection of biomarkers. Identification of these biomarkers would improve diagnosis, identify patients in early disease stages and potentially target intervention. This review focuses on the evidence arising from metabolomics and its interaction with microbiomics and pharmacology with respect to pathogenesis and treatment options for this multifactorial complex disease.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to recognize the multifactorial cause of asthma, from the influence of mother until adulthood, highlight the main characteristics of the disease at different ages and summarize the evidence of potential prevention strategies., RECENT FINDINGS: To date, regarding the prenatal period, the presence of specific genes, maternal asthma, drugs, and tobacco exposure are the most relevant predisposing features for an asthmatic offspring. For newborns, preterm, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and low birth weight has been associated with low lung function. Among young children, atopic dermatitis, lower respiratory tract infections, and increased levels of total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and allergen-specific IgE are important determinants.Breastfeeding has been demonstrated being protective for the onset of asthma. Allergen immunotherapy has also been shown to have significant preventive effect decreasing asthma development. Inhaled corticosteroids use in early childhood prevents exacerbations but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Other interventions, such as the use of palivizumab, probiotics, vitamin D supplementation, and fish consumption presented controversial results., SUMMARY: A good knowledge of risk factors for asthma development, from prenatal period to adulthood, may lead to efficacious preventive strategies. Further data of long-term follow-up in population-based studies according to different phenotypes are needed.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a common and challenging complication of prematurity, with limited effective strategies at the neonatologist's disposal. Throughout the years, our understanding of this complex syndrome has broadened. Instead of solely attributing this disease to the effects of prematurity and injuries to the lung from mechanical ventilation, it is now accepted to be a multifactorial disease. Recent research efforts have focused on investigating the gene-environment interactions that may influence an infant's susceptibility toward the development of BPD. So far, success has been limited but promising, offering hope that in the future, novel therapies will be available to ameliorate the risk for BPD.

AB  - Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) is a process of transdifferentiation where endothelial cells gradually adopt the phenotypic characteristics of mesenchymal cells. This phenomenon was first discovered in embryonic heart development. The mechanisms underlying EndoMT are due to the activation of transforming growth factor-beta, bone morphogenetic protein, Wingless/Integrated, or Notch signaling pathways. The EndoMT can be modulated by pathological processes, including inflammation, disturbed shear stress, vascular stiffness, and metabolic dysregulation. Recent studies have shown that EndoMT is implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases, including pulmonary hypertension and lung fibrosis. Lung pathology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia can be mimicked in rodents exposed to hyperoxia as neonates. Although hyperoxic exposure reduces an endothelial cell marker platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule but increases a mesenchymal cell biomarker alpha-smooth muscle actin in vitro in human pulmonary endothelial cells, there is no direct evidence showing EndoMT in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Both pulmonary hypertension and lung fibrosis occur in long-term survivors with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this review, we discuss the EndoMT and its modulation by pathological processes. We then focus on the role of EndoMT in the pathogenesis of these chronic lung diseases, and discuss therapeutic approaches targeting the EndoMT using its negative regulators.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For clinical research findings to improve the quality of care and outcomes for newborn infants and their families, they need to be implemented in policy and adopted in practice., METHODS: We describe the principles of effective dissemination and implementation of research findings and highlight examples of collaborative quality improvement strategies to ensure that guidelines, protocols, policies and practices reflect research-informed evidence., RESULTS: Passive dissemination of research findings is generally ineffective in driving change. Implementation strategies that use multi-faceted approaches acting on different barriers to change are better at driving improvements in the quality of care practices. These initiatives are increasingly embedded within regional, national and international networks of neonatal care centres that collaborate in conducting research, implementing its findings and auditing its uptake. Examples of successful network-based collaborative quality improvement programmes include efforts to increase use of evidence-based strategies to prevent hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, optimise surfactant replacement for preterm infants, reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, improve antibiotic stewardship and promote the use of human milk to prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very-low-birth-weight infants., CONCLUSIONS: Effective dissemination and implementation are essential for research evidence to improve quality of care and outcomes for newborn infants and their families. Multifaceted initiatives within network-based collaborative quality improvement programmes facilitate continuous audit and benchmarking cycles to ensure equity of access to evidence-based care practices.

AB  - Autophagy is a Greek-derived concept that means "self-eating" and is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of homeostasis and disease. In this issue of the JCI, Yeganeh et al. report the important finding that intrinsic autophagy is required for normal progression of lung development. Conditional deletion of the beclin 1-encoding gene (Becn1) specifically within lung epithelial cells of embryonic mice resulted in neonatal lethal respiratory distress that was associated with negative impacts on airway branching and differentiation of airway epithelial cell lineages. The authors draw speculative parallels with the alveolar simplification phenotype of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature human infants and suggest that stimulation of autophagy by cAMP-dependent kinase activation might conceivably rescue these phenotypes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease among neonates, with increasing morbidity and mortality. This study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) on hyperoxia-induced BPD. Hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse and alveolar epithelial cell models were constructed. The effects of hyperoxia on lung development were evaluated by histological and morphological analysis. The levels of KDM3A, E26 transformation specific-1 (ETS1), H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related indexes were quantified by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and IF staining. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Transfection of oe-ETS1, oe-KDM3A, and sh-ETS1 was applied in hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cells to explore the mechanism of the KDM3A/ETS1 axis in hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. KDM3A inhibitor IOX1 was applied to validate the in vivo effect of KDM3A in hyperoxia-induced BPD mice. The results displayed that hyperoxia-induced BPD mice showed reduced body weight, severe destruction of alveolar structure, decreased radial alveolar count (RAC), and increased mean linear intercept (MLI) and mean alveolar diameter (MAD). Further, hyperoxia induction down-regulated ETS1 expression, raised ER stress levels, and increased apoptosis rate in BPD mice and alveolar epithelial cells. However, transfection of oe-ETS1 improved the above changes in hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, transfection of oe-KDM3A up-regulated ETS1 expression, down-regulated H3K9me2 expression, inhibited ER stress, and reduced apoptosis rate in hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, transfection of sh-ETS1 reversed the inhibitory effect of KDM3A on hyperoxia-induced apoptosis by regulating ER stress. In vivo experiments, KDM3A inhibitor IOX1 intervention further aggravated BPD in newborn mice. In a word, KDM3A alleviated hyperoxia-induced BPD in mice by promoting ETS1 expression.

Global collaborations have been working on the etiologies and classification scheme of chILD. With the development of medical technologies, some new diseases were identified to be associated with chILD and its etiologic spectrum is expanding. The aim of this study is to describe the etiologic spectrum of chILD in children older than 2 years of age and summarize the approaches to diagnosis of chILD., METHODS: We made a retrospective analysis of children older than 2 years of age with chILD who referred to Beijing Children's Hospital from 21 provinces all over China from 2013 to 2018. After excluding pulmonary infection, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis, 133 patients were included and categorized by etiology. Clinical manifestations, high-resolution computed tomography, laboratory data, genetic data and pathologic findings were all collected and reviewed., RESULTS: Systemic disease associated ILD were the most common causes, accounting for 49.6% of the patients, followed by alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD (27%), exposure related ILD (13.5%), and disorders masquerading as ILD (3.8%). In systemic disease associated ILD, in addition to common etiologies such as vasculitis (10.5%) and connective tissue diseases (9.0%), primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) associated ILD (9.8%), interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (6.8%), and metabolic diseases (6.8%) were not rarely found. Some newly reported etiologies such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy, COPA syndrome and STAT3 mutation were included in PID associated ILD. Genetic tests contributed to 15% of the diagnoses which mainly distributed in PID associated ILD, metabolic diseases and surfactant dysfunction disorders, and contributed to the final diagnoses more than lung biopsies (13.5%) and biopsies of rashes or other tissues (12%)., CONCLUSIONS: This study first demonstrated an etiologic spectrum of chILD in Chinese children older than 2 years of age and summarized the approaches to diagnosis. The etiologic spectrum of chILD is expanding with more genetic etiologies being recognized.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disorder that typically affects 2%-5% of pregnant women and is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, especially when the condition is of early onset. Globally, 76 000 women and 500 000 babies die each year from this disorder. Furthermore, women in low-resource countries are at a higher risk of developing PE compared with those in high-resource countries. Although a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of PE remains unclear, the current theory suggests a two-stage process. The first stage is caused by shallow invasion of the trophoblast, resulting in inadequate remodeling of the spiral arteries. This is presumed to lead to the second stage, which involves the maternal response to endothelial dysfunction and imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, resulting in the clinical features of the disorder. Accurate prediction and uniform prevention continue to elude us. The quest to effectively predict PE in the first trimester of pregnancy is fueled by the desire to identify women who are at high risk of developing PE, so that necessary measures can be initiated early enough to improve placentation and thus prevent or at least reduce the frequency of its occurrence. Furthermore, identification of an "at risk" group will allow tailored prenatal surveillance to anticipate and recognize the onset of the clinical syndrome and manage it promptly. PE has been previously defined as the onset of hypertension accompanied by significant proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Recently, the definition of PE has been broadened. Now the internationally agreed definition of PE is the one proposed by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP). According to the ISSHP, PE is defined as systolic blood pressure at >=140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure at >=90 mm Hg on at least two occasions measured 4 hours apart in previously normotensive women and is accompanied by one or more of the following new-onset conditions at or after 20 weeks of gestation: 1.Proteinuria (i.e. >=30 mg/mol protein:creatinine ratio; >=300 mg/24 hour; or >=2 + dipstick); 2.Evidence of other maternal organ dysfunction, including: acute kidney injury (creatinine >=90 mumol/L; 1 mg/dL); liver involvement (elevated transaminases, e.g. alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >40 IU/L) with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain; neurological complications (e.g. eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches, and persistent visual scotomata); or hematological complications (thrombocytopenia-platelet count <150 000/muL, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis); or 3.Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth). It is well established that a number of maternal risk factors are associated with the development of PE: advanced maternal age; nulliparity; previous history of PE; short and long interpregnancy interval; use of assisted reproductive technologies; family history of PE; obesity; Afro-Caribbean and South Asian racial origin; co-morbid medical conditions including hyperglycemia in pregnancy; pre-existing chronic hypertension; renal disease; and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. These risk factors have been described by various professional organizations for the identification of women at risk of PE; however, this approach to screening is inadequate for effective prediction of PE. PE can be subclassified into: 1.Early-onset PE (with delivery at <34+0 weeks of gestation); 2.Preterm PE (with delivery at <37+0 weeks of gestation); 3.Late-onset PE (with delivery at >=34+0 weeks of gestation); 4.Term PE (with delivery at >=37+0 weeks of gestation). These subclassifications are not mutually exclusive. Early-onset PE is associated with a much higher risk of short- and long-term maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Obstetricians managing women with preterm PE are faced with the challenge of balancing the need to achieve fetal maturation in utero with the risks to the mother and fetus of continuing the pregnancy longer. These risks include progression to eclampsia, development of placental abruption and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme, low platelet) syndrome. On the other hand, preterm delivery is associated with higher infant mortality rates and increased morbidity resulting from small for gestational age (SGA), thrombocytopenia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cerebral palsy, and an increased risk of various chronic diseases in adult life, particularly type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Women who have experienced PE may also face additional health problems in later life, as the condition is associated with an increased risk of death from future cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, renal impairment, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. The life expectancy of women who developed preterm PE is reduced on average by 10 years. There is also significant impact on the infants in the long term, such as increased risks of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension in infants born to pre-eclamptic women. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) brought together international experts to discuss and evaluate current knowledge on PE and develop a document to frame the issues and suggest key actions to address the health burden posed by PE. FIGO's objectives, as outlined in this document, are: (1) To raise awareness of the links between PE and poor maternal and perinatal outcomes, as well as to the future health risks to mother and offspring, and demand a clearly defined global health agenda to tackle this issue; and (2) To create a consensus document that provides guidance for the first-trimester screening and prevention of preterm PE, and to disseminate and encourage its use. Based on high-quality evidence, the document outlines current global standards for the first-trimester screening and prevention of preterm PE, which is in line with FIGO good clinical practice advice on first trimester screening and prevention of pre-eclampsia in singleton pregnancy.1 It provides both the best and the most pragmatic recommendations according to the level of acceptability, feasibility, and ease of implementation that have the potential to produce the most significant impact in different resource settings. Suggestions are provided for a variety of different regional and resource settings based on their financial, human, and infrastructure resources, as well as for research priorities to bridge the current knowledge and evidence gap. To deal with the issue of PE, FIGO recommends the following: Public health focus: There should be greater international attention given to PE and to the links between maternal health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) on the Sustainable Developmental Goals agenda. Public health measures to increase awareness, access, affordability, and acceptance of preconception counselling, and prenatal and postnatal services for women of reproductive age should be prioritized. Greater efforts are required to raise awareness of the benefits of early prenatal visits targeted at reproductive-aged women, particularly in low-resource countries. Universal screening: All pregnant women should be screened for preterm PE during early pregnancy by the first-trimester combined test with maternal risk factors and biomarkers as a one-step procedure. The risk calculator is available free of charge at https://fetalmedicine.org/research/assess/preeclampsia. FIGO encourages all countries and its member associations to adopt and promote strategies to ensure this. The best combined test is one that includes maternal risk factors, measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum placental growth factor (PLGF), and uterine artery pulsatility index (UTPI). Where it is not possible to measure PLGF and/or UTPI, the baseline screening test should be a combination of maternal risk factors with MAP, and not maternal risk factors alone. If maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) is measured for routine first-trimester screening for fetal aneuploidies, the result can be included for PE risk assessment. Variations to the full combined test would lead to a reduction in the performance screening. A woman is considered high risk when the risk is 1 in 100 or more based on the first-trimester combined test with maternal risk factors, MAP, PLGF, and UTPI. Contingent screening: Where resources are limited, routine screening for preterm PE by maternal factors and MAP in all pregnancies and reserving measurements of PLGF and UTPI for a subgroup of the population (selected on the basis of the risk derived from screening by maternal factors and MAP) can be considered. Prophylactic measures: Following first-trimester screening for preterm PE, women identified at high risk should receive aspirin prophylaxis commencing at 11-14+6 weeks of gestation at a dose of ~150 mg to be taken every night until 36 weeks of gestation, when delivery occurs, or when PE is diagnosed. Low-dose aspirin should not be prescribed to all pregnant women. In women with low calcium intake (<800 mg/d), either calcium replacement (<=1 g elemental calcium/d) or calcium supplementation (1.5-2 g elemental calcium/d) may reduce the burden of both early- and late-onset PE.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of preterm infants, characterized by lung growth arrest and matrix remodeling. Various animal models provide mechanistic insights in the pathogenesis of BPD. Since there is increasing evidence that genetic susceptibility modifies the response to lung injury, we investigated strain-dependent effects in hyperoxia (HYX)-induced lung injury of newborn mice. To this end, we exposed newborn C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J mice to 85% O2 (HYX) or normoxia (NOX; 21% O2) for 28 days, followed by lung excision for histological and molecular measurements. BL/6J-NOX mice exhibited a lower body and lung weight than BL/6N-NOX mice; hyperoxia reduced body weight in both strains and increased lung weight only in BL/6J-HYX mice. Quantitative histomorphometric analyses revealed reduced alveolar formation in lungs of both strains after HYX, but the effect was greater in BL/6J-HYX mice than BL/6N-HYX mice. Septal thickness was lower in BL/6J-NOX mice than BL/6N-NOX mice but increased in both strains after HYX. Elastic fiber density was significantly greater in BL/6J-HYX mice than BL/6N-HYX mice. Lungs of BL/6J-HYX mice were protected from changes in gene expression of fibrillin-1, fibrillin-2, fibulin-4, fibulin-5, and surfactant proteins seen in BL/6N-HYX mice. Finally, Stat3 was activated by HYX in both strains; in contrast, activation of Smad2 was markedly greater in lungs of BL/6N mice than BL/6J mice after HYX. In summary, we demonstrate strain-dependent differences in lung structure and matrix, alveolar epithelial cell markers, and Smad2 (transforming growth factor beta) signaling in neonatal HYX-induced lung injury. Strain-dependent effects and genetic susceptibility need be taken into consideration for reproducibility and reliability of results in animal models.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a disease of increasing incidence, is related mainly to smoking. Although symptoms only appear at adulthood, the disease can develop from early life events. For example, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which occurs in preterm infants, is characterized by airspace enlargement and could lead to late lung consequences. Once the lesions are established, no curative treatment is available. Stimulating lung regeneration from endogenous stem cells is therefore an exciting research domain, particularly through the activation of the mesenchymal contingent located in the lung stem cell niche.

AB  - As management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) advances, clinicians must continually revise their current practice. We report the fourth update of "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS" by a European panel of experienced neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the end of 2018. Optimising outcome for babies with RDS includes prediction of risk of preterm delivery, need for appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal centre and timely use of antenatal steroids. Delivery room management has become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection including initiation of CPAP and titration of oxygen should be implemented immediately after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of management of RDS, and newer protocols for its use recommend early administration and avoidance of mechanical ventilation. Methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been further developed and may cause less distress and reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease, although minimising time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimising general care of infants with RDS are also essential with good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion and judicious use of antibiotics all being important determinants of best outcome.

AB  - Thirty years ago, there was an emerging appreciation for the significance of oxidative stress in newborn disease. This prompted a renewed interest in the impact of oxygen therapy for the newborn in the delivery room and beyond, especially in premature infants. Today, the complexity of oxidative stress both in normal regulation and pathology is better understood, especially as it relates to neonatal mitochondrial oxidative stress responses to hyperoxia. Mitochondria are recipients of oxidative damage and have a propensity for oxidative self-injury that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neonatal lung diseases. Similarly, both intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and macrosomia are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Additionally, reoxygenation with 100% O2 in a hypoxic-ischemic newborn lamb model increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Moreover, the interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress in the newborn is better understood because of animal studies. Transcriptomic analyses have found a number of genes to be differentially expressed in murine models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Epigenetic changes have also been detected both in animal models of BPD and premature infants exposed to oxygen. Antioxidant therapy to prevent newborn disease has not been very successful; however, new therapeutic principles, like melatonin, are under investigation. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cellular senescence results in cell cycle arrest with secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and remodeling proteins (senescence-associated secretory phenotype; SASP) that have autocrine and paracrine effects on the tissue microenvironment. SASP can promote remodeling, inflammation, infectious susceptibility, angiogenesis, and proliferation, while hindering tissue repair and regeneration. While the role of senescence and the contributions of senescent cells are increasingly recognized in the context of aging and a variety of disease states, relatively less is known regarding the portfolio and influences of senescent cells in normal lung growth and aging per se or in the induction or progression of lung diseases across the age spectrum such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we introduce concepts of cellular senescence, the mechanisms involved in the induction of senescence, and the SASP portfolio that are relevant to lung cells, presenting the potential contribution of senescent cells and SASP to inflammation, hypercontractility, and remodeling/fibrosis: aspects critical to a range of lung diseases. The potential to blunt lung disease by targeting senescent cells using a novel class of drugs (senolytics) is discussed. Potential areas for future research on cellular senescence in the lung are identified.

AB  - Preterm birth is a primary cause of worldwide childhood mortality. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by impaired alveolar and lung vascular development, affects 25-50% of extremely low birth weight (BW; <1kg) infants. Abnormalities in lung function persist into childhood in affected infants and are second only to asthma in terms of childhood respiratory disease healthcare costs. While advances in the medical care of preterm infants have reduced mortality, the incidence of BPD has not decreased in the past 10 years. Reactive oxygen intermediates play a key role in the development of lung disease but, despite promising preclinical therapies, antioxidants have failed to translate into meaningful clinical interventions to decrease the incidence of lung disease in premature infants. In this review we will summarize the state of the art research developments in regards to antioxidants and premature lung disease and discuss the limitations of antioxidant therapies in order to more fully comprehend the reasons why therapeutic antioxidant administration failed to prevent BPD. Finally we will review promising therapeutic strategies and targets. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) driven cytoprotective protein expression. The activation of Nrf2 signaling plays an essential role in preventing cells and tissues from injury induced by oxidative stress. Under the unstressed conditions, natural inhibitor of Nrf2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), traps Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and promotes the degradation of Nrf2 by the 26S proteasome. Nevertheless, stresses including highly oxidative microenvironments, impair the ability of Keap1 to target Nrf2 for ubiquitination and degradation, and induce newly synthesized Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus to bind with ARE. Due to constant exposure to external environments, including diverse pollutants and other oxidants, the redox balance maintained by Nrf2 is fairly important to the airways. To date, researchers have discovered that Nrf2 deletion results in high susceptibility and severity of insults in various models of respiratory diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), respiratory infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and lung cancer. Conversely, Nrf2 activation confers protective effects on these lung disorders. In the present review, we summarize Nrf2 involvement in the pathogenesis of the above respiratory diseases that have been identified by experimental models and human studies and describe the protective effects of Nrf2 inducers on these diseases.

AB  - There is growing evidence that events occurring early in life, both before and after birth, are significantly associated with the risk of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diminished lung function later in life. In fact, from conception to death, a series of continuous, dynamic gene-environment interactions determine 2 fundamental biological processes, namely, lung development and lung aging. Over 130 birth cohorts have been initiated in the last 30 years. Data from these cohorts have improved our understanding of the inception, progression, and persistency of asthma. In this review, we summarize the main data for the early life events proven to determine later development and persistence of asthma, such as maternal atopy and smoking, preterm birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infections, nutrition, obesity, smoking, and other environmental exposures in childhood and adolescence. While some of these factors are obviously impossible to prevent or eliminate, others have been proven to have a protective role, and current research is aimed optimizing them. Available prophylactic measures are also reviewed. In the case of environmental pollution, large scale political interventions successfully managed to decrease contamination levels, leading to improved lung function and lower asthma prevalence in the respective geographical areas. Future research should focus on better understanding these complex interactions in order to develop and enhance effective preventive therapeutic measures.

AB  - The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand pattern recognition receptor that is highly expressed in lung epithelial cells. It helps alveolar epithelial cells to maintain their morphology and specific architecture. However, in various pathophysiological conditions, pulmonary tissues express a supraphysiological level of RAGE and its ligands including advanced glycation end products, high mobility group box 1 proteins, and S100 proteins. On interaction with RAGE, these ligands stimulate downstream signaling that generates inflammation and oxidative stress leading to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancers, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, pneumonia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, and sepsis. Thus, pharmacological agents that can either suppress the production of RAGE or block its biological activity would offer promising therapeutic value against pathogenesis of the aforementioned lungassociated diseases. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the recent progress made in defining the functions of RAGE in lung-associated diseases.

AB  - Aims: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolarization arrest. During alveolarization, alveolar myofibroblasts are thought to migrate into the septal tips and elongate secondary septa. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure has been reported to disrupt directional migration and final location of alveolar myofibroblasts in a rat model of BPD induced by intra-amniotic injection of LPS. However, molecular mechanisms that control directional migration of alveolar myofibroblasts have not so far been investigated clearly. Materials and Methods: We assessed the polarization of myofibroblast using scrape wounding assays combined with Golgi tracking. Transwell migration assay was used to detect the directional migration of myofibroblasts. Pull-down assays were performed to isolate the active GTP-bound form using the RhoA activation assay kits. Western blotting analysis was performed to evaluate the changes in protein expression. Functional analysis was performed via siRNA interference. Results: Here, we showed that LPS might affect the directional migration of myofibroblasts by disturbing the polarization of myofibroblasts. In addition, as a main member of RhoGTPases family which plays a vital role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity, RhoA activity was significantly upregulated in myofibroblasts treated with LPS, while activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was upregulated and overexpression of its ligand, TGF-alpha, in myofibroblasts by LPS treatment. AG1478, an EGFR inhibitor, could abrogate the upregulated RhoA activity of myofibroblasts by LPS and rhTGF-alpha. Moreover, if we knock down 14-3-3beta, LPS and rhTGF-alpha could not activate RhoA and disturb myofibroblasts polarization. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest that LPS exposure may increase RhoA activity of myofibroblasts by TGF-alpha/EGFR/14-3-3beta signaling pathway, and then disturb myofibroblasts polarization and directional migration.

AB  - Respiratory problems have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). In particular, recurrent aspiration, impaired airway clearance, spinal and thoracic deformity, impaired lung function, poor nutritional status, and recurrent respiratory infections negatively affect respiratory status. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia may contribute to pulmonary problems, but asthma is not more common in CP than in the general population. We discuss treatment options for each of these factors. Multiple coexisting and interacting factors that influence the respiratory status of patients with CP should be recognized and effectively addressed to reduce respiratory morbidity and mortality. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Respiratory problems are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Respiratory status in patients with CP is influenced by recurrent aspiration and impaired airway clearance. Spinal and thoracic deformity, impaired lung function, poor nutrition, and respiratory infections also negatively affect respiratory status. These factors should all be addressed to reduce respiratory problems in patients with CP. Copyright © 2018 Mac Keith Press.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize evidence regarding microbial dysbiosis of the airway associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and to explore heterogeneity among studies., STUDY DESIGN: We included studies that evaluated the airway microbiome in preterm infants who developed BPD using culture-independent molecular techniques and reported alpha- and beta-diversity metrics and microbial profiles., RESULTS: The 6 included studies had substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Most studies reported the presence of an airway microbiome early after birth and an evolution in the first weeks of life with increasing bacterial loads. The early airway microbiome was dominated by Staphylococcus and Ureaplasma spp. Two studies reported differences in alpha- and beta- diversity indices in preterm infants with BPD compared with those who did not develop BPD. Increased microbial community turnover, changes in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and decreased Lactobacilli were reported with BPD progression. Most included infants were born by cesarean delivery, and a majority were exposed to postnatal antibiotics. No data regarding feeding human milk or correlations with the development of gut microbiota (gut-lung axis) were available., CONCLUSIONS: Microbial dysbiosis may be associated with BPD progression and severity, and further study of microbiome optimization in preterm infants at risk for BPD is warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the association between thrombocytopenia and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)., METHODS: The case-control study was conducted on preterm newborns with ROP between January 2011 and January 2014, retrospectively. The patients were assigned into two groups: Cases required intervention and controls developed no or Stage I ROP., RESULTS: Eighty-one premature infants with Type I ROP were enrolled to the study with a mean gestational age of 27.6 +/- 2.1 (range: 24-32) weeks and birth weight of 993 +/- 292 (range: 560-1,930) g. Mean follow-up time was 38.3 +/- 2.7 weeks (min: 32 and max: 46 weeks). Cases were individually matched to a set of controls (1:1 ratio). Thrombocytopenia (<150.000/mm) was seen in 58 (71.6%) of the cases with Type I ROP, whereas only 17 (21%) of the controls had thrombocytopenia (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that bronchopulmonary dysplasia and thrombocytopenia were significantly associated with Type I ROP (relative risk [95% confidence interval]: 4.19 [1.47-12] and 6.69 [2.83-15.9], respectively). The thrombocytopenia ratio (P = 0.073), thrombocytopenia 1 week before intervention (P = 0.076) and platelet transfusion ratio (P = 0.062) tended to be higher in Zone I ROP compared with Zone II ROP., CONCLUSION: In our study, there was a significant association between thrombocytopenia and Type I ROP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate effect of budesonide combining Poractant Alfa on preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 preterm infants were involved. pH value, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), and blood gas analysis were evaluated. Peripheral blood was collected and mononuclear cells were isolated. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were detected with laser confocal. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in PBMCs was detected using immunofluorescence. SIRT1 and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 1 (SENP1) were detected with Western blot., RESULTS: Compared with group B, pH value and PO2 were improved significantly in group C and D (p<0.01). Compared with group B, oxygen inhalation duration, rate of having a respirator assisted ventilation, and using pulmonary surfactant (PS) again, and BPD incidence were significantly decreased in other groups (p<0.05). BPD incidence in group D was less than group C (chi2=4.00, p<0.05). Compared with control group, ROS level of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) group was significantly increased, SENP1 was increased, and SIRT1 was decreased in SIRT1 group. Compared with NRDS, when budesonide combined with Poractant Alfa, ROS decreased, SENP1 decreased, SIRT1 nuclear pulp shuttling rate reduced, nuclear SIRT1 increased (p<0.01). Compared with control, ROS level of NRDS group was significantly increased, SENP1 increased, and SIRT1 in nucleus decreased (p<0.05). Compared with NRDS group, when treated with budesonide and Poractant Alfa, ROS levels decreased, SENP1 decreased, nuclear SIRT1 increased (p<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide combining Poractant Alfa can prevent BPD in preterm infants by activating the SIRT1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that adverse early life events can affect long-term health trajectories throughout life. Preterm birth, in particular, is a significant early life event that affects approximately 10% of live births. Worldwide, prematurity is the number one cause of death in children less than 5 years of age and has been shown to disrupt normal lung development with lasting effects into adult life. Along with impaired lung development, interventions used to support gas exchange and other sequelae of prematurity can lead to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is a chronic respiratory disease of infancy characterized by alveolar simplification, small airways disease, and pulmonary vascular changes. Although many survivors of BPD improve with age, survivors of BPD often have chronic lung disease characterized by airflow obstruction and intermittent pulmonary exacerbations. Long-term lung function trajectories as measured by FEV1 can be lower in children and adults with a history BPD. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and manifestations of BPD and its long-term consequences throughout childhood and into adulthood. Available evidence suggests that disrupted lung development, genetic susceptibility and subsequent environment and infectious events that occur in prenatal and postnatal life likely increase the predisposition of children with BPD to develop early onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Caudal anesthesia is a safe and effective technique in children. Some surgical procedures, such as abdominal or inguinal surgeries, could be performed avoiding general anesthesia in newborns and babies, reducing the risk of respiratory depression and neurotoxicity. Our objective is to analyze the experience in a tertial referral center., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried a retrospective study in patients under 1 year of age who underwent abdominal or inguinal procedures under caudal regional anesthesia, between 2016 and 2018. Demographics, diagnosis, comorbidity, surgical procedure, operation time, oral intake, perioperative complications and hospital stay were recorded., RESULTS: We included 87 patients under 1 year of age. In 56 patients (23 males, 33 females) surgery was performed under caudal anesthesia (37 scheduled, 19 urgent). Mean age was 2 months (0-11). Comorbidity: 25 associated prematurity, 3 severe tracheomalacia, 1 apnea and 8 bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Surgical procedures: 34 inguinal hernia repair, 9 incarcerated inguinal hernias, 5 neonatal testicular torsions, 8 pyloromyotomies. Mean operation time was 35 min (15-80) and mean anesthetic time 30 min (20-60). Oral intake started 2 h after surgery in 55 patients. Discharge was given in 24 h (12-36). Complications were not noticed. Any patient needed conversion to general anesthesia., CONCLUSIONS: Caudal anesthesia should be the anesthetic technique of choice in newborns and babies who undergo abdominal or inguinal surgeries, especially in those with comorbidity. This procedure could be performed safely, avoiding respiratory or neurological complications, with a fast recovery of patients and short hospital stay.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. A key histopathological feature of BPD is stunted late lung development, where the process of alveolarization-the generation of alveolar gas exchange units-is impeded, through mechanisms that remain largely unclear. As such, there is interest in the clarification both of the pathomechanisms at play in affected lungs, and the mechanisms of de novo alveoli generation in healthy, developing lungs. A better understanding of normal and pathological alveolarization might reveal opportunities for improved medical management of affected infants. Furthermore, disturbances to the alveolar architecture are a key histopathological feature of several adult chronic lung diseases, including emphysema and fibrosis, and it is envisaged that knowledge about the mechanisms of alveologenesis might facilitate regeneration of healthy lung parenchyma in affected patients. To this end, recent efforts have interrogated clinical data, developed new-and refined existing-in vivo and in vitro models of BPD, have applied new microscopic and radiographic approaches, and have developed advanced cell-culture approaches, including organoid generation. Advances have also been made in the development of other methodologies, including single-cell analysis, metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics, as well as the generation and use of complex mouse genetics tools. The objective of this review is to present advances made in our understanding of the mechanisms of lung alveolarization and BPD over the period 1 January 2017-30 June 2019, a period that spans the 50th anniversary of the original clinical description of BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - The European Pediatric Pulmonary Vascular Disease Network is a registered, non-profit organization that strives to define and develop effective, innovative diagnostic methods and treatment options in all forms of pediatric pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease, including pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, PH associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), persistent PH of the newborn, and related cardiac dysfunction. The executive writing group members conducted searches of the PubMed/MEDLINE bibliographic database (1990-2018) and held face-to-face and web-based meetings. Ten section task forces voted on the updated recommendations, based on the 2016 executive summary. Clinical trials, meta-analyses, guidelines, and other articles that include pediatric data were searched using the term "pulmonary hypertension" and other keywords. Class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) were assigned based on European Society of Cardiology/American Heart Association definitions and on pediatric data only, or on adult studies that included >10% children or studies that enrolled adults with CHD. New definitions by the World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension 2018 were included. We generated 10 tables with graded recommendations (COR/LOE). The topics include diagnosis/monitoring, genetics/biomarkers, cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance/chest computed tomography, associated forms of PH, intensive care unit/lung transplantation, and treatment of pediatric PH. For the first time, a set of specific recommendations on the management of PH in middle- and low-income regions was developed. Taken together, these executive, up-to-date guidelines provide a specific, comprehensive, detailed but practical framework for the optimal clinical care of children and young adults with PH.

AB  - Hyperoxia exposure in premature infants increases the risk of subsequent lung diseases, such as asthma and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Fibroblasts help maintain bronchial and alveolar integrity. Thus, understanding mechanisms by which hyperoxia influences fibroblasts is critical. Cellular senescence is increasingly recognized as important to the pathophysiology of multiple diseases. We hypothesized that clinically relevant moderate hyperoxia (<50% O2) induces senescence in developing fibroblasts. Using primary human fetal lung fibroblasts, we investigated effects of 40% O2 on senescence, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy pathways. Fibroblasts were exposed to 21% or 40% O2 for 7 days with etoposide as a positive control to induce senescence, evaluated by morphological changes, beta-galactosidase activity, and DNA damage markers. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) profile of inflammatory and profibrotic markers was further assessed. Hyperoxia decreased proliferation but increased cell size. SA-beta-gal activity and DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, and marked upregulation of phosphorylated p53 and p21 were noted. Reduced autophagy was noted with hyperoxia. mRNA expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic factors (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-8, MMP3) was elevated by hyperoxia or etoposide. Hyperoxia increased several SASP factors (PAI-1, IL1-alpha, IL1-beta, IL-6, LAP, TNF-alpha). The secretome of senescent fibroblasts promoted extracellular matrix formation by naive fibroblasts. Overall, we demonstrate that moderate hyperoxia enhances senescence in primary human fetal lung fibroblasts with reduced autophagy but not enhanced ER stress. The resulting SASP is profibrotic and may contribute to abnormal repair in the lung following hyperoxia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common chronic respiratory disease in premature infants with growing evidence that genetic factors contribute largely to moderate and severe cases. We assessed by exome sequencing if rare genetic variants could account for extremely severe phenotypes. We selected 6 infants born very preterm with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 8 very preterm born controls for exome sequencing. We filtered whole exome sequencing results to include only rare variants and selected variants and/or genes with variants that were present in at least 2 cases and absent in controls. We selected variants, all heterozygous, in 9 candidate genes, 7 with a putative role in lung development and 2 that displayed 3 variations in 3 different cases, independently of their potential role in lung development. Sequencing of 5 other severe cases for these variants did not replicate our results. Conclusion: In selected preterm born infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and controls, we failed to find any rare variant shared by several infants with an extremely severe phenotype. Our results are not consistent with the role of rare causative variants in bronchopulmonary dysplasia's development and argue for the highly polygenic nature of susceptibility of this disorder.What is Known:* Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a multifactorial disease resulting from complex environmental and genetic interactions occurring in an immature lung.* It is not known whether rare genetic variants in coding regions could account for extreme phenotypes of the disease.What is New:* In a group of infants with an extreme phenotype of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in comparison to controls, no common genetic variants were found, nor did variants that were select in other exome studies in this setting.* These results argue for the highly polygenic nature of susceptibility of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - We aimed to test the hypothesis that determinants of the perinatal clinical exposome related to the underlying etiology of premature birth (PTB) impact differently on select neonatal outcomes. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 377 singleton preterm neonates [gestational age (GA) at birth: 23-34 weeks] separated into three distinct contemporaneous newborn cohorts: i) spontaneous PTB in the setting of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (yes-IAI, n = 116); ii) spontaneous PTB in the absence of IAI (no-IAI, n = 130), and iii) iatrogenic PTB for preeclampsia (iPTB-PE, n = 131). Newborns (n = 372) were followed until death or discharge. Amniotic fluid defensins 1&2 and calgranulins A&C were used as biomarkers of IAI. An algorithm considering cord blood interleukin-6 (IL-6) and haptoglobin (Hp switch-on) was used to assess fetal exposure to IAI. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), early-onset neonatal (EONS) and late-onset (LOS) sepsis, death. Independent risk factors for adverse outcomes were: i) IVH (n = 53): histologic chorioamnionitis, GA, fetal growth restriction, male sex, Hp switch-on; ii) PVL (n = 11): cord blood IL-6; iii) NEC (n = 25), GA; iv) BPD (n = 53): ventilator support, need for surfactant, GA; v) ROP (n = 79): ventilator support, Hp switch-on, GA; vi) fetal and neonatal death (n = 31): GA, amniotic fluid IL-6; vii) suspect EONS (n = 92): GA, Hp switch-on; viii) LOS (n = 81): GA. Our findings are applicable to pregnancies delivered between 23 and 34 weeks' gestation in the setting of IAI and PE, and suggest that GA and inflammatory intrauterine environment play key roles in occurrence of IVH, PVL, ROP, death, EONS and LOS. Postnatal determinants seem to play major role in NEC and BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a disorder with a multifactorial etiology and highly variable clinical phenotype. Several traditional biomarkers have been identified, but due to the complex disease phenotype, these biomarkers have low predictive accuracy for BPD. In recent years, newer technologies have facilitated the in-depth and unbiased analysis of 'big data' in delineating the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and mechanisms of diseases. Novel systems-biology based 'omic' approaches, including but not limited to genomics, microbiomics, proteomics, and metabolomics may help define the multiple cellular and humoral interactions that regulate normal as well as abnormal lung development and response to injury that are the hallmarks of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major cause of late morbidities and death after preterm birth. BPD is characterized by an arrest of vascular and alveolar growth and high risk for pulmonary hypertension; yet mechanisms contributing to its pathogenesis and early strategies to prevent BPD are poorly understood. Strong epidemiologic studies have shown that the "new BPD" reflects the long-lasting impact of antenatal factors on lung development, partly due to placental dysfunction, as reflected in recent data from animal models. Improved understanding of mechanisms through which antenatal stress alters placental function and contributes to BPD may lead to preventive therapies. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Myo-inositol is a highly abundant stereoisomer of the inositol family of sugar alcohols and forms the structural basis for a variety of polyphosphate derivatives including second messengers and membrane phospholipids. These derivatives regulate numerous cell processes including gene transcription, membrane excitability, vesicular trafficking, intracellular calcium signaling, and neuronal growth and development. Myo-inositol can be formed endogenously from the breakdown of glucose, is found in a variety of foods including breastmilk and is commercially available as a nutritional supplement. Abnormal myo-inositol metabolism has been shown to underlie the pathophysiology of a variety of clinical conditions including Down Syndrome, traumatic brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Several animal studies have shown that myo-inositol may play a critical role in development of both the central and peripheral respiratory neural control system; a notable example is the neonatal apnea and respiratory insufficiency that manifests in a mouse model of myo-inositol depletion, an effect that is also postnatally lethal. This review focuses on myo-inositol (and some of its derivatives) and how it may play a role in respiratory neural control; we also discuss clinical evidence demonstrating a link between serum myo-inositol levels and the incidence of intermittent hypoxemia (IH) events (a surrogate measure of apnea of prematurity (AOP)) in preterm infants. Further, there are both animal and human infant studies that have demonstrated respiratory benefits following supplementation with myo-inositol, which highlights the prospects that nutritional requirements are important for appropriate development and maturation of the respiratory system.

AB  - Premature infants have chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) that increases morbidity, and the youngest and the smallest premature infants are at the greatest risk. The combination of lung injury from inflammation/oxidative stress causing low functional residual capacity combined with frequent short apneas leads to CIH. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipose-derived adipokine that protects the lung from inflammation and oxidative stress. Premature and small for gestational age (SGA) infants have minimal body fat and low levels of circulating APN. To begin to understand the potential role of APN in lung protection during lung development, we characterized the developmental profile of APN and APN receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) protein and mRNA expression in the newborn rat lung at fetal day (FD) 19, and postnatal days (PD) 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Protein levels in lung homogenates were measured by western blot analyses; relative mRNA expression was detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR); and serum high molecular weight (HMW) APN was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: APN protein and mRNA levels were lowest at FD19 and PD1, increased 2.2-fold at PD4, decreased at PD10, and then increased again at PD21. AdipoR1 protein and mRNA levels peaked at PD1, followed by a threefold drop by PD4, and remained low until PD21. AdipoR2 protein and mRNA levels also peaked at PD1, but remained high at PD4, followed by a 1.7-fold drop by PD10 that remained low by PD21. Serum APN levels detected by ELISA did not differ from PD4 to PD28. To date, this is the first report characterizing APN and APN receptor protein and mRNA expression in the rat lung during development. The developmental stage of the newborn rat lung models that of the premature human infant; both are in the saccular stage of lung development. In the newborn rat lung, alveolarization begins at PD4, peaks at PD10, and ends at PD21. Importantly, we found that AdipoR1 receptor protein and mRNA expression is lowest during lung alveolarization (PD4 to PD21). Thus, we speculate that low levels of AdipoR1 during lung alveolarization contributes to the increased susceptibility to developing acute lung edema and chronic lung injury such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature human infants.

AB  - During the perinatal period, free radicals (FRs) are involved in several physiological roles such as the cellular responses to noxia, the defense against infectious agents, the regulation of cellular signaling function, and the induction of a mitogenic response. However, the overproduction of FRs and the insufficiency of an antioxidant mechanism result in oxidative stress (OS) which represents a deleterious process and an important mediator of damage to the placenta and the developing fetus. After birth, OS can be magnified by other predisposing conditions such as hypoxia, hyperoxia, ischemia, hypoxia ischemia-reperfusion, inflammation, and high levels of nonprotein-bound iron. Newborns are particularly susceptible to OS and oxidative damage due to the increased generation of FRs and the lack of adequate antioxidant protection. This impairment of the oxidative balance has been thought to be the common factor of the so-called "free radical related diseases of prematurity," including retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, kidney damage, and oxidative hemolysis. In this review, we provide an update focused on the factors influencing these diseases refining the knowledge about the role of OS in their pathogenesis and the current evidences of such relationship. Mechanisms governing FR formation and subsequent OS may represent targets for counteracting tissue damage.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that mainly affects premature babies who require ventilator support. The pathogenesis of BPD is complex but includes vascular maldevelopment, alveolarization arrest, and lung inflammation. There is no cure for BPD. Clinical care is limited to supportive respiratory measures. A population of stem-like cells derived from placental membranes, human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs), has shown therapeutic promise in preclinical models of BPD. With a view to future efficacy trials, we undertook a first-in-human clinical trial of hAECs in babies with BPD to assess the safety of these cells. In a single-center, open-label phase I trial, we administered allogeneic hAECs (1 x 106 per kilogram bodyweight) by intravenous infusion to six premature babies with BPD. The primary outcomes of the study were focused on safety, including local site reaction, anaphylaxis, infection, features of rejection, or tumor formation. Outcomes to discharge from neonatal unit were studied. The hAECs were well tolerated. In the first baby, there was transient cardiorespiratory compromise during cell administration consistent with a pulmonary embolic event. Following changes to cell administration methods, including introduction of an inline filter, and reducing the cell concentration and the rate of cell infusion, no such events were observed in the subsequent five babies. We did not see evidence of any other adverse events related to cell administration. Allogeneic hAECs can be safely infused into babies with established BPD. Future randomized clinical trials to assess efficacy in this patient population are justified. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:628-635.

AB  - With the increase in the rescue success rate of critically ill preterm infants and extremely preterm infants, the incidence rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is increasing year by year. BPD has a high mortality rate and high possibility of sequelae, which greatly affects the quality of life of preterm infants and brings a heavy burden to their families, and so the treatment of BPD is of vital importance. At present, no consensus has been reached on the treatment measures for BPD. However, recent studies have shown that early application of caffeine can prevent BPD. With reference to the latest studies on the effect of caffeine in the prevention of BPD, this article reviews the mechanism of action of caffeine in reducing pulmonary inflammation, improving morphological abnormalities of lung injury, reducing oxidative stress injury, and improving pulmonary function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of pediatric bronchiolitis and pneumonia worldwide. Risk factors for high mortality and prolonged morbidity after RSV infection include premature birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, and Down syndrome. However, some previously healthy, full-term children who are infected with RSV also require hospitalization and even experience severe sequelae or death., CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present the case of an RSV-associated death of a child who was born at full-term and developed normally up to the age of 2 years old. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurred within 3 days after the onset of symptoms, which included cough and high fever. Complete brain edema was prominent, and encephalopathy was developing. Viral antigen detection and microbiome analyses of oral swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens verified an RSV infection, while bacterial culture of blood specimens yielded negative results. The RSV strain detected in this patient was subtyped as RSVB9, and no mutation was found in the six antigenic sites for targeted drugs or vaccines., CONCLUSIONS: The patient had a severe infection associated with RSV, which was very likely the cause of her central nervous system infection and acute neurological complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between epigenetic maturity of extremely preterm babies (born at less than 28 weeks of gestation), neonatal interventions, and respiratory outcomes, including the administration of surfactant and postnatal corticosteroids, duration of assisted ventilation, and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., STUDY DESIGN: DNA was extracted from neonatal blood spots collected after birth from 143 extremely preterm infants born 1991-1992 in Victoria, Australia and used to determined DNA methylation (DNAm). A DNAm based gestational age was determined using our previously published method. The residual of DNAm gestational age and clinically estimated gestational age (referred to as "gestational age acceleration") was used as a measure to assess developmental maturity. Associations between gestational age acceleration and respiratory interventions and morbidities were determined., RESULTS: Infants with higher gestational age acceleration were less likely to receive surfactant (P = .009) or postnatal corticosteroids (P = .008), had fewer days of assisted ventilation (P = .01), and had less BPD (P = .02). Respiratory measures are known to correlate with gestational age; however, models comparing each with clinically estimated gestational age were improved by the addition of the gestational age acceleration measure in the model., CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age acceleration correlates with respiratory interventions and outcomes of extremely preterm babies. Surfactant and postnatal corticosteroid use, assisted ventilation days, and BPD rates were all lower in babies who were epigenetically more mature than their obstetrically estimated gestational age. This suggests that gestational age acceleration is a clinically relevant metric of developmental maturity. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a frequent complication following preterm birth, affecting respiratory health throughout life. Transcriptome analysis in a preterm rabbit model for BPD revealed dysregulation of key genes for inflammation, vascular growth and lung development in animals exposed to hyperoxia, which could be prevented by simvastatin., METHODS: Preterm rabbits were randomized to either normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) and within each condition to treatment with 5 mg/kg simvastatin daily or control. Lung function, structure and mRNA-expression was assessed on day 7., RESULTS: Simvastatin partially prevented the effect of hyperoxia on lung function, without altering alveolar structure or inflammation. A trend towards a less fibrotic phenotype was noted in simvastatin-treated pups, and airways were less muscularized. Most importantly, simvastatin completely prevented hyperoxia-induced arterial remodeling, in association with partial restoration of VEGFA and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression. Simvastatin however decreased survival in pups exposed to normoxia, but not to hyperoxia., CONCLUSION: Repurposing of simvastatin could be an advantageous therapeutic strategy for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other developmental lung diseases with pulmonary vascular disease. The increased mortality in the treated normoxia group however limits the translational value at this dose and administration route.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence of congenital CMV infection (cCMV) in very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWI) and to evaluate epidemiological characteristics of VLBWI with antiviral therapy (AT)., METHODS: CMV-specific PCR in umbilical cord tissue was performed (n=3330). Univariate analyses and logistic regression models were used to identify associations with outcome., RESULTS: 22/3330 VLBWI received AT (0.66%). 4 of these (0.12%) were PCR positive, with 2 VLBWI showing pathological screening for hearing loss. VLBWI with AT and negative PCR had significantly reduced mean birth weight (BW) and higher rates of small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Clinical sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), use of reserve antibiotics (RA) and treatment for retinopathy of prematurity were significantly increased. We further observed a higher need of transfusion of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma and platelets. Logistic regression (controlled for gender, gestational age, SGA and BW) showed associations for AT and BPD (OR 3.4 [1.2-10.1], p=0.024), RA (OR 20.4 [4.2-98.9], p<=0.001), transfusions of RBC (OR 11.9 [1.3-105.7], p=0.026) and platelets (OR 8.7 [2.9-26.4], p<=0.001)., DISCUSSION: All VLBWI with positive PCR received AT. We hypothesize from our data by assuming a postnatal aquired CMV infection in VLBWI with AT and negative PCR that VLBWI born SGA have a different risk profile., CONCLUSION: Further prospective studies concerning postnatal transmission should take VLBWI born SGA into account and should study the impact of infection on short- and long-term complications in this supposed vulnerable group.

AB  - Chronic respiratory morbidity is a common complication of premature birth, generally defined by the presence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, both clinically and in trials of respiratory therapies. However, recent data have highlighted that bronchopulmonary dysplasia does not correlate with chronic respiratory morbidity in older children born preterm. Longitudinally evaluating pulmonary morbidity from early life through to childhood provides a more rational method of defining the continuum of chronic respiratory morbidity of prematurity, and offers new insights into the efficacy of neonatal respiratory interventions. The changing nature of preterm lung disease suggests that a multimodal approach using dynamic lung function assessment will be needed to assess the efficacy of a neonatal respiratory therapy and predict the long-term respiratory consequences of premature birth. Our aim is to review the literature regarding the long-term respiratory outcomes of neonatal respiratory strategies, the difficulties of assessing dynamic lung function in infants, and potential new solutions.

AB  - AIM: Inflammation is a major factor in the pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and it contributes to accelerated telomere shortening and cellular ageing. This study aimed to determine its effect on telomere length and lung function in school-aged children born preterm with BPD., METHODS: We examined 29 children with BPD, born preterm in Stockholm county 1998-99, along with 28 children with allergic asthma born at term matched for age and gender. At 10 years of age, we measured relative telomere length (RTL) in blood by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, lung function by spirometry and inflammation by fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood cytokines., RESULTS: RTL was not different in preterm born with BPD compared to term born children with asthma. The gender effect was strong in both groups; girls had significantly longer median RTL than boys (1.8 versus 1.5, p < 0.01). Short RTL was associated with low forced expiratory flow, also after adjusting for gender, but was not affected by severity of BPD or ongoing inflammation., CONCLUSION: Telomere length was similar in 10-year-old children born preterm with a history of BPD and term born children with allergic asthma. However, impaired lung function and male gender were associated with short telomeres. Copyright ©2018 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Newborn admission temperature is a strong predictor of outcomes across all gestations. Hypothermia immediately after birth remains a worldwide issue and, if prolonged, is associated with harm. Keeping preterm infants warm is difficult even when recommended routine thermal care guidelines are followed in the delivery room., OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room, compared with routine thermal care or any other single/combination of intervention(s) also designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room., SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 June 2016), Embase (1980 to 30 June 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 June 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials., SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials using randomised or quasi-randomised allocations to test interventions designed to prevent hypothermia (apart from 'routine' thermal care) applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room for infants at < 37 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight <= 2500 grams., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Cochrane Neonatal methods when performing data collection and analysis., MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-five studies across 15 comparison groups met the inclusion criteria, categorised as: barriers to heat loss (18 studies); external heat sources (three studies); and combinations of interventions (four studies). Barriers to heat loss Plastic wrap or bag versus routine carePlastic wraps improved core body temperature on admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or up to two hours after birth (mean difference (MD) 0.58degreeC, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.66; 13 studies; 1633 infants), and fewer infants had hypothermia on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.72; typical risk reduction (RD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.20; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 4, 95% CI 4 to 5; 10 studies; 1417 infants). Risk of hyperthermia on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth was increased in infants in the wrapped group (typical RR 3.91, 95% CI 2.05 to 7.44; typical RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 17 to 50; 12 studies; 1523 infants), but overall, fewer infants receiving plastic wrap were outside the normothermic range (typical RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81; typical RD -0.20, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.15; NNTH 5, 95% CI 4 to 7; five studies; 1048 infants). Evidence was insufficient to suggest that plastic wraps or bags significantly reduce risk of death during hospital stay or other major morbidities, with the exception of reducing risk of pulmonary haemorrhage.Evidence of practices regarding permutations on this general approach is still emerging and has been based on the findings of only one or two small studies.External heat sourcesEvidence is emerging on the efficacy of external heat sources, including skin-to-skin care (SSC) versus routine care (one study; 31 infants) and thermal mattress versus routine care (two studies; 126 infants). SSC was shown to be effective in reducing risk of hypothermia when compared with conventional incubator care for infants with birth weight >= 1200 and <= 2199 grams (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64; RD -0.56, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.27; NNTB 2, 95% CI 1 to 4). Thermal (transwarmer) mattress significantly kept infants <= 1500 grams warmer (MD 0.65degreeC, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94) and reduced the incidence of hypothermia on admission to the NICU, with no significant difference in hyperthermia risk.Combinations of interventionsTwo studies (77 infants) compared thermal mattresses versus plastic wraps or bags for infants at <= 28 weeks' gestation. Investigators reported no significant differences in core body temperature nor in the incidence of hypothermia, hyperthermia, or core body temperature outside the normothermic range on admission to the NICU.Two additional studies (119 infants) compared plastic bags and thermal mattresses versus plastic bags alone for infants at < 31 weeks' gestation. Meta-analysis of these two studies showed improvement in core body temperature on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth, but an increase in hyperthermia. Data show no significant difference in the risk of having a core body temperature outside the normothermic range on admission to the NICU nor in the risk of other reported morbidities., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of moderate quality shows that use of plastic wraps or bags compared with routine care led to higher temperatures on admission to NICUs with less hypothermia, particularly for extremely preterm infants. Thermal mattresses and SSC also reduced hypothermia risk when compared with routine care, but findings are based on two or fewer small studies. Caution must be taken to avoid iatrogenic hyperthermia, particularly when multiple interventions are used simultaneously. Limited evidence suggests benefit and no evidence of harm for most short-term morbidity outcomes known to be associated with hypothermia, including major brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis, and nosocomial infection. Many observational studies have shown increased mortality among preterm hypothermic infants compared with those who maintain normothermia, yet evidence is insufficient to suggest that these interventions reduce risk of in-hospital mortality across all comparison groups. Hypothermia may be a marker for illness and poorer outcomes by association rather than by causality. Limitations of this review include small numbers of identified studies; small sample sizes; and variations in methods and definitions used for hypothermia, hyperthermia, normothermia, routine care, and morbidity, along with lack of power to detect effects on morbidity and mortality across most comparison groups. Future studies should: be adequately powered to detect rarer outcomes; apply standardised morbidity definitions; focus on longer-term outcomes, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is potentially one of the most devastating conditions in premature infants with longstanding consequences involving multiple organ systems including adverse effects on pulmonary function and neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we review recent studies in the field to summarize the progress made in understanding in the pathophysiology, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of BPD in the last decade. The work reviewed includes the progress in understanding its pathobiology, genomic studies, ventilatory strategies, outcomes, and therapeutic interventions. We expect that this review will help guide clinicians to treat premature infants at risk for BPD better and lead researchers to initiate further studies in the field.

AB  - The metabolism of nutrient substrates, including glucose, glutamine, and fatty acids, provides acetyl-CoA for the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy, as well as metabolites for the biosynthesis of biomolecules, including nucleotides, proteins, and lipids. It has been shown that metabolism of glucose, fatty acid, and glutamine plays important roles in modulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, senescence, and inflammatory responses. All of these cellular processes contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. Recent studies demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming occurs in patients with and animal models of chronic lung diseases, suggesting that metabolic dysregulation may participate in the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases. In this review, we briefly discuss the catabolic pathways for glucose, glutamine, and fatty acids, and focus on how metabolic reprogramming of these pathways impacts cellular functions and leads to the development of these chronic lung diseases. We also highlight how targeting metabolic pathways can be utilized in the prevention and treatment of these diseases.

AB  - Macrophages, circulating in the blood or concatenated into different organs and tissues constitute the first barrier against any disease. They are foremost controllers of both innate and acquired immunity, healthy tissue homeostasis, vasculogenesis and congenital metabolism. Two hallmarks of macrophages are diversity and plasticity due to which they acquire a wobbling array of phenotypes. These phenotypes are appropriately synchronized responses to a variety of different stimuli from either the tissue microenvironment or - microbes or their products. Based on the phenotype, macrophages are classified into classically activated/(M1) and alternatively activated/(M2) which are further sub-categorized into M2a, M2b, M2c and M2d based upon gene expression profiles. Macrophage phenotype metamorphosis is the regulating factor in initiation, progression, and termination of numerous inflammatory diseases. Several transcriptional factors and other factors controlling gene expression such as miRNAs contribute to the transformation of macrophages at different points in different diseases. Understanding the mechanisms of macrophage polarization and modulation of their phenotypes to adjust to the micro environmental conditions might provide us a great prospective for designing novel therapeutic strategy. In view of the above, this review summarises the activation of macrophages, the factors intricated in activation along with benefaction of macrophage polarization in response to microbial infections, pulmonary toxicity, lung injury and other inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary dysplasia (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma and sepsis, along with the existing efforts to develop therapies targeting this facet of macrophage biology.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation represents the next breakthrough in the treatment of currently intractable and devastating neonatal disorders with complex multifactorial etiologies, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Absent engraftment and direct differentiation of transplanted MSCs, and the "hit-and-run" therapeutic effects of these MSCs suggest that their pleiotropic protection might be attributable to paracrine activity via the secretion of various biologic factors rather than to regenerative activity. The transplanted MSCs, therefore, exert their therapeutic effects not by acting as "stem cells," but rather by acting as "paracrine factors factory." The MSCs sense the microenvironment of the injury site and secrete various paracrine factors that serve several reparative functions, including antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antifibrotic, and/or antibacterial effects in response to environmental cues to enhance regeneration of the damaged tissue. Therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs might be dependent on their paracrine potency. In this review, we focus on recent investigations that elucidate the specifically regulated paracrine mechanisms of MSCs by injury type and discuss potential strategies to enhance paracrine potency, and thus therapeutic efficacy, of transplanted MSCs, including determining the appropriate source and preconditioning strategy for MSCs and the route and timing of their administration.

AB  - Lung diseases remain one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Cell therapy and regenerative medicine have the potential to revolutionize the management of life-threatening and debilitating lung diseases that currently lack effective treatments. Over the past decade, the repair capabilities of stem/progenitor cells have been harnessed to prevent/rescue lung damage in experimental neonatal lung diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells and amnion epithelial cells exert pleiotropic effects and represent ideal therapeutic cells for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a multifactorial disease. Endothelial progenitor cells are optimally suited to promote lung vascular growth and attenuate pulmonary hypertension in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia or a vascular bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are one of the most exciting breakthroughs of the past decade. Patient-specific iPSCs can be derived from somatic cells and differentiated into any cell type. iPSCs can be capitalized upon to develop personalized regenerative cell products for surfactant protein deficiencies-lethal lung disorders without treatment-that affect a single gene in a single cell type and thus lend themselves to phenotype-specific cell replacement. While the clinical translation has begun, more needs to be learned about the biology of these repair cells to make this translation successful.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics (ATB) are drugs widely used in hospitalized newborns. The indiscriminate use of ATBs promote the rise of resistant bacteria to the most commonly indicated antimicrobials. In addition, ATB prescription presents associations to morbidity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, late sepsis and even death. All of the above leads to an increase in health care costs., AIM: To record and to evaluate trends of antibiotic use over time in hospitalized NB in the Neonatology Unit at Dr. Sotero del Rio Hospital, in order to objectify the changes in the usual practice of the ATM indication. A secondary objective was to assess its impact on antimicrobial resistance., METHODS: Cohort, observational, prospective unicenter study which included all hospitalized patients between January 2011 and December 2014. Birth weight, hospitalization days, ATB indication and days of ATB use were recorded for each patient. The use of ATB was quantified by means of different rates; days of indication of one or more ATBs for global consumption (RUA), total sum of days of use (TSUA) and for the most frequently used ATBs. Each calculated rate for 100 days hospitalized. In addition, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the most frequently isolated bacteria in our service: coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (SCN) and Gram-negative bacilli (BGN) were recorded continuously., RESULTS: The 34.7% of the hospitalized patients received some type of antimicrobial agent. ATBs were 32.3% of medicines used. The most widely used was ampicillin (with 20.2% of the total) and cefadroxyl (with 11.6%). The RUA did not change during the study time, but STUA decreased by 10.7% between 2011 and 2014 with p < 0.05. When subgroup analyzes were divided by weight ranges, in the < 750 g group, the use of vancomycin decreased in use by 9.9% and an increase of 18.8% for metronidazole was observed. On the other hand, there was an increase in the use of the piperacillin-tazobactam regimen in the range > 1,500 g. When evaluating antimicrobial susceptibility, there was a decrease in susceptibility for oxacillin in SCN between 2011 and 2014 from 27% to 10.3% respectively. In addition, for Gram negative there was a decrease from 76.9% to 40.5% in susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins, mainly due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, which became the predominantly isolated BGN with an increase of 6.7% to 50% between 2011 and 2014, respectively. For K. pneumoniae the loss of susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins decreased from 77% to 22%. Finally, amikacin showed an activity over 85% in all BGNs between 2011 and 2014., CONCLUSIONS: It is advisable to plan and to maintain a continuous record of ATB consumption, as well as therapy and prophylaxis, being categorized by ATB type and range of newborn weight. It is of considerable importance to analyze and to evaluate the susceptibility of microorganisms. It is essential that an interdisciplinary team prepare this recording, and to continuously provide feedback to professionals who maintain the functioning of neonatal care units.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of medications to treat respiratory conditions of extreme prematurity is often based upon studies of adults or children over 2 years of age. Little is known about the spectrum of medications used or dosing ranges. To inform the design of future studies, we conducted a prospective analysis of respiratory medication exposure among 832 extremely low gestational age neonates., METHODS: The prematurity and respiratory outcomes program (PROP) enrolled neonates less than 29-week gestation from 6 centers incorporating 13 clinical sites. We collected recorded daily "respiratory" medications given along with dosing information through 40-week postmenstrual age or neonatal intensive care unit discharge if earlier., RESULTS: PROP participants were exposed to a wide range of respiratory medications, often at doses beyond published recommendations. Nearly 50% received caffeine and furosemide beyond published recommendations for cumulative dose. Those who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia were more likely to receive treatment with respiratory medications. However, more than 30% of PROP subjects that did not develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia also were treated with diuretics, systemic steroids, and other respiratory medications., CONCLUSION: Extremely preterm neonates in PROP were exposed to high doses of medications at levels known to generate significant adverse effects. With limited evidence for efficacy, there is an urgent need for controlled trials in this vulnerable patient population. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 122-129. Despite developments in the perinatal and neonatal care, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is still the most frequently seen long-term complication in preterm infants. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the association between the development of BPD and serial measurements of IGF-1 levels and their relationship with levels of IGF-1 and cytokine in tracheal aspirate fluids. A total of 40 premature infants, born at a gestational age of <= 32 weeks, were enrolled in the study. On postnatal day-1, 3, 7, 21 and 28 serum IGF-1 levels and IGF-1 levels, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels in tracheal aspirate fluid samples of intubated cases were examined. Mean gestational age of 40 patients included in the study was 29.41 +/- 2.23 weeks, and their mean birth weight was 1,256.85 +/- 311.48 g. BPD was detected in 35% of cases. Mean gestational week and birth weight of the cases that developed BPD were 30 +/- 3 weeks and 1,150 +/- 295 g, respectively. Serum IGF-1 levels on postnatal day-1, 3, 7, 21 and 28 in cases who developed BPD were significantly lower when compared with those without BPD (p < 0.01). Levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha in tracheal aspirate samples were significantly higher in cases with BPD compared to those without BPD (p < 0.05). IGF-1 levels in tracheal aspirate fluid samples did not differ significantly based on the presence of BPD (p > 0.05). Severity of BPD was associated with decreased serum IGF-1 levels and increased cytokine levels in tracheal aspirate samples.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of primarily premature infants that results from an imbalance between lung injury and repair in the developing lung. BPD is the most common respiratory morbidity in preterm infants, which affects nearly 10, 000 neonates each year in the United States. Over the last two decades, the incidence of BPD has largely been unchanged; however, the pathophysiology has changed with the substantial improvement in the respiratory management of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. Here we have attempted to comprehensively review and summarize the current literature on the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of BPD. Our goal is to provide insight to help further progress in preventing and managing severe BPD in the ELBW infants. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of lung development is to generate an organ of gas exchange that provides both a thin gas diffusion barrier and a large gas diffusion surface area, which concomitantly generates a steep gas diffusion concentration gradient. As such, the lung is perfectly structured to undertake the function of gas exchange: a large number of small alveoli provide extensive surface area within the limited volume of the lung, and a delicate alveolo-capillary barrier brings circulating blood into close proximity to the inspired air. Efficient movement of inspired air and circulating blood through the conducting airways and conducting vessels, respectively, generates steep oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration gradients across the alveolo-capillary barrier, providing ideal conditions for effective diffusion of both gases during breathing. The development of the gas exchange apparatus of the lung occurs during the second phase of lung development-namely, late lung development-which includes the canalicular, saccular, and alveolar stages of lung development. It is during these stages of lung development that preterm-born infants are delivered, when the lung is not yet competent for effective gas exchange. These infants may develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a syndrome complicated by disturbances to the development of the alveoli and the pulmonary vasculature. It is the objective of this review to update the reader about recent developments that further our understanding of the mechanisms of lung alveolarization and vascularization and the pathogenesis of BPD and other neonatal lung diseases that feature lung hypoplasia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a frequent and disabling consequence of preterm birth, despite the recent advances in neonatal intensive care. There is a need to further improve outcomes and many novel therapeutic or preventive strategies are therefore investigated in animal models. We discuss in this review the aspects of human BPD pathophysiology and phenotype, which ideally should be mimicked by an animal model for this disease. Prematurity remains the common denominator in the heterogeneous spectrum of human BPD, and preterm animal models thus have a clear translational advantage. Additional factors, like excessive oxygen, mechanical ventilation and infection, which frequently have been studied in animal models, can contribute to preterm lung injury however are not indispensable to develop BPD. The phenotype of human BPD is characterized by alveolar developmental arrest with extracellular matrix remodeling, signs of obstructive airway disease and pulmonary vascular disease. Many animal models mimic this phenotype and have their place in BPD research, but results should be interpreted bearing in mind the specific advantages and disadvantages of the model. Term mice and rats are well suited for basic explorative research on specific disease mechanisms, essential for the generation of new hypotheses, while the larger ventilated preterm baboons and lambs provide a good platform for the ultimate translation of these strategies towards clinical application. The preterm rabbit model seems a promising model as it the smallest model that includes a factor of prematurity and has a unique position between the small and large animal models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis, or infiltration of the chorioamnion by neutrophils, is a risk factor associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Increased neutrophil elastase levels are observed in the tracheal aspirates of these patients., AIMS: To examine the effects of early administration of the selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor sivelestat, which is used to treat acute lung injury in adults, on bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely premature infants., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SUBJECTS: This study included extremely low-birth-weight infants born at a gestational age<28weeks. Patients were divided into groups based on the receipt of sivelestat., OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia-free survival at a postmenstrual age of 36weeks, and the secondary outcomes included various clinically significant factors of neonatal mortality and morbidity and adverse events., RESULTS: Of the 1031 included neonates, 124 (12.0%) were treated with sivelestat. Significant differences between the groups were noted for gestational age, delivery method, fetal number, the frequency of chorioamnionitis, immunoglobulin M levels, and WBC counts. No differences were identified concerning the bronchopulmonary dysplasia-free survival rate at a postmenstrual age of 36weeks (adjusted odds ratio for sivelestat to control, 0.83; 95% confidence interval=0.53-1.30). Secondary outcomes did not significantly differ between the groups., CONCLUSIONS: In extremely premature infants, early sivelestat use was not associated with an improved rate of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia at a postmenstrual age of 36weeks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diuretics are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), despite minimal data regarding the safety and efficacy of their use in the neonatal population. Off-label diuretic therapy is used in preterm and full-term infants to both optimize kidney function and improve respiratory status., PURPOSE: This article examines the literature specific to the impact of diuretic therapy in the NICU and compares the benefits versus risks of utilization as they pertain to the prevention and treatment of renal and pulmonary dysfunction in this population., METHODS/SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive literature search of online databases was performed, utilizing: CINAHL via EBSCO, PubMed, and ProQuest. Full-text, peer-reviewed, clinical trials, and review articles published in the English language between 2005 and 2015 were searched., FINDINGS/RESULTS: Diuretics rank as the seventh most frequently prescribed medication in the NICU. More than 8% of all NICU patients and 37% of infants born at less than 32 gestational weeks and weighing less than 1500 g are exposed to diuretics. Benefits include lung fluid resorption acceleration, improved urine output, fluid retention counteraction, and augmentation of physiologic weight loss., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Diuretics are currently utilized in the NICU at an alarming rate, without adequate clinical trials regarding their safety and efficacy of use., IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Updated studies are needed regarding short- and long-term outcomes of diuretic use, as well as overall general outcome data regarding the impact and evaluation of diuretic usage in the NICU population.

AB  - Caffeine is the most frequently used medication in the neonatal intensive care unit. It is used for the prevention and treatment of apnea, although this has been associated with lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and patent ductus arteriosus as well as intact survival at 18-21 months of life. Although neurodevelopmental advantage was no longer statistically significant at age 5 years, caffeine was associated with sustained improvement in co-ordination and less gross motor impairment than placebo. The mechanism of action of caffeine on prevention of apnea and activation of breathing seems to be through central inhibition of adenosine receptors. However, its impact on BPD and neurodevelopmental outcomes might be induced through its effects as anti-inflammatory mediator, protection of white matter, and induction of surfactant protein B. Whereas long-term studies have documented the safety of caffeine as used in current practice, further studies are clearly needed to identify optimum dosing, and time of starting and discontinuing caffeine.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic illness that usually originates in preterm newborns. Generally, BPD is a consequence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) which, in turn, comes from the early arrest of lung development and the lack of pulmonary surfactant. The need of oxygen therapy to overcome premature newborns' compromised respiratory function generates an increasing amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the onset of sustained oxidative stress (OS) status, and inflammation in the pulmonary alveoli deputies to respiratory exchanges. BPD is a severe and potentially life-threatening disorder that in the most serious cases, can open the way to neurodevelopmental delay. More importantly, there is no adequate intervention to hamper or treat BPD. This perspective article seeks to review the most recent and relevant literature describing the very early stages of BPD and hyperoxic lung injuries focussing on nuclear factor erythroid derived 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) axis. Indeed, Nrf2/HO1 activation in response to OS induced lung injury in preterm concurs to the induction of certain number of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxification pathways that seem to be more powerful than the activation of one single antioxidant gene. These elicited protective effects are able to counteract/mitigate all multifaceted aspects of the disease and may support novel approaches for the management of BPD. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1 (sFlt-1)/placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio has been studied extensively as a predictive marker for pre-eclampsia. However, its usefulness for predicting neonatal outcomes remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the association of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio with pregnancy outcomes, neonatal morbidities and short-term postnatal growth patterns in pregnant women and their babies., METHODS: sFlt-1 and PlGF were measured in women with fetal intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) or pre-eclampsia during gestational age (GA) of 16-36 weeks. These women were classified into high- and low-ratio groups with a sFlt-1/PlGF cut-off ratio of 85. The maternal and neonatal outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: A total of 25 pregnant women were recruited. Thirteen of them had a sFlt-1/PlGF ratio over 85 and twelve had a ratio of less than 85. The median duration from elevation of sFlt-1/PlGF to delivery was 4.5 weeks. Women in the high SFlt-1/PlGF ratio group had higher rates of intrauterine fetal demise (2/13 vs. 0/12) and early termination (1/13 vs. 0/12). The surviving offspring in this group had a higher incidence of preterm birth (GA: 31.4 +/- 2.9 weeks vs. 37.3 +/- 1.3 weeks, p < 0.001), lower birth weight (1142 +/- 472 g vs. 2311 +/- 236 g, p < 0.001), higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (6/10 vs. 0/12, p = 0.002) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (4/10 vs. 0/12, p = 0.01). However, the percentile of body weight, height and head circumference at 28 days of age, 56 days of age and the corrected age of 6 months were comparable between groups., CONCLUSIONS: High sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in pregnant women is associated with poor pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Therefore, the monitoring of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in pregnant women with fetal IUGR and timely management for placenta-associated diseases are recommended. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: It has been suggested that plasma KL-6 increases in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We aimed to evaluate the predictive values of KL-6 in BPD., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed in preterm neonates with birthweight <=1500 g and gestational age <=32 weeks. Plasma KL-6 levels were measured on postnatal days 1, 7, and 14., RESULTS: BPD was identified in eight of the 28 study infants. On postnatal days 1 and 7, plasma KL-6 levels were similar in infants with BPD [on day 1: 8.9 (7.5-17.8) U/mL and on day 7: 16.8 (10.5-47.7) U/mL] and without BPD [on day 1: 10.8 (9.4-17.2) U/mL and on day 7: 12.9 (5.8-19.3) U/mL] (P = 0.38 and P = 0.13, respectively). On day 14, KL-6 levels were significantly higher in infants with BPD [155.2 (15.3-545.6) U/mL] than they were in infants without BPD [7.9 (7.7-15.6) U/mL] (P = 0.001). The best predictor was KL-6 levels on postnatal day 14 (area under the ROC curve = 0.88; range 0.75-1.0; P = 0.002). At this point, KL-6 level of 59.7 U/mL showed a specificity of 90.0% and negative predictive value of 85.7% for BPD., CONCLUSION: High plasma KL-6 levels on postnatal day 14 in premature infants may predict the development of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by alveoli simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary microvasculature, is a chronic lung disease affecting prematurely born infants. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an important BPD feature associated with morbidity and mortality. In human BPD, inflammation leads to decreased fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression but the impact on the vasculature is so far unknown. We used lungs from Fgf10+/- versus Fgf10+/+ pups to investigate the effect of Fgf10 deficiency on vascular development in normoxia (NOX) and hyperoxia (HOX, BPD mouse model). To assess the role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (Fgfr2b) ligands independently of early developmentaldefects, we used an inducible double transgenic system in mice allowing inhibition of Fgfr2b ligands activity. Using vascular morphometry, we quantified the pathological changes. Finally, we evaluated changes in FGF10, surfactant protein C (SFTPC), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) and alpha-smooth muscle actin 2 (alpha-SMA) expression in human lung samples from patients suffering from BPD. In NOX, no major difference in the lung vasculature between Fgf10+/- and control pups was detected. In HOX, a greater loss of blood vessels in Fgf10+/- lungs is associated with an increase of poorly muscularized vessels. Fgfr2b ligands inhibition postnatally in HOX is sufficient to decrease the number of blood vessels while increasing the level of muscularization, suggesting a PH phenotype. BPD lungs exhibited decreased FGF10, SFTPC and PECAM but increased alpha-SMA. Fgf10 deficiency-associated vascular defects are enhanced in HOX and could represent an additional cause of morbidity in human patients with BPD. Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Neonatal sepsis, a clinical disorder developed by bacterial blood stream infections (BSI) in neonates, is one of the serious global public health problems that must be addressed. More than one million of the estimated global newborn deaths per year are occurred due to severe infections. The genesis of the infection is divided into early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) of the disease. The clinical complications of neonatal sepsis may be associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis. The clinical diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis is highly complicated. Over the past few years distinct biomarkers have been identified. Most widely used biomarkers are C-reactive protein, Procalcitonin (PCT) and Serum amyloid A (SAA). Until recently, many potential biomarkers including Cell Surface antigens and Bacterial surface antigens and genetic biomarkers are being investigated. Protein biomarkers, cytokines and chemokines are getting much interest for identification of neonatal sepsis infection. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The C242T polymorphism of CYBA (cytochrome B-245 alpha chain), the gene encoding the p22phox subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, has been linked to several conditions in which oxidative stress plays a pathogenic role. We investigated in a cohort of 451 preterm infants [gestational age (GA) <=30 weeks] the association of the polymorphism with the risk of developing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, or intraventricular hemorrhage. We observed a significant association of the TT/CT genotype with RDS [odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.28-3.90], ROP (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.80), and BPD (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05-2.43). When this dominant model was adjusted to account for GA, birth weight, and sex, it remained significant for the three outcomes. This study is the first to address the association of a polymorphism related to the NADPH family with oxidative stress-related complications of prematurity. Since p22phox is essential for reactive oxygen species production by NADPH oxidase, we hypothesize that genetic variations in the protein may lead to differences in susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced damage in preterm infants.

AB  - Preterm birth exposes the developing lung to an environment with direct exposure to bacteria, often facilitated by endotracheal intubation. Despite evidence linking bacterial infections to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), systematic studies of airway microbiota are limited. The objective was to identify specific patterns of the early respiratory tract microbiome from tracheal aspirates of mechanically ventilated preterm infants that are associated with the development and severity of BPD. Infants with gestational age <=34 weeks, and birth weight 500-1250g were prospectively enrolled. Mechanically ventilated infants had tracheal aspirate samples collected at enrollment, 7, 14, and 21 days of age. BPD was determined by modified NIH criteria with oxygen reduction tests; infants without BPD were excluded due to low numbers. Aspirates were processed for bacterial identification by 16S rRNA sequencing, and bacterial load by qPCR. Cross-sectional analysis was performed using 7 day samples and longitudinal analysis was performed from subjects with at least 2 aspirates. Microbiome analysis was performed on tracheal aspirates from 152 infants (51, 49, and 52 with mild, moderate, and severe BPD, respectively). Seventy-nine of the infants were included in the cross-sectional analysis and 94 in the longitudinal. Shannon Diversity, bacterial load, and relative abundance of individual taxa were not strongly associated with BPD status. Longitudinal analysis revealed that preterm infants who eventually developed severe BPD exhibited greater bacterial community turnover with age, acquired less Staphylococcus in the first days after birth, and had higher initial relative abundance of Ureaplasma. In conclusion, longitudinal changes in the airway microbial communities of mechanically ventilated preterm infants may be associated with BPD severity, whereas cross-sectional analysis of airway ecology at 7 days of age did not reveal an association with BPD severity. Further evaluation is necessary to determine whether the observed longitudinal changes are causal or in response to clinical management or other factors that lead to BPD.

AB  - Despite recent advances in neonatal medicine, neonatal disorders, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm neonates and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in term neonates, remain major causes of mortality and morbidities. Promising preclinical research results suggest that stem cell therapies represent the next breakthrough in the treatment of currently intractable and devastating neonatal disorders with complex multifactorial etiologies. This review focuses primarily on the potential role of stem cell therapy in the above mentioned neonatal disorders, highlighting the results of human clinical trials and the challenges that remain to be addressed for their safe and successful translation into clinical care of newborn infants.

AB  - Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a ubiquitous master transcription factor that upregulates antioxidant response elements (AREs)-mediated expression of antioxidant enzyme and cytoprotective proteins. Activation of Nrf2 has been shown to be protective against lung injury. In the lung, diverse stimuli including environmental oxidants, medicinal agents, and pathogens can activate Nrf2. Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to an ARE. Through transcriptional induction of ARE-bearing genes encoding antioxidant-detoxifying proteins, Nrf2 induces cellular rescue pathways against oxidative pulmonary injury, abnormal inflammatory and immune responses, and apoptosis. The Nrf2-antioxidant pathway has been shown to be important in the protection against various lung injuries including acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and allergy and was widely examined for new therapeutic targets. The present review explores the protective role of Nrf-2 against lung injury and the therapeutic potential in targeting Nrf-2. Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Antenatal corticosteroid (CS) therapy improves both fetal lung mechanism and gas exchange due to accelerated morphologic development of type one and two pneumocytes. This therapy also enhances the production of surfactant binding proteins and fetal lung antioxidant enzymes. In women with threatening preterm delivery, a single course is advocated between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation with either betamethasone (two doses of 12 mg 24 h apart) or dexamethasone (four doses of 6 mg at 12-h intervals). Such treatment reduces the rate of respiratory distress syndrome, comorbidity, and mortality in neonates in the first 48 h of life. The optimal time interval between CS administration and delivery is reported to be 1-7 days. Weekly repeat courses reduce the occurrences and severity of respiratory diseases but are associated with reduce fetal growth. Multiple courses should be avoided. However, a repeat course should be considered in women at risk of preterm birth 7 or more days after an initial course in women who remain at risk of preterm birth <34 weeks' gestation. CS may be harmful in growth restricted fetuses associated with an absent or reversed end-diastolic UA flow since they are at increased risk of acidosis and perinatal death. The purpose of this publication is to update and highlight antenatal CS therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both histologic chorioamnionitis (HCAM) and Ureaplasma infection are considered important contributors to perinatal lung injury. We tested the hypothesis that coexistence of maternal HCAM and perinatal Ureaplasma exposure increases the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation in extremely low-birthweight (ELBW) infants., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out of all ELBW infants born between January 2008 and December 2013 at a single academic center. Placental pathology and gastric fluid Ureaplasma data were available for all infants. Culture and polymerase chain reaction were used to detect Ureaplasma in gastric fluid. Prolonged mechanical ventilation was defined as mechanical ventilation that began within 28 days after birth and continued., RESULTS: Of 111 ELBW infants enrolled, 84 survived beyond 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA) and were included in the analysis. Eighteen infants (21.4%) had both HCAM and Ureaplasma exposure. Seven infants (8.3%) required mechanical ventilation beyond 36 weeks of PMA. Coexistence of HCAM and Ureaplasma in gastric fluid was significantly associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation after adjustment for gestational age, sex, mode of delivery, and use of macrolide antibiotics (OR, 8.7; 95%CI: 1.1-67.2)., CONCLUSIONS: Coexistence of maternal HCAM and perinatal Ureaplasma exposure significantly increases the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation in ELBW infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that affects thousands of newborns and infants every year. Although it is accepted that BPD results from lung damage and inflammation triggered by mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia, the causes and molecular events leading to lung damage and arrested development remain unknown. While recent advances in neonatal care have improved the survival of very low-weight infants, the rates of BPD have not improved accordingly. This is mainly due to our limited understanding of the disease's pathogenesis and the effective therapeutic options available. Current therapeutics for BPD involve ventilation management, steroid treatment, and administration of various agents, such as pulmonary surfactant, caffeine, vitamin A, nitric oxide, and stem cells. However, the efficacy of these agents in preventing and ameliorating BPD symptoms varies depending on the populations studied and the disease stage. As the field moves towards personalised therapeutic approaches, this review summarises clinical and experimental studies conducted in various models, aiming to increase understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these agents can prevent or treat BPD. Due to the increasing number of extremely premature infants, it is imperative that we continue to work towards understanding the mechanisms of BPD pathogenesis and generating more effective therapeutic options.

AB  - Evidence indicates that human milk (HM) is the best form of nutrition uniquely suited not only to term but also to preterm infants conferring health benefits in both the short and long-term. However, HM does not provide sufficient nutrition for the very low birth weight (VLBW) infant when fed at the usual feeding volumes leading to slow growth with the risk of neurocognitive impairment and other poor health outcomes such as retinopathy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. HM should be supplemented (fortified) with the nutrients in short supply, particularly with protein, calcium, and phosphate to meet the high requirements of this group of babies. In this paper the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA) Working Group on HM Fortification discusses the existing evidence in this field, gives an overview of different fortification approaches and definitions, outlines the gaps in knowledge and gives recommendations for practice and suggestions for future research. EMBA recognizes that "Standard Fortification," which is currently the most utilized regimen in neonatal intensive care units, still falls short in supplying sufficient protein for some VLBW infants. EMBA encourages the use of "Individualized Fortification" to optimize nutrient intake. "Adjustable Fortification" and "Targeted Fortification" are 2 methods of individualized fortification. The quality and source of human milk fortifiers constitute another important topic. There is work looking at human milk derived fortifiers, but it is still too early to draw precise conclusions about their use. The pros and cons are discussed in this Commentary in addition to the evidence around use of fortifiers post discharge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a severe clinical problem among neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients. The genetic pathogenesis of PPHN is unclear. Only a few genetic polymorphisms have been identified in infants with PPHN. Our study aimed to investigate the potential genetic etiology of PPHN., METHODS: This study recruited PPHN patients admitted to the NICU of the Children's Hospital of Fudan University from Jan 2016 to Dec 2017. Exome sequencing was performed for all patients. Variants in reported PPHN/pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-related genes were assessed. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association and gene-level analyses were carried out in 74 PPHN cases and 115 non-PPHN controls with matched baseline characteristics., RESULTS: Among the patient cohort, 74 (64.3%) patients were late preterm and term infants (>= 34 weeks gestation) and 41 (35.7%) were preterm infants (< 34 weeks gestation). Preterm infants with PPHN exhibited low birth weight and a high frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and mortality. Nine patients (only one preterm infant) were identified as harboring genetic variants, including three with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in TBX4 and BMPR2 and six with variants of unknown significance in BMPR2, SMAD9, TGFB1, KCNA5 and TRPC6. Three SNPs (rs192759073, rs1047883 and rs2229589) in CPS1 and one SNP (rs1044008) in NOTCH3 were significantly associated with PPHN (p < 0.05). CPS1 and SMAD9 were identified as risk genes for PPHN (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified genetic variants in PPHN patients, and we reported CPS1, NOTCH3 and SMAD9 as risk genes for late preterm and term PPHN in a single-center Chinese cohort. Our findings provide additional genetic evidence of the pathogenesis of PPHN and new insight into potential strategies for disease treatment.

AB  - Despite advances in intensive care, several neonatal conditions typically due to prematurity affect vital organs and are associated with high mortality and long-term morbidities. Current treatment strategies for these babies are only partially successful or are effective only in selected patients. Regenerative medicine has been shown to be a promising option for these conditions at an experimental level, but still warrants further exploration for the development of optimal treatment. Although stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a treatment option, studies have shown that it is associated with potential risks and hazards, especially in the fragile population of babies. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an attractive therapeutic alternative that holds great regenerative potential and is cell-free. EVs are nanosized particles endogenously produced by cells that mediate intercellular communication through the transfer of their cargo. Currently, EVs are garnering considerable attention as they are the key effectors of stem cell paracrine signaling and can epigenetically regulate target cell genes through the release of RNA species, such as microRNA. Herein, we review the emerging literature on the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from different sources for the treatment of neonatal conditions that affect the brain, retinas, spine, lungs, and intestines and discuss the challenges for the translation of EVs into clinical practice.

AB  - MicroRNAs are small single-stranded, non-coding RNAs which have a known role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Recent studies have reported that extracellular vesicles are capable of specific delivery of miRNAs to a target cell or tissue from a host cell. MiRNAs are generated by host cells, selectively packaged into EVs, and then delivered to nearby target cells with full functionality. After delivery to the target cells, these EV-packaged miRNAs regulate the translation of their target genes. Thus, EV transported miRNAs have become a newly understood method for intercellular communication. In this review, we summarize the novel findings of EV-miRNA transfer in acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease in infants with lifelong pulmonary and neurodevelopmental consequences. The pathogenesis of BPD is contributed by genetic and environmental factors; among the latter, a critical contributor is exposure of the developing lung to hyperoxia. We have recently reported (Nat Comm 8:1173) that hyperoxia exposure in our in vitro and in vivo modeling systems of hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HALI) and BPD leads to an upregulation of the microRNA (miR) 34a. Utilizing genetic loss- and gain- of function strategies, we show that miR34a inhibition ameliorates the pulmonary phenotype of BPD (including BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension), at least in part, via one of the downstream targets of miR34a, namely Angiopoietin1/Tie 2 signaling. In addition, we demonstrate translational clinical significance of our findings by showing increased miR34a and decreased Ang1 expression in 3 independent cohorts of human lung samples.

AB  - The lungs of extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) are deficient in pulmonary surfactant and are incapable of efficient gas exchange necessary for successful transition from a hypoxic intrauterine environment to ambient air. To improve gas exchange and survival, ELGANs often receive supplemental oxygen with mechanical ventilation which disrupts normal lung developmental processes, including microvascular maturation and alveolarization. Factors that regulate these developmental processes include vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinases, both of which are influenced by generation of oxygen byproducts, or reactive oxygen species (ROS). ELGANs are also deficient in antioxidants necessary to scavenge excessive ROS. Thus, the accumulation of ROS in the preterm lungs exposed to prolonged hyperoxia, results in inflammation and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease (CLD). Despite advances in neonatal care, BPD/CLD remains a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The underlying mechanisms are not completely understood, and the benefits of current therapeutic interventions are limited. The association between ROS and biomarkers of microvascular maturation and alveolarization, as well as antioxidant therapies in the setting of hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury are reviewed in this article.

AB  - Selective and rapid detection of biomarkers is of utmost importance in modern day health care for early stage diagnosis to prevent fatal diseases and infections. Among several protein biomarkers, the role of lysozyme has been found to be especially important in human immune system to prevent several bacterial infections and other chronic disease such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Thus, real-time monitoring of lysozyme concentration in a human body can pave a facile route for early warning for potential bacterial infections. Here, we present for the first time a label-free lysozyme protein sensor that is rapid and selective based on a graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) functionalized with selectively designed single-stranded probe DNA (pDNA) with high binding affinity toward lysozyme molecules. When the target lysozyme molecules bind to the surface-immobilized pDNAs, the resulting shift of the charge neutrality points of the GFET device, also known as the Dirac voltage, varied systematically with the concentration of target lysozyme molecules. The experimental results show that the GFET-based biosensor is capable of detecting lysozyme molecules in the concentration range from 10 nM to 1 microM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), (R213G), in extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), decreases SOD3 matrix binding affinity. Humans and mature mice expressing the R213G SNP exhibit increased cardiovascular disease but decreased lung disease. The impact of this SNP on the neonatal lung at baseline or with injury is unknown., METHODS: Wild type and homozygous R213G mice were injected with intraperitoneal bleomycin or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times weekly for three weeks and tissue harvested at 22 days of life. Vascular and alveolar development were evaluated by morphometric analysis and immunostaining of lung sections. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was assessed by right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Lung protein expression for superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms, catalase, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH-1) was evaluated by western blot. SOD activity and SOD3 expression were measured in serum., RESULTS: In R213G mice, SOD3 lung protein expression decreased, serum SOD3 protein expression and SOD serum activity increased compared to wild type (WT) mice. Under control conditions, R213G mice developed pulmonary vascular remodeling (decreased vessel density and increased medial wall thickness) and PH; alveolar development was similar between strains. After bleomycin injury, in contrast to WT, R213G mice were protected from impaired alveolar development and their vascular abnormalities and PH did not worsen. Bleomycin decreased VEGFR2 and GTPCH-1 only in WT mice., CONCLUSION: R213G neonatal mice demonstrate impaired vascular development and PH at baseline without alveolar simplification, yet are protected from bleomycin induced lung injury and worsening of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. These results show that vessel bound SOD3 is essential in normal pulmonary vascular development, and increased serum SOD3 expression and SOD activity prevent lung injury in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and PH.

AB  - Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a multimeric collectin that is involved in innate immune defense and expressed in pulmonary, as well as non-pulmonary, epithelia. SP-D exerts antimicrobial effects and dampens inflammation through direct microbial interactions and modulation of host cell responses via a series of cellular receptors. However, low protein concentrations, genetic variation, biochemical modification, and proteolytic breakdown can induce decomposition of multimeric SP-D into low-molecular weight forms, which may induce pro-inflammatory SP-D signaling. Multimeric SP-D can decompose into trimeric SP-D, and this process, and total SP-D levels, are partly determined by variation within the SP-D gene, SFTPD. SP-D has been implicated in the development of respiratory diseases including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, allergic asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disease-induced breakdown or modifications of SP-D facilitate its systemic leakage from the lung, and circulatory SP-D is a promising biomarker for lung injury. Moreover, studies in preclinical animal models have demonstrated that local pulmonary treatment with recombinant SP-D is beneficial in these diseases. In recent years, SP-D has been shown to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in various non-pulmonary organs and to have effects on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory effects in vessel walls, which enhance the risk of atherosclerosis. A common SFTPD polymorphism is associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes, and SP-D has been associated with metabolic disorders because of its effects in the endothelium and adipocytes and its obesity-dampening properties. This review summarizes and discusses the reported genetic associations of SP-D with disease and the clinical utility of circulating SP-D for respiratory disease prognosis. Moreover, basic research on the mechanistic links between SP-D and respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases is summarized. Perspectives on the development of SP-D therapy are addressed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The REGAL (RSV Evidence - A Geographical Archive of the Literature) series has provided a comprehensive review of the published evidence in the field of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Western countries over the last 20 years. This seventh and final publication covers the past, present and future approaches to the prevention and treatment of RSV infection among infants and children., METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken of publications between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2017 across PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library. Studies reporting data on the effectiveness and tolerability of prophylactic and therapeutic agents for RSV infection were included. Study quality and strength of evidence (SOE) were graded using recognized criteria. A further nonsystematic search of the published literature and Clinicaltrials.gov on antiviral therapies and RSV vaccines currently in development was also undertaken., RESULTS: The systematic review identified 1441 studies of which 161 were included. Management of RSV remains centered around prophylaxis with the monoclonal antibody palivizumab, which has proven effective in reducing RSV hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants < 36 weeks' gestational age (72% reduction), children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (65% reduction), and infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (53% reduction) (high SOE). Palivizumab has also shown to be effective in reducing recurrent wheezing following RSVH (high SOE). Treatment of RSV with ribavirin has conflicting success (moderate SOE). Antibodies with increased potency and extended half-life are currently entering phase 3 trials. There are approximately 15 RSV vaccines in clinical development targeting the infant directly or indirectly via the mother., CONCLUSION: Palivizumab remains the only product licensed for RSV prophylaxis, and only available for high-risk infants. For the general population, there are several promising vaccines and monoclonal antibodies in various stages of clinical development, with the aim to significantly reduce the global healthcare impact of this common viral infection., FUNDING: AbbVie.

AB  - Erythropoietin treatment is associated with a reduction in moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. A regional retrospective study., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether premature infants treated with erythropoietin (Epo) in the neonatal period for anemia had a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as oxygen need at 36weeks postmenstrual age, and lower rehospitalization rates in the first year of life than infants not exposed., METHODS: Retrospective study of a population of infants born at 23 to 32weeks gestational age, between January 2009 and December 2014, with birthweight <=1500g. Patient characteristics, and risk factors for BPD were compared between patients who received erythropoietin, and those not exposed. To examine the association between the outcomes of BPD at 36weeks PMA, rehospitalization, and erythropoietin treatment, we performed a propensity score (PS) analysis using inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) approach. For comparison, we conducted a logistic regression adjusting for the same covariates used to generate PS using the original population., RESULTS: The study population included 1821 preterm infants: 928 received Epo and 893 did not. Epo treatment was associated with a reduction in BPD (18.8% versus 25.9%, p<0.01) at 36weeks PMA and reduced median length of stay with lowest BPD rate with Epo initiation before 2weeks of age. There was no difference in rehospitalization rates in the first year of life., CONCLUSION: Erythropoietin treatment was associated with a reduction in BPD but not in rehospitalization rate in the first year of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to correlate the pulmonary surfactant B (SP-B) gene variation with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in ethnic Han, Chinese, premature newborns., METHOD: 47 newborns with BPD and 55 controls without BPD were included. Genomic DNA was extracted from cord or artery blood. Genotyping for the SP-B gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction or gene sequencing, and the clinical characteristics were also analyzed., RESULTS: Two types of SP-B gene variations in Exon 2 or Exon 5 were discovered, including V1 (Exon 2: c.[5A > C] + [5A > C] or c.[5A > C] + [=]) and V2 (Exon 5: c.[428C > T] + [428C > T] or c.[428C > T] + [=]). In the BPD group, there were 33 newborns with gene variations, of which type V1 and V2 accounted for 18 and 15 respectively. In the control group, there were 19 newborns with gene variations, of which type V1 and V2 accounted for 7 and 12 respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups in type V1 variation (X2=8.956, P < 0.05), and V1 variation was more likely associated with BPD occurrence. Logistic regression analysis showed that gene variation, premature rupture of membranes, birth weight, and the duration of mechanical ventilation were associated with BPD development. Among them, gene variation and premature rupture of the membranes were risk factors for BPD development., CONCLUSIONS: The exon 2 or 5 of SP-B gene variations were associated with the BPD in Chinese premature newborns, and the type V1: Exon 2: c.[5A > C] + [5A > C] or c.[5A > C] + [=] was a risk factor for the development of BPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe complication of extreme prematurity that can be caused by hyperoxia inhalation. SP-B and TGF-beta have been reported to be implicated in the development of lung. This study aimed to reveal the spatial and temporal expression patterns of these two factors in an animal model of BPD., METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to hyperoxia conditions to establish an animal model of BPD. The levels of SP-B, TGF-beta, MDA and TAOC, as well as the activations of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in lung tissues were monitored during newborn rats prolonged exposure to hyperoxia., RESULTS: We found that hyperoxia exposure significantly induced body weight loss of SD rats. H&E staining for morphometric analyses revealed that hyperoxia arrested alveolar development or loss of alveoli, with fewer and dysmorphic capillaries. mRNA and protein levels of SP-B and TGF-beta were high expressed in hyperoxic lung tissues. The concentrations of SP-B and TGF-beta in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were also increased. All these increases begin at the 3th day of hyperoxia exposure. MDA content was increased while TAOC content was decreased in response to hyperoxia. Furthermore, hyperoxia activated p38, and deactivated PI3K and AKT expression., CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrated that SP-B and TGF-beta1 were highly expressed in three levels: mRNA and protein levels in lung tissues, and the release of SP-B and TGF-beta1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, beginning at the 3th day of hyperoxia exposure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-induced lung injury is considered to be a main factor in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Optimizing ventilator strategies may reduce respiratory morbidities in preterm infants. Permissive hypercapnia has been suggested to attenuate lung injury. We aimed to determine if a higher PCO2 target range results in less lung injury compared to the control target range and possibly reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) in tracheal aspirates (TA), which has not been addressed before., METHODS: During a multicenter trial of permissive hypercapnia in extremely low birthweight infants (PHELBI), preterm infants (birthweight 400-1,000 g, gestational age 23 0/7-28 6/7 weeks) requiring mechanical ventilation within 24 h of birth were randomly assigned to a high PCO2 target or a control group. The high target group aimed at PCO2 values of 55-65, 60-70, and 65-75 mmHg and the control group at PCO2 values of 40-50, 45-55 and 50-60 mmHg on postnatal days 1-3, 4-6, and 7-14, respectively. TA was analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokines from postnatal day 2-21. BPD was determined at a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks +/- 2 days., MAIN FINDINGS: Levels of inflammatory cytokines and ASM were similar in both groups: interleukin (IL)-6 (p = 0.14), IL-8 (p = 0.43), IL-10 (p = 0.24), IL-1beta (p = 0.11), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (p = 0.44), albumin (p = 0.41), neuropeptide Y (p = 0.52), leukotriene B4 (p = 0.11), transforming growth factor-beta1 (p = 0.68), nitrite (p = 0.15), and ASM (p = 0.94). Furthermore, most inflammatory mediators were strongly affected by the age of the infants and increased from postnatal day 2 to 21. BPD or death was observed in 14 out of 62 infants, who were distributed evenly between both groups., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that high PCO2 target levels did not result in lower pulmonary inflammatory activity and thus reflect clinical results. This indicates that high PCO2 target ranges are not effective in reducing ventilator-induced lung injury in preterm infants, as compared to control targets., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN56143743.

AB  - The development of neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD), i.e., bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, significantly determines long-term outcome in this patient population. Risk factors include mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity impacting on the immature lung resulting in impaired alveolarization and vascularization. Disease development is characterized by inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and apoptosis, closely intertwined with the dysregulation of growth factor signaling. This review focuses on the causes and consequences of altered signaling in central pathways like transforming growth factor (TGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) driving these above indicated processes, i.e., inflammation, matrix remodeling, and vascular development. We emphasize the shared and distinct role of these pathways as well as their interconnection in disease initiation and progression, generating important knowledge for the development of future treatment strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast milk alone, given at standard recommended volumes (150 to 180 mL/kg/d), is not adequate to meet the protein, energy, and other nutrient requirements of growing preterm or low birth weight infants. One strategy that may be used to address these potential nutrient deficits is to give infants enteral feeds in excess of 200 mL/kg/d ('high-volume' feeds). This approach may increase nutrient uptake and growth rates, but concerns include that high-volume enteral feeds may cause feed intolerance, gastro-oesophageal reflux, aspiration pneumonia, necrotising enterocolitis, or complications related to fluid overload, including patent ductus arteriosus and bronchopulmonary dysplasia., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect on growth and safety of feeding preterm or low birth weight infants with high (> 200 mL/kg/d) versus standard (<= 200 mL/kg/d) volume of enteral feeds. Infants in intervention and control groups should have received the same type of milk (breast milk, formula, or both), the same fortification or micronutrient supplements, and the same enteral feeding regimen (bolus, continuous) and rate of feed volume advancement.To conduct subgroup analyses based on type of milk (breast milk vs formula), gestational age or birth weight category of included infants (very preterm or VLBW vs preterm or LBW), presence of intrauterine growth restriction (using birth weight relative to the reference population as a surrogate), and income level of the country in which the trial was conducted (low or middle income vs high income) (see 'Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity')., SEARCH METHODS: We used the Cochrane Neonatal standard search strategy, which included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (1946 to November 2016); Embase (1974 to November 2016); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to November 2016), as well as conference proceedings, previous reviews, and trial registries., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared high-volume versus standard-volume enteral feeds for preterm or low birth weight infants., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We analysed treatment effects in individual trials and reported the risk ratio and risk difference for dichotomous data, and the mean difference for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence intervals. . We assessed the quality of evidence at the outcome level via the GRADE approach., MAIN RESULTS: We found one eligible trial that included 64 infants. This trial was not blinded. Analysis showed a higher rate of weight gain in the high-volume feeds group: mean difference 6.20 g/kg/d (95% confidence interval 2.71 to 9.69). There was no increase in the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis with high-volume feeds, but 95% confidence intervals around these estimates were wide. We assessed the quality of evidence for these outcomes as 'low' or 'very low' because of imprecision of the estimates of effect and concern about risk of bias due to lack of blinding in the included trial. Trial authors provided no data on other outcomes, including gastro-oesophageal reflux, aspiration pneumonia, necrotising enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or long-term growth and neurodevelopment., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only very limited data from one small unblinded trial on the effects of high-volume feeds on important outcomes for preterm or low birth weight infants. The quality of evidence is low to very low. Hence, available evidence is insufficient to support or refute high-volume enteral feeds in preterm or low birth weight infants. A large, pragmatic randomised controlled trial is needed to provide data of sufficient quality and precision to inform policy and practice.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD, is the most common chronic lung disease in infants. Genetic predisposition and developmental vulnerability secondary to antenatal and postnatal infections, compounded with exposure to hyperoxia and invasive mechanical ventilation to an immature lung, result in persistent inflammation, culminating in the characteristic pulmonary phenotype of BPD of impaired alveolarization and dysregulated vascularization. In this article, we highlight specific areas in current management, and speculate on therapeutic strategies that are on the horizon, that we believe will make an impact in decreasing the incidence of BPD in your neonatal intensive care units.

AB  - Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs) are a group of phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations of SCN2A, the gene encoding the aII subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.2), have been detected in some EOEE patients. This report describes a 4-month-old female who presented with severe EOEE as well as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and adrenal hypofunction. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel missense mutation in SCN2A (c.1261T > G; p.L421V) that was not detected in either her parents or her brother. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and characterized as pathogenic by several prediction programs. This finding of a de novo SCN2A mutation in an ethnic Chinese infant with EOEE as well as multi-organ dysfunction expands the phenotypic spectrum of SCN2A mutations. IJCEP Copyright © 2017.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by the aberrant remodeling of the lung parenchyma, resulting from accumulation of fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. Circulating fibrocytes are implied in pulmonary fibrosis, but whether these cells are associated with the development of BPD or the progressive fibrosis is unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of fibrocytes in peripheral venous blood and explore whether these cells might be associated with severity of BPD., METHODS: We investigated circulating fibrocytes in 66 patients with BPD, 23 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) and 11 normal subjects. Circulating fibrocytes were defined and quantified as cells positive for CD45 andcollagen-1 by flow cytometry. Furthermore, serum SDF-1/CXCL12 and TGF-beta1 were evaluated using ELISA methods. We also investigated the clinical value of fibrocyte counts by comparison with standard clinical parameters., RESULTS: The patients with BPD had significantly increased numbers of fibrocytes compared to the controls (p < 0.01). Patients with ARDS were not different from healthy control subjects. There was a correlation between the number of fibrocytes and pulmonary hypertension or oxygen saturation (p < 0.05). Fibrocyte numbers were not correlated with other clinical or functional variables or radiologic severity scores. The fibrocyte attractant chemokine CXCL12 increased in plasma (p < 0.05) and was detectable in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 40% of the patients but not in controls., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that circulating fibrocytes are increased in patients with BPD and may contribute to pulmonary fibrosis in BPD. Circulating fibrocytes, likely recruited through the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis, might contribute to the production of TGF-beta1 for the expansion of fibroblast/myofibroblast population in BPD.

AB  - Despite major advances in obstetrics and neonatal intensive care, preterm infants frequently suffer from neurological impairments in later life. Preterm and also full-term neonates are generally susceptible to injury caused by reactive oxygen species due to the immaturity of endogenous radical scavenging systems. It is well known that high oxygen levels experienced during the critical phase of maturation can profoundly influence developmental processes. Supraphysiological oxygen concentrations used for resuscitation or in the care of critically ill infants are known to have deleterious effects on the developing lung and retina, contributing to the pathophysiology of neonatal diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. Moreover, experimental work from the last decade suggests that hyperoxia also leads to neuronal and glial cell death, contributing to the injury of white and grey matter observed in preterm infants. During the critical phase of brain maturation, hyperoxia can alter developmental processes, resulting in the disruption of neural plasticity and myelination. However, oxygen therapy can often not be avoided in neonatal intensive care. Therefore, in situations requiring oxygen supplementation, in addition to the development of appropriate monitoring systems, protective and/or regenerative strategies are highly warranted. Here, we summarise the clinical and experimental evidence as well as potential therapeutic strategies, providing an overview of the pathophysiology of oxygen exposure on the developing central nervous system and its impact on neonatal brain injury.

AB  - Retinopathy of prematurity is a potentially blinding disease, which is associated with low neonatal IGF-I serum concentrations and poor growth. In severe cases impaired retinal vessel growth is followed by pathologic neovascularization, which may lead to retinal detachment. IGF-I may promote growth even in catabolic states. Treating preterm infants with recombinant human (rh) IGF-I to concentrations normally found during gestation has been suggested to have a preventative effect on ROP. A recent phase 2 study treating infants (gestational age between 23weeks+0days and 27weeks +6days) with rhIGF-I/IGF binding protein-3 until 30 postmenstrual weeks showed no effect on ROP but a 53% reduction in severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 44% reduction in severe intraventricular hemorrhage. Oxygen is a major risk factor for ROP and during the phase 2 study oxygen saturation targets were increased to 90-95%, due to national guidelines, which might have affected ROP rate and severity making increased IGF-I a weaker preventative factor for ROP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a major risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Maternal stress and poor diet are linked to FGR. Effect of perinatal stress on lung development remains unknown., OBJECTIVE: Using a murine model of adverse early life environment (AELE), we hypothesized that maternal exposure to perinatal environmental stress and high-fat diet (Western diet) lead to impaired lung development in the offspring., METHODS: Female mice were placed on either control diet or Western diet before conception. Those exposed to Western diet were also exposed to perinatal environmental stress, the combination referred to as AELE. Pups were either euthanized at postnatal day 21 (P21) or weaned to control diet and environment until adulthood (8-14 wk old). Lungs were harvested for histology, gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR, microRNA profiling, and immunoblotting., RESULTS: AELE increased the mean linear intercept and decreased the radial alveolar count and secondary septation in P21 and adult mice. Capillary count was also decreased in P21 and adult mice. AELE lungs had decreased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha protein levels and increased expression of genes that regulate DNA methylation and upregulation of microRNAs that target genes involved in lung development at P21., CONCLUSION: AELE leads to impaired lung alveolar and vascular growth, which persists into adult age despite normalizing the diet and environment at P21. AELE also alters the expression of genes involved in lung remodeling.

AB  - The neonatal period of very preterm infants is often characterized by a difficult adjustment to extrauterine life, with an inadequate nutrient supply and insufficient levels of growth factors, resulting in poor growth and a high morbidity rate. Long-term multisystem complications include cognitive, behavioral, and motor dysfunction as a result of brain damage as well as visual and hearing deficits and metabolic disorders that persist into adulthood. Insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a major regulator of fetal growth and development of most organs especially the central nervous system including the retina. Glucose metabolism in the developing brain is controlled by IGF-1 which also stimulates differentiation and prevents apoptosis. Serum concentrations of IGF-1 decrease to very low levels after very preterm birth and remain low for most of the perinatal development. Strong correlations have been found between low neonatal serum concentrations of IGF-1 and poor brain and retinal growth as well as poor general growth with multiorgan morbidities, such as intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that early supplementation with IGF-1 can improve growth in catabolic states and reduce brain injury after hypoxic/ischemic events. A multicenter phase II study is currently underway to determine whether intravenous replacement of human recombinant IGF-1 up to normal intrauterine serum concentrations can improve growth and development and reduce prematurity-associated morbidities.

AB  - Heated, humidified high-flow delivered by nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) is increasingly used for noninvasive respiratory support in preterm infants and critically ill children due to its perceived effectiveness and ease of use. Evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that HHHFNC and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are equally effective as postextubation support in preterm infants. HHHFNC is also used for weaning preterm infants from CPAP. Data on HHHFNC used as the primary support for treating respiratory distress syndrome are conflicting. HHHFNC use in preterm infants is associated with reduced nasal trauma. Inability to measure the pressure generated by HHHFNC systems is a concern because overexpansion can lead to an air leak and lung injury. Great caution is warranted when HHHFNC is used in extremely low-birth-weight infants (who were rarely included in these randomized controlled trials) because a recent retrospective study found its use is associated with a higher likelihood of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death in this population. HHHFNC has also become popular in pediatric intensive care units and pediatric wards as a method for delivering oxygen and noninvasive respiratory support. Most published studies were conducted on infants and young children with bronchiolitis. The results of a few observational studies and two randomized trials suggest that HHHFNC therapy is effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis. This review discusses the proposed mechanisms of action behind HHHFNC, the results of observational studies, and the evidence emerging from clinical trials on the use of HHHFNC in preterm infants and children critically ill with bronchiolitis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic lung diseases of human infants and adults, respectively, that are characterized by alveolar simplification. One-third of the infants with severe BPD develop pulmonary hypertension (PH). More importantly, PH increases morbidity and mortality in BPD patients. Additionally, COPD is a common respiratory morbidity in former BPD patients. The lack of an appropriate small animal model wherein echocardiography (Echo) can demonstrate PH is one of the major barriers to understand the molecular mechanisms of the disease and, thereby, develop rational therapies to prevent and/or treat PH in BPD patients. Thus, the goal of this study was to establish a model of experimental BPD and PH and investigate the feasibility of Echo to diagnose PH in neonatal mice. Since hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation contributes to the development of BPD with PH, we tested the hypothesis that exposure of newborn C57BL/6J mice to 70% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 days leads to lung oxidative stress, inflammation, alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and Echo evidence of PH. Hyperoxia exposure caused lung oxidative stress and inflammation as evident by increased malondialdehyde adducts and inducible nitric oxide synthase, respectively. Additionally, hyperoxia exposure caused growth restriction, alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, and pulmonary vascular remodeling. At 14 days of age, Echo of these mice demonstrated that hyperoxia exposure decreased pulmonary acceleration time (PAT) and PAT/ejection time ratio and increased right ventricular free wall thickness, which are indicators of significant PH. Thus, we have demonstrated the feasibility of Echo to phenotype PH in neonatal mice with experimental BPD with PH, which can aid in discovery of therapies to prevent and/or treat BPD with PH and its sequelae such as COPD in humans.

AB  - Abnormal enlargement of the alveolar spaces is a hallmark of conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Notch signaling is crucial for differentiation and regeneration and repair of the airway epithelium. However, how Notch influences the alveolar compartment and integrates this process with airway development remains little understood. Here we report a prominent role of Notch signaling in the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that lead to alveolar formation in the developing lung. We found that alveolar type II cells are major sites of Notch2 activation and show by Notch2-specific epithelial deletion (Notch2(cNull)) a unique contribution of this receptor to alveologenesis. Epithelial Notch2 was required for type II cell induction of the PDGF-A ligand and subsequent paracrine activation of PDGF receptor-alpha signaling in alveolar myofibroblast progenitors. Moreover, Notch2 was crucial in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the distal conducting airways. Our data suggest that epithelial Notch signaling regulates multiple aspects of postnatal development in the distal lung and may represent a potential target for intervention in pulmonary diseases.

AB  - Systemically-administered bleomycin causes inflammation, arrested lung growth, and pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in the neonatal rat, similar to human infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Leukotrienes (LTs) are inflammatory lipid mediators produced by multiple cell types in the lung. The major LTs, LTB4 and cysteinyl LTs, are suggested to contribute to BPD, but their specific roles remain largely unexplored in experimental models. We hypothesized that LTs are increased in bleomycin-induced BPD-like injury, and that inhibition of LT production would prevent inflammatory cell influx and thereby ameliorate lung injury. Rat pups were exposed to bleomycin (1 mg.kg(-1). day(-1) ip) or vehicle (control) from postnatal days 1-14 and were treated with either zileuton (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor), montelukast (cysteinyl LT1 receptor antagonist), or SC57461A (LTA4 hydrolase inhibitor) 10 mg.kg(-1). day(-1) ip. Bleomycin led to increased lung content of LTB4, but not cysteinyl LTs. Bleomycin-induced increases in tissue neutrophils and macrophages and lung contents of LTB4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were all prevented by treatment with zileuton. Treatment with zileuton or SC57461A also prevented the hemodynamic and structural markers of chronic PHT, including raised pulmonary vascular resistance, increased Fulton index, and arterial wall remodeling. However, neither treatment prevented impaired alveolarization or vascular hypoplasia secondary to bleomycin. Treatment with montelukast had no effect on macrophage influx, PHT, or on abnormal lung structure. We conclude that LTB4 plays a crucial role in lung inflammation and PHT in experimental BPD. Agents targeting LTB4 or LTB4-mediated signaling may have utility in infants at risk of developing BPD-associated PHT. Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - In vitro human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived tissues are excellent models to study certain aspects of normal human development. Current research in the field of hPSC derived tissues reveals these models to be inherently fetal-like on both a morphological and gene expression level. In this review we briefly discuss current methods for differentiating lung and intestinal tissue from hPSCs into individual 3-dimensional units called organoids. We discuss how these methods mirror what is known about in vivo signaling pathways of the developing embryo. Additionally, we will review how the inherent immaturity of these models lends them to be particularly valuable in the study of immature human tissues in the clinical setting of premature birth. Human lung organoids (HLOs) and human intestinal organoids (HIOs) not only model normal development, but can also be utilized to study several important diseases of prematurity such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

AB  - Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to be a major preventable cause of blindness and visual handicaps globally. With improved perinatal care, improved survival of moderately preterm infants, and limited resources for oxygen delivery and monitoring, more mature preterm infants are developing severe ROP in developing countries. The pathophysiology of ROP is characterized by two phases. Phase I ROP is due to vaso-obliteration beginning immediately after birth secondary to a marked decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Phase II begins around 33 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). During this phase, VEGF levels increase, especially if there is retinal hypoxia with increasing retinal metabolism and demand for oxygen leading to abnormal vasoproliferation. Since the original description of ROP in 1942 by Terry et al. [Am J Ophthalmol 1942;25:203-204], four epidemics of ROP have been observed. Prevention or early treatment of ROP involves careful titration of oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2). Optimal SpO2 target remains elusive. Most of the large trials have focused on either a low SpO2 (85-89%) or a high SpO2 (91-95%) from the first day of birth to 36 weeks' PMA. Although the incidence of severe ROP and bronchopulmonary dysplasia decreased significantly, predischarge mortality was higher in these studies. Use of graded SpO2 during the 2 different phases of ROP (early, low SpO2 during phase I vs. late, high SpO2 during phase II) may be the best approach to prevent this disabling condition. Further trials should focus on this strategy. Other biological agents that are currently being studied include IGF-1 with IGF-binding protein-3 (rhIGF-1 + rhIGFBP-3) and propranolol. For advanced stages of ROP, laser ablation of avascular retina, early treatment of ROP (ETROP) protocol, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibodies (e.g. bevacizumab) and vitrectomy are used to protect central vision and prevent retinal detachment. Long-term complications such as refractory errors, recurrence of ROP and risk of retinal detachment require continued follow-up with an ophthalmologist through adolescence and beyond. Optimal nutrition including adequate intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreasing infection/inflammation to promote normal vascularization are important strategies. Screening guidelines for ROP based on local incidence of ROP in different regions of the world are very important. Oxygen therapy is clearly a modifiable risk factor to decrease ROP that needs further study. Understanding the two phases of ROP will help to identify appropriate therapeutic strategies and improve visual outcomes in many preterm infants globally. Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth remains the major risk factor for the development of intraventricular haemorrhage, an injury that occurs in 25% of very low birth weight infants. Intraventricular haemorrhage is thought to be venous in origin and intrinsic thromboses in the germinal matrix are likely to play a triggering role. Heparin activates antithrombin and promotes the inactivation of thrombin and other target proteinases. The administration of anticoagulants such as heparin may offset the increased risk of developing intraventricular haemorrhage and may also reduce the risk of developing parenchymal venous infarct, a condition known to complicate intraventricular haemorrhage., OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the prophylactic administration of heparin reduces the incidence of germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo, no treatment, or other anticoagulants., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2015), MEDLINE (1996 to 22 November 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 22 November 2015) and CINAHL (1982 to 22 November 2015), applying no language restrictions. We searched the abstracts of the major congresses in the field (Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand and Pediatric Academic Societies) from 2000 to 2015., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and cluster trials comparing the administration of early, i.e. within the first 24 hours of life, heparin in very preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks)., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each of the included trials, two authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, dose of heparin, mode of administration, and duration of therapy, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are intraventricular haemorrhage, severe intraventricular haemorrhage and neonatal mortality., MAIN RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials enrolling a total of 155 infants met the inclusion criteria of this review. Both trials compared low-dose heparin to the same solution without heparin in very preterm newborns requiring umbilical catheterisation. No trials were identified that specifically studied the use of heparin in infants at risk of germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage. We found no differences in the rates of intraventricular haemorrhage (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.41; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.12; 2 studies, 155 infants; I2 = 57% for RR and I2 = 65% for RD), severe intraventricular haemorrhage (typical RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.23; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.11; 2 studies, 155 infants; I2 = 0% for RR and I2 = 0% for RD) and neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.67; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06; 2 studies, 155 infants; I2 = 28% for RR and I2 = 50% for RD). We judged the quality of the evidence supporting these findings as very low (rates of intraventricular haemorrhage) and low (severe intraventricular haemorrhage and neonatal mortality) mainly because of limitations in the study designs and the imprecision of estimates. We found very few data on other relevant outcomes, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary haemorrhage and patent ductus arteriosus; and no study assessing long-term outcomes (e.g. neurodevelopmental disability)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited data on the effect of prophylactic administration of heparin on the incidence and severity of IVH in very preterm neonates. Both the identified trials used heparin in the context of maintaining umbilical line patency and not specifically as an agent to prevent germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage. Given the imprecision of our estimates, the results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of heparin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question. Limited evidence is available on other clinically relevant outcomes.

AB  - Metabolomics is the quantitative analysis of a large number of low molecular weight metabolites that are intermediate or final products of all the metabolic pathways in a living organism. Any metabolic profiles detectable in a human biological fluid are caused by the interaction between gene expression and the environment. The metabolomics approach offers the possibility to identify variations in metabolite profile that can be used to discriminate disease. This is particularly important for neonatal and pediatric studies especially for severe ill patient diagnosis and early identification. This property is of a great clinical importance in view of the newer definitions of health and disease. This review emphasizes the workflow of a typical metabolomics study and summarizes the latest results obtained in neonatal studies with particular interest in prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, inborn errors of metabolism, perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, kidney disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and cardiac malformation and dysfunction.

AB  - Surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) has been shown to reduce mortality and air leaks in preterm neonates from high-income countries (HICs). The safety and efficacy of SRT in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) have not been systematically evaluated. The major objectives of this review were to assess the (1) efficacy and safety, and (2) feasibility and cost effectiveness of SRT in LMIC settings. We searched the following databases-MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE and WHOLIS using the search terms 'surfactant' OR 'pulmonary surfactant'. Both experimental and observational studies that enrolled preterm neonates with or at-risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and required surfactant (animal-derived or synthetic) were included. A total of 38 relevant studies were found; almost all were from level-3 neonatal units. Pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 22 observational studies showed a significant reduction in mortality at the last available time point in neonates who received SRT (relative risk (RR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.79). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of air leaks (five studies; RR 0.51; 0.29 to 0.90). One RCT and twelve observational studies reported the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with contrasting results; while the RCT and most before-after/cohort studies showed a significant reduction or no effect, the majority of the case-control studies demonstrated significantly higher odds of receiving SRT in neonates who developed BPD. Two studies-one RCT and one observational-found no difference in the proportion of neonates developing pulmonary hemorrhage, while another observational study reported a higher incidence in those receiving SRT. The failure rate of the intubate-surfactant-extubate (InSurE) technique requiring mechanical ventilation or referral varied from 34 to 45% in four case-series. No study reported on the cost effectiveness of SRT. Available evidence suggests that SRT is effective, safe and feasible in level-3 neonatal units and has the potential to reduce neonatal mortality and air leaks in low-resource settings as well. However, there is a need to generate more evidence on the cost effectiveness of SRT and its effect on BPD in LMIC settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature neonates. Several mechanisms, including improvement in pulmonary mechanics underly beneficial effects of caffeine in BPD. As vascular development promotes alveologenesis, we hypothesized that caffeine might enhance angiogenesis in the lung, promoting lung growth, thereby attenuating BPD., METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice litters were randomized within 12 h of birth to room air (RA) or 95%O2 to receive caffeine (20 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 4 days and recovered in RA for 12wks. The lung mRNA and protein expression for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and angiogenic genes performed on day 5. Lung morphometry and vascular remodeling assessed on inflation fixed lungs at 12wks., RESULTS: Caffeine and hyperoxia in itself upregulate HIF-2alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression. Protein expression of HIF-2alpha and VEGFR1 were higher in hyperoxia/caffeine and angiopoietin-1 lower in hyperoxia. An increase in radial alveolar count, secondary septal count, and septal length with a decrease in mean linear intercept indicate an amelioration of hyperoxic lung injury by caffeine. An increase in vessel surface area and a significant reduction in smooth muscle thickness of the pulmonary arterioles may suggest a beneficial effect of caffeine on vascular remodeling in hyperoxia, especially in male mice., CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal caffeine by modulating angiogenic gene expression early in lung development may restore the pulmonary microvasculature and alveolarization in adult lung.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is an independent risk factor for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants. We investigated whether attenuation of hyperoxic lung injury with intratracheal transplantation of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could simultaneously mitigate brain damage in neonatal rats., METHODS: Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia conditions for 14 d. MSCs (5 x 10(5) cells) were transplanted intratracheally at postnatal day (P) 5. At P14, lungs and brains were harvested for histological and biochemical analyses., RESULTS: Hyperoxic lung injuries, such as impaired alveolarization evident from increased mean linear intercept (MLI) and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels were significantly alleviated with MSC transplantation. Hyperoxia decreased brain weight, increased brain cell death, and induced hypomyelination. MSC transplantation significantly ameliorated hyperoxia-induced increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and reduced myelin basic protein. In correlation analyses, brain weight and myelin basic protein (MBP) were significantly inversely correlated with lung MLI and inflammatory cytokines, while TUNEL-positive brain cell number showed a significant positive correlation with lung MLI., CONCLUSION: Despite no significant improvement in short-term neurofunctional outcome, intratracheal transplantation of MSCs simultaneously attenuated hyperoxic lung and brain injuries in neonatal rats, with the extent of such attenuation being closely linked in the two tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been no previous studies regarding whether combined use of Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) and continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) is helpful in the treatment of preterm infants with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and hypercytokinemia., METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of 18 SIRS infants born at gestational week 24-28. Eight with blood interleukin (IL)-6 >= 1000 pg/mL were treated actively with 2 h PMX-DHP followed by 2 h PMX-DHP and CHDF. Ten with IL-6 < 500 pg/mL were treated conventionally (with neither PMX-DHP nor CHDF) and served as controls., RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar except for IL-6, arterial-to-alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2 ), and number of immature neutrophils between the two groups. Baseline a/APO2 was significantly lower in infants with than without active treatment (0.44 vs 0.67, respectively, P = 0.002). After 4 h treatment, the IL-6 decreased to < 500 pg/mL in all eight infants, and a/APO2 improved significantly to 0.62 (P = 0.006). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurred in a similar proportion (63%, 5/8 vs 80%, 8/10, respectively), but the number of days on inhaled oxygen (30 vs 47 days, respectively, P = 0.033) and tracheal intubation (36 vs 51 days, respectively, P = 0.040) was significantly lower in infants with than without active treatment. Prevalence of adverse events was similar (13%, 1/8 vs 50%, 5/10 for active vs conventional treatment, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Active treatment with PMX-DHP and CHDF was helpful in the reduction of days on inhaled oxygen and tracheal intubation in preterm SIRS infants with hypercytokinemia. Further prospective randomized studies are warranted. Copyright © 2016 Japan Pediatric Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common and serious chronic lung disease of premature infants. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) plays an important role in tissue development and remodeling. We have previously shown that targeted overexpression of CTGF in alveolar type II epithelial cells results in BPD-like pathology and activates beta-catenin in neonatal mice., METHODS: Utilizing this transgenic mouse model and ICG001, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of beta-catenin, we tested the hypothesis that beta-catenin signaling mediates the effects of CTGF in the neonatal lung. Newborn CTGF mice and control littermates received ICG001 (10 mg/kg/dose) or placebo (dimethyl sulfoxide, equal volume) by daily i.p. injection from postnatal day 5 to 15. Alveolarization, vascular development, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) were analyzed., RESULTS: Administration of ICG001 significantly downregulated expression of cyclin D1, collagen 1a1, and fibronectin, which are the known target genes of beta-catenin signaling in CTGF lungs. Inhibition of beta-catenin signaling improved alveolar and vascular development and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling. More importantly, the improved vascular development and vascular remodeling led to a decrease in PH., CONCLUSION: beta-Catenin signaling mediates the autocrine and paracrine effects of CTGF in the neonatal lung. Inhibition of CTGF-beta-catenin signaling may provide a novel therapy for BPD.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a prevalent chronic lung disease in premature infants. Twin studies have shown strong heritability underlying this disease; however, the genetic architecture of BPD remains unclear., RECENT FINDINGS: A number of studies employed different approaches to characterize the genetic aberrations associated with BPD, including candidate gene studies, genome-wide association studies, exome sequencing, integrative omics analysis, and pathway analysis. Candidate gene studies identified a number of genes potentially involved with the development of BPD, but the etiological contribution from each gene is not substantial. Copy number variation studies and three independent genome-wide association studies did not identify genetic variations significantly and consistently associated with BPD. A recent exome-sequencing study pointed to rare variants implicated in the disease. In this review, we summarize these studies' methodology and findings, and suggest future research directions to better understand the genetic underpinnings of this potentially life-long lung disease., SUMMARY: Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of BPD. Recent studies suggested that rare variants in genes participating in lung development pathways could contribute to BPD susceptibility.

AB  - Apelin, an endogenous ligand of the G-protein-coupled receptor APJ, is expressed in a diverse number of organs. The apelin-APJ axis helps to control the processes of pathological and physiological fibrosis, including renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, liver fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role of apelin-APJ in organ fibrosis remains controversial due to conflicting study results. The apelin-APJ axis is a detrimental mechanism which promotes liver fibrosis mainly via up-regulation the expression of collagen-II and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta). On the contrary, the apelin-APJ axis is beneficial for renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. The apelin-APJ axis alleviates renal fibrosis by restraining the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). In addition, the apelin-APJ axis attenuates cardiac fibrosis through multiple pathways. Furthermore, the apelin-APJ axis has beneficial effects on experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which suggest the apelin-APJ axis potentially alleviates pulmonary fibrosis. In this article, we review the controversies associated with apelin-APJ in organ fibrosis and introduce the drugs that target apelin-APJ. We conclude that future studies should place more emphasis on the relationship among apelin isoforms, APJ receptor subtypes and organ fibrosis. The apelin-APJ axis will be a potential therapeutic target and those drugs targeted for apelin-APJ may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, liver fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Preterm infants frequently suffer from pulmonary complications resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Physiological and structural lung immaturity impairs perinatal lung transition to air breathing resulting in respiratory distress. Mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation ensure sufficient oxygen supply but enhance inflammatory processes which might lead to the establishment of a chronic lung disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Current therapeutic options to prevent or treat BPD are limited and have salient side effects, highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have demonstrated therapeutic potential in animal models of BPD. This review focuses on MSC-based therapeutic approaches to treat pulmonary complications and critically compares results obtained in BPD models. Thereby bottlenecks in the translational systems are identified that are preventing progress in combating BPD. Notably, current animal models closely resemble the so-called "old" BPD with profound inflammation and injury, whereas clinical improvements shifted disease pathology towards a "new" BPD in which arrest of lung maturation predominates. Future studies need to evaluate the utility of MSC-based therapies in animal models resembling the "new" BPD though promising in vitro evidence suggests that MSCs do possess the potential to stimulate lung maturation. Furthermore, we address the mode-of-action of MSC-based therapies with regard to lung development and inflammation/fibrosis. Their therapeutic efficacy is mainly attributed to an enhancement of regeneration and immunomodulation due to paracrine effects. In addition, we discuss current improvement strategies by genetic modifications or precondition of MSCs to enhance their therapeutic efficacy which could also prove beneficial for BPD therapies.

AB  - The pulmonary alveolar lipofibroblast was first reported in 1970. Since then its development, structure, function and molecular characteristics have been determined. Its capacity to actively absorb, store and 'traffic' neutral lipid for protection of the alveolus against oxidant injury, and for the active supply of substrate for lung surfactant phospholipid production have offered the opportunity to identify a number of specialized functions of these strategically placed cells. Namely, Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP) signaling, expression of Adipocyte Differentiation Related Protein, leptin, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma, and the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP2- which are all stretch-regulated, explaining how and why surfactant production is 'on-demand' in service to ventilation-perfusion matching. Because of the central role of the lipofibroblast in vertebrate lung physiologic evolution, it is a Rosetta Stone for understanding how and why the lung evolved in adaptation to terrestrial life, beginning with the duplication of the PTHrP Receptor some 300 mya. Moreover, such detailed knowledge of the workings of the lipofibroblast have provided insight to the etiology and effective treatment of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia based on physiologic principles rather than on pharmacology.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation. This generic term encompasses emphysema and chronic bronchitis, two common conditions, each having distinct but also overlapping features. Recent epidemiological and experimental studies have challenged the traditional view that COPD is exclusively an adult disease occurring after years of inhalational insults to the lungs, pinpointing abnormalities or disruption of the pathways that control lung development as an important susceptibility factor for adult COPD. In addition, there is growing evidence that emphysema is not solely a destructive process because it is also characterized by a failure in cell and molecular maintenance programs necessary for proper lung development. This leads to the concept that tissue regeneration required stimulation of signaling pathways that normally operate during development. We undertook a review of the literature to outline the contribution of developmental insults and genes in the occurrence and pathogenesis of COPD, respectively.

AB  - Altered bioenergetics with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and degradation of epithelial function are key aspects of pathogenesis in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This motif is not unique to obstructive airway disease, reported in related airway diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and parenchymal diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. Similarly, mitochondrial dysfunction in vascular endothelium or skeletal muscles contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension and systemic manifestations of lung disease. In experimental models of COPD or asthma, the use of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, such as MitoQ, has substantially improved mitochondrial health and restored respiratory function. Modulation of noncoding RNA or protein regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, or degradation has been found to be effective in models of fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary hypertension. Transfer of healthy mitochondria to epithelial cells has been associated with remarkable therapeutic efficacy in models of acute lung injury and asthma. Together, these form a 3R model--repair, reprogramming, and replacement--for mitochondria-targeted therapies in lung disease. This review highlights the key role of mitochondrial function in lung health and disease, with a focus on asthma and COPD, and provides an overview of mitochondria-targeted strategies for rejuvenating cellular respiration and optimizing respiratory function in lung diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is associated with changes in pulmonary angiogenesis. However, the role of the vascular endothelial growth factor/placental growth factor (VEGF/PlGF) heterodimer, an antiangiogenic factor, remains unknown in this disease., OBJECTIVE: To compare VEGF/PlGF levels in preterm infants with and without BPD., METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Preterm neonates with birth weight <2,000 g and gestational age <= 34 weeks were included. Exclusion criteria were: neonates transferred from other institutions after 72 hours of life; death before blood collection; presence of major congenital malformations, inborn errors of metabolism, and early sepsis; and mothers with multiple pregnancies, TORCH infections, HIV infection, or autoimmune diseases. BPD was defined as the need for oxygen therapy for a period equal to or greater than 28 days, accompanied by radiographic changes compatible with the disease. Blood was collected from neonates in the first 72 hours of life. VEGF/PlGF levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The chi-square test, t-test, Mann-Whitney test, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. Variables found to be significant in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included (19 with BPD, 43 without BPD, and 11 neonates who died in the first 28 days of life), with a mean (SD) gestational age of 30.32 (2.88) weeks and birth weight of 1,288 (462) g. Median VEGF/PlGF levels were higher in the groups with BPD and death in the first 28 days of life than in the group without BPD (16.46 [IQR, 12.19-44.57] and 20.64 [IQR, 13.39-50.22], respectively, vs. 9.14 [IQR, 0.02-20.64] pg/mL], p < 0.001). Higher VEGF/P1GF levels remained associated with BPD and death in the first 28 days of life in the multivariate analysis., CONCLUSION: Higher plasma VEGF/PlGF levels were found in preterm neonates with BPD and in those who died in the first 28 days of life, suggesting an important role of this substance in pulmonary vascular development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) at 2- and 5-years corrected age (CA) in a cohort of preterm infants with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included infants born between 2009 and 2016 at a gestational age (GA) <30 weeks with moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Perinatal characteristics, (social) demographics, and comorbidities were collected from the electronic patient records. Odds ratios for NDI were calculated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders., RESULTS: Of the 602 eligible infants, 123 infants were diagnosed with BPD. NDI was present in 30.3% and 56.1% at 2- and 5-years CA, respectively. The only independent risk factors associated with NDI in the multivariate analyses were birthweight (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.95; aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.91, respectively), small for GA (SGA) (aOR 3.25, 95% CI 1.09-9.61; aOR 5.44, 95% CI 1.62-18.2, respectively) at both time points, and male gender at 5-years CA (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.11-5.57)., CONCLUSION: Birthweight and SGA are independent risk factors for NDI at 2- and 5-years CA and male gender at 5-years CA in preterm infants with BPD. In contrast, well-known other risk factors for NDI in the general population of preterm infants, such as GA, maternal education, and neonatal comorbidities were not independently associated with NDI.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity complicating premature birth. Importantly, preclinical models have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor antagonism prevents the lung injury and subsequent abnormal development that typically results following perinatal exposure to inflammatory stresses. This receptor is activated by two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. While many studies have linked IL-1beta to BPD development, IL-1alpha is relatively under-studied. The objective of our study was to determine whether systemic inflammatory stress induces IL-1alpha expression in the neonatal lung, and if so, whether this expression is mediated by innate immune NFkappaB signaling. We found that endotoxemia induced IL-1alpha expression during the saccular stage of neonatal lung development and was not present in the other neonatal organs or the adult lung. This IL-1alpha expression was dependent upon sustained pulmonary NFkappaB activation, which was specific to the neonatal lung. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we found that pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of NFkappaB signaling attenuated IL-1alpha expression. These findings demonstrate that innate immune regulation of IL-1alpha expression is developmentally regulated and occurs via an NFkappaB dependent mechanism. Importantly, the specific role of developmentally regulated pulmonary IL-1alpha expression remains unknown. Future studies must determine the effect of attenuating innate immune IL-1alpha expression in the developing lung before adopting broad IL-1 receptor antagonism as an approach to prevent neonatal lung injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soybean oil-based intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) administered to preterm neonates can induce oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which are associated with severe complications of prematurity. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that administration of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)/omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-enriched IVFE in preterm neonates is associated with a cytokine and fatty acid (FA) profile consistent with attenuated inflammatory response., PATIENTS/METHODS: In a double-blind randomized study, 60 preterm neonates (gestational age 26-32 weeks) were randomized to receive either MCT/omega-3 PUFA-enriched IVFE (intervention group) or soybean oil-based IVFE (control group). Serum biochemistry, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, alpha-tocopherol, and FAs were assessed at baseline, on day of life 15, and day of life 30 or at the end of intervention., RESULTS: All cytokine levels changed significantly across the 3 time points, whereas the type of IVFE had a significant effect on final IL-6 and IL-8 levels, which were lower in the intervention group. The difference in final IL-6 and IL-8 levels remained significant after controlling for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or infection. alpha-Tocopherol and FA values changed significantly over time. MCT/omega-3 PUFA-enriched IVFE administration was associated with significantly higher alpha-tocopherol, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and omega-3 PUFAs and lower linolenic acid, total PUFA, and omega-6/omega-3 PUFA values compared with soybean oil-based IVFE. Both IVFEs were well tolerated., CONCLUSION: Compared with the soybean oil-based IVFE, the MCT/omega-3 PUFA-enriched IVFE is associated with a more favorable cytokine and FA profile consistent with attenuated inflammatory response in preterm neonates.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a complex disorder resulting from gene-environmental interactions. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of this most common chronic lung disease in infants has been made by utilizing animal models and correlating with human data. Currently, while some (vitamin A, caffeine) pharmacotherapeutic options are being utilized to ameliorate this condition, there is still no specific or effective treatment for BPD. It would be helpful for prognostication and targeted potential novel therapeutic strategies to identify those babies accurately who are at risk for developing this disease. A reliable biomarker would have the capacity to be detected in the initial phase of the disease, to allow early interventions to avoid or minimize the detrimental effects of the disease. This review will focus on human studies performed with the "omic" techniques, specifically genomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, transciptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, and summarize the information available in the literature, as it pertains to biomarker identification for BPD. Using "omics" technologies, investigators have reported markers that have the potential to be used as biomarkers of BPD: SPOCK2, VEGF -624C > G, VEGF -460T > C, mast cells specific markers, miR-219 pathway, miR-152, -30a-3p, -133b, -206, -7, lactate, taurine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, gluconate, myoinositol and alterations in surfactant lipid profile.

AB  - The pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial, and the clinical phenotype of BPD is extremely variable. Several clinical and laboratory biomarkers have been proposed for the early identification of infants at higher risk of BPD and for determination of prognosis of infants with a diagnosis of BPD. The authors review available literature on prediction tools and biomarkers of BPD, using clinical variables and biomarkers based on imaging, lung function measures, and measurements of various analytes in different body fluids that have been determined to be associated with BPD either in a targeted manner or by unbiased omic profiling.

AB  - This paper is focused on unique insights provided by the preterm lamb physiological model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Connections are also made to insights provided by the former preterm baboon model of BPD, as well as to rodent models of lung injury to the immature, postnatal lung. The preterm lamb and baboon models recapitulate the clinical setting of preterm birth and respiratory failure that require prolonged ventilation support for days or weeks with oxygen-rich gas. An advantage of the preterm lamb model is the large size of preterm lambs, which facilitates physiological studies for days or weeks during the evolution of neonatal chronic lung disease (CLD). To this advantage is linked an integrated array of morphological, biochemical, and molecular analyses that are identifying the role of individual genes in the pathogenesis of neonatal CLD. Results indicate that the mode of ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation vs. less invasive high-frequency nasal ventilation, is related to outcomes. Our approach also includes pharmacological interventions that test causality of specific molecular players, such as vitamin A supplementation in the pathogenesis of neonatal CLD. The new insights that are being gained from our preterm lamb model may have important translational implications about the pathogenesis and treatment of BPD in preterm human infants.

AB  - Respiratory tract colonization with the genital mycoplasma species Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum in preterm infants is a significant risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Recent studies of the ureaplasmal genome, animal infection models, and human infants have provided a better understanding of specific virulence factors, pathogen-host interactions, and variability in genetic susceptibility that contribute to chronic infection, inflammation, and altered lung development. This review provides an update on the current evidence supporting a causal role of ureaplasma infection in BPD pathogenesis. The current status of antibiotic trials to prevent BPD in Ureaplasma-infected preterm infants is also reviewed. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension is associated with diverse cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic diseases in neonates, infants, and older children and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. However, current approaches to caring for pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension have been limited by the lack of consensus guidelines from experts in the field. In a joint effort from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society, a panel of experienced clinicians and clinician-scientists was assembled to review the current literature and to make recommendations on the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of pediatric pulmonary hypertension. This publication presents the results of extensive literature reviews, discussions, and formal scoring of recommendations for the care of children with pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - The objective of this study is to review the candidate gene and genome-wide association studies relevant to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and to discuss the emerging understanding of the complexities involved in genetic predisposition to bronchopulmonary dysplasia and its outcomes. Genetic factors contribute much of the variance in risk for BPD. Studies to date evaluating single or a few candidate genes have not been successful in yielding results that are replicated in GWAS, perhaps due to more stringent p-value thresholds. GWAS studies have identified only a single gene (SPOCK2) at genome-wide significance in a European White and African cohort, which was not replicated in two North American studies. Pathway gene-set analysis in a North American cohort confirmed involvement of known pathways of lung development and repair (e.g., CD44 and phosphorus oxygen lyase activity) and indicated novel molecules and pathways (e.g., adenosine deaminase and targets of miR-219) involved in genetic predisposition to BPD. The genetic basis of severe BPD is different from that of mild/moderate BPD, and the variants/pathways associated with BPD vary by race/ethnicity. A pilot study of whole exome sequencing identified hundreds of genes of interest, and indicated the overall feasibility as well as complexity of this approach. Better phenotyping of BPD by severity and pathophysiology, and careful analysis of race/ethnicity is required to gain a better understanding of the genetic basis of BPD. Future translational studies are required for the identification of potential genetic predispositions (rare variants and dysregulated pathways) by next-generation sequencing methods in individual infants (personalized genomics).

AB  - Gene-environment interactions likely account for some degree of the variance in response rates that are clinically observed with antenatal corticosteroids, breast milk prophylaxis, surfactant administration, early recognition and treatment of sepsis, utility of non-invasive ventilation, and judicious exposure to supplemental oxygen. While these therapies and practice guidelines have significantly decreased overall neonatal mortality in the NICU, they have not made a marked impact on the frequency and severity of conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis, and periventricular leukomalacia. One possible explanation is that genetic factors in the neonate modulate response to external intervention or preventative agents, culminating in variable levels of injury and different degrees of resolution and repair. Gene-environment explanations are supported by the observed heritability of BPD in twin studies, but they do not differentiate the interactions between neonate and offending toxin or pathogen, from interactions between neonate and intervention or therapeutic agent. Likely, both kinds of interactions are important in determining outcome. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Premature infants are at substantial risk for a spectrum of morbidities that are gestational age dependent. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is most common in the first two years of life with the highest burden in children aged <6 months. Preterm infants <=35 weeks' gestation are handicapped by incomplete immunological and pulmonary maturation and immature premorbid lung function with the added risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Superimposed RSV infection incites marked neutrophilic airway inflammation and innate immunological responses that further compromise normal airway modeling. This review addresses the epidemiology and burden of RSV disease, focusing on the preterm population. Risk factors that determine RSV-disease severity and hospitalization and the impact on healthcare resource utilization and potential long-term respiratory sequelae are discussed. The importance of disease prevention and the evidence-based rationale for prophylaxis with palivizumab is explored, while awaiting the development of a universal vaccine.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension secondary to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD-PH) represents a major complication of BPD in extremely preterm infants for which there are currently no safe and effective interventions. The abundance of interleukin-1 (IL-1) is strongly correlated with the severity and long-term outcome of BPD infants and we have previously shown that IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) protects against murine BPD; therefore, we hypothesized that IL-1Ra may also be effective against BPD-PH. We employed daily injections of IL-1Ra in a murine model in which BPD/BPD-PH was induced by antenatal LPS and postnatal hyperoxia of 65% O2. Pups reared in hyperoxia for 28 days exhibited a BPD-PH-like disease accompanied by significant changes in pulmonary vascular morphology: micro-CT revealed an 84% reduction in small vessels (4-5 mum diameter) compared to room air controls; this change was prevented by IL-1Ra. Pulmonary vascular resistance, assessed at day 28 of life by echocardiography using the inversely-related surrogate marker time-to-peak-velocity/right ventricular ejection time (TPV/RVET), increased in hyperoxic mice (0.27 compared to 0.32 in air controls), and fell significantly with daily IL-1Ra treatment (0.31). Importantly, in vivo cine-angiography revealed that this protection afforded by IL-1Ra treatment for 28 days is maintained at day 60 of life. Despite an increased abundance of mediators of pulmonary angiogenesis in day 5 lung lysates, namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), no difference was detected in ex vivo pulmonary vascular reactivity between air and hyperoxia mice as measured in precision cut lung slices, or by immunohistochemistry in alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and endothelin receptor type-A (ETA) at day 28. Further, on day 28 of life we observed cardiac fibrosis by Sirius Red staining, which was accompanied by an increase in mRNA expression of galectin-3 and CCL2 (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2) in whole hearts of hyperoxic pups, which improved with IL-1Ra. In summary, our findings suggest that daily administration of the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra prevents the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and the pulmonary dysangiogenesis of murine BPD-PH, thus pointing to IL-1Ra as a promising candidate for the treatment of both BPD and BPD-PH.

AB  - Acute inflammatory lesions of the placenta consist of diffuse infiltration of neutrophils at different sites in the organ. These lesions include acute chorioamnionitis, funisitis, and chorionic vasculitis and represent a host response (maternal or fetal) to a chemotactic gradient in the amniotic cavity. While acute chorioamnionitis is evidence of a maternal host response, funisitis and chorionic vasculitis represent fetal inflammatory responses. Intraamniotic infection generally has been considered to be the cause of acute chorioamnionitis and funisitis; however, recent evidence indicates that "sterile" intraamniotic inflammation, which occurs in the absence of demonstrable microorganisms induced by "danger signals," is frequently associated with these lesions. In the context of intraamniotic infection, chemokines (such as interleukin-8 and granulocyte chemotactic protein) establish a gradient that favors the migration of neutrophils from the maternal or fetal circulation into the chorioamniotic membranes or umbilical cord, respectively. Danger signals that are released during the course of cellular stress or cell death can also induce the release of neutrophil chemokines. The prevalence of chorioamnionitis is a function of gestational age at birth, and present in 3-5% of term placentas and in 94% of placentas delivered at 21-24 weeks of gestation. The frequency is higher in patients with spontaneous labor, preterm labor, clinical chorioamnionitis (preterm or term), or ruptured membranes. Funisitis and chorionic vasculitis are the hallmarks of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome, a condition characterized by an elevation in the fetal plasma concentration of interleukin-6, and associated with the impending onset of preterm labor, a higher rate of neonatal morbidity (after adjustment for gestational age), and multiorgan fetal involvement. This syndrome is the counterpart of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in adults: a risk factor for short- and long-term complications (ie, sterile inflammation in fetuses, neonatal sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, and cerebral palsy). This article reviews the definition, pathogenesis, grading and staging, and clinical significance of the most common lesions in placental disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: 1/To assess the effectiveness and safety of EPO in reducing red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm infants. 2/To provide guidelines for clinical practice in France., METHODS: 1/This systematic evidence review is based on PubMed search, Cochrane library. 2/Using French National Authority for Health methods concerning guidelines for clinical practice., RESULTS: Early EPO reduced the risk of RBC transfusions, donor exposure, and the number of transfusions in very preterm infants (LE2). Late EPO reduced the risk of RBC transfusions and the number of transfusions in very preterm infants (LE2). There is no difference between the effectiveness of early and late EPO (LE2). There is no difference between high-dose and low-dose EPO (LE2). The level of evidence is too low to recommend the intravenous route. EPO has no impact on the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis (LE3), and retinopathy of prematurity (LE2). The level of evidence is too low to recommend EPO for neuroprotection in very preterm or term infants., CONCLUSIONS: EPO to reduce RBC transfusion in very preterm infants is recommended (Level A). The optimal time to start therapy is unknown (Level B). The recommended dose is 750IU/kg/week via three subcutaneous injections for 6weeks (Level B). Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in human preterm infants and a similar lung phenotype characterized by alveolar simplification in newborn mice. Omeprazole (OM) is a proton pump inhibitor that is used to treat humans with gastric acid related disorders. OM-mediated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation attenuates acute hyperoxic lung injury (HLI) in adult mice. Whether OM activates pulmonary AhR and protects C57BL/6J newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced developmental lung (alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, inflammation, and oxidative stress) injury (HDLI) is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that OM will activate pulmonary AhR and mitigate HDLI in newborn mice. Newborn mice were treated daily with i.p. injections of OM at doses of 10 (OM10) or 25 (OM25) mg/kg while being exposed to air or hyperoxia (FiO2 of 85%) for 14 days, following which their lungs were harvested to determine alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular injury, and AhR activation. To our surprise, hyperoxia-induced alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury were augmented in OM25-treated animals. These findings were associated with attenuated pulmonary vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression and decreased pulmonary AhR activation in the OM25 group. We conclude that contrary to our hypothesis, OM decreases functional activation of pulmonary AhR and potentiates HDLI in newborn mice. These observations are consistent with our previous findings, which suggest that AhR activation plays a protective role in HDLI in newborn mice. Copyright © The Author 2015.

AB  - The survival of preterm babies has increased over the last few decades. However, disorders associated with preterm birth, known as oxygen radical diseases of neonatology, such as retinopathy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, and necrotizing enterocolitis are severe complications related to oxidative stress, which can be defined by an imbalance between oxidative reactive species production and antioxidant defenses. Oxidative stress causes lipid, protein, and DNA damage. Preterm infants have decreased antioxidant defenses in response to oxidative challenges, because the physiologic increase of antioxidant capacity occurs at the end of gestation in preparation for the transition to extrauterine life. Therefore, preterm infants are more sensitive to neonatal oxidative stress, notably when supplemental oxygen is being delivered. Furthermore, despite recent advances in the management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, controversies persist concerning the oxygenation saturation targets that should be used in caring for preterm babies. Identification of adequate biomarkers of oxidative stress in preterm infants such as 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha, and adduction of malondialdehyde to hemoglobin is important to promote specific therapeutic approaches. At present, no therapeutic strategy has been validated as prevention or treatment against oxidative stress. Breastfeeding should be considered as the main measure to improve the antioxidant status of preterm infants. In the last few years, melatonin has emerged as a protective molecule against oxidative stress, with antioxidant and free-radical scavenger roles, in experimental and preliminary human studies, giving hope that it can be used in preterm infants in the near future.

AB  - Survival of extremely preterm infants has increased over recent years, but bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major cause of morbidity. In the USA, BPD is the most common chronic respiratory disorder of infancy and affects the pulmonary and overall health of 10,000 preterm infants annually. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest a crucial role for lung inflammation and host immune response in the pathogenesis of BPD. Inflammation may result from, amongst others, chorioamnionitis, postnatal infection, ventilation, and the administration of oxygen. Infants with BPD have worse long-term outcomes than those without chronic lung disease. They are more than twice as likely to be readmitted to hospital in their first year of life and, having survived their primary hospitalizations, they are more likely to die than very preterm infants without chronic lung disease. Survivors with BPD have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment and their respiratory function remains compromised well into adolescence. As the first generations of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) survivors have not yet reached retirement age, there are currently no reliable data addressing the association between BPD and pulmonary diseases of the elderly such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although BPD is quite common in ELBW infants, there are infants who do not develop BPD, which supports the argument that BPD is a preventable disease, emphasizing the need for high-quality safety and efficacy prevention studies. However, according to an Institute of Medicine statement regarding pediatric drug studies, the therapeutic area that has the fewest drugs indicated for neonates is BPD. As inflammation seems to be a primary mediator of injury in the pathogenesis of BPD, anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids have long been the focus of preventive research activities. However, systemic steroids, although reducing BPD, have frequently been linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and these considerations may have contributed to the recently reported widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids in neonatal units in North America and Europe. Inhaled corticosteroids were prescribed to 25% of infants born at <29 weeks of gestation with birth weights <1,500 g in neonatal units of 35 children's hospitals in the USA. According to a survey across all neonatal units in Germany, 46% administered inhaled corticosteroids to preterm infants either as prophylaxis or treatment for BPD [10]. Pediatricians and neonatologists should ask themselves whether the off-label use of inhaled corticosteroids in preterm infants is justifiable in view of the available evidence. The authors of the pertinent review from the Cochrane Collaboration, including 7 studies and 492 infants, conclude that there is currently no evidence to support the routine use of inhaled steroids for the prevention of BPD. Recently, the primary outcome results of the Neonatal European Study of Inhaled Steroids (NEUROSIS), including 863 very preterm infants (gestational age 23-27 weeks), have been presented at scientific conferences, but the full study report is not yet published. By contrast, intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle has not yet become part of clinical practice. There are fewer studies addressing the risks and benefits of this mode of administration. In a randomized blinded pilot study in 116 very low birth weight infants who had severe radiographic respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation shortly after birth, early intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle resulted in significantly lower mean airway pressure on day 1 and day 3 and a significantly lower oxygen index and PCO2 during the first 3 days compared with infants in the control group who had received surfactant without corticosteroids. More infants were extubated in the treatment group than in the controls at 1 and 2 weeks and the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (19 of 60 vs. 34 of 56). No clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the study and at the time of the follow-up assessment at 2-3 years of age. In the future, intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle may play a role in the prevention of BPD in ELBW infants. However, before this therapy can be introduced into routine clinical care, remaining open questions need to be answered and appropriately powered studies need to be performed. Copyright © 2015 S.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) of prematurity is associated with impaired angiogenesis. Excess soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) impaired alveolarization in preterm rats. Overexpression of placenta growth factor (PlGF) in mice caused airspace enlargement, which is similar to BPD pathologically. Our study aimed to clarify whether cord blood levels of these angiogenic factors were associated with the development of BPD in preterm infants., METHODS: Preterm infants of gestational age (GA) <35 weeks who already had all the data of cord blood VEGF, PlGF, and sFlt-1 levels in our previous studies were enrolled. Cord blood levels of VEGF, PlGF, and sFlt-1 were collected. BPD was defined as the need for supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation support at the postmenstrual age of 36 weeks. We used the Mann-Whitney U test for comparison between infants with and without BPD, and multivariate analysis with logistic regression to assess the association of these molecules and the development of BPD., RESULTS: Infants with BPD had lower GA [(27 weeks (24-34) vs. 31 weeks (28-24)], lower birth body weight [882 g (620-1232) vs. 1538 g (886-2328)], a higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (58% vs. 14%), and a higher level of PlGF [21.45 pg/dL (6.03-474.01) vs. 7.43 pg/dL (0.09-23.75)] as compared with those infants without BPD. The levels of VEGF and sFlt-1 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that lower birth body weight (p = 0.022) and higher level of PlGF (p = 0.012) were significantly correlated with the development of BPD independently. There was no significant association between the level of VEGF or sFlt-1 and the development of BPD., CONCLUSION: Cord blood level of PlGF, rather than VEGF or sFlt-1, was significantly increased in the BPD group. Consistent with our previous report, cord blood level of PlGF may be considered as a biomarker to predict subsequently developing BPD in preterm infants. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the optimal cell type for transplantation to protect against neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. To this end, the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacies and paracrine potencies of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (HUMs), human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (HAMs) and human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (HMNs) were compared., METHODS: Hyperoxic injury was induced in vitro in A549 cells by challenge with H2O2. Alternatively, hyperoxic injury was induced in newborn Sprague-Dawley rats in vivo by exposure to hyperoxia (90% oxygen) for 14 days. HUMs, HAMs or HMNs (5 x 10(5) cells) were given intratracheally at postnatal day 5., RESULTS: Hyperoxia-induced increases in in vitro cell death and in vivo impaired alveolarization were significantly attenuated in both the HUM and HAM groups but not in the HMN group. Hyperoxia impaired angiogenesis, increased the cell death and pulmonary macrophages and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. These effects were significantly decreased in the HUM group but not in the HAM or HMN groups. The levels of human vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor produced by donor cells were highest in HUM group, followed by HAM group and then HMN group., CONCLUSIONS: HUMs exhibited the best therapeutic efficacy and paracrine potency than HAMs or HMNs in protecting against neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. These cell type-dependent variations in therapeutic efficacy might be associated or mediated with the paracrine potency of the transplanted donor cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and short term outcome of high dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) given shortly after birth and subsequently over the first 2 days for neuroprotection to very preterm infants., STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double masked phase II trial. Preterm infants (gestational age 26 0/7-31 6/7 weeks) were given rhEpo (nt = 229; 3000 U/kg body weight) or NaCl 0.9% (nc = 214) intravenously at 3, 12-18, and 36-42 hours after birth., RESULTS: There were no relevant differences between the groups for short-term outcomes such as mortality, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At day 7-10, we found significantly higher hematocrit values, reticulocyte, and white blood cell counts, and a lower platelet count in the rhEpo group., CONCLUSIONS: Early high-dose rhEpo administration to very premature infants is safe and causes no excess in mortality or major adverse events., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00413946.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung inflammation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) modulate the inflammatory response. It is not known if antagonism of CXCR4 alleviates lung inflammation in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether CXCR4 antagonism would attenuate lung injury in rodents with experimental BPD by decreasing pulmonary inflammation., METHODS: Newborn rats exposed to normoxia (room air, RA) or hyperoxia (FiO2 = 0.9) from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P16 were randomized to receive the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 or placebo (PL) from P5 to P15. Lung alveolarization, angiogenesis and inflammation were evaluated at P16., RESULTS: Compared to the RA pups, hyperoxic PL pups had a decrease in alveolarization, reduced lung vascular density and increased lung inflammation. In contrast, AMD3100-treated hyperoxic pups had improved alveolarization and increased angiogenesis. This improvement in lung structure was accompanied by a decrease in the macrophage and neutrophil counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and reduced lung myeloperoxidase activity., CONCLUSION: CXCR4 antagonism decreases lung inflammation and improves alveolar and vascular structure in neonatal rats with experimental BPD. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate lung injury in preterm infants with BPD. Copyright © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis (CA) is associated with premature delivery and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesize that preterm infants exposed to CA have reduced suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and increased non-regulatory T cell pro-inflammatory cytokines, increasing risk for BPD., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cord blood CD4(+) T cell regulatory phenotype and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in CA and BPD groups., STUDY DESIGN: Cord blood mononuclear cells from infants (GA 32 weeks), with or without placental histological evidence of CA (hChorio), were analyzed by flow cytometry. Clinical information was collected by retrospective chart review. Numbers of putative Treg (CD4(+)FoxP3(+)CD25(+)CD127Dim), CD4(+) non-Tregs, and CD4(+) T cell intracellular cytokine content following in vitro stimulation were compared with CA status and oxygen requirement at 36weeks postmenstrual age., RESULT: Absolute Treg numbers were not different in CA and non-CA exposed samples. However, the infants who developed BPD had a significant decrease in Treg and non-regulatory T cell numbers. Greater IL-6 production was observed in hCA group., CONCLUSION: A pro-inflammatory CD4(+) T cell status is noted in CA and BPD but the later disease is also associated with decrease in Tregs, suggesting that the development of BPD is marked by distinct inflammatory changes from those of CA exposed infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the hematological features of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and their relationships with clinical severity., METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 73 BPD patients from a total of 331 infants with a birth weight of <1500 g from 2005 to 2013. The clinical severity of BPD was defined by the duration of oxygen supplementation and positive pressure ventilation (PPV) in line with the diagnostic criteria of BPD. The hematological status and cytokine levels were surveyed from blood samples at birth and at 2 and 4 weeks of life., RESULTS: Thirty-four (46.6%) cases were classified as "moderate-to-severe" BPD. Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) was associated with the severity of BPD (OR: 5.05; 95% CI: 1.45 to 17.2). The CRP level at 2 weeks (partial regression coefficient [rc]: 21.8; 4.01 to 39.7) and the neutrophil count at 4 weeks (0.005; 0.001 to 0.007) were positively correlated with the oxygenation period. The PPV period was found to be correlated with the CRP level at 2 weeks (27.2; 14.9 to 39.5), and the neutrophil count (0.003; 0.001 to 0.004) at 4 weeks., CONCLUSION: The aggravation of BPD was associated with both SGA at birth and inflammation during neonatal period.

AB  - Neonatal glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is used to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in prematurely born babies. In the 1990s, treatment regimens with relatively high doses of dexamethasone (DEX) were common. As an alternative, hydrocortisone (HC) was used. Earlier, we compared long-term effects of both GCs in children aged 7-10 and detected adverse effects of neonatal DEX treatment, but not of HC, on a range of outcomes. The aim of the current cohort study was to investigate whether long-term effects of neonatal DEX were maintained and whether effects of HC remained absent at adolescent age (14-17years). We compared 71 DEX-treated and 67 HC-treated adolescents. In addition, 71 adolescents who were not neonatally treated with GCs participated. All were born <32weeks of gestation. DEX-treated girls showed increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol responses in the Trier Social Stress Test. The cortisol awakening response was lower in HC-treated participants compared to untreated participants. Negative feedback function of the HPA-axis in the dexamethasone suppression test did not differ between groups. In contrast to our observations at the age of 7-10years, we did not observe group differences in mitogen-induced cytokine production at the age of 14-17years. DEX-treated girls showed more social problems and anxious/depressed behavior than HC-treated girls. Untreated girls showed more problem behavior as well. In conclusion, our results suggest that, especially in girls, neonatal DEX has a programming effect on the HPA-axis and on the ability to adjust to the environment. The loss of group differences on immune system measures indicate that potentially negative effects detected at a younger age subsided. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human cysteine cathepsins (family C1, clan CA) have long been regarded as ubiquitous household enzymes, primarily involved in the recycling and degradation of proteins in lysosomes. This opinion has changed considerably during recent decades, however, with the demonstration of their involvement in various physiological processes. A growing body of evidence supports the theory that cathepsins play specific functions in lung homeostasis and pathophysiological events such as asthma, lung fibrosis (including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (embracing emphysema and chronic bronchitis), silicosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or tumor invasion. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the current knowledge of the role of these enzymes in the lung. Particular attention has been paid to the understanding of the role of these proteases and their natural inhibitors, cystatins (family I25, clan IH), in TGF-beta1-driven fibrotic processes with an emphasis on lung fibrosis.

AB  - Acute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalization in children less than 1 year of age worldwide. It is usually a mild disease, but some children may develop severe symptoms, requiring hospital admission and ventilatory support in the ICU. Infants with pre-existing risk factors (prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart diseases and immunodeficiency) may be predisposed to a severe form of the disease. Clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis is manly based on medical history and physical examination (rhinorrhea, cough, crackles, wheezing and signs of respiratory distress). Etiological diagnosis, with antigen or genome detection to identify viruses involved, may have a role in reducing hospital transmission of the infection. Criteria for hospitalization include low oxygen saturation (<90-92%), moderate-to-severe respiratory distress, dehydration and presence of apnea. Children with pre-existing risk factors should be carefully assessed.To date, there is no specific treatment for viral bronchiolitis, and the mainstay of therapy is supportive care. This consists of nasal suctioning and nebulized 3% hypertonic saline, assisted feeding and hydration, humidified O2 delivery. The possible role of any pharmacological approach is still debated, and till now there is no evidence to support the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, chest physiotherapy, antibiotics or antivirals. Nebulized adrenaline may be sometimes useful in the emergency room. Nebulized adrenaline can be useful in the hospital setting for treatment as needed. Lacking a specific etiological treatment, prophylaxis and prevention, especially in children at high risk of severe infection, have a fundamental role. Environmental preventive measures minimize viral transmission in hospital, in the outpatient setting and at home. Pharmacological prophylaxis with palivizumab for RSV bronchiolitis is indicated in specific categories of children at risk during the epidemic period. Viral bronchiolitis, especially in the case of severe form, may correlate with an increased incidence of recurrent wheezing in pre-schooled children and with asthma at school age. The aim of this document is to provide a multidisciplinary update on the current recommendations for the management and prevention of bronchiolitis, in order to share useful indications, identify gaps in knowledge and drive future research.

AB  - Oxidative stress is worldwide recognized as a fundamental component of the aging, a process that begins before birth. There is a critical balance between free radical generation and antioxidant defenses. Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the ability of antioxidant system to detoxify them. Oxidative stress can occur early in pregnancy and continue in the postnatal period; this damage is implicated in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-related disorders, including recurrent pregnancy loss, preeclampsia and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Moreover, diseases of the neonatal period such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and periventricular leukomalacia are related to free radical damage. The specific contribution of oxidative stress to the pathogenesis and progression of these neonatal diseases is only partially understood. This review summarizes what is known about the role of oxidative stress in pregnancy and in the pathogenesis of common disorders of the newborn, as a component of the early aging process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant (an active agent that keeps pulmonary alveoli open and facilitates the entry of air to the lungs, thus improving the oxygenation of the newborn). A number of interventions such as pulmonary surfactant and prenatal corticosteroids are used to prevent RDS. Ambroxol has been studied as a potential agent to prevent RDS, but effectiveness and safety has yet to be evaluated., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of giving ambroxol to pregnant women who are at risk of preterm birth, for preventing neonatal RDS., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (29 November 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 11),Embase (1988 to November 2013), MEDLINE (PubMed 1970 to November 2013), LILACS (1982 to November 2013), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (November 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of ambroxol given to pregnant women at risk of preterm birth versus placebo, antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone), or no treatment. We did not identify any trials comparing ambroxol with dexamethasone (corticosteroid) in this review. Nor did we identify any trials comparing ambroxol combined with corticosteroid versus corticosteroid alone, or placebo/no treatment., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy., MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies (in 18 trial reports), involving 1047 pregnant women at risk of preterm birth with 1077 newborns. However, three of the included studies did not report on this review's outcomes of interest. We carried out two main comparisons: ambroxol versus antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone); and ambroxol versus placebo or no treatment. Seven RCTs provided data for our comparison of ambroxol versus corticosteroid (betamethasone) and two trials contributed data to our comparison of ambroxol compared to placebo or no treatment. The included studies were generally judged as having either 'low' risk of bias or 'unclear' risk of bias (because the trial reports provided insufficient details about methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding). Primary outcomesThere was no clear evidence of a difference in the incidence of RDS among newborns born to women who received ambroxol when compared to newborns of women who were given the corticosteroid, betamethasone (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07, seven RCTs, 728 women/758 newborns, moderate quality evidence) or placebo/no treatment (average RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20, two studies, 204 women/204 newborns,T2= 0.07; I(2)= 53%, low-quality evidence). Results were imprecise and consistent with appreciable benefit as well as negligible effect.Similarly, there was no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of perinatal mortality between the group of women who received ambroxol and women in the corticosteroid (betamethasone) group (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, six studies, 648 women/657 newborns, moderate quality evidence) or the placebo/no treatment group (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.98, one study, 116 women/116 newborns, low-quality evidence). In terms of maternal adverse effects, there was no clear differences (in nausea or vomiting) between those women who received ambroxol compared to either those women who received corticosteroids (betamethasone) (average RR 3.45; 95% CI 0.34 to 35.51, three studies, 305 women, T(2)= 2.82; I(2)= 67%, very low-quality evidence), or women who received placebo or no treatment (RR 1.79; 95% CI 0.45 to 7.13, one study, 116 women, low-quality evidence). No other adverse effects (e.g. diarrhoea, gastric irritation and headache) were reported in the included studies. Secondary outcomesFor the review's secondary outcomes, none of the included studies reported on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis or rate of maternal mortality.One small trial (involving 88 women) comparing ambroxol with placebo or no treatment, reported no difference between groups in terms of the need for mechanical ventilation in the neonate (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.21, 88 women/88 babies, low-quality evidence) or the administration of pulmonary surfactant (RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.30, one RCT, 88 women/88 babies, low-quality evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review is based on very low to moderate quality evidence from 14 small trials (many are published in the form of conference abstracts with minimal methodological details provided). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the practice of giving ambroxol to women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal RDS, perinatal mortality and adverse effects. More research is needed in order to fully evaluate the benefits and risks of this intervention.

AB  - The etiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial, with genetics, ante- and postnatal sepsis, invasive mechanical ventilation, and exposure to hyperoxia being well described as contributing factors. Much of what is known about the pathogenesis of BPD is derived from animal models being exposed to the environmental factors noted above. This review will briefly cover the various mouse models of BPD, focusing mainly on the hyperoxia-induced lung injury models. We will also include hypoxia, hypoxia/hyperoxia, inflammation-induced, and transgenic models in room air. Attention to the stage of lung development at the timing of the initiation of the environmental insult and the duration of lung injury is critical to attempt to mimic the human disease pulmonary phenotype, both in the short term and in outcomes extending into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The various indexes of alveolar and vascular development as well as pulmonary function including pulmonary hypertension will be highlighted. The advantages (and limitations) of using such approaches will be discussed in the context of understanding the pathogenesis of and targeting therapeutic interventions to ameliorate human BPD.

AB  - Premature infants requiring supplemental oxygen are at increased risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Rodent models involving neonatal exposure to excessive oxygen concentrations (hyperoxia) have helped to identify mechanisms of BPD-associated pathology. Genome-wide assessments of the effects of hyperoxia in neonatal mouse lungs could identify novel BPD-related genes and pathways. Newborn C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 100% oxygen for 10 days, and whole lung tissue RNA was used for high-throughput, sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis (RNA-Seq). Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis were used to identify genes and pathways affected. Expression patterns for selected genes were validated by qPCR. Mechanistic relationships between genes were further tested in cultured mouse lung epithelial cells. We identified 300 genes significantly and substantially affected following acute neonatal hyperoxia. Canonical pathways dysregulated in hyperoxia lungs included nuclear factor (erythryoid-derived-2)-like 2-mediated oxidative stress signaling, p53 signaling, eNOS signaling, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) pathways. Cluster analysis identified Ccnd1, Cdkn1a, and Ahr as critical regulatory nodes in the response to hyperoxia, with Ahr serving as the major effector node. A mechanistic role for Ahr was assessed in lung epithelial cells, and we confirmed its ability to regulate the expression of multiple hyperoxia markers, including Cdkn1a, Pdgfrb, and A2m. We conclude that a global assessment of gene regulation in the acute neonatal hyperoxia model of BPD-like pathology has identified Ahr as one driver of gene dysregulation.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Effective therapies are urgently needed for infants with forms of pulmonary hypertension that develop or persist beyond the first week of life. The L-arginine nitric oxide (NO) precursor, L-citrulline, improves NO signalling and ameliorates pulmonary hypertension in newborn animals. In vitro studies demonstrate that manipulating L-citrulline transport alters NO production., CONCLUSION: Strategies that increase the supply and transport of L-citrulline merit pursuit as novel approaches to managing infants with chronic, progressive pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - The lung develops from a very simple outpouching of the foregut into a highly complex, finely structured organ with multiple specialized cell types that are required for its normal physiological function. During both the development of the lung and its remodeling in the context of disease or response to injury, gene expression must be activated and silenced in a coordinated manner to achieve the tremendous phenotypic heterogeneity of cell types required for homeostasis and pathogenesis. Epigenetic mechanisms, consisting of DNA base modifications such as methylation, alteration of histones resulting in chromatin modification, and the action of noncoding RNA, control the regulation of information "beyond the genome" required for both lung modeling and remodeling. Epigenetic regulation is subject to modification by environmental stimuli, such as oxidative stress, infection, and aging, and is thus critically important in chronic remodeling disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Technological advances have made it possible to evaluate genome-wide epigenetic changes (epigenomics) in diseases of lung remodeling, clarifying existing pathophysiological paradigms and uncovering novel mechanisms of disease. Many of these represent new therapeutic targets. Advances in epigenomic technology will accelerate our understanding of lung development and remodeling, and lead to novel treatments for chronic lung diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature birth is a growing and serious public health problem affecting more than one of every ten infants worldwide. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common neonatal morbidity associated with prematurity and infants with BPD suffer from increased incidence of respiratory infections, asthma, other forms of chronic lung illness, and death (Day and Ryan, Pediatr Res 81: 210-213, 2017; Isayama et la., JAMA Pediatr 171:271-279, 2017). BPD is now understood as a longitudinal disease process influenced by the intrauterine environment during gestation and modulated by gene-environment interactions throughout the neonatal and early childhood periods. Despite of this concept, there remains a paucity of multidisciplinary team-based approaches dedicated to the comprehensive study of this complex disease., METHODS: The Discovery BPD (D-BPD) Program involves a cohort of infants < 1,250 g at birth prospectively followed until 6 years of age. The program integrates analysis of detailed clinical data by machine learning, genetic susceptibility and molecular translation studies., DISCUSSION: The current gap in understanding BPD as a complex multi-trait spectrum of different disease endotypes will be addressed by a bedside-to-bench and bench-to-bedside approach in the D-BPD program. The D-BPD will provide enhanced understanding of mechanisms, evolution and consequences of lung diseases in preterm infants. The D-BPD program represents a unique opportunity to combine the expertise of biologists, neonatologists, pulmonologists, geneticists and biostatisticians to examine the disease process from multiple perspectives with a singular goal of improving outcomes of premature infants., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Does not apply for this study.

AB  - Lung development follows a stereotypic program orchestrated by key interactions among epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Deviations from this developmental program can lead to pulmonary diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Significant efforts have been made to examine the cellular and molecular basis of the tissue interactions underlying these stereotypic developmental processes. Genetically engineered mouse models, lung organ culture, and advanced imaging techniques are a few of the tools that have expanded our understanding of the tissue interactions that drive lung development. Intimate crosstalk has been identified between the epithelium and mesenchyme, distinct mesenchymal tissues, and individual epithelial cells types. For interactions such as the epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk regulating lung specification and branching morphogenesis, the key molecular players, FGF, BMP, WNT, and SHH, are well established. Additionally, VEGF regulation underlies the epithelial-endothelial crosstalk that coordinates airway branching with angiogenesis. Recent work also discovered a novel role for SHH in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition of the mesothelium. In contrast, the molecular basis for the crosstalk between upper airway cartilage and smooth muscle is not yet known. In this review we examine current evidence of the tissue interactions and molecular crosstalk that underlie the stereotypic patterning of the developing lung and mediate injury repair.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Oxidative stress is involved in the development of newborn lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs), which is impaired as a result of prematurity and oxidative injury, may be further affected by specific genetic polymorphisms or an unfavorable combination of more of them., RECENT ADVANCES: Genetic polymorphisms of superoxide dismutase and catalase were recently demonstrated to be protective or risk factors for the main complications of prematurity. A lot of research focused on the potential of different antioxidant strategies in the prevention and treatment of lung diseases of the newborn, providing promising results in experimental models., CRITICAL ISSUES: The effect of different genetic polymorphisms on protein synthesis and activity has been poorly detailed in the newborn, hindering to derive conclusive results from the observed associations with adverse outcomes. Therapeutic strategies that aimed at enhancing the activity of AOEs were poorly studied in clinical settings and partially failed to produce clinical benefits., FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The clarification of the effects of genetic polymorphisms on the proteomics of the newborn is mandatory, as well as the assessment of a larger number of polymorphisms with a possible correlation with adverse outcome. Moreover, antioxidant treatments should be carefully translated to clinical settings, after further details on optimal doses, administration techniques, and adverse effects are provided. Finally, the study of genetic polymorphisms could help select a specific high-risk population, who may particularly benefit from targeted antioxidant strategies.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Fetal lung development takes place in hypoxia meaning that premature birth is hyperoxia for the prematurely born infant. The most common respiratory morbidity afflicting premature infants is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pathophysiologically, BPD represents the impact of injury, including O2 toxicity, to the immature developing lung that causes arrested lung development., RECENT ADVANCES: The thioredoxin (Trx) system, which is predominantly expressed in pulmonary epithelia in the newborn lung, acts as an antioxidant system; however, it is increasingly recognized as a key redox regulator of signal transduction and gene expression via thiol-disulfide exchange reactions., CRITICAL ISSUES: This review focuses on the contribution of Trx family proteins toward normal and aberrant lung development, in particular, the roles of the Trx system in hyperoxic responses of alveolar epithelial cells, aberrant lung development in animal models of BPD, O2-dependent signaling processes, and possible therapeutic efficacy in preventing O2-mediated lung injury., FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The significant contribution of the Trx system toward redox regulation of key developmental pathways necessary for proper lung development suggests that therapeutic strategies focused on preserving pulmonary Trx function could significantly improve the outcomes of prematurely born human infants.

AB  - Neonatal chronic lung disease, also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is the most common complication of premature birth, affecting up to 30% of very low birth weight infants. Improved medical care has allowed for the survival of the most premature infants and has significantly changed the pathology of BPD from a disease marked by severe lung injury to the "new" form characterized by alveolar hypoplasia and impaired vascular development. However, increased patient survival has led to a paucity of pathologic specimens available from infants with BPD. This, combined with the lack of a system to model alveolarization in vitro, has resulted in a great need for animal models that mimic key features of the disease. To this end, a number of animal models have been created by exposing the immature lung to injuries induced by hyperoxia, mechanical stretch, and inflammation and most recently by the genetic modification of mice. These animal studies have 1) allowed insight into the mechanisms that determine alveolar growth, 2) delineated factors central to the pathogenesis of neonatal chronic lung disease, and 3) informed the development of new therapies. In this review, we summarize the key findings and limitations of the most common animal models of BPD and discuss how knowledge obtained from these studies has informed clinical care. Future studies should aim to provide a more complete understanding of the pathways that preserve and repair alveolar growth during injury, which might be translated into novel strategies to treat lung diseases in infants and adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is usually diagnosed in preterm infants at least 28 days after birth. Great interest lies in the potential to identify biomarkers that predict development of the disease and future neurodevelopmental outcomes. We have reviewed the existing literature on early biomarkers as predictors for BPD in preterm infants., METHODS: Two reviewers independently searched the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for studies pertaining to biomarkers for BPD. Studies were assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria., RESULTS: We identified 46 relevant articles that are summarized in the review. These studies assessed over 30 potential biomarkers. Sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers were reported or could be calculated for only 16 articles, and ranged from 0 to 100 %. Based on the nine highest quality studies, serum KL-6, CC16, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and end-tidal carbon monoxide (etCO) perform extremely well in predicting the early diagnosis of established BPD, highlighting these biomarkers as promising candidates for future research., CONCLUSIONS: Published data from studies on serum biomarkers and etCO suggest that biomarkers may have great potential to predict the subsequent BPD and neurodevelopmental outcomes. These biomarkers need validation in larger studies, and the generalizability of biomarkers for predicting BPD, as well as the neurodevelopmental outcomes, needs to be further explored.

AB  - Preterm infants often experience hyperoxia while receiving supplemental oxygen. Prolonged exposure to hyperoxia during development is associated with pathologies such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. Over the last 25 years, however, experiments with animal models have revealed that moderate exposures to hyperoxia (e.g., 30-60% O(2) for days to weeks) can also have profound effects on the developing respiratory control system that may lead to hypoventilation and diminished responses to acute hypoxia. This plasticity, which is generally inducible only during critical periods of development, has a complex time course that includes both transient and permanent respiratory deficits. Although the molecular mechanisms of hyperoxia-induced plasticity are only beginning to be elucidated, it is clear that many of the respiratory effects are linked to abnormal morphological and functional development of the carotid body, the principal site of arterial O(2) chemoreception for respiratory control. Specifically, developmental hyperoxia reduces carotid body size, decreases the number of chemoafferent neurons, and (at least transiently) diminishes the O(2) sensitivity of individual carotid body glomus cells. Recent evidence suggests that hyperoxia may also directly or indirectly impact development of the central neural control of breathing. Collectively, these findings emphasize the vulnerability of the developing respiratory control system to environmental perturbations. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past several years, several microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling studies have been carried out on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in mammalian lung tissues. The most effective way to identify these important miRNAs is to systematically search for similar signatures identified in multiple independent studies. Accordingly, a meta-analysis was conducted to review published miRNA expression profiling studies that compared miRNA expression profiles between BPD lung tissues and normal lung tissues. A vote-counting strategy that considered the total number of studies and time points reporting differential expression was applied. Furthermore, cut-off criteria of statistically significant differentially expressed miRNAs as defined by the author and their predicted target genes, if available, as well as the list of up- and down-regulated miRNA features, were collected and recorded. Results of the meta-analysis revealed that four up-regulated miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-34a, miRNA-431, and Let-7f) and one down-regulated miRNA (miRNA-335) were differentially expressed in BPD lung tissues compared with normal groups. In addition, eight miRNAs (miRNA-146b, miRNA-29a, miRNA-503, miRNA-411, miRNA-214, miRNA-130b, miRNA-382, and miRNA-181a-1*) were found to show differential expression not only in the process of normal lung development, but also during the progress of BPD. Finally, several meaningful target genes (such as the HPGD and NTRK genes) of common miRNAs (such as miRNA-21 and miRNA-141) were systematically predicted. These specific miRNAs may provide clues of the potential mechanisms involved in BPD. Further mechanistic and external validation studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of these miRNAs in the development of BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease occurring in very and extremely preterm infants undergoing mechanical ventilation. Given the altered lung vascular growth characterizing BPD, circulating angiogenic cells could be useful biomarkers to predict the risk. The objective of the study was to determine whether the percentages of circulating angiogenic cells (CD34+VEGFR-2+, CD34+CD133+VEGFR-2+, and CD45-CD34+CD133+VEGFR-2+ cells), assessed in the peripheral blood at birth by flow cytometry, could be used as markers for the risk of BPD. In one-hundred and forty-two preterm neonates (gestational age less than 32 weeks and/or birth weight less than 1500 g) admitted to our tertiary care Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 2006 and 2009, we evaluated the percentages of circulating angiogenic cells at birth, at 7 days, and, in a subset of infants (n=40), at 28 days of life. The main outcome was the correlation between cell counts at birth and the subsequent risk of developing BPD. In our study, all the three cell populations failed to predict the development of BPD or other diseases of prematurity. We suggest that these cells cannot be used as biomarkers in preterm infants, and that research is needed to find other early predictors of BPD.

AB  - Metabolomics consists of the quantitative analysis of a large number of low molecular mass metabolites involving substrates or products in metabolic pathways existing in all living systems. The analysis of the metabolic profile detectable in a human biological fluid allows to instantly identify changes in the composition of endogenous and exogenous metabolites caused by the interaction between specific physiopathological states, gene expression, and environment. In pediatrics and neonatology, metabolomics offers new encouraging perspectives for the improvement of critically ill patient outcome, for the early recognition of metabolic profiles associated with the development of diseases in the adult life, and for delivery of individualized medicine. In this view, nutrimetabolomics, based on the recognition of specific cluster of metabolites associated with nutrition and pharmacometabolomics, based on the capacity to personalize drug therapy by analyzing metabolic modifications due to therapeutic treatment may open new frontiers in the prevention and in the treatment of pediatric and neonatal diseases. This review summarizes the most relevant results published in the literature on the application of metabolomics in pediatric and neonatal clinical settings. However, there is the urgent need to standardize physiological and preanalytical variables, analytical methods, data processing, and result presentation, before establishing the definitive clinical value of results.

AB  - Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) is closely related to human diseases including non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), infertility, premature membranes and neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Researches on the pathogenicity of UU have become a hot topic in recent years, and suggest that many potential pathogenicity genes or putative pathogenicity islands are involved in its virulence. Moreover, the biovar and serum types of UU, the infection concentration and the state of the host immune system are also important to determine whether UU can cause human disease or not. In this article the recent progress of researches in the pathogenicity of UU is reviewed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Conventionally regarded as a harmless skin commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis accounts for the majority of neonatal late-onset sepsis and is shown to be associated with neonatal inflammatory morbidities, especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This study addressed the pro-inflammatory capacity of different S. epidermidis strains on human alveolar epithelial cells., METHODS: A549 cell monolayers were stimulated by live bacteria of S. epidermidis RP62A strain (biofilm-positive) and ATCC 12228 strain (biofilm-negative) at a multiplicity of infection ratio of 10 for 24h. LPS (100ng/ml) and Pam3CSK4 (1microg/ml) were used for comparisons. Cell viability was measured by MTT method. The mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators and toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 were assessed using RT-PCR, immunoassays and immunofluorescence., RESULTS: Both S. epidermidis strains induced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, but not IL-10. The stimulatory effect of RP62A exceeded that of LPS (p<0.05). RP62A strain showed a trend towards higher induction of pro-inflammatory mediators than ATCC 12228 strain. The co-stimulation with RP62A strain decreased cell viability compared to control and TLR agonists (p<0.05). RP62A but not ATCC 12228 stimulated mRNA and protein expression of TLR2., CONCLUSIONS: S. epidermidis drives pro-inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells in vitro. The pro-inflammatory capacity of S. epidermidis may differ between strains. Biofilm-positive S. epidermidis strain seems to induce more potent pulmonary pro-inflammation than biofilm-negative S. epidermidis strain. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in premature infants. BPD was first described by Northway in 1967 as a chronic respiratory condition that developed in premature infants exposed to mechanical ventilation and high oxygen supplementation. DBP is currently defined by the need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life (mild BPD) and at the 36 weeks of post-menstrual age (moderate and severe BPD). With the advances of neonatal care, epidemiological characteristics and mechanisms of the disease as well as pathological characteristics and clinical course have profoundly changed within the last two decades, but still no effective curative treatment exists and BPD continue to occur among 10 to 20% of premature infants. Furthermore, BPD is a significant source of respiratory and neuro-cognitive morbidities. Thus, its treatment makes a considerable demand on health services. Regarding its pathophysiological mechanisms, it is now established that BPD is a complex disease combining genetic susceptibility and environmental injuries. The identification of genetic variants involved in BPD is a potential source of innovative development in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Indeed, no curative or effective prophylactic therapeutic exists and BPD treatment is currently symptomatic. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.
