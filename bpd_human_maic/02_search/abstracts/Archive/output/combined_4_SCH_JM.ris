AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is histopathologically characterized by alveolar simplification in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated. No treatment is available for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Preterm birth is associated with rapid decline in plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) protein level. We used our preterm lamb model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia to test the hypothesis that recombinant human (rh) IGF-1 bound to binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) will improve structural indices of alveolar formation in mechanically ventilated preterm lambs. Methods Used: Preterm lambs (128d; term ~150d; saccular stage of lung development, ~28w human gestation) were exposed to antenatal steroids, perinatal surfactant, and resuscitated and supported by mechanical ventilation for 7d (Drager VN500, PC-SIMV mode). Physiological targets were PaO2 60-90 mmHg, PaCO2 45-60 mmHg, O2 saturation 88-92%, pH 7.25-7.35. The control group received vehicle (IGF-1 diluent in saline; continuous iv infusion; n=8; 4F 4M). The treated group received rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 (optimized dose of 1.5 mg/Kg/d, iv; n=9; 4F 5M). We used morphometry and stereology to quantify structural indices of alveolar formation. Summary of Results: Radial alveolar count and secondary septal volume density were significantly greater (* p<0.05) in the IGF-1-treated group compared to the control group (Fig 1A and B). Distal airspace wall thickness was not statistically different between the groups (Fig 1C) possibly because of the short period of study. No differences were detected between females and males. Conclusion(s): We conclude that rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 improved indices of alveolar formation in preterm lambs that were mechanically ventilated for 7d. We speculate that rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 may be an effective treatment for preterm infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (Table Presented).

AB  - Purpose of Study: Alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s) that are the target of WNT signaling serve as facultative stem cells in the mature lungs of adults. These AT2 stem cells can be identified by expression of the AT2 canonical marker, SFTPC, and the WNT downstream target gene Axin2. Axin2-AT2 stem cells proliferate in response to various injuries to maintain functional homeostasis through the regeneration of damaged tissue. What about the immature lungs of neonates born before the completion of gestation? There is virtually no information as to whether AT2 stem cells exist in the lungs of neonates born prematurely and whether they are capable of responding to injuries occurring during the NICU course. To address this important gap in our knowledge we investigated whether AXIN2-AT2 cells can be detected in the lungs of preterm infants who died of non-pulmonary causes to those of infants who died from the neonatal chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD. Methods Used: BPD and non-BPD postnatal human lung tissues were provided by the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine and the National Disease Research Interchange and were classified exempt from human subject regulations (RSRB00056775). A combination of immunofluorescence for SFTPC (green) and RNAscope for AXIN2 (red) used to identify regenerative SFTPC(+);AXIN2(+) double-positive cells. Combination IF for SFTPC (red) and RNAscope for MKI67 (white) was used to identify and quantify proliferative AT2s. Multiple samples (greater than 20 experimental replicates) were manually scored. Summary of Results: Our results showed that AXIN2-SFTPC cells are indeed present in control neonatal lungs and represent 28% of the total AT2 cell population. This is remarkably similar to what has been reported in the mature adult human lung. We were surprised to find that the relative abundance of AXIN2-SFTPC cells increased to 36.5% in BPD lungs. This could represent an either incomplete or blunted response to injury. Importantly, while the relative pool of "regenerative" cells is larger, the relative number of proliferating AT2s was smaller in BPD lungs compared to controls. Conclusion(s): The sum of these data indicates that BPD may more likely be caused by a failure in recruitment, rather than a lack of presumptive regenerative epithelial cells. The latter has obvious implications for the pathogenesis of BPD and may offer novel preventive or therapeutic strategies for this neonatal chronic lung disease.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Although inflammation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the triggers, receptors and signaling pathways of the immune cells that respond to exogenous signals such as hyperoxia in the premature lung are incompletely understood.Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor expressed by macrophages and monocytes in the lung. Upon activation, TREM2 can induce p53, a transcription factor (TF) involved in DNA repair or apoptosis. In lung infections, TREM2 has been reported to regulate macrophage function. However, its role in BPD is not known. Our objective was to investigate the role of TREM2 and its downstream TF, p53 in lung macrophages and monocytes during hyperoxia exposure in the developing lung. Methods Used: C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen) between postnatal day 1 and 14. Gene expression changes were measured by single-cell RNAseq and bulk RNAseq of whole lung. To determine the functional importance of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes we used Trem2-deficient mice (TREM2 KO). To identify transcription factor binding sites we used ChIPseq. Protein expression was measured by immunoblot. Lung histology was assessed with H&E stained slides. RNAseq and ChIPseq data were analyzed with HOMER. Summary of Results: Unbiased genomic assessment using single-cell RNAseq showed that hyperoxia exposure upregulates Trem2 in three myeloid subsets; alveolar macrophages (AM), interstitial macrophages (IM) and monocytes. We next determined the functional importance of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes using TREM2 KO mice. Trem2-deficiency resulted in a marked improvement of the lung architecture. Gene expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the p53 pathway after hyperoxia in WT mice as compared to TREM2 KO mice. We validated these findings on the protein level by immunoblot. As predicted by the RNAseq results, hyperoxia exposed WT mice had higher p53 levels than the room air controls. In TREM2 KO mice, hyperoxia exposure did not induce significant changes in p53 protein levels. ChIP-seq analysis identified a significantly increased binding of p53 to active gene regions in the lungs of hyperoxia exposed mice. Conclusion(s): These data suggest that TREM2 is not merely a hyperoxia associated marker but an essential driver of the injury and abnormal lung development after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. Trem2 deficiency and the lack of p53 activation were associated with a protective phenotype. We propose that activation of the TREM2-p53 axis in myeloid cells is part of a dysregulated, injury-induced immune response that derails lung development, and that blocking TREM2 will results in lung regeneration and repair. The selective expression of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes, makes this receptor a highly attractive target for immunotherapy. Furthermore, an inhibitory anti-TREM2 antibody is available and its therapeutic value is currently being tested in phase one clinical trials.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, is characterized by impaired lung development with sustained abnormalities of lung function into adulthood. We have previously demonstrated that a single injection of intra-amniotic endotoxin (IA ETX) causes abnormal distal lung structure in a rodent model of BPD. Whether dysanapsis, defined as disproportionate growth of airways and parenchyma, contributes to sustained abnormalities of lung function in BPD is unknown. Methods Used: Fetal rats were exposed to IA ETX (10 mug) or saline (CTL) at embryonic day 20 (E20) and delivered at term (E22). At day 14, lung mechanics were measured via Flexivent followed by: 1) intratracheal fixation at 20 cmH2O for distal structure analysis; 2) perfusion fixation at 5 cmH2O for stereology; or 3) micro-computed tomography (muCT) at 5 or 20 cmH2O to measure conducting airway diameters. A dysanaptic ratio (DR) of airway diameter (AD) to inspiratory capacity (IC), DR=AD/IC, was calculated to define airway size relative to lung size. Airways reactivity was measured via methacholine challenge (MCh; dose range: 0-25 mg/ml). Response to albuterol (Alb; 0.083%) was assessed after MCh exposure. Summary of Results: Compared to CTL, ETX-exposed pups had decreased body weight and lung volume (p< 0.0001 for both), with no difference in crown-rump length. ETX-exposed pups had increased airways resistance (Rn) and total respiratory system resistance (Rrs), as well as decreased total lung compliance (p<0.01 for all). ETX-exposed pups had decreased radial alveolar counts (RAC), increased mean linear intercepts (MLI), and decreased surface area (p< 0.05 for all). muCT measurements of AD for large airways (trachea, 2nd, and 3rd generations) were decreased in ETX-exposed pups when measured at 5 cmH2O (p<0.005 for all), but there were no differences in 2nd and 3rd generation AD at 20 cmH2O. ETX-exposed pups had decreased IC; however, there were no differences in dysanapsis as assessed by DR (AD/IC). ETX-exposed pups had increased Rn and Rrs in response to MCh (p< 0.05), but sensitivity to MCh was not different from CTL. After MCh exposure, the Rrs percent change in response to Alb was not significantly different between ETX and CTL groups (ETX: 19.5% decrease in Rrs; CTL: 33.1% decrease). Conclusion(s): We found that antenatal ETX exposure impairs lung structure and function in infant rats, including reduced alveolarization and surface area in the distal lung with increased airways resistance. ETX-exposed pups have smaller diameters of the trachea and large airways. Although central airways and distal lung structure are altered after IA ETX, there were no differences in DR. We speculate that injury to both compartments-airways and distal lung-contribute to abnormalities of late lung function after antenatal stress.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants, with pulmonary hypertension (PH) being a common life-threatening sequela of the disease. Further, BPD-associated PH lacks curative therapies. We showed that hyperoxia increases lung AMPKalpha activation in neonatal mice. Whether this alteration is a compensatory or contributory phenomenon in hyperoxiainduced experimental BPD is unclear. Thus, we hypothesized that endothelial AMPKalpha-deficient neonatal mice would be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wild-type littermates. Methods used To determine the necessary role of endothelial AMPKalpha signaling in neonatal lung injury, we decreased endothelial AMPKalpha expression by breeding AMPKalpha-1flox/ flox mice with Tie-Cre mice, and exposed endothelial AMPKalpha-1 sufficient or deficient mouse pups to air (21% FiO2) or hyperoxia (70% O2) from PND1 to PND14. Lung morphometric studies and echocardiographic (echo) studies were done on PND28 to determine the effects of AMPKalpha-1 gene and hyperoxia on alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH. To determine the sufficient role of AMPK signaling in neonatal lung injury, C57BL6J wild-type mice were treated with daily i.p. injections of 1 mg/kg of the AMPK agonist, aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), or the vehicle, while they were exposed to air or hyperoxia through PND1-PND14. Lung morphometric studies were done on PND14 to determine the effects of hyperoxia and AMPKalpha activation on alveolarization and pulmonary vascularization. Summary of results Hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification, as evidenced by decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts. Additionally, hyperoxia decreased lung angiogenesis. Further, hyperoxia induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, as evidenced by increased medial wall thickness index of resistance lung vessels, decreased pulmonary acceleration time/ejection time ratio, and increased right ventricular systolic pressure. However, these effects of hyperoxia were augmented in the presence of endothelial AMPKalpha-1 deficiency. By contrast, AICAR-mediated AMPKalpha activation attenuated hyperoxiainduced lung injury. Conclusions These findings support our hypothesis that AMPKalpha signaling mitigates hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice. We propose that AMPKalpha is a potential therapeutic target for BPD infants with PH.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and Pulmonary hypertension secondary to BPD (BPD-PH) are chronic inflammatory diseases in preterm infants. Due to the multifactorial nature of BPD and BPD-PH, its pathogenesis remains poorly characterised despite considerable research efforts. We discovered that the type 2 immune response plays a role in disease development. Method(s): MURINE STUDIES: In a murine BPD "double hit" model, pregnant dams were injected with 150mug/kg LPS ip at E14. At birth, WT and STAT6-KO pups were randomised into continuous hyperoxia (65% O 2 ) or room air (21% O 2 ) as a control. Pulmonary inflammation was characterised by cytokine abundance, lung structure by histology, pulmonary vasculature by echocardiography and synchrotron micro-CT imaging to visualise pulmonary vasculature remodelling. HUMAN STUDIES: 5 blood samples were collected from 51 preterm infants longitudinally, plus 20 healthy term infants at birth and age 3 to 16weeks, and 5 healthy adults. Result(s): In preterm infants type 2 immune polarization in circulating T cells is associated with cardiopulmonary illness. Maternal magnesium sulfate therapy and delayed hepatitis B vaccination were associated with attenuated type 2 polarization. In mice blocking type 2mediators or STAT6 prevented changes in cell type composition, cytokine increase, and losses of pulmonary capillaries. Thereby, type 2blockade ameliorated lung inflammation, protected alveolar and vascular integrity and confirmed the pathological impact of type 2 cytokines and STAT6. Conclusion(s): This work advances knowledge on developmental immunology and its impact on early life disease and identifies multiple therapeutic approaches that may relieve inflammation-driven suffering in the youngest patients.

AB  - Purpose of Study Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) leads to worse clinical outcomes in former preterm neonates. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor, smooth muscle mitogen, and is increased in the lungs of infants who died with severe BDP. Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, is increased in patients and animals with experimental PH. Serotonin signaling blockade decreases pulmonary vascular resistance and prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling in preclinical neonatal PH models. We hypothesized neonatal TPH1 knock-out (KO) mice would be protected from hypoxia induced BPD and PH. Methods Used Neonatal wild-type (WT) and TPH1 KO offspring were placed in hypoxia or remained in normoxia at Denver altitude for 2 weeks. Weights were recorded at 2 weeks. Plasma 5-HT levels were measured by ELISA. To assess alveolar development, inflation fixed lungs were analyzed for surface area (SA) and mean linear intercept (MLI). To identify total number of small vessels (<30 mum), lung sections were immunostained with VWF. PH was assessed by Fulton's index and right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSPs). Data were analyzed by Prism via unpaired t-test or 2-way ANOVA via Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. Significance level p<0.05. Summary of Results TPH1 KO mice weighed less than WT mice in normoxia and hypoxia. Serotonin levels were significantly decreased in TPH1 KO mice. However, measurable levels of 5-HT remained in TPH1 KO mice. Alveolar development, vascular development, and RVSPs were similar in TPH1 KO and control mice. TPH1 KO mice were not protected from hypoxia induced alveolar simplification or hypoxia induced pulmonary vascular simplification. TPH1 KO mice displayed attenuated hypoxia induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, shown by reduction in RVSPs (32+/-0.66 - 29+/-0.55, p<0.006). Conclusions We speculate the lack of protection against hypoxia induced lung injury observed in TPH1 KO mice may be the result of decreased growth in KO animals and/or be a consequence of 5-HT levels.

AB  - (1) Background: The main challenge in cases of early onset fetal growth restriction is management (i.e., timing of delivery), trying to determine the optimal balance between the opposing risks of stillbirth and prematurity. The aim of this study is to determine the likelihood of neonatal complications depending on the time of birth based on Doppler parameters in fetuses with early onset fetal growth restriction; (2) Methods: A case-control study of 205 consecutive pregnant women diagnosed with early onset FGR was conducted at the Obstetrics Clinic of the Municipal Emergency Hospital in Timisoara, Romania; The case group included newborns who were delivered at the onset of umbilical arteries absent/reversed end-diastolic flow, and the control included infants delivered at the onset of reversed/absent ductus venosus A-wave. (3) Results: The overall neonatal mortality rate was 2.0%, and there was no significant statistical difference between the two study groups. In infants delivered up to 30 gestational weeks, grades III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were statistically significantly more frequent in the control group. Moreover, univariate binomial logistic regression analysis on fetuses born under 30 gestational weeks shows that those included in the control group are 30 times more likely to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 14 times more likely to develop intraventricular hemorrhage grades III/IV; (4) Conclusion(s): Infants delivered according to the occurrence of umbilical arteries absent/reversed end-diastolic flow are less likely to develop intraventricular hemorrhage grades III/IV and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - IMPACT: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia has multiple definitions that are currently based on phenotypic characteristics. Using an unsupervised machine learning approach, we created BPD subclasses (e.g., endotypes) by clustering whole microarray data. T helper 17 cell differentiation was the most significant pathway differentiating the BPD endotypes., INTRODUCTION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extreme prematurity. Discovery of BPD endotypes in an unbiased format, derived from the peripheral blood transcriptome, may uncover patterns underpinning this complex lung disease., METHODS: An unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach applied to genome-wide expression of profiling from 62 children at day of life five was used to identify BPD endotypes. To identify which genes were differentially expressed across the BPD endotypes, we formulated a linear model based on least-squares minimization with empirical Bayes statistics., RESULTS: Four BPD endotypes (A, B,C,D) were identified using 7,319 differentially expressed genes. Across BPD endotypes, 5,850 genes had a p value < 0.05 after multiple comparison testing. Endotype A consisted of neonates with a higher gestational age and birthweight. Endotypes B-D included neonates between 25 and 26 weeks and a birthweight range of 640 to 940 g. Endotype D appeared to have a protective role against BPD compared to Endotypes B and C (36% vs. 62% vs. 60%, respectively). The most significant pathway focused on T helper 17 cell differentiation., CONCLUSION: Bioinformatic analyses can help identify BPD endotypes that associate with clinical definitions of BPD.

AB  - AIM: Autophagy is a common process during development. Abnormal autophagy can impact cell apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that apoptosis is present during bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, there is no consensus on the level of coexisting autophagy. This study was designed to investigate the role of autophagy and the effects of autophagy inducers in a BPD model., METHOD: A total of 100 newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to model and control groups. BPD models were established by hyperoxic induction(FiO2 0.80). Some of them were treated with autophagy-inducing agents., RESULT: As compared to the control group, more autophagic bodies were found within Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT-II cells) under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the model group at 3 d . These autophagic bodies were also accompanied by apoptotic bodies and expression of both bodies peaked at 7 d. As shown by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), there were more apoptotic cells in the model group than in the control group. Protein expression levels of LC3B-II, p62, Lamp1, and cleaved Caspase-3 increased with increased hyperoxic exposure time. No significant differences were observed in the mRNA expression levels of LC3B, p62, and Lamp1. After introducing an autophagy inducer, either rapamycin or lithium chloride, the radial alveolar count (RAC) value of BPD model group increased as compared with placebo group, the thickness of alveolar septum decreased, while apoptosis decreased., CONCLUSION: Reduced autophagy resulting from blocked autophagy flow may be a key link in the pathogenesis of BPD. By enhancing repressed autophagy, apoptosis could be reduced and alveolar development improved. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The role of prematurity and pulmonary inflammation in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is very well-defined. However, there is limited knowledge about whether the level of prematurity and surfactant therapy alter the pulmonary cytokines and endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Method(s): This study analyzed the VEGF and cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the tracheal aspirate (TA) of preterm infants obtained before (within 2 h after birth) and 10-12 h after the administration of the first dose of surfactant. TA was collected from 40 infants of 35 or fewer weeks of gestation, including extremely (Group 1, n = 19), very (Group 2, n = 13), and moderate/late (Group 2, n = 8) preterm neonates. In addition to univariate analysis, controlled regression models estimated the association of perinatal factors with the tested parameters and their role in the development of BPD. Result(s): We recorded significantly lower post-partum levels of VEGF and higher IL-8, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in the TA of Group 1 infants than in Group 2 and 3. Compared to the infants in Group 2 and 3, the post-surfactant increases of pulmonary VEGF, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha were more significant in Group 1. All tested parameters in Group 1 and 2 infants, before and after surfactant administration, were comparable. BPD was recorded in nearly 60% of the extremely preterm survivors and was significantly predicted by increased IL-8 before, and elevated TNF-alpha level after surfactant administration. Conclusion(s): This study indicates the association of birth at extremely preterm gestation with reduction in pulmonary VEGF and exacerbation of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by greater elevation post-surfactant administration levels of VEGF, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 than in neonates born with gestational age of 28-35 weeks.Copyright © 2022 Taiwan Pediatric Association

AB  - Background: Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are frequent in preterm infants and may have long-term impact on respiratory morbidity, especially those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP). The immune response and respiratory are key defence elements, so the purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response regulation and the respiratory epithelial barrier integrity in the preterm infants suffering RVIs during Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission. Method(s): Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) were obtained, separating cells from supernatants. Viral detection was performed by RT-nested PCR, and gene expression by qPCR. Proteins were detected by western blot and ELISA or Luminex. Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were stimulated with Poly:IC and/or wounds. Result(s): Levels of filaggrin, IL-1beta, MIP-1beta, VEGF and HIF-1alpha were higher in pre-infection supernatant samples (p < 0.05), from 26 preterm infants compared to 23 noninfected controls, being infection-risk biomarkers (AUC over 0.7). Conversely, re-infection samples that later developed RVIs had less frequency of filaggrin gene expression and fewer protein levels (p = 0.06). IL-17A, RANTES, VEGF, and HIF-1alpha levels were higher during and post infection (p < 0.05), while MCP-1 and amphiregulin were reduced after infection (p < 0.05 and p = 0.07, respectively). Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) stimulated by poly:IC reduced filaggrin gene expression and increased its levels at supernatant (p < 0.05 and p = 0.08, respectively). Finally, poly:IC stimulation over SAEC increased TLR3 and TSLP expression, while reduced AREG expression (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Filaggrin gene expression and protein quantity was reduced at cellular level of the NPA, while its secreted levels were increased in basal samples from infected newborns and in SAEC stimulated with poly:IC. Our findings highlight the importance of filaggrin as a factor facilitating RVIs.

AB  - Background: Aim: Assessment of neonatal septic complications with major potential risks for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature babies. Method(s): Children with a history of premature birth and oxygen treatment in the postnatal period were evaluated. The research is part of a cohort study. The basic group included 44 premature infants (57.9%: 95% CI 46-69.1) who performed DBP and the control group -32 premature infants (42.1%: 95% CI 30.9-54) without DBP. The research results were statistically analyzed (Microsoft Excel, Epi Info -7.2). Result(s): The birth weight of children with DBP was 1096 +/- 49.2 gr (maximum value of 1995 gr, minimum -457 gr, median -1065 gr, Mo -760 gr), being significant (statistical T = 3.1, p < 0.004) lower compared to children in the control group -1360 +/- 72.6 gr (maximum -2100 gr, minimum -640 gr, median -1315 gr, Mo -1020 gr). The Apgar score in preterm infants in the study group was 5.3 +/- 0.16 points, which confirms a state of asphyxia, possibly with pathogenic impact in the developmental stage of DBP. Premature babies in the control group at birth had a significantly better Apgar score -6.06 +/- 0.23 points (statistical T = 2.7, p < 0.01). In the postnatal period, sepsis was diagnosed in 10 premature infants (23.3%: 95CI 11.8-38.6) who subsequently developed DBP and no case of sepsis in the control group. These results would suggest that the generalized aggressive infection in the neonatal period presents a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of chronic bronchopulmonary disease of the preterm infant (RR = 1.97%: 95% CI, 1.6-2.5; RD = 49.2; p < 0.004). Conclusion(s): The major risk for the development of BPD in premature babies is neonatal sepsis, which occurs in low birth weight infants and signs of postnatal asphyxia.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a prematurity-related lung disease that has evolved over the last decades due to advancements in neonatal care. Animal models of BPD utilize hyperoxia at levels that do not correlate with current clinical practice. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of lower oxygen concentrations on lung development and pathology. Method(s): Pregnant New Zealand-hybrid rabbits underwent caesarean section on gestational day 28 (term 31 days). Kittens were randomised to normoxia (Nox), 50% hyperoxia (50%-H) or 95% hyperoxia (95%-H). On day 7, kits underwent invasive pulmonary function testing (PFT). An in-line nebuliser was used to deliver increasing doses of methacholine for airway reactivity testing. Afterwards, lungs were harvested for histological and molecular testing. Result(s): Static compliance was reduced in both hyperoxia groups (50%-H 2.67 +/- 0.52 p=0.046, 95%-H 1.53 +/- 0.50 p<0.0001). Forced vital capacity (FVC) was reduced in both groups (Nox: 84.27 mL/kg +/- 9.75, 50%-H: 75.69 mL/kg +/- 10.93 p=0.084, 95%-H: 52.11 mL/kg +/-16.61 p<0.0001) and the FEV0.1/FVC ratio was higher among hyperoxia exposed kittens. Reactivity testing in Nox compared to 50%-H was similar but 95%-H group showed markedly less responsiveness to methacholine. Gene expression for molecular markers of fibrosis were abnormal in both hyperoxia groups. Conclusion(s): We detected early changes in lung function and gene expression in preterm rabbits exposed to 50% hyperoxia. While moderate concentrations of oxygen are clinically more relevant, it remains challenging to utilize this research model for pharmacological testing due to small effect sizes.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to use molecular biomarkers and clinical data and echocardiograms that were collected during admission to predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with gestational age <=32 weeks. Method(s): Eighty-two patients (40 with BPD, BPD group and 42 healthy as controls, non-BPD group) admitted to the Department of Neonatology of the Children's Hospital of Soochow University between October 1, 2018, and February 29, 2020, were enrolled in this study at the tertiary hospital. Basic clinical data on the perinatal period, echocardiographic measurements, and molecular biomarkers (N-terminal-pro-B-brain natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP) were collected. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to establish an early predictive model for detecting BPD development in preterm infants of gestational age <=32 weeks. We also used a receiver operating characteristic curve to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the model. Result(s): No significant differences were found between the BPD and non-BPD groups in terms of sex, birth weight, gestational age, incidence of asphyxia, maternal age, gravidity, parity, mode of delivery, premature rupture of membranes >18 h, use of prenatal hormones, placental abruption, gestational diabetes mellitus, amniotic fluid contamination, prenatal infections, and maternal diseases. The use of caffeine, albumin, gamma globulin; ventilation; days of FiO2 >= 40%; oxygen inhalation time; red blood cell suspension infusion volume (ml/kg); and proportion of infants who received total enteral nutrition (120 kcal/kg.d) >=24 d after birth were higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group. The levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin in the BPD group were significantly lower than those in the non-BPD group. The total calorie intake was significantly lower in the BPD group on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th day after birth than in the non-BPD group (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), pulmonary hypertension, and tricuspid regurgitation were significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group (P < 0.05). The serum level of NT-proBNP 24 h after birth was significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group (P < 0.05). Serum NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in infants with severe BPD than in those with mild or moderate BPD (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): As there were various risk factors for BPD, a combining clinical data, molecular biomarkers, and echocardiogram measurements can be valuable in predicting the BPD. The tricuspid regurgitation flow rate (m/s), NT-proBNP (pg/ml), ventilator-associated pneumonia, days of FiO2 >= 40% (d), red blood cell suspension infusion volume (ml/kg), and proportion of infants who received total enteral nutrition (120 kcal/kg.d) >=24 d after birth were the most practical factors considered for designing an appropriate model for predicting the risk of BPD.Copyright 2023 Wang, Yan, Wu, Geng, Zhu and Zhu.

AB  - Background: Systemic hydrocortisone administration has been widely used in preterm infants who are at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the effects of hydrocortisone on cytokine profiles have not been examined. We aimed to investigate the effects of postnatal hydrocortisone treatment on serum cytokine levels in extremely preterm infants. Method(s): This is a retrospective study of 29 extremely preterm infants born at <28 weeks of gestational age. We obtained serum from blood samples collected during an early phase (5-20 days) and a late phase (28-60 days) after birth. We measured the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6), T-helper (Th) 1 cytokines (interferon-gamma, IL-2, and IL-12p70), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10), Th17 cytokine IL-17A, and chemokine IL-8. The cytokine levels between the early and late phases were compared between infants who received postnatal hydrocortisone and those who did not. Result(s): Thirteen infants (45%) received systemic hydrocortisone treatment at a median age of 15 days (IQR: 10.0-21.5) after birth due to respiratory deterioration. The percentage of BPD was higher in the steroid group than in the non-steroid group (P = 0.008). The ratio of IL-6 for the late-to-early phase was significantly lower in the steroid group than in the non-steroid group (P = 0.04). The concentration of the other cytokines remained unchanged between the phases. Conclusion(s): Although the postnatal hydrocortisone treatment provided for respiratory deterioration did not prevent the BPD development, hydrocortisone treatment might suppress IL-6 overproduction in extremely preterm infants.Copyright © 2022 Japan Pediatric Society.

AB  - Background: The genetic cause of most fetal anomalies is not determined prenatally, however, prenatal molecular sequencing is an emerging diagnostic tool for early fetal diagnosis, timely clinical management, reproductive planning, and potential treatment. The yield of prenatal genomic testing is often limited by lack of fetal genotype-phenotype correlations and the expansion of this tool is reliant on deeper fetal phenotyping. Here we provide the first case with prenatal ultrasonographic and autopsy findings in an infant with VARS2-related mitochondrial disease (OMIM #615917). The VARS2 gene encodes a mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase and is associated with early onset encephalocardiomyopathy with brain MRI changes, hypotonia, and plasma lactate elevation. Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase disorders are an emerging group of genetic conditions with only 24 VARS2 cases published to date. Method(s): Written and informed consent was obtained. Clinical trio exome sequencing was performed. Mitochondrial respiratory chain analysis and post-mortem autopsy were performed at Seattle Children's Hospital. Result(s): Our male patient was born at 35 weeks 2 days gestational age, weighing 1.881 kg (Z-score -2.46), prenatal complicated by fetal bradycardia concerning for sick sinus node, cardiomegaly, ventricular hypertrophy, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There was no hydrops, and he was non-dysmorphic on exam. He was encephalopathic, diffusely hypotonic, and had minimal response to stimuli. Despite maximal medical management, he died at 5 days of age in the setting of hypoxic respiratory failure, persistent lactic acidosis (>20 mmol/L), and a severe pulmonary hypertensive crisis. There was history of maternal febrile illness in the first trimester. Family history was remarkable for a prior spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestational age. Postnatal exome sequencing identified a homozygous pathogenic variant in VARS2 NM_01167734:c.1258 G>A; p.Ala420Thr. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme analyses showed minimally reduced complex 1 activity, with the reactions for complexes 1, 3 and 4 were at the low end of normal. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of VARS2-related mitochondrial disease. Findings at autopsy included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatic steatosis, brain injury with gliosis. The heart was enlarged, globular, with biventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular non-compaction. His lungs showed severe pulmonary arteriopathy, with numerous occlusive thrombi and immaturity with hyaline membrane disease. Pulmonary hypertension in this infant was attributed to his congenital cardiomyopathy compounded by respiratory insufficiency. Placental examination showed severe chronic villitis and focal findings of maternal vascular malperfusion. Conclusion(s): We present a case of an infant with VARS2-related disease with a severe, prenatal-onset phenotype. The observed allele frequency of this mutation (p.Ala420Thr) is 0.0381% in gnomAD. By Harby-Weinberg estimations this variant alone would account for a prevalence of 1.5:10,000,000, suggesting this is an underrecognized condition. Novel features that broaden the pre and perinatal phenotype of this rare mitochondrial disease include the prenatal onset of cardiomyopathy and bradycardia. IUGR was likely exacerbated by placental abnormalities. The presence of distinct fetal findings (cardiomyopathy, arrythmia and brain abnormalities), detectable by ultrasound suggests that VARS2-related disease can be diagnosed prenatally with molecular sequencing. These clinical findings should prompt suspicion and testing for mitochondrial disease to facilitate early diagnoses and anticipatory management.Copyright © 2023

AB  - Introduction. A characteristic pathology that develops in deeply premature babies with extremely low birth weight is bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which has a chronic course and leads to death in a number of children. When studying the pathogenesis of this disease, many authors attach great importance to pathological processes occurring at the cellular and molecular genetic levels, in particular, oxidative stress. Purpose. To desing a model for predicting the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature newborns with respiratory disorders. Materials and methods. On the basis of the health care institution "Grodno Regional Perinatal Center" 45 premature newborns were examined. In addition to the general clinical examination, the concentration of homocysteine, cysteine, gamma-glutamylcysteine, reduced glutathione (GSH) was determined. The main group (1) consisted of 22 premature infants who were clinically diagnosed with bronchopulmonarydysplasia, group 2 included 23 infants who did not develop this disease. Results. To build a model for determining the probability of developing BPD, those signs were determined that were statistically significantly different in groups 1 and 2, then the values of the correlation or association coefficients were determined for all pairs of signs identified at the first stage. From the remaining variables, sets of regression models were built by enumeration. Only those models were selected in which all predictors were statistically significant. After filtering the models, the most optimal model turned out to be the one in which the variable "presence of BPD" is associated with a linear combination of only 3 predictors: the concentration of total protein in the blood serum at birth, the concentration of albumin in the blood serum on the 5th-7th day of life, the concentration of reduced glutathione in the blood serum on the 5th-7th day of life. A binary logistic regression equation was constructed to assess the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Conclusions. Based on the results of the regression analysis, a mathematical model was developed that allows determining the likelihood of developing BPD in premature newborns with respiratory distress syndrome. To build an equation, it is necessary to perform a biochemical blood test: determination of the concentration of total protein in the blood serum at birth and albumin on the 5-7th day of life, determination of the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the blood serum on the 5-7th day of life. Next, for each patient, the value of "p" is calculated using a mathematical equation. With an estimated p value of more than 0.539, preterm infants with respiratory disorders are predicted to develop BPD with a sensitivity of 93.33% and a specificity of 83.33%, with an overall accuracy of 87.18%.Copyright © 2022, Professionalnye Izdaniya.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common long-term morbidity of premature birth, and the incidence of BPD is not declining despite medical advancements. Infants with BPD are at high risk for postnatal growth failure and are often treated with therapies that suppress growth. Additionally, these infants may display excess weight gain relative to linear growth. Optimal growth and nutrition are needed to promote lung growth and repair, improve long-term pulmonary function, and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. Linear growth in particular has been associated with favorable outcomes yet can be difficult to achieve in these patients. While there has been a significant clinical and research focus regarding BPD prevention and early preterm nutrition, there is a lack of literature regarding nutritional care of the infant with established BPD. There is even less information regarding how nutritional needs change as BPD evolves from an acute to chronic disease. This article reviews the current literature regarding nutritional challenges, enteral nutrition management, and monitoring for patients with established BPD. Additionally, this article provides a practical framework for interdisciplinary nutritional care based on our clinical experience at the Comprehensive Center for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - miR-21 has been confirmed to be overexpressed in neonatal rat lungs with hyperoxia-mediated bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The specific function of miR-21 in BPD is still unclear. We established the hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model in vivo and the hyperoxia-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) model in vitro. Transwell assay was utilized to detect the migratory capability of PMVECs. Tube formation assay was utilized to measure angiogenesis ability. ELISA was utilized to test nitric oxide (NO) production and the intracellular and extracellular Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentration. Furthermore, the interaction between miR-21 and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) was evaluated using luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-21 expression in PMVECs was increased by hyperoxia stimulation. Inhibition of miR-21 improved the migratory and angiogenic activities of PMVECs and overexpression of miR-21 exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-21 increased NO production and decreased intracellular and extracellular ADMA concentration in hyperoxia-treated PMVECs. Next we proved that miR-21 could bind to DDAH1 and negatively regulate its expression. Rescues assays showed that DDAH1 knockdown reversed the effects of miR-21 depletion on hyperoxia-mediated PMVEC functions, NO production, and ADMA concentration. Importantly, miR-21 downregulation restored alveolarization and vascular density in BPD rats. This study demonstrates that inhibition of miR-21 improves pulmonary vascular responses in BPD by targeting the DDAH1/ADMA/NO pathway.Copyright © 2022 the author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine infection/inflammation plays an important role in the development of lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, While a multifactorial genesis is likely, mechanisms involved in BPD after intrauterine infection/inflammation are largely unknown. Recent studies have suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) are likely to play a role. Therefore, this study aimed to study the effects and mechanisms of intrauterine infection/inflammation on lung development, and to identify miRNAs related to lung injury and BPD., METHODS: An animal model of intrauterine infection/inflammation was established with pregnant SD rats endocervically inoculated with E.coli. The fetal and neonatal rats were observed at embryonic day (E) 17, 19, 21 and postnatal day (P) 1, 3, 7, 14, respectively. Body weight, lung weight, the expression levels of NLRP3, TNF-alpha, IL-lbeta, IL-6, VEGF, Collagen I, SP-A, SP-B and SP-C in the lung tissues of fetal and neonatal rats were measured. Expression profiles of 1218 kinds of miRNAs in the lungs of neonatal rats were detected by miRNA microarray technique. Target genes of the identified miRNAs were predicted through online software., RESULTS: Intrauterine infection/inflammation compromised not only weight development but also lung development of the fetal and neonatal rats. The results showed significantly increased expression of NLRP3, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, Collagen I, and significantly decreased expression of VEGF, SP-A, SP-B and SP-C in the fetal and neonatal rat lung tissues in intrauterine infection group compared to the control group at different observation time point (P < 0.05). Forty-three miRNAs with significant differential expression were identified. Possible target genes regulated by the identified miRNAs are very rich., CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine infection/inflammation results in lung histological changes which are very similar to those observed in BPD. Possible mechanisms may include NLRP3 inflammasome activation followed by inflammatory cytokines expression up-regulated, inhibiting the expression of pulmonary surfactant proteins, interfering with lung interstitial development. There are many identified miRNAs which target a wide range of genes and may play an important role in the processes of lung injury and BPD.

AB  - Background: Very Low Birth Weight infants (VLBW, < 1,500g at birth) require extended neonatal care via fortification of breast milk to meet their nutritional needs. Targeted Fortification (TFO) is based on measuring macronutrients in human milk to tailor infants' feeding, while Standard Fortification (SF) assumes average macronutrient values in milk. TFO is becoming the preferred method in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), but there is a lack of studies about its cost-effectiveness. This study analyses the cost-effectiveness of TFO, by quantifying the total costs versus the economic benefits of TFO over SF. Methodology: Various use case scenarios were analyzed, considering different frequency of milk analysis (every day to three times per week) and sizes of the NICU (on average 10, 50 and 100 VLBW infants fed TFO every day). The costs of TFO were calculated considering costs for purchasing and operating one of two different systems for human milk analysis, and include the cost for the device to analyze human milk, recurring costs such as consumables, and operating costs such as the increased workload for nurses and dieticians. The economic benefits were calculated by quantifying the health outcomes resulting from TFO as reported in literature, namely the reduction in the prevalence of key neonatal diseases - Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), Sepsis, and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). Result(s): TFO generates significant savings in all the scenarios. In a 50-bed unit, annual savings can reach up to $1,549,888, entirely covering TFO costs for 10 years ($1,058,903). A sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the reduction rate for each disease that would cover all the TFO related cost for 10 years. In a 50-bed unit performing human milk analysis every day, 10-year costs of TFO would be covered by reducing NEC by 21.4 cases in 10 years (0.65% net reduction), sepsis by 87.3 cases (2.6% reduction), and BPD by 27.8 cases (0.84% reduction), over the same 10-year period. Conclusion(s): We concluded that TFO is a more cost-effective Isabel Hoffmann, CEO and founder of Tellspec, is a deep-tech entrepreneur who has successfully founded eight companies over the last 28 years in the fields of analytical vibrational spectroscopy, medical devices and more recently in Al-based data analysis. Diogo Barros is data scientist at Tellspec, the company that is developing the Preemie System for human milk analysis. Paolo Satta, Tellspec's Chief Operating Officer, is leading the operations for developing the Preemie Systems. More about the authors' bios at the end of this article. fortification approach, since initial set-up costs and operating costs are recovered within 1-2 years, depending on the scenario, due to the reduction in the prevalence of key diseases. Furthermore, the economic benefits achieved with TFO are expected to be higher than the ones reported, due to the medium- and long-term health benefits achieved in the life of VLBW infants.Copyright © 2022 Goldstein and Associates.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the complications and outcomes during the hospitalization of extremely premature infants (EPI) and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI). Method(s): Clinical data of 168 cases of EPI and ELBWI admitted to 4 hospitals of grade three in Shaanxi Province between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The information of general data, prenatal care, complications and outcomes were summarized. Outcomes of different groups were compared according to birth weight and gestational age. Result(s): A total of 168 cases of EPI and ELBWI were collected. The rate of delivery in tertiary hospitals was 86.9% (146/165 cases), 86 patients (57.7%) received prenatal Dexamethasone. The mean gestational age was (27.9+/-1.7) weeks, and the mean birth weight was (951.6+/-148.9) g. The highest rates of pregnancy complications included gestational hypertension (44/149 cases, 29.5%), premature rupture of membranes (43/149 cases, 28.9%) and gestational diabetes (16/149 cases, 10.7%). The first three neonatal complications were neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (16/168 cases, 95.2%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (73/110 cases, 66.4%) and retinopathy of prematurity (65/110 cases, 59.1%). The survival rate of EP and ELBWI in 168 cases was 61.9% (104/168 cases), the abandonment rate was 27.4% (46/168 cases), and the mortality in hospital was 10.7% (18/168 cases). According to birth weight and gestational age, there were no statistically significant differences in survival, abandonment and hospital mortality among different birth weight groups(chi2=4.361, 5.104, 1.630, all P>0.05), while there were statistically significant differences in survival, abandonment and hospital mortality among different gestational age groups(chi2=21.650, 8.164, 13.490, all P<0.05). Conclusion(s): There are many complications of EPI and ELBWI and the outcomes are closely related to the gestational age of birth. Improving the perinatal management level and the professional diagnosis and treatment level of neonatology are helpful to improve the survival rate and prognosis.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of Budesonide (BUD) on pulmonary vascular development and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in newborn rats with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) caused by intrauterine infection. Method(s): The 15-day-pregnant SD rats were divided into control group and infection group [intraperitoneal injection of 0.35 mg/(kg.d) lipopolysaccharide], and the newborn rats born by the above groups were divided into 3 groups: BUD group (0.5 mg of BUD suspension), normal control group (NC group, equal amount of 9 g/L saline), BPD group (equal amount of 9 g/L saline), with 40 rats in each group, all of them were inhaled twice a day for 14 days.Ten newborn rats were selected at birth, on the 3rd, 7th and 14th day after administration.Pulmonary histopathological changes and radial alveolar counts (RAC) were observed after HE staining, and the thickness of alveolar respiratory membrane was measured; the platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1/CD31) in lung tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the density of pulmonary microvessels was calculated; the expressions of VEGF, NLRP3 and Caspase-1 were detected by Western blot; and the levels of serum interleukin( IL)-1beta and IL-18 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Result(s): With the increase of day-old, the lung tissue of newborn rats in NC group was gradually developed and matured, the structure of alveoli was clear, the size was uniform, the count was significantly increased, and no obvious pathological changes were observed.In BPD group, the lung tissue structure was disordered, the alveoli were different in size and few in count, and inflammatory cells were exuded from the alveoli or the alveoli space.Compared with BPD group, the pathological changes of lung tissue in BUD group were significantly reduced.On the 3rd, 7th and 14th day after administration, compared with NC group, the RAC, average integral optical density of CD31 positive cells, density of pulmonary microvessel and level of VEGF protein in lung tissue of BPD group and BUD group were lower, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05); while the thickness of respiratory membrane, level of NLRP3, Caspase-1 proteins in lung tissue and serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-18 were significantly higher, and the differences were statistically significant(all P<0.05). Compared with BPD group, the RAC, average integral optical density of CD31 positive cells, density of pulmonary microvessel and level of VEGF protein in lung tissue of BPD group and BUD group were significantly higher, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05); while the thickness of respiratory membrane, level of NLRP3, Caspase-1 proteins in lung tissue and serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-18 were significantly lower, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). Conclusion(s): The occurrence and development of pathological changes of BPD newborn rats caused by intrauterine infection can affect the development of pulmonary vessels through the inflammatory response of lung tissue.BUD can alleviate pathological changes in lung tissues of BPD newborn rats by reducing inflammatory reaction and up-regulating VEGF expression, promoting pulmonary vascular remodeling, and increasing pulmonary microvascular density.Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association

AB  - [Objective] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that typically affects infants delivered at a gestational age of <30 weeks. Although surfactant replacement therapies and gentle ventilation are common strategies for preventing BPD-related lung injury, they have limited efficacy. Relatively new approaches using mesenchymal stem cells tMSCs) have shown promise as potential curative therapies. Previously, we showed that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1), released from injured tissue, induced regeneration through activating platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha-positive bone-marrow MSCs. Our another work also identified and synthesized a critical domain in HMGB1 that induces regeneration. In this study, we tested whether the HMGB1 peptide can ameliorate BPD-related lung injury. [Methods] We used a well-characterized mouse BPD model created with a hyperoxic chamber. Briefly, normoxic mouse pups were kept in room air, and hyperoxic mouse pups were raised in hyperoxic chambers v90% 02) from birth until postnatal day 14. Pups were administered with either HMGB1 peptide or saline on Postnatal 4,8 and 12. Mice were sacrificed at P14 for detailed evaluations. [Results] HMGB1 peptide significantly rescued BPD-related decreases in body weight and survival. The treatment also restored alveolar structure via suppressing inflammation and fibrosis in the lung. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the lung further showed that the peptide significantly suppressed a hyperoxia-induced inflammatory signature in macrophages and fibrotic signature in fibroblasts. These changes in the transcriptome were also confirmed at the protein level. [Conclusion] Our data show that treatment with the HMGB1 peptide suppressed inflammation and fibrosis, thus preventing BPD progression.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effects of human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) on inflammation of hyperoxic lung injury in neonatal rats. Method(s): Seventy-two neonatal rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, BPD group, hyperoxia + low-dose recombinant erythropoietin [EPO(L)]group, and hyperoxia + high-dose recombinant erythropoietin [EPO(H)]group. The neonatal rats in BPD group, hyperoxia + EPO(L)group and hyperoxia + EPO(H)group were exposed to 850 mL/L oxygen. Then the neonatal rats in hyperoxia + EPO(L)group and hyperoxia + EPO(H)group were given 800 IU/kg and 2 000 IU/kg rhEPO by subcutaneous injection respectively at 1 d, 3 d and 7 d, while the control group and BPD group were given the same amount of 9 g/L saline water. Initially, the body weight of each group was recorded at 3 d, 7 d and 14 d. The morphological structure changes of lung tissues were observed by HE staining under light microscope, and the radial alveolar count(RAC) in lung tissues were detected. The expression of nuclear factor kappa B(NF-kappaB) was detected by immunofluorescence staining; Western blot was applied to determine the protein expression of phosphorylated NF-kappaB(pNF-kappaB), inhibitor protein(IkappaB) and Caspase-3 in lung tissues; and the expression of interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Result(s): (1) On the 14th day, the body weight of neonatal rats in the BPD group was lower than that in the control group [(18.97+/-3.21) g vs.(27.97+/-2.30) g], and the difference was statistically significant(P<0.01); however, the body weights of neonatal rats in the hyperoxia+ EPO(L)group and hyperoxia+ EPO(H)group[(24.16+/-2.15) g, (26.04+/-1.97) g] was much heavier than that in the BPD group, and the differences was statistically significant(all P<0.05). (2) The morphological structure of lung tissues which was observed by HE staining showed that in the BPD group, there were a few inflammatory cells infiltration in alveolar septum on the 3rd day, the inflammatory response was more evident on the 7th day, when exudation could be seen in the alveolar cavity; and on the 14th day, the number of pulmonary alveoli decreased, pulmonary bulla formed, and septa were thickened. Besides, it was also observed that compared with control group, RAC was significantly decreased in BPD group on the 14th day(5.50+/-1.29 vs.14.33+/-2.80), and the difference was statistically significant(P<0.01). Pathological changes were ameliorated and the infiltration of inflammatory reaction cells was reduced in the hyperoxia+ EPO(L)group and hyperoxia + EPO(H)group.RAC was remarkably higher in the hyperoxia+ EPO(L)group and hyperoxia+ EPO(H)group than that in the BPD group on the 14th day, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). (3)Immunofluorescence results showed that: the number of NF-kappaB p65 positive cells increased significantly and fluorescence intensity increased in the BPD group, while EPO could greatly reduce the number of NF-kappaB p65 positive cells and lower the fluorescence intensity.(4)Western blot results indicated that compared with the control group, the expressions of pNF-kappaB p65 and Cleaved Caspase-3 was significantly increased, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05); and IkappaB was significantly lower, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The expression of NF-kappaB p65 and Cleaved Caspase-3 was significantly lower, but IkappaB was significantly higher in the hyperoxia+ EPO(L)group and the hyperoxia+ EPO(H)group than those in the BPD group, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). (5) ELISA results revealed that the expression of IL-1beta in the BPD group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05); Compared with BPD group, the expression of IL-1beta was significantly lower in the hyperoxia+ EPO(L)group and hyperoxia+ EPO(H)group, and the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). Conclusion(s): EPO can reduce hyperoxia-induced lung tissue apoptosis and protect newborn rats against hyperoxic lung injury by decreasing the inflammatory response of cells through the NF-kappaB pathway on BPD.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.

AB  - Objective: A cough that lasts longer than four weeks in children is called chronic cough. The aim of this study is to determine the underlying causes of chronic cough. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients aged 0-18 years who were referred to Sanliurfa Training and Research Hospital pediatric pulmonology outpatient clinic between 27 December 2021 and 30 June 2022 due to chronic cough were enrolled. Patients with known cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, interstitial lung disease, asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia were excluded from the study. The "CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report" guideline was used in the approach to chronic cough. Result(s): 153 patients were included in this study. The most common causes of chronic cough were asthma (30.7%), protracted bacterial bronchitis (20.3%), and upper respiratory tract cough syndrome (11.1%). Wet cough was present in 60.8% of the patients with chronic cough and the most common diagnosis in patients with wet cough were protracted bacterial bronchitis (33.3%), pneumonia and other lung infections (17.2%) and bronchiectasis (12.9%). The most common diagnoses were asthma (68.3%), upper airway cough syndrome (6.7%), and natural recovery (6.7%) in patients with dry cough. Failure to thrive was more common in patients with wet cough than patients with dry cough (p<0.030) and fever, weight loss and desaturation were only present in patients with wet cough. Conclusion(s): The most common reasons are asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis and upper airway cough syndrome. The differential diagnosis should be made by pediatricians based on specific cough pointers, careful physical examination and tests performed in line with the recommendations of the guidelines.Copyright © 2023 Ankara Pediatric Hematology Oncology Training and Research Hospital.

AB  - Objective: To provide clear and concise guidelines for the diagnosis and management of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) Target Population: All patients with PPROM <37 weeks gestation Benefits, Harms, and Costs: This guideline aims to provide the first Canadian general guideline on the management of preterm membrane rupture. It includes a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the evidence on the diagnosis, management, timing and method of delivery. Evidence: The following search terms were entered into PubMed/Medline and Cochrane in 2021: preterm premature rupture of membranes, PPROM, chorioamnionitis, Nitrazine test, ferning, commercial tests, placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) test, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) test, ultrasonography, PPROM/antenatal corticosteroids, PPROM/Magnesium sulphate, PPROM/ antibiotic treatment, PPROM/tocolysis, PPROM/preterm labour, PPROM/Neonatal outcomes, PPROM/mortality, PPROM/outpatient/inpatient, PPROM/cerclage, previable PPROM. Articles included were randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, and observational studies. Additional publications were identified from the bibliographies of these articles. Only English-language articles were reviewed. Validation Methods: The authors rated the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. See Appendix A (Tables A1 for definitions and A2 for interpretations of strong and weak recommendations). Intended Audience: All prenatal and perinatal health care providers. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: 1. Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes complicates approximately 3% of pregnancies and causes approximately one-third of all spontaneous preterm deliveries (high). 2. Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes is associated with high neonatal mortality and short- and long-term severe neonatal morbidity such as periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and adverse neurodevelopment outcomes (high). 3. The latency period from rupture of membranes to delivery is negatively correlated with gestational age at preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (high). 4. There is insufficient evidence on both the testing modality and the optimal frequency of testing to prevent adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes (low). 5. Bed rest is not beneficial in the setting of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes and has adverse maternal effects (high). 6. Serial monitoring of white cell count or other markers of inflammation have not been proven to be useful in the absence of other clinical signs of infection (low). 7. There is insufficient evidence to recommend hospital versus home management for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (low). 8. Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes may complicate up to 38% of pregnancies in patients who have undergone cervical cerclage (moderate). 9. There are no randomized controlled trials comparing different management strategies (or timing) in the setting of previable preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (low). 10. Amniotic fluid volume at time of rupture may be helpful in counselling patients and families with previable preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, as anhydramnios and oligohydramnios are more frequently associated with pregnancy loss and pulmonary hypoplasia compared with normal amniotic fluid volumes (low). 11. There is conflicting evidence about the relationship between the gestational age at preterm prelabour rupture of membranes in a previous pregnancy and future pregnancy risks (low). 12. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of prevention strategies for reducing complications in subsequent pregnancies for patients with a history of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (moderate). 13. The reported recurrence risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes in future pregnancy ranges from 10% to 32%, but the most common complication in future pregnancy is preterm birth (34%-46%) (moderate). RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. The diagnosis of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes should be based on the combination of patient's history and physical examination by a sterile speculum with direct visualization of fluid in the posterior fornix (strong, moderate). 2. Digital exam should be avoided to reduce the risk of infection, unless the patient is in active labour (strong, moderate). 3. Multiple conventional tests (nitrazine, ferning test, and ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume) should be considered to confirm the diagnosis of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes when amniotic fluid is not visible at speculum examination (strong, moderate). 4. Commercial tests, particularly placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1), should be considered following conventional tests in equivocal cases or used as the primary tests in rural and remote areas if other diagnostic options are not available or feasible (strong, moderate). 5. Once preterm prelabour rupture of membranes is diagnosed, the initial assessment should include maternal and fetal status with the principal purpose of ruling out active labour, infection (chorioamnionitis), placental abruption, or fetal distress, all conditions that warrant immediate delivery (strong, high). 6. Once preterm prelabour rupture of membranes is diagnosed, a vaginal/rectal swab should be obtained to test for group B Streptococcus colonization if not previously done within 5 weeks (conditional, moderate). 7. Expectant management with maternal and fetal monitoring should be offered to patients who have no contraindications to continuing the pregnancy (strong, moderate). 8. Given that the rate of preterm birth is highest immediately following preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, hospitalization is recommended for the first few days following diagnosis (conditional, low). 9. Based on the gestational age at preterm prelabour rupture of membranes and local capacity and resources, antenatal transfer to centres specialized in preterm care should be considered (strong, high). 10. The optimal antibiotic regimen for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes remains unclear. If group B Streptococcus status is unknown or positive, the antibiotic regimen should include coverage for this pathogen (strong, moderate). 11. The following 2 antibiotic regimens may be used: 1) a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin) alone or associated with group B Streptococcus coverage for 2 days (if group B Streptococcus status is unknown or positive), or 2) a combination of ampicillin/amoxicillin and a macrolide independently of group B Streptococcus status. There are no data to support extending the antibiotic therapy beyond 10 days (strong, moderate). 12. Alternative antibiotic therapy can be considered based on local data on antibiotic resistance (conditional, low). 13. Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be routinely administered to patients with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes at the time of diagnosis when gestational age criteria are met (strong, moderate). 14. There is insufficient evidence to support prolonged or recurrent use of tocolysis in the context of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes except for ensuring the full course of corticosteroids for 48 hours, or during transfer to a tertiary care centre in the absence of infection or abruption (conditional, moderate). 15. Magnesium sulphate administration for fetal neuroprotection is recommended following preterm prelabour rupture of membranes once the patient is in active labour or prior to indicated delivery, when gestational age criteria are met (strong, moderate). 16. If preterm prelabour rupture of membranes occurs before 34 weeks gestation, expectant management with careful monitoring is recommended at least until 35 weeks, in the absence of contraindications, such as infection, placental abruption, cord accident, or abnormal fetal health surveillance. There is conflicting evidence regarding the optimal timing of delivery in cases of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes during the late-preterm period (340 and 366 weeks gestation). If there is evidence of group B Streptococcus colonization, induction of labour should be considered (conditional, moderate). 17. In patients with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes and cervical cerclage, there is insufficient evidence on whether the cerclage should be removed or remain in situ. In the absence of signs of infection or other contraindications to retaining a cerclage, either option is reasonable (conditional, low). 18. Patients with previable preterm prelabour rupture of membranes should have a consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and neonatology specialist for comprehensive counselling about prognosis and risks, multidisciplinary management planning, and shared decision-making (conditional, moderate).Copyright © 2022 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Societe des obstetriciens et gynecologues du Canada

AB  - Previous studies showed that increased urinary Beta 2-microglobulin (beta2-M) level is associated with fetal inflammatory response and successfully predict bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We aimed to investigate the clinical utility of serum beta2-M levels to predict BPD in preterm infants. Infants born between May and November 2018 and whose gestational age (GA) was <32 weeks were included into the study. During routine blood work in the first couple of hours of life an extra 0.5 mL blood was drawn to study beta2-M levels later on. beta2-M levels were compared between infants who developed BPD or not. Data analysis of 111 infants was performed. Out of 111 infants, 37 died before BPD diagnosis and out of the rest 74 infants, 38 (34.2%) were diagnosed with BPD. Mean GA was 28 +/- 1.8 and 29.9 +/- 1.4 weeks (p < 0.01) and mean birth weights (BW) were 1,086 +/- 316 and 1,395 +/- 348 g (p < 0.01) in BPD group and without BPD respectively. Demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. While the white blood cell count, CRP and IL-6 levels were similar in both groups, beta2-M levels were significantly higher in BPD group (4.84 +/- 1.0 and 3.79 +/- 0.95 mg/L, p = 0.01). Furthermore a weak correlation between beta2-M level and BPD was observed (r = 0.23, p = 0.04). Serum beta2-M levels which obtained in the early postnatal life could predict developing BPD. Monitoring beta2-M levels in infants who have high clinical risk factors for BPD development may provide additional benefit in predicting BPD. Copyright © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal problem in premature newborns that can often lead to a poor outcome. Physicians' knowledge of the earliest predictors of NEC will reduce the likelihood of its development. The purpose of the research was to seek for the earliest predictors of NEC development in the neonatal period in surviving premature newborns with the gestational age (GA) at birth of less than 32 weeks. Materials and methods used: a single-center retrospective cohort study. The analysis of 167 medical records in the Moscow Oblast Regional Perinatal Center (MOPC, located in Balashikha, Moscow Oblast, Russia) was carried out. Inclusion criteria: 1) newborns with GA of less than 32 weeks; 2) information corresponding to the primary variables of this research in the patient's medical records; 3) patients were treated during the period from Apr. 22 to Dec. 24, 2021. Exclusion criteria: 1) lethal outcome, 2) congenital malformations affecting the outcome, 3) chromosomal and/or genetic abnormalities. Two groups: G1 (<>) of 35 patients with NEC; G2 (<>) of 132 without NEC. Result(s): NEC incidence was 8.3% (35/167). Prenatal factors that are statistically significantly more common in the NEC group: an increase in the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the mother's blood prior to the delivery (p=0.003), an increase in pathogenic microflora during pregnancy (p=0.010), detection of Enterococcus faecalis during pregnancy (p=0.016), delivery by the C-section (p=0.028) and the C-section due to fetal deterioration (p=0.001). In premature newborns from the NEC group, a decrease in serum albumin (SA) concentration was statistically significantly more common in the first 30 hours of life (p<0.001). The use of dexamethasone in the first 168 hours of life (p=0.003) and for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p=0.010) was statistically significantly more common in patients with NEC. Conclusion(s): the earliest prenatal predictors of NEC in surviving premature newborns with the GA at birth of less than 32 weeks are as follows: an increase in the level of CRP in the mother's blood prior to the delivery, the growth of pathogenic microflora during pregnancy, esp. of the fecal Enterococcus, the C-section, esp. due to the deterioration of the fetus; and the postnatal predictors of NEC are as follows: lower concentration of SA in premature infants in the first 30 hours of life, the use of dexamethasone in the neonatal period.Copyright © 2023, Pediatria Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis (CA) is associated with a high risk for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) after preterm birth, but mechanisms that increase susceptibility for BPD and strategies to prevent BPD are uncertain. As a model of CA, antenatal intra-amniotic (IA) endotoxin (ETX) exposure alters placental structure, causes fetal growth restriction, increases perinatal mortality, and causes sustained cardiorespiratory abnormalities throughout infancy. Vitamin D (Vit D) has been shown to have both anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic properties. Antenatal IA treatment with Vit D (1,25-(OH)2D3) during IA ETX exposure improves survival and increases vascular and alveolar growth in infant rats. Whether IA ETX causes decreased placental vascular development and if the protective effects of prenatal Vit D treatment are due to direct effects on the fetus or to improved placental vascular development remain unknown., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if IA ETX impairs placental vascular development and Vit D metabolism, and whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment improves placental vascularity after IA ETX exposure during late gestation in pregnant rats., DESIGN/METHODS: Fetal rats were exposed to ETX (10 mg), ETX + 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1 ng/mL), 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1 ng/mL), or saline (control) via IA injection at E20 and delivered 2 days later. To assess placental vascular development, histologic sections from the placenta were stained for CD31 and vessel density per high power field (HPF) was determined and analyzed using Matlab software. To determine the effects of ETX on placental Vit D metabolism, Vit D receptor (VDR) and activity of the Vit D conversion enzyme, CYP27B1, were assayed from placental homogenates. Angiogenic mediators were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction by RNA extracted from placental tissue., RESULTS: IA ETX reduced placenta and newborn birth weights by 22 and 20%, respectively, when compared with controls (placental weight: 0.60 vs. 0.47 g; p < 0.0001; birth weight: 4.68 vs. 5.88 g; p < 0.0001). IA 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment increased birth weight by 12% in ETX-exposed pups (5.25 vs. 4.68 g; p < 0.001). IA ETX decreased placental vessel density by 24% in comparison with controls (1,114 vs. 848 vessels per HPF; p < 0.05). Treatment with IA 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased placenta vessel density twofold after ETX exposure (1,739 vs. 848); p < 0.0001), and increased vessel density compared with saline controls by 56% (1,739 vs. 1,114; p < 0.0001). IA ETX decreased both VDR and CYP27B1 expression by 83 and 35%, respectively (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: IA ETX decreases placental growth and vessel density and decreases placental VDR and CYP27B1 protein expression, and that antenatal 1,25-(OH)2D3 restores placental weight and vessel density, as well as birth weight. We speculate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment preserves placental function in experimental CA and that these effects may be mediated by increased vascular growth.

AB  - This pilot study aimed to explore the effectiveness and safety of dexibuprofen suppository in the treatment of PDA in preterm infants. Preterm infants with gestational age <34 weeks and color Doppler echocardiographic evidence of hemodynamically significant PDA (hs PDA) with systemic hypoperfusion was intended to be included into this study since January 2020. As of January 1, 2021, this trial had recruited 87 preterm infants who met the inclusion criteria. Neonates were admitted into hospital within 1 hour after birth and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group one included 44 preterm newborns administered with oral ibuprofen. Group two included 43 preterm newborns administered with dexibuprofen suppository. This preliminary study showed that rectal dexibuprofen and oral ibuprofen were both effective for the closure of PDA, and the closure rate of dexibuprofen suppository was comparable to that of oral ibuprofen after the 1st and 2nd courses of treatment. In addition, rectal dexibuprofen did not increase the incidence of adverse outcomes, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis, and necrotising enterocolitis. This pilot study showed dexibuprofen suppository is as effective and safe as oral ibuprofen; yet, better designed, muticenter controlled studies are still needed.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Vitamin A has a key role in lung development and its deficiency is associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This secondary cohort analysis of the ImNuT trial (Immature, Nutrition Therapy NCT03555019) aimed to (1) explore vitamin A status in preterm infants <29 weeks gestation and (2) assess the influence of inflammation and postnatal dexamethasone exposure on vitamin A concentrations in blood. We report detailed information on vitamin A biochemistry, vitamin A intake, markers of inflammation and dexamethasone exposure. After four weeks of age, infants exposed to dexamethasone (n = 39) showed higher vitamin A concentrations compared to unexposed infants (n = 41); median (IQR) retinol was 1.0 (0.74, 1.5) vs. 0.56 (0.41, 0.74) micromol/L, p < 0.001. Pretreatment retinol concentrations were lower in the dexamethasone group compared to non-exposed infants (p < 0.001); 88% vs. 60% of the infants were considered deficient in vitamin A (retinol < 0.7 micromol/L) at one week of age. Small size for gestational age, mechanical ventilation and elevated levels of interleukin-6 were factors negatively associated with first-week retinol concentrations. In conclusion, preterm infants <29 weeks gestation are at risk of vitamin A deficiency despite intakes that accommodate current recommendations. The presence of inflammation and dexamethasone exposure should be considered when interpreting vitamin A status.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is commonly used to stimulate closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in very premature infants and may lead to aberrant neonatal lung development and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Method(s): We investigated the effect of ibuprofen on angiogenesis in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the therapeutic potential of daily treatment with 50 mg/kg of ibuprofen injected subcutaneously in neonatal Wistar rat pups with severe hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD. Parameters investigated included growth, survival, lung histopathology and mRNA expression. Result(s): Ibuprofen inhibited angiogenesis in HUVECs, as shown by reduced tube formation, migration and cell proliferation via inhibition of the cell cycle S-phase and promotion of apoptosis. Treatment of newborn rat pups with ibuprofen reduced pulmonary vessel density in the developing lung, but also attenuated experimental BPD by reducing lung inflammation, alveolar enlargement, alveolar septum thickness and small arteriolar wall thickening. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, ibuprofen has dual effects on lung development: adverse effects on angiogenesis and beneficial effects on alveolarization and inflammation. Therefore, extrapolation of the beneficial effects of ibuprofen to premature infants with BPD should be done with extreme caution.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Although it is known that exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) alleviate hyperoxic lung injury of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in animal models, the role of microvesicles (MVs) derived from hUCMSCs in BPD is poorly defined. Furthermore, antenatal inflammation has been linked to high risk of BPD in preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to explore whether MVs derived from hUCMSCs can preserve lung structure and function in an antenatal lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced BPD rat model and to clarify the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that antenatal LPS induced alveolar simplification, altered lung function, and dysregulated pulmonary vasculature, which restored by hUCMSCs and MVs treatment. Furthermore, MVs were large vesicles with a diameter of 100-900 nanometers and mostly uptaken by alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2) and macrophages. Compared with the LPS-exposed group, MVs restored the AT2 cell number and SP-C expression in vivo and promoted the proliferation of AT2 cells in vitro. MVs also restored the level of IL-6 and IL-10 in lung homogenate. Additionally, PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways were associated with the protection of MVs. Taken together, this study suggests MVs derived from hUCMSCs improve lung architecture and function in an antenatal LPS-induced BPD rat model by promoting AT2 cell proliferation and attenuating lung inflammation; thus, MVs provide a promising therapeutic vehicle for BPD treatment.Copyright © 2022 Ou Zhou et al.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Asthma is the most common pediatric lung disease characterized by an inflammatory activation of T helper (Th) 2 cells. Evidence suggests a similar skewing of Th2 cells in premature neonates who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Being that many neonates with BPD develop asthma, the objective of this study was to test the significance of an asthma transcriptomic signature in neonates with BPD. Methods Used: We tested the applicability of a previously derived asthma transcriptomic signature (n = 10 genes) in a publicly available whole microarray data set of 111 very low birthweight neonates. The transcriptomic signatures were evaluated over three timepoints (days 5, 14, and 28) using generalized estimating equations. Next, we validated our findings in blood and lung tissue samples of extremely preterm baboons. Summary of Results: The median gestational age and birthweight of the premature cohort was 27.8 weeks (SD:2.5) and 1029 g (SD:290), respectively. Sixty-eight (61%) neonates developed BPD (defined per the NICHD criteria). The asthma transcriptomic signature predicted severe BPD on day of life 5 with an area under the curve of 88%. The figure below demonstrates the discriminatory ability of the transcriptomic signature across BPD severity. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) 5 and IL-6, as well as lung levels of Th2-driven inflammatory cytokines, were elevated in our ventilator-induced BPD model of baboons. [Figure presented] Conclusion(s): Our study provides novel evidence suggesting a shared genetic component in the pathophysiologic processes involving BPD and asthma.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Purpose of Study: After preterm birth, young adults have reduced cardiac biventricular volume, lower systolic and diastolic function, contributing to a 17-fold increased risk of heart failure hypertension, and reduced exercise tolerance. Postnatal cardiac development is a known independent risk factor for developing early cardiovascular disease. Hyperoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are fundamental contributors of diseases of prematurity, yet there is limited knowledge on the effects of hyperoxia and ROS in cardiac disease of prematurity. We hypothesize that neonatal hyperoxia alters cardiac mitochondrial respiratory chain and induces an increase production of ROS. Methods Used: Sprague-Dawley pups were exposed to room air (controls) or 80% O2 at postnatal days 1 to 14 in an established animal model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We studied left ventricular mitochondrial changes at 14 days of life. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production was assessed in fresh left ventricular fibers via O2K-FluoRespirometer (Ouroboros). Mitochondrial dynamics and stability were assessed by western blot from snap frozen left ventricular samples. Summary of Results: Hearts exposed to hyperoxia no difference in heart/body weight compared to controls (Figure A). Hyperoxia exposed pups showed an increase rate of oxygen consumption compared to control P14 pups that was mainly driven by complex IV (Figure 1B). In addition, hearts exposed to hyperoxia generated a significantly increase level of H2O2 than control hearts (Figure 1C). Mitochondria integrity, fusion and fission measured by Mitofussin-1, mitofussin-2, OPA1 were not altered between the 2 groups (Figure 1D). [Figure presented] Conclusion(s): Our preliminary findings show that, when exposed to hyperoxia, rats at P14 exhibit an increase left ventricular mitochondrial oxygen consumption and elevated production of ROS with no change in mitochondrial dynamics. When completed, this studies will reveal the effects of hyperoxia on the neonatal heart allowing for possible future interventions to prevent heart disease of premature children.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in preterm neonates. The current definitions of BPD do not take into consideration the molecular changes occurring in the lung. The purpose of this study was to create subclasses of BPD using an unbiased approach derived from gene expression data to potentially uncover patterns underpinning this complex disease. Methods Used: Using publicly available data, we analyzed whole blood microarray gene expression from 97 neonates at three times points (day 5, 14 and 28). Of neonates with a gestational age <32 weeks and birth weight =1500 g, 67 developed BPD (69.1%) when defined as oxygen exposure for least 28 days. Regression modeling was performed to identify genes that were differentially expressed at each time point and then across all timepoints. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was utilized to separate significant genes and enriched gene ontology pathways associating with BPD. Summary of Results: From an initial set of 33 252 genes per patient, 10 875 genes were significantly expressed at any time point (false discovery rate <0.05). One hundred and nine genes were significant across all 3 time points. Differentially expressed genes localized to the cell membrane (fold enrichment [FE] 28.3) and endoplasmic reticulum (FE 24.8), and highlighted the ribosomal pathway (cytosolic ribosome and ribosome subunit with adjusted p-values of 4.6 x 10-21 and 2.2 x 10-18, respectively). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that in preterm neonates, genomic expression within the first month of life points towards ribosome homeostasis as an overarching theme in the development of BPD. Bioinformatic analyses are novel approaches that may help uncover patterns underlying complex neonatal diseases.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extreme prematurity. Existing definitions of BPD rely heavily upon clinical and phenotypic characteristics. A bioinformatic approach towards identifying BPD subclasses may offer better insight into molecular pathways that contribute to the disease process. The aim of this study was to use whole genome expression data to stratify BPD into molecular subclasses (e.g. endotypes) and pathways that associate with phenotypic outcomes. Methods Used: A secondary analysis of whole microarray data from premature neonates (?1500 g) at day of life five was performed. An unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering was conducted to identify optimal number of endotypes. A model based on least-squares minimization with empirical Bayes statistics was used to discover genes that were differentially expressed. Pathways of these genes were determined using a gene ontologic software program. Next, a machine learning (ML) model was utilized to highlight the optimal set of genes that could discriminate between the endotypes. Summary of Results: Among 62 neonates with BPD (per the NICHD definition), 61% (n = 38) were male, 54% (n = 34) had mild BPD, and 46% (n = 28) had moderate/ severe BPD. Three distinct endotypes (A, B, C) were identified. Compared to endotypes A and C, endotype B had a lower median birth weight (690 g vs 950 g(A) and 835 g(C)) and had a median gestational age of 28 weeks [IQR 26-29weeks]. Endotypes B and C had higher rates of moderate/severe BPD compared to endotype A (62% vs 53%(B) and 7.7%(C)). From 4000 genes (p-adjusted value <1%), 12 ontologic processes were generated (Figure). A random forest ML algorithm yielded 121 genes that best classified the endotypes. [Figure presented] Figure: 12 distinct ontologic processes generated from 4000 genes Conclusion(s): Unsupervised clustering of genome-wide expression data can potentially subclassify BPD into molecular pathways that associate with clinical data and outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants that is associated with life-long morbidities and lacks curative therapies. Inflammatory insults are known contributors to BPD pathogenesis. T Helper 17 Cells (TH17) and their signature cytokine IL-17a are known to play a role in various neonatal inflammatory disorders. There are limited studies examining IL-17a's role in BPD pathogenesis. The objective of this study is to assess the role of IL- 17a in murine experimental BPD using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model through protein analysis, flow cytometry, neutralizing IL-17a antibody, and lung histology review. We will test the hypothesis that blocking IL- 17a signaling mitigates LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury in neonatal mice. Methods Used: Wild-type (WT) mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with PBS or LPS on post-natal days (P) 3, 4, and 5 (N = 11). On P6, the IL-17a expression was determined in whole lung cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in T cells by flow cytometry after stimulating lung cells with PMA and ionomycin in vitro. To determine the role of IL-17a in LPS-induced lung injury, we injected WT-mice i.p. with isotype antibody (Ab) or IL-17a neutralizing Ab on P2 and P4, while they were treated with PBS or LPS from P3 to P5, resulting in four study groups [PBS + Isotype Ab (n = 3), PBS + IL-17a Ab (n = 3), LPS + Isotype Ab (n = 3), LPS + IL-17a Ab (N = 3)]. We quantified inflammatory markers by western blotting on P6 and alveolarization by estimating the mean linear intercept (MLI) on P14. Summary of Results: Univariate analysis showed that LPS-injected mice had higher IL-17a protein and IL-17a+ T-cells than PBS-injected mice. ANOVA analysis showed that LPS treatment increased STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 levels to a greater extent in mice treated with isotype Ab compared to IL-17a antibody. ANOVA analysis of MLIs also revealed that LPS significantly decreased alveolarization in mice treated with isotype Ab compared to IL-17a antibody. Conclusion(s): IL-17a protein levels and IL-17a+ T-cells are increased in an LPS-induced murine experimental BPD model. Further, blocking IL-17a signaling decreases proinflammatory markers and improves alveolarization in LPS-treated neonatal mice. These observations suggest that IL-17a may play a significant role in BPD pathogenesis and could potentially be a target for BPD treatment.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - Purpose of Study: The incidence of hyperglycemia has been reported in up to 80% of extremely low birthweight (ELBW) preterm neonates. ELBW infants carry a high burden of morbidity and mortality from the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Adult studies demonstrate deleterious effects of hyperglycemia in lung and insulin sensitive tissues. In this translational study, we hypothesized that hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk for the development of BPD. Additionally, we hypothesized that early hyperglycemia is associated with impaired pulmonary and pancreatic function in extremely preterm baboons, a well-established model of preterm human physiology. Methods Used: Retrospective chart review of ELBW neonates was performed in a level IV NICU. Demographic characteristics, lab values, and clinical parameters were obtained. The hyperglycemic (HG) cohort was defined as infants with glucose values >125 mg/dL on a single check within the first 72 hours of life. Preterm baboons (n = 12) were delivered at 125 +/- 2 days and received routine NICU care for 2 weeks. BPD was defined as supplemental oxygen or positive pressure ventilation at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Animals were randomized to HG (serum glucose 150-250 mg/dL) or euglycemia (NG; Serum glucose 50-100 mg/dL) for the first five days of life. Euglycemiawas maintained thereafter in both groups. Hyperglycemic clamp procedureswere performedon days 6 and 12 to assess pancreatic function. After necropsy, mRNA was isolated from flash frozen lung, spleen, liver, and muscle tissue and shipped for RNA sequencing. All statistics were performed using R statistical software. Summary of Results: 137 ELBW infants were included in the clinical cohort with a median BW of 790 grams, median GA of 25.7 weeks, and a median glucose of 75.9 mg/dL. 55.5% of infants were categorized into the HG group. Morbidity rates were similar among groups except for lower rates of patent ductus arteriosus requiring medications (48% vs. 32%, p = 0.04) and higher rates of grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage (8.3% vs. 22%, p = 0.03) in the HG cohort. BPD rates were higher in the HG group (47% vs. 65%, p = 0.045). In the preterm baboon study, BW, vital signs, fluid and electrolyte intake were similar with the exception of glucose intake. HG baboons had significantly higher serum glucose during the first 5 days of life as planned (Fig 1A). The HG group had an increase in both oxygenation index (3.4 vs. 6.3, p < 0.001) and ventilation index (22.5 vs. 37.8, p < 0.001) during the active period of hyperglycemia (Fig 1B, 1C). Insulin production was similar at DOL 6; however, at day 12, the HG group had 75% decreased insulin consistent with pancreatic failure (p < 0.05). RNA sequencing data is ongoing. [Figure presented] Figure 1 Conclusion(s): ELBW infants with hyperglycemia >125 mg/dL may have an increased risk for BPD. Transient hyperglycemia is associated with decreased oxygenation, ventilation, and insulin production in preterm baboons. Glucose changes at critical periods of development may have long-term consequences.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

AB  - BackgroundDeficiency of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is associated with hypoplastic lung diseases, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Provision of VEGF has been demonstrated to be beneficial in hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and hence could induce lung growth and improve the outcome in hypoplastic lung diseases. We aimed to determine the effects of exogenous VEGF in a rodent model of compensatory lung growth after left pneumonectomy. Methods Eight-to-ten-week-old C57Bl6 male mice underwent left pneumonectomy, followed by daily intra-peritoneal injections of saline or VEGF (0.5 mg/kg). Lung volume measurement, pulmonary function tests, and morphometric analyses were performed on post-operative day (POD) 4 and 10. The pulmonary expression of angiogenic factors was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Results Lung volume on POD 4 was higher in the VEGF-treated mice (P=0.03). On morphometric analyses, VEGF increased the parenchymal volume (P=0.001), alveolar volume (P=0.0003), and alveolar number (P<0.0001) on POD 4. The VEGF group displayed higher levels of phosphorylated-VEGFR2/VEGFR2 (P=0.03) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) messenger RNA (P=0.01). Conclusion VEGF accelerated the compensatory lung growth in mice, by increasing the alveolar units. These changes may be mediated by VEGFR2 and EGF-dependent mechanisms.

AB  - Objective: Early transition to full enteral nutrition prevents protein catabolism and has a positive impact on the growth and development of infants. The aim of this study was to determine the factors affecting the time to full enteral feeding in very low birth weight infants. Material(s) and Method(s): Demographic data of infants with birth weight <=1500 g and gestational age <=32 weeks, time to full enteral feeding, weights and head circumference at discharge, daily weight gain, duration of hospital stay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), late neonatal sepsis (LNS) and mortality rates were recorded. Data were compared by grouping according to the time of transition to full enteral nutrition as early in the first 10 days and delayed in more than 10 days. Result(s): Totally 474 infants were included in the study. Of those 91 infants achieved full enteral feeding in the first 10 days and 383 of them after 10 days. Median gestational age were 29 and 28 weeks and birth weights were 1240 g and 1030 g respectively. While the duration of hospital stay was shorter in the early enteral feeding group (p <0.01), late neonatal sepsis and BPD rates were significantly higher in late arriving enteral feeding (p <0.01). NEC, Grade 3-4 IVH and mortality rates were similar between the groups. Low birth weight, presence of RDS and maternal preeclampsia were found to be risk factors for delayed transition to full enteral feeding. Conclusion(s): Early achievement of full enteral feeding in very low birth weight preterm infants might have beneficial effects on morbidities. This might contribute to the growth of infants by decreasing duration of hospitalization. Prevention of preterm births, prevention of RDS and preeclampsia facilitate the transition to full enteral nutrition.Copyright © 2021 Ankara Pediatric Hematology Oncology Training and Research Hospital.

AB  - With improved neonatal care and more and more neonatal intensive care units (NICU) developing in Pakistan, is leading to more premature infants surviving. We know that these infants are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental and many health issues post discharge from NICU often presenting repeatedly to general paediatricians or general practitioners or emergency rooms of hospitals. This paper reviews the conditions with which ex-preterm infants present to health care facilities or clinicians in practice, and suggests basic guideline for early detection and intervention for conditions like; feeding difficulties, growth failure, repeated respiratory infections, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cerebral palsy, neurocognitive and neurosensory developmental issues (Hearing, Vision) coupled with lack of support to parents and family.Copyright © 2022, Pakistan Pediatric Journal.

AB  - Background. The placenta is the major regulatory element of the in-utero environment, and alterations in placental cellular functions in infection, inflammation, and hypoxemia lead to adverse preterm birth outcomes. The importance of regulation of autophagy and inflammasome activities has been shown in the pathogenesis of morbidities in immature animal models. This study aimed to determine the relationship between placental autophagy and inflammasome activities with morbidity in extremely preterm infants. Methods. Premature infants born between 24th to 29th gestational weeks were evaluated prospectively. Placental LC3B and NLRP3 immunostainings were performed to assess autophagy and inflammasome activities. Preterm morbidities including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), patent ductus ateriosus: (PDA), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and mortality were evaluated. Results. Fifty-nine infants with a mean gestational age of 26.9 +/- 1.5 weeks were included. Anti-LC3B staining scores were moderate or intense positive in 75% of the placentas. Anti-LC3B activity was not associated with the existance of evaluated neonatal morbidities or mortality. Autophagy and inflammasome coexistence were demonstrated in 35 placentas (59.3%). Anti-NLRP3 staining score was moderate or intensely positive in 75% of the placentas. Infants with BPD had a lower rate of positive anti-NLRP3 staining than infants without BPD (42.9 vs 57.1%, p=0.048). Infants who had hemodynamic significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and surgical-NEC showed significantly intense anti-NLRP3 staining compared to infants who did not (18.8% vs 0%, p= 0.027 and 33% vs 7.5%, p=0.048 respectively). Conclusions. The results showed that autophagy and inflammatory activities were present in varying amounts in the placenta of preterm infants. Association of decreased or increased rates of inflammasome activities with certain diseases such as BPD, hsPDA and surgical-NEC indicates the role of the intrauterin inflammatory process and the importance of critical balance in inflammation. Because of the complex pathophysiology of preterm morbidities, placental autophagy and inflammasome activities seem worthy of further investigation.Copyright © 2022, Turkish National Pediatric Society.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication after preterm birth that is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has been identified as a biomarker for neuroaxonal damage in preterm infants, but its relation with BPD has not yet been established. We hypothesized that BPD is associated with increased NfL levels at an early stage, indicative of early neuroaxonal damage. Method(s): In this prospective observational study we included preterm infants born <30 weeks of gestation, admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Amsterdam UMC between October 2019 and March 2021. Serum NfL levels were determined using Simoa assay in cord blood and blood obtained at postnatal days 3, 7 and 14. Linear regression analysis was used to compare NfL levels between infants with moderate/severe BPD (BPD group) and infants with no/mild BPD (no BPD group), while linear mixed model analysis was performed to assess the effect of time on NfL levels between the two groups. Next, analyses were adjusted for gestational age (GA) and small for gestational age (SGA). Result(s): Sixty-seven infants with a GA of 27+/-1.3 weeks were included for analysis, of whom 19 infants (28%) developed moderate/ severe BPD. Although the NfL levels were significantly higher at every time point in the BPD group, statistical significance was lost after adjusting for GA and SGA (Table 1). No differences were found between the groups in NfL change over time. Conclusion(s): We showed that the positive association between BPD and NfL among preterm infants in their first weeks of life could be explained by GA and SGA rather than by the development of BPD.

AB  - Introduction: DiGeorge syndrome is one of the most common microdeletion syndromes, also known as 22q11 deletion syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). It is seen in 1 in 2000 to 4000 live births in Malaysia. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is due to microdeletion of about 1.5 - 3Mbp of the DiGeorge Critical Region (DGCR) which is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at region 22q11.2. Current standard method of investigations involve conventional cytogenetic followed by FISH technique. Case report: A 2-year-old girl born premature at 35 weeks was noted to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, multiple cardiac anomalies, and developmental delay. Her blood sample was sent for conventional cytogenetics and FISH for deletion 22q11.2. Both tests were normal. Subsequently, array CGH test was sent to rule out microdeletion syndrome revealed a pathogenic variant of interstitial deletion involving 8 probes at 22q11.2 with the size of 120.37Kb described according to ISCN as arr[hg19] 22q11.21(18890162-19010531)x1. This deletion interval contains two OMIM Morbid genes (DGCR6 and PRODH) located within the known disease critical region for DiGeorge Syndrome according to OMIM #601279. Discussion(s): Common FISH probes available in the market for DiGeorge syndrome can detect deletion at either TBX1, TUPLE or N25 loci, which represent the DGCR. However, DGCR6 and PRODH genes, being centromeric to the previously mentioned genes are not covered and this explains the negative result by FISH method. We suggest cases that are strongly suggestive of DiGeorge syndrome be followed up by array CGH test to rule out deletion of DGCR at other loci.

AB  - An extremely dystrophic, premature female infant, born at 25 3/7 weeks of gestational age (birth weight: 430 g) with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), was admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) requiring cardiorespiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and continuous intravenous sildenafil infusions. The diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was made. A hemodynamically relevant, persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was surgically ligated after failed pharmacologic PDA closure using indomethacin and ibuprofen. The patient was discharged with an estimated 2/3 systemic pulmonary artery pressure. One month after hospital discharge, on low-flow oxygen supplementation (0.5 L/min FiO2 100%), at the corrected age of 16 weeks, she was readmitted to our emergency department with signs of respiratory distress and circulatory decompensation. Echocardiography demonstrated suprasystemic PH. Severe PH persisted despite initiated invasive mechanical ventilation, triple vasodilating therapy [iNO, macitentan, and continuous intravenous (IV) sildenafil], as well as levosimendan, milrinone, and norepinephrine for recompensation from cardiac shock. Thus, we started off-label oral selexipag therapy (oral IP receptor agonist) in the smallest patient reported so far (4 kg body weight). Subsequently, RV systolic pressure decreased to half-systemic, allowing successful weaning of iNO, norepinephrine, and milrinone, and extubation of the patient over 4 days. The infant was discharged 4 weeks after pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission in stable cardiorespiratory condition, with an oral, specific, triple antihypertensive PAH-targeted therapy using selexipag, macitentan, and sildenafil as well as oxygen therapy at low-flow (0.5 l/min) and spironolactone. The first cardiac catheterization at the age of 9 months under aforementioned triple PAH-targeted therapy revealed mild PH with 35% systemic PA pressure (mPAP/mSAP = 0.35) and isolated pulmonary vein stenosis. A transthoracic biopsy at the age of 12 months confirmed the diagnosis of BPD and further showed pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis and severe pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, without involvement of the pulmonary venules (chILD A2, A3, and B4 according to the Deutsch-Classification). The patient is currently in stable cardiorespiratory condition undergoing triple PH-targeted therapy including selexipag. This report highlights the potential benefits of the oral prostacyclin mimetic selexipag as an early add-on PH-targeted drug in chronic PH of infancy (cPHi).Copyright © 2022 Hasan, Hysko, Jack, Dingemann, Wetzke and Hansmann.

AB  - Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are potent PPARgamma agonists that have been shown to attenuate alveolar simplification after prolonged hyperoxia in term rodent models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, the pulmonary outcomes of postnatal TZDs have not been investigated in preterm animal models. Here, we first investigated the PPARgamma selectivity, epithelial permeability, and lung tissue binding of three types of TZDs in vitro (rosiglitazone (RGZ), pioglitazone, and DRF-2546), followed by an in vivo study in preterm rabbits exposed to hyperoxia (95% oxygen) to investigate the pharmacokinetics and the pulmonary outcomes of daily RGZ administration. In addition, blood lipids and a comparative lung proteomics analysis were also performed on Day 7. All TZDs showed high epithelial permeability through Caco-2 monolayers and high plasma and lung tissue binding; however, RGZ showed the highest affinity for PPARgamma. The pharmacokinetic profiling of RGZ (1 mg/kg) revealed an equivalent biodistribution after either intratracheal or intraperitoneal administration, with detectable levels in lungs and plasma after 24 h. However, daily RGZ doses of 1 mg/kg did not improve lung function in preterm rabbits exposed to hyperoxia, and daily 10 mg/kg doses were even associated with a significant lung function worsening, which could be partially explained by the upregulation of lung inflammation and lipid metabolism pathways revealed by the proteomic analysis. Notably, daily postnatal RGZ produced an aberrant modulation of serum lipids, particularly in rabbit pups treated with the 10 mg/kg dose. In conclusion, daily postnatal RGZ did not improve lung function and caused dyslipidemia in preterm rabbits exposed to hyperoxia.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a common pathology of premature newborns caused by oxidative stress and mechanical ventilation, resulting in hypoalveolization and impaired angiogenesis. It can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension (HTP-DBP) with excess mortality. Celastrol has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and we addressed its potential therapeutic interest in HTP-DBP. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to evaluate celastrol's effects as a preventive treatment of HTP-DBP on murine and human models. Method(s): Different concentrations of celastrol (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/d) were used in a murine model of hyperoxic HTP-DBP (14 days with 90% O2) and we evaluated hemodynamic parameters with echocardiography and lung remodeling with histological methods. Pulmonary arterial (PA) reactivity was addressed with myograph. Cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2 + i) response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) was evaluated in human fetal PA smooth muscle cells (fPASMC) with spectrophotometry in normoxic (21% O2) and hyperoxic conditions (48 h with 60% O2). Inflammation was addressed with IL6 ELISA assay in fPASMC. Result(s): Celastrol reduces mortality at doses of 1 and 0.5 mg/kg/d compared to the hyperoxic control group. At 1 mg/kg/d, it normalizes PA acceleration time (PAAT) (P < 0.001) and reduces vascular hyperreactivity to phenylephrine and ET-1 (P < 0.001 and < 0.05, respectively) with no effect on the alteration of the response to acetylcholine induced by hyperoxia. At doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/d, it decreases right heart hypertrophy and vascular remodeling (wall thickness) but has no effect on alveolization and vascular density (vWF staining). Finally, although celastrol (0.1 and 0.3 muM) decreases the increased Ca2 + i response to ET-1 in hyperoxia in fPASMC, expression of ET-1 receptors (Western blotting and qPCR for ET-A and ET-B) was unchanged. An increased concentration of IL6 was also observed in fPASMC in hyperoxia and was decreased by celastrol 0.3 muM. Conclusion(s): Celastrol has a preventive dose-dependent effect on some hallmarks of HTP induced by hyperoxia and could thus be considered as an interesting new potential therapeutic option for HTP-DBP.Copyright © 2022

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main pathological features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia are stagnation of lung development and minor tissue damage. Fetal lung development needs to go through five stages, and a preterm infant cannot survive after birth until the cystic stage. Therefore, research on the pathogenesis of premature birth-and hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia has focused on cystic and alveolar phases. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the regulatory role of differentially expressed microRNAs in hyperoxia-associated bronchopulmonary dysplasia during two developmental stages - cystic and alveolar stages. METHOD(S): Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly into four groups: in 0 day group (n=10), rat lung tissue was taken immediately after birth; 4-, 7-, 14-day groups were further divided into two subgroups - hyperoxia group (exposed to persistent hyperoxia with an oxygen concentration of 85%-90%, n=10) and air group (exposed to the air with FiO2: 21%, n=10). Lung samples tissue were then taken at postnatal days 4, 7, 14. MicroRNAs in lung tissue were acquired using miRNA-Seq technology to build a library, and sequenced on the Illumina platform. Differently expressed microRNAs between different groups were screened by Deseq2 (Version 1.10.1) and Venn map. Gene ontology enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis were performed to predict target proteins of differentially expressed microRNAs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): There were 633 microRNAs in the 0-day group, 609, 614, and 584 microRNAs in the hyperoxia group at postnatal days 4, 7, 14, respectively, and 629, 608, and 581 in the corresponding air groups. The hyperoxia group obtained 130, 3, and 114 differentially expressed microRNAs during postnatal days 0-4 (cystic stage), 4-7, and 4-14 (alveolar stage), respectively. And the corresponding air group received 106, 0, 111 differentially expressed microRNAs respectively. There were 91, 0, and 79 differentially expressed microRNAs in the two groups at different stages. During the cystic and alveolar phases, miR-34a-5p and miR-21-5p were significantly expressed in the lung tissue of neonatal rats in the hyperoxia group. miR-34a-5p had 198 target proteins, which concentrated around the PDGFRB/PDGFRA/NGFR; miR-21-5p had 302 target proteins that mainly revolved around the MAPK1/STAT3. To conclude, miR-34a-5p and miR-21-5p are highly expressed in the cystic and alveolar stages under hyperoxia exposure, targeting the proteins about PDGFRB/ PDGFRA/NGFR and MAPK1/STAT3 respectively, which mediate the process of lung development and participate in the occurrence and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to evaluate outcomes, prognosis, and safety associated with the timing of surgical ligation for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in extremely premature infants (EPI). Method(s): We reviewed the clinical data of 44 EPI (gestational age at birth 26.8 +/- 0.67 weeks; birth weight 997 +/- 152 g) who received surgical ligation for hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Seventh Medical Center of PLA General Hospital in China between January 2021 and December 2014. We compared the general characteristics, underlying diseases, postoperative surgical complications, and prognoses in two groups of patients who received early ligation (<= 14 days after birth) and late ligation (> 14 days after birth). Result(s): The gender, gestational age at birth, birth weight, Apgar score, postoperative surgical complications, rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity, necrotic enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, total hospitalization, and medical costs of both groups were compared. According to the results, the late ligation group had a higher rate of severe BPD (66.3% cf. 35%) and required significantly longer time to reach total enteral feeding and weaning of respiratory support compared with the early ligation group. Conclusion(s): In EPI with hsPDA, for whom medical treatment failed or is contraindicated, early surgical closure of the ductus arteriosus can promote earlier total enteral feeding, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, and reduce the rates of severe BPD.Copyright © 2021, Author(s).

AB  - Alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cells are uniquely specialized to produce surfactant in the lung and act as progenitor cells in the process of repair after lung injury. AT2 cell injury has been implicated in several lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The inability to maintain primary AT2 cells in culture has been a significant barrier in the investigation of pulmonary biology. We have addressed this knowledge gap by developing a three-dimensional (3D) organotypic coculture using primary human fetal AT2 cells and pulmonary fibroblasts. Grown on top of matrix-embedded fibroblasts, the primary human AT2 cells establish a monolayer and have direct contact with the underlying pulmonary fibroblasts. Unlike conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture, the structural and functional phenotype of the AT2 cells in our 3D organotypic culture was preserved over 7 days of culture, as evidenced by the presence of lamellar bodies and by production of surfactant proteins B and C. Importantly, the AT2 cells in 3D cocultures maintained the ability to replicate, with approximately 60% of AT2 cells staining positive for the proliferation marker Ki67, whereas no such proliferation is evident in 2D cultures of the same primary AT2 cells. This organotypic culture system enables interrogation of AT2 epithelial biology by providing a reductionist in vitro model in which to investigate the response of AT2 epithelial cells and AT2 cell-fibroblast interactions during lung injury and repair.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a life-threatening condition in preterm infants with few effective therapies. Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising therapeutic strategy for BPD. The ideal MSC source for BPD prevention is however unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the regenerative effects of MSC obtained from bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord tissue (UCT) in an experimental BPD model. In vitro, UCT-MSC demonstrated greater proliferation and expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines as compared to BM-MSC. Lung epithelial cells incubated with UCT-MSC conditioned media (CM) had better-wound healing following scratch injury. UCT-MSC CM and BM-MSC CM had similar pro-angiogenic effects on hyperoxia-exposed pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. In vivo, newborn rats exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 1 to 21 were given intra-tracheal (IT) BM or UCT-MSC (1 x 106 cells/50 muL), or placebo (PL) on P3. Hyperoxia PL-treated rats had marked alveolar simplification, reduced lung vascular density, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and lung inflammation. In contrast, administration of both BM-MSC and UCT-MSC significantly improved alveolar structure, lung angiogenesis, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and lung inflammation. UCT-MSC hyperoxia-exposed rats however had greater improvement in some morphometric measures of alveolarization and less lung macrophage infiltration as compared to the BM-MSC-treated group. Together, these findings suggest that BM-MSC and UCT-MSC have significant lung regenerative effects in experimental BPD but UCT-MSC suppresses lung macrophage infiltration and promotes lung epithelial cell healing to a greater degree.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) remains a serious problem among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and is a marker of severe nutritional deficit during the first weeks of life. It can lead to a higher risk of growth impairment during childhood and long-term medical problems. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors of EUGR in preterm infants below 1500 grams. METHOD(S): Descriptive retrospective study of all preterm infants with birth weight below 1500 grams who were born at and discharged from our center, from January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2016. Those with major congenital malformations, congenital TORCH infections, death before 36 weeks of postmenstrual age and those transferred during hospitalization were excluded. RESULT(S): A total of 101 VLBW newborns were studied, 35 (34.7%) had EUGR. Fifty-four (52.9%) newborns were male. The median gestational age was 29 weeks (25-35) and the median birth weight was 1205 grams (580-1500). Fetal growth restriction, moderate-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, invasive mechanical ventilation, patent ductus arteriosus and its surgical treatment, retinopathy of prematurity, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, anemia requiring red blood cells transfusions, as well as duration of parenteral nutrition, day of start of enteral nutrition (EN), day of achievement of full EN and a longer duration of hospitalization were identified as independent risk factors for EUGR. CONCLUSION(S): EUGR is a serious concern in neonatal intensive care. Some of its potential long-term consequences include a higher risk of growth impairment during childhood, poorer neurodevelopment and motor outcomes, as well as cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes later in life. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully assess the nutritional status of VLBW infants, as well as to increase the knowledge of the risk factors for EUGR, which will be crucial for its prevention.Copyright © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - Background: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a common disease that seriously endangers the life and safety of newborns, especially premature infants. Exogenous pulmonary surfactant (PS) is the specific agent for the treatment of neonatal RDS. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been successfully used in the diagnosis of RDS, but its value in guiding the application of PS is still unclear. This paper explored whether the application of PS under LUS monitoring has some advantages, including (1) decreasing the misdiagnosis rate of RDS and decreasing probability of using PS, and (2) reducing the dose of PS without reducing the therapeutic effect. Method(s): This study included two parts. Part 1: To decide whether the LUS is good to differentiate RDS from other lung diseases in the premature infants. All patients who were diagnosed with RDS and required PS treatment based on conventional criteria were routinely examined by LUS. Then, according to LUS findings, we decided whether they needed to receive PS treatment. Part 2: To see the dose reduction of surfactant is applicable. In RDS patients diagnosed based on LUS presentation and treated with Curosurf (Chiesi Pharmaceutical, Parma, Italy), the dose of Curosurf was compared with that recommended by the European RDS management guidelines. Result(s): (1) Since March 2017, 385 newborn infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit met the traditional diagnostic criteria of RDS. Of these, only 269 cases were diagnosed with RDS and needed PS treatment according to LUS manifestations. The other 116 infants who did not meet the criteria for ultrasound diagnosis of RDS did not receive PS supplementation but obtained good outcomes, that is LUS findings decreased a misdiagnosis rate of RDS by 30.1% and subsequently resulted in a 30.1% reduction in PS use. (2) Among the 269 RDS patients diagnosed based on LUS findings, 148 were treated with Curosurf (another 121 RDS infants who received domestic PS treatment were not included in the study group), and the average dose was 105.4 +/- 24.3 mg/kg per time, which is significantly lower than the dose of 200 mg/kg per time recommended by the European RDS guidelines. (3) The mortality rate of RDS patients was 0%, and no patients had ventilator-associated pneumonia or bronchopulmonary dysplasia in this study. Conclusion(s): LUS can decrease the misdiagnosis rate of RDS, thereby decreasing the probability of using PS and decreasing the dose of PS, and can help RDS infants to achieve better outcomes.Copyright 2022 Liu, Fu and Qin.

AB  - Objective: To explore the diagnostic value of IGF-1 and IL-18 in premature infants with BPD. Method(s): Through a prospective observational study, the serum samples of infants in the BPD group and the non-BPD group were collected at different targeted time points, and the serum IGF-1 and IL-18 concentrations were dynamically monitored by ELISA. The Student t-test and one-way analysis of variance were adopted to analyze data, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to test the diagnostic value. Result(s): A total of 90 VLBW premature infants admitted to NICU between January 2020 and 2021 were finally included. Compared with the non-BPD group, infants diagnosed with BPD had a significantly lower serum concentration of IGF-1 (P < 0.05) but a higher level of IL-18 (P < 0.05) on days 1, 7, 14, and 28 after birth. With the ROC curve analysis, the serum concentration IGF-1 on day 14 and IL-18 on day 28 reported high sensitivity and specificity to predict the risk of BPD (IGF-1: sensitivity: 89.29%, specificity: 77.78%, AUC: 0.8710; IL-18: sensitivity: 53.57%, specificity: 83.33%, AUC: 0.7887). And more substantial predictive power was found in combined analysis of IGF-1 and serum IL-18 on day 14: the sensitivity was 91.07% and the specificity was 83.33%, with the AUC of 0.9142. Conclusion(s): IGF-1 and IL-18 might be closely involved in the occurrence and development of BPD. The serum concentration of IGF-1 combined with IL-18 could be potentially sensitive markers for the early diagnosis and severity of BPD.Copyright 2022 Huang, Guo, Cheng, Wang, Chen and Shi.

AB  - Patient: Male, 1-year-old Final Diagnosis: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II Symptoms: Respiatory distress Medication: - Clinical Procedure: Bronchoalveolar lavage * CT scan * whole exome sequencing Specialty: Pediatrics and Neonatology Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusion(s): Unusual clinical course Hunter syndrome is a multisystem metabolic inherited disease belonging to the large group of mucopolysac-charidoses (MPSs). Hunter syndrome is also known as MPS type II. Its association with respiratory symptoms has been well documented in the literature; however, it is uncommon that these patients initially present with diffuse lung disease and respiratory failure. Diffuse lung disease has a wide range of differential diagnoses that can overlap in some clinical and radiological aspects, making physicians struggle to quickly reach a final diagnosis. We report a case of a full-term male infant who presented postnatally with progressive respiratory distress, hy-poxemia, and radiologically-demonstrated ground-glass opacity and pneumothorax requiring mechanical ven-tilation and an extensive workup including CT scan of the chest, a flexible and rigid bronchoscopic examina-tion of the airway with bronchoalveolar lavage, and whole-exome sequencing, which eventually resulted in a diagnosis of Hunter syndrome. After enzyme therapy was initiated, the patient showed marked improvement in clinical status and biological and imaging data and was weaned off oxygen a few months later. The diagnostic approach for patients with diffuse lung disease is challenging and requires centers with exper-tise to reach a final diagnosis, especially in the presence of an unusual clinical presentation. The choice of the diagnostic approach can be influenced by factors such as the patient's critical condition, clinical presentation, imaging data, genetic analysis, and family decision.Copyright © Am J Case Rep,.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of extreme prematurity. Despite more than 50 years of research, current treatments are inef-fective, and clinicians are largely unable to accurately predict which neonates the condi-tion will develop in. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the characteristic arrest in lung development are warranted. Integrating high-fidelity technology from precision medicine approaches may fill this gap and provide the tools necessary to identify biomarkers and targetable pathways. In this review, we describe insights garnered from current studies using omics for BPD prediction and stratification. We conclude by describing novel programs that will integrate multi-omics in efforts to better understand and treat the pathogenesis of BPD.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular impairment contributes to increased mortality in preterm infants with chronic lung disease. Macitentan, an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, has the potential to attenuate pulmonary and cardiovascular remodelling. Method(s): In a prospective randomized placebo-controlled intervention trial, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 0.21 or 1.0 fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) for 19 postnatal days. Rats were treated via gavage with placebo or macitentan from days of life 5 to 19. Alveoli, pulmonary vessels, alpha-smooth muscle actin content in pulmonary arterioles, size of cardiomyocytes, right to left ventricular wall diameter ratio, and endothelin-1 plasma concentrations were assessed. Result(s): FiO2 1.0 induced typical features of chronic lung disease with significant alveolar enlargement (p = 0.012), alveolar (p = 0.048) and pulmonary vessel rarefaction (p = 0.024), higher alpha-smooth muscle actin content in pulmonary arterioles (p = 0.009), higher right to left ventricular wall diameter ratio (p = 0.02), and larger cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (p < 0.001). Macitentan treatment significantly increased pulmonary vessel count (p = 0.004) and decreased right to left ventricular wall diameter ratios (p = 0.002). Endothelin-1 plasma concentrations were higher compared to placebo (p = 0.015). Alveolar number and size, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and the cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area remained unchanged (all p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The endothelin-1 receptor antagonist macitentan attenuated cardiovascular remodelling in an infant rat model for preterm chronic lung disease. This study underscores the potential of macitentan to reduce cardiovascular morbidity in preterm infants with chronic lung disease.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity complicating preterm birth and affects long-term respiratory outcomes. The objectives of this study were to establish whether serum periostin at birth, day of life (DOL) 28, and corrected 36 weeks' gestational age could be potential biomarkers for BPD. Method(s): A total of 98 preterm Japanese infants born at <32 weeks and comparing 41 healthy controls born at term, were divided into BPD (n = 44) and non-BPD (n = 54) cohorts. Serum periostin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Result(s): Among 98 preterm infants, the median serum periostin levels at birth were higher with BPD (338.0 ng/mL) than without (275.0 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that serum periostin levels at birth were significantly associated with BPD (P = 0.013). Serum periostin levels at birth with moderate/severe BPD (345.0 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those with non-BPD/mild BPD (283.0 ng/mL, P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): Serum periostin levels were significantly correlated with birth weight and gestational age, and serum periostin levels at birth in BPD infants were significantly higher than that in non-BPD infants. Impact: This study found higher serum periostin levels at birth in preterm infants subsequently diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.It also emerged that serum periostin levels at birth significantly correlated with gestational age and birth weight.The mechanism by which serum periostin is upregulated in BPD infants needs further investigation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Background: Neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic neonatal respiratory disease that is precipitated by prolonged oxygenation and mechanical ventilation (MV), leading to respiratory distress (RD). Aim of Study: The aim of the study is to assess the role of Vitamin D as adjuvant treatment in the prevention and management of BPD in neonates. Patients and Methods: Prospective randomized controlled trial with identification number TCTR20210622001 on 100 premature neonates who had RD and were put on MV. The examined neonates were classified into 2 groups: Group 1, which received Vitamin D (Vit D), and Group 2, which had placebo. Urinary beta2-microglobulin (B2M) in addition to plasma Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels were measured on the 1 st and the 14 th day of hospitalization. Result(s): There was a decrease in urinary B2M and plasma KL-6 levels in Group 1, if compared with Group 2 neonates (P < 0.05). There was a decrease in hospitalization in Group 1 neonates (P < 0.05). Group 1 neonates showed a decrease of the developed BPD cases (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Vit D supplementation may help in the prevention of BPD in neonates, but further studies with larger number of neonates should be done. Recommendation: Routine Vit D supplementation in a dose of 800 IU to preterm who are susceptible to develop BPD.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite improvements in the care and outcomes of infants born extremely preterm, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a common and frustrating complication of prematurity. This review summarizes the BPD-focused research conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network (NRN). To improve disease classification and outcome prediction, the NRN developed new data-driven diagnostic criteria for BPD and web-based tools that allow clinicians and investigators to reliably estimate BPD risk in preterm infants. Randomized trials of intramuscular vitamin A and prophylactic nasal continuous positive airway pressure conducted by the NRN have contributed to our current use of these therapies as evidence-based approaches to reduce BPD risk. A recent large, randomized trial of hydrocortisone administered beginning between the 2nd and 4th postnatal weeks provided strong evidence that this therapy promotes successful extubation but does not lower BPD rates. Ongoing studies within the NRN will address important, unanswered questions on the risks and benefits of intratracheal surfactant/corticosteroid combinations and treatment versus expectant management of the patent ductus arteriosus to prevent BPD.Copyright © 2022

AB  - BACKGROUND: The poor survival rate of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) transplanted into recipient lungs greatly limits their therapeutic efficacy for diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) overexpression on improving the potential for bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) to confer resistance against hyperoxia-induced cell injury., METHODS: 80% O2 was used to imitate the microenvironment surrounding-transplanted cells in the hyperoxia-induced lung injury in vitro. BMSC proliferation and apoptotic rates and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. The effects of Trx-1 overexpression on the level of antioxidants and growth factors were investigated. We also investigated the activation of apoptosis-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)., RESULT: Trx-1 overexpression significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced BMSC apoptosis and increased cell proliferation. We demonstrated that Trx-1 overexpression upregulated the levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase as well as downregulated the production of ROS. Furthermore, we illustrated that Trx-1 protected BMSCs against hyperoxic injury via decreasing the ASK1/P38 MAPK activation rate., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that Trx-1 overexpression improved the ability of BMSCs to counteract hyperoxia-induced injury, thus increasing their potential to treat hyperoxia-induced lung diseases such as BPD.

AB  - The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared responsible for a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. It created, since its emergence, a special concern in neonates given their immature immune system and their frequent contact with caregivers. Monochorionic very preterm female neonate (31 5/7weeks of gestation) with growth retardation had at 3 weeks of age severe lung damage following an acute respiratory failure caused by horizontally transmitted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Before this acute episode, she was without respiratory support apart from 7 days of positive airway pressure following a respiratory distress syndrome. Both of her parents, her twin sister, and her referent nurse tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Chest radiographs showed bilateral alveolar infiltration. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan detected multiple ground-glass opacifications in both lungs along with ventilation disorders and bronchial wall thickening. Neonate paraclinical tests showed a negative C-reactive protein and hypogammaglobulinemia. Mechanical ventilation was needed for 1 week along with sedation, pharmaceutically induced paralysis, and inhaled nitric oxide. Severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia revealed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of gestation was treated with steroids and noninvasive respiratory support. The neonate was discharged with free oxygen at home. Her twin sister, also SARS-CoV-2-positive, only needed noninvasive ventilation for 19 days.Severe forms of COVID-19 in premature neonates, with long-term respiratory sequelae, are possible. Considering the lack of data in this age group, more studies are needed to investigate the risk factors associated with severe symptoms, the effects of specific treatments, and the long-term prognosis of the disease.Copyright © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in December 2019 and has since unleashed a global pandemic, with over 518 million cases as of May 10, 2022. Neonates represent a very small proportion of those patients. Among reported cases of neonates with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, the rates of hospitalization remain low. Most reported cases in infants and neonates are community acquired with mild symptoms, most commonly fever, rhinorrhea and cough. Very few require intensive care or invasive support for acute infection. We present a case of a 2-month-old former 26-week gestation infant with a birthweight of 915 grams and diagnoses of mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia and a small ventricular septal defect who developed acute respiratory decompensation due to COVID-19 infection. He required veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for 23 days. Complications included liver and renal dysfunction and a head ultrasound notable for lentriculostriate vasculopathy, extra-axial space enlargement and patchy periventricular echogenicity. The patient was successfully decannulated to conventional mechanical ventilation with subsequent extubation to non-invasive respiratory support. He was discharged home at 6 months of age with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and gastrostomy tube feedings. He continues to receive outpatient developmental follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a preterm infant during their initial hospitalization to survive ECMO for COVID-19.Copyright © 2022 Patrick-Esteve, Mumphrey, Yu, Masoumy, Lawson, Hebert and Barkemeyer.

AB  - Previous studies suggest that platelets are involved in fetal and adult lung development, but their role in postnatal lung development especially after premature birth is elusive. There is an urgent need to scrutinize this topic because the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease after premature birth, remains high. We have previously shown impaired platelet biogenesis in infants and rats with BPD. In this study, we investigated the role of anti-CD41 antibody-induced platelet depletion during normal postnatal lung development and thrombopoietin (TPO)-induced platelet biogenesis in mice with experimental BPD. We demonstrate that platelet deficient mice develop a BPD-like phenotype, characterized by enlarged alveoli and vascular remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries, resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Vascular remodeling was potentially caused by endothelial dysfunction demonstrated by elevated von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentration in plasma and reduced vWF staining in lung tissue with platelet depletion. Furthermore, TPO-induced platelet biogenesis in mice with experimental BPD improved alveolar simplification and ameliorated vascular remodeling. These findings demonstrate that platelets are indispensable for normal postnatal lung development and attenuation of BPD, probably by maintaining endothelial function.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Lin, Han, Wang, Zhong, Wagenaar, Yang and Chen.

AB  - Background: The presence of patent ductus arteriosus can be as high as 50% in preterm babies. Hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus is a common cause of delayed weaning of respiratory support and an important risk factor of necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in this population. Objective(s): The aim of this study is to describe an initial experience of percutaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants weighing less than 2 kg. Method(s): This was a prospective study, comprised of 14 consecutive patients submitted to percutaneous closure of ductus arteriosus between March 2020 and February 2021 in 6 institutions in Brazil. Result(s): Mean gestational age was 28.45+/-3.14 weeks, mean age at the procedure was 38.85+/-17.35 days and mean weight was 1.41 +/-0.41 kg; 79% of the patients were under mechanical ventilation, and 79% had been submitted, on average, to a 1.5 cycle of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Most patients were weaned off of mechanical ventilation in a mean of 12.6 +/-7.24 days after the procedure. Success rate was 100%. No procedure-related mortality was observed. Conclusion(s): This study concluded that percutaneous closure of ductus arteriosus in premature babies below 2 kg has satisfactory results and a low complication rate in this study sample.Copyright © 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia.

AB  - Purpose: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and severe complication in preterm infants. Vitamin D (VitD) has been reported to protect against BPD; however, its role in the mitochondria-mediated and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways has not yet been reported. Method(s): We first performed in vivo studies using neonatal C57BL/6 mice in which we induced BPD by exposing them to a hyperoxic environment (85% O2). The mice were divided into room air (RA; 21% O2), RA+VitD, BPD, and BPD+VitD groups. Hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining were used to evaluate lung injury. Inflammation and apoptosis were measured using ELISA, RT-qPCR, and TUNEL assays. We then analyzed BEAS-2B cells divided into the same groups along with an additional BPD+VitD+inhibitor group. Mitochondrial apoptosis was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Western blotting. We then used VDR-shRNA to silence the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) in the BEAS-2B cells. The inflammation, apoptotic rate, and the phosphorylated forms of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in cells were detected by RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. Result(s): The mean linear intercept, septal thickness, and abnormal fibrosis increased, while radial alveolar count decreased in BPD lungs compared to RA lungs. VitD administration was able to ameliorate the phenotype in BPD lungs. IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha expression and the apoptotic rate decreased in the BPD+VitD lung group. VitD pretreatment restored abnormal mitochondrial morphology, reduced mitochondrial membrane loss, and reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in BEAS-2B cells. VitD administration also reduced IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha mRNA, as well as pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 expression and apoptosis rate in cells exposed to hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): We concluded that VitD treatment ameliorated apoptosis and inflammation by targeting the mitochondrial pathway and via the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway in BPD, thus supporting its potential therapeutic use in this condition.Copyright © 2022 Hu et al.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to predict the ineffectiveness of the first injection of Beractantby a minimally invasive method in the first 6 hours of life and the use of artificial lung ventilation (ALV) in premature newborns with a gestational age (GA) of less than 32 weekswith respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) at the age of 72 hours of life. Materials and methods of the research: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was carried out. Nine perinatal centers from different Russia regions took part in the research from July 1, 2019 till June 30, 2020. A total of 102 premature newborns at the GA of less than 32 weeks participated in the survey.The 100 mg/kg Beractant was used in the first and repeated injectionsof surfactant.The first injection was allowedat the age of not later than 6 hours of life. The authors have studied the methods of injection by a thin catheter represented by the term less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) orthrough an endotracheal tube using INSURE method, which consists of an intubation-surfactant-extubation sequence. The twocomparison groups of patients were formed. Group 1 of 69 children <>: after the introduction of Beractant the patients had needednon-invasive respiratory support (non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)). Group 2 of 33 children <>: needed intubation trachea and invasive ALVduring the first 72 hours of life. Result(s): both groups did not differ statistically significantly in terms of gender, GA, body weightand length at birth, as well as in the APGAR score. The statistically significant differences were found in the duration of the anhydrous interval (Me [Q1; Q3] in children <> 72.0 [27.0; 95.0] hours versus 15.0 [6.8; 59.2] hours in children <>, p=0.035) and by the level of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in the blood: the median (Me) maximum value in children <> was 8.0 [7.4; 10.0] mg/l versus 19.45 [11.2; 28.7] mg/l in in children <>. The risk of transfer to ALV in those children who were injected with Beractant using INSURE was 3,625 [1,137; 11,552] times higher than in those who were administered using LISA. Conclusion(s): the predictors for ALV in the first 72 hours of life in premature newborns with GA of less than 32 weeks are a short anhydrous period and a high level of CRP in the child's blood. The use of the INSURE method in comparison with LISA adds about 3.6 times higher risk of need for the ALV in patients with RDS in the first 72 hours of life (in the selection described in the article).Copyright © 2022, Pediatria Ltd..

AB  - Background There are limited data about the range of diseases, natural history, age-appropriate end-points and optimal care for children with pulmonary hypertension (PH), including the need for developing high-quality patient registries of children with diverse forms of PH to enhance care and research. Our objective was to characterise the distribution and clinical features of diseases associated with paediatric PH, including natural history, evaluation, therapeutic interventions and outcomes, as defined by the World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) classification. Methods 1475 patients were enrolled into a multisite registry across the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet), comprised of eight interdisciplinary PH programmes. Results WSPH Groups 1 (pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)) and 3 (lung or hypoxia-related PH) were the most common primary classifications (45% and 49% of subjects, respectively). The most common Group 3 conditions were bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Group 1 disease was predominantly associated with congenital heart disease (60% of Group 1 cases) and idiopathic PAH (23% of Group 1 cases). In comparison with Group 1, Group 3 subjects had better disease resolution (hazard ratio 3.1; p<0.001), tended to be younger at diagnosis (median (interquartile range) age 0.3 (0.0-0.6) versus 1.6 (0.1-6.9) years; p<0.001) and were more often male (57% versus 45%; p<0.001). Down syndrome, the most common genetic syndrome in the PPHNet Registry, constituted 11% of the entire PH cohort. Conclusions We find a striking proportion of paediatric PH patients with Group 3 disorders, reflecting the growing recognition of PH in diverse developmental lung diseases. Greater precision of clinical phenotyping based on disease-specific characterisation may further enhance care and research of paediatric PH.Copyright © The authors 2022.

AB  - Introduction: Premature newborns are a special category of children with inherent morpho-functional immaturity and specific pathological conditions that cause significant differences in the survival and morbidity, and the consequences of their care in comparison with children of other weight categories. The problems of premature babies are at the forefront of neonatal research and perinatal care. Aim of the research: To establish an association between the formation of adverse consequences in preschool children born prematurely, with a body weight of less than 1500 g, and placental changes. Material(s) and Method(s): The study involved 220 preschool children born prematurely. The results of a pathomorphological study of the placentas of mothers of 220 children were analysed. The results distinguished 5 groups of mothers according to the classification of changes in the placenta. In the course of the study, this category of children was under observation of the doctors of the Prematurity and Hight-risk Neonate Post-discharge Follow-up Department, in order to regular assess their health. Clinical indicators such as body weight, height, head circumference, neurological and general cognitive development, and low-severity dysfunction, the post-discharge history including respiratory diseases, skeletal system problems, and haematological and metabolic disorders was analysed. Ophthalmological and audiological examinations were performed prospectively to assess vision and hearing. Patients were divided into 3 groups depending on the severity of the disabling pathology. Result(s): An analysis of the clinical parameters of children with severe disability consequences was carried out; these were divided into 5 groups according to the changes found in their placentas. All the children involved in the study had a disease combination in the neonatal period that caused severe conditions. Pathological changes of the placenta significantly affected the course of the neonatal period. Thus, newborns with signs of inflammatory changes and immaturity were 10 times more likely to suffer generalized intrauterine infections and neonatal sepsis; they also significantly more frequently had intraventricular haemorrhages, periventricular leukomalacia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The course of the neonatal period in groups of children with signs of premature aging of placenta and blood flow disorders was characterized by a low frequency of infections, but periventricular leukomalacia was diagnosed 5 times more often. Conclusion(s): It was found that transplacental infection and pathological placenta immaturity had a negative impact on the health of children of groups III and IV, causing their birth 3 weeks prematurely, unlike the children in the comparison group. Newborns of groups III and IV needed resuscitation care in the delivery room 9 times more often, and the need for respiratory support was 10 times higher than in the comparison group, which predetermined a significantly longer duration of hospital stay for children of groups III and IV - on average 30-45 days longer compared to the newborns of group V.Copyright © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - While the association of inflammation with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has long been appreciated, M1 proinflammatory macrophage population is emerging as the key element in driving the BPD inflammatory environment. Previous study suggests that low-dose metformin elicits an anti-inflammatory response, possibly through modulating macrophages, to improve disease outcome in a rat BPD model. To investigate this concept further, we examined the dose-dependent immunomodulatory function of metformin directly on human macrophages derived from cord blood (CB) monocytes. We demonstrate that low-dose metformin promotes expansion of M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages, contrasted with high-dose treatment, which exacerbates inflammation by favoring M1 polarization and restricting M2 phenotype. These findings highlight that metformin hold immunomodulatory ability by regulating macrophage polarization in a dose-dependent manner, and only when applied at low dose, exhibiting potential for beneficial anti-inflammatory adjuvant in BPD setting.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Introduction: Ibuprofen is one of the most common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used to close patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. PDA is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), while PDA closure by ibuprofen did not reduce the incidence of BPD or death. Previous studies have indicated an anti-angiogenesis effect of ibuprofen. This study investigated the change of angiogenic factors after ibuprofen treatment in preterm infants. Method(s): Preterm infants with hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) were included. After confirmed hsPDA by color doppler ultrasonography within 1 week after birth, infants received oral ibuprofen for three continuous days. Paired plasma before and after the ibuprofen treatment was collected and measured by ELISA to determine the concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha). Result(s): 17 paired plasma from infants with hsPDA were collected. The concentration of PDGF-BB and VEGF-A significantly decreased after ibuprofen treatment (1,908 vs. 442 pg/mL for PDGF-BB, 379 vs. 174 pg/mL for VEGF-A). HIF-2alpha level showed a tendency to decrease after ibuprofen treatment, although the reduction was not statistically significant (p = 0.077). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated decreased vascular growth factors after ibuprofen exposure in hsPDA infants.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Han, Wei, Lin, Zeng, Zhang, Wei, Huang, Chen and Yang.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin A (VA) is crucial for lung growth and development. In premature infants, inadequate VA levels are associated with an increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Intramuscular VA supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence of BPD, but is not widely used in the clinical setting due to concerns about feasibility and pain. We studied VA kinetics, distribution, and the induction of early genetic expression of retinoid homeostatic genes in the lung after endotracheal and intravenous application in a preterm lamb model., METHODS: Lambs were delivered prematurely after 85% of gestation, intubated, and ventilated for 3 hours. The animals were randomized to receive no VA ("control"), a bolus of VA intravenously ("i.v."), or VA endotracheally directly after administration of surfactant ("e.t.")., RESULTS: Animals treated with VA endotracheally directly after administration of surfactant showed significant increases of VA in serum and lung compared to controls. Animals treated with a bolus of VA intravenously showed significant increases of VA in serum, lung, and liver; however, peak serum concentrations and mRNA levels of homeostatic genes raised concerns about toxicity in this group., CONCLUSIONS: Endotracheal VA supplementation in preterm lambs is feasible and might offer advantages in comparison to i.v. Further studies are warranted to explore biological effects in the context of BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Preterm infants are at risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), including Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) associated bronchiolitis, for which palivizumab prophylaxis can be proposed. Our aim was to determine risk factors of very severe RSV disease in children born before 34 weeks of gestation. Method(s): Among 2,101 infants born before 34 weeks of gestation in 3 maternity wards between 2012 and 2017, the laboratory confirmed RSV-infected patients requiring hospitalization before 12 months of corrected age were retrospectively included. We collected data about the neonatal period, the palivizumab prophylaxis and the hospitalization for a RSV-related LRTI. LRTI was considered as very severe (VS-LRTI) when patients required invasive or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Result(s): Among 86 included patients, 31 met the criteria of VS-LRTI. The VS-LRTI patients had a higher birth gestational age and weight but less heart disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. They received palivizumab prophylaxis less frequently than the other patients but the difference was not significant. At the onset of infection, VS-LRTI patients had a younger corrected age for prematurity and presented more frequently with apnea, bradycardia, life-threatening event, hemodynamic failure, hypercapnia. Using logistic regression, the main factor associated with VS-LRTI was a younger corrected age for prematurity at the onset of infection [Odd ratio for each month of corrected age = 0.77 (0.62; 0.93), p = 0.012]. Conclusion(s): Infants at the highest risk of VS-LRTI were infants with a younger corrected age for prematurity. Therefore, a better targeting of infants requiring palivizumab prophylaxis and early interventions at hospital discharge could limit VS-LRTI in these infants.Copyright © 2022 Mulot, Benchaib, Plaisant, Ploin, Gillet, Javouhey, Claris, Picaud, Casalegno and Butin.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (KD) are at a high risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) given in combination with aspirin is the standard of treatment for the prevention of coronary aneurysm. IVIG is recommended to be administered as a dose of 2 g/kg infused during 10 to 12 hours for the prevention of coronary aneurysms in KD; however, this does not always occur in practice. We aimed to investigate if an infusion time of <10 hours is associated with more coronary artery aneurysms than the recommended infusion time of 10 to 12 hours. METHODS Patients with a diagnosis of and treated for KD with IVIG at the University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children's Hospital were identified by drug use reports that included patients who received IVIG between September 2008 and August 2018. Data were collected though chart review and patients were divided into 2 groups based on duration of infusion (<10 hours and 10-12 hours). The primary outcome was the incidence of coronary artery aneurysm. The secondary outcome was the time to defervescence. The safety outcome was the development of renal dysfunction. RESULTS A total of 70 patients were screened and 44 were included in the analysis. Coronary aneurysm occurred in 2 of 33 patients (6.0%) in the <10-hour group and no patients in the 10-to 12-hour group (p = 0.558). The median time to defervescence was 0.5 hours in the <10-hour group and 0.95 hours in the 10-to 12-hour group (p = 0.166). The incidence of acute kidney injury was 6% (2 of 33 patients) in the 10-hour group and 9.1% (1 of 11 patients) in the 10-to 12-hour group (p = 0.588). CONCLUSIONS All incidences of coronary artery aneurysm occurred in the patients who received IVIG with an infusion time of <10 hours. The incidence of acute kidney injury was numerically higher in the 10-to 12-hour group. Based on the recommendations in the American Heart Association KD guideline, our internal hospital policy, and our results, we recommend the infusion of IVIG be administered at a rate of 10 to 12 hours.

AB  - We aimed to compare the rate of morbidity and mortality of late preterm and term infants during hospitalization in the third-level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 743 late preterm and 489 term infants who were born and followed up in the third level NICU were evaluated retrospectively. The birth weight, mode of delivery, gestational week, gender, duration of hospitalization, problems in neonatal and post-discharge period, and rate of mortality were investigated. The rate of mortality and morbidity were compared between the groups. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was the most common (40.3%) cause of hospitalization. The rate of necrotizing enterocolitis, RDS and bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly higher in late preterms. Sixty-two (8.3%) of the late preterms and 88 (18%) of the term babies died. Congenital anomalies (55%) were the major cause of mortality in the term group, whereas RDS (35%), surgical interventions, long-term hospitalization, and infection were the main causes of mortality in the late preterm group. The high mortality rate in our study was because our study included only the babies hospitalized in the 3rd level NICU. It must be kept in mind that late preterms experience most of the problems of ongoing prematurity; therefore, they should not be delivered unless there is absolute obstetric and/or fetal indication.Copyright © 2022, Yuzuncu Yil Universitesi Tip Fakultesi.

AB  - Background: Sepsis in premature newborns is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but underlying mechanisms of lung injury remain unclear. Aberrant expression of endothelial cell (EC) angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) disrupts angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1)/TIE2-mediated endothelial quiescence, and is implicated in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults. We hypothesized that recombinant ANGPT1 will mitigate sepsis-induced ANGPT2 expression, inflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), and alveolar remodeling in the saccular lung. Method(s): Effects of recombinant ANGPT1 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial inflammation were evaluated in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC). ALI and long-term alveolar remodeling were assessed in newborn mice exposed to intraperitoneal LPS and recombinant ANGPT1 pretreatment. Result(s): LPS dephosphorylated EC TIE2 in association with increased ANGPT2 in vivo and in vitro. ANGPT1 suppressed LPS and ANGPT2-induced EC inflammation in HPMEC. Neonatal mice treated with LPS had increased lung cytokine expression, neutrophilic influx, and cellular apoptosis. ANGPT1 pre-treatment suppressed LPS-induced lung Toll-like receptor signaling, inflammation, and ALI. LPS-induced acute increases in metalloproteinase 9 expression and elastic fiber breaks, as well as a long-term decrease in radial alveolar counts, were mitigated by ANGPT1. Conclusion(s): In an experimental model of sepsis-induced BPD, ANGPT1 preserved endothelial quiescence, inhibited ALI, and suppressed alveolar simplification. Impact: Key message: Angiopoietin 1 inhibits LPS-induced neonatal lung injury and alveolar remodeling.Additions to existing literature:Demonstrates dysregulation of angiopoietin-TIE2 axis is important for sepsis- induced acute lung injury and alveolar simplification in experimental BPD.Establishes recombinant Angiopoietin 1 as an anti-inflammatory therapy in BPD. Impact: Angiopoietin 1-based interventions may represent novel therapies for mitigating sepsis-induced lung injury and BPD in premature infants.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Background: Postnatal infection with cytomegalovirus CMV in very-preterm and very-low-birth-weight infants, transmitted through breast milk BM, is potentially associated with adverse outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and clinical significance of postnatal CMV infection in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. Method(s): Infants of CMV-seropositive mothers born in a neonatal intensive care unit in Melbourne, Australia, were observed for 14 weeks from birth in a prospective cohort study. Maternal BM and infant urine were tested weekly for CMV by culture and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed in relation to the infants' CMV infection status. Result(s): Data from 65 infants of 56 CMV-seropositive mothers were available for analysis. Of these mothers, 88% 49/56 shed CMV in their BM. Of the 58 infants exposed to CMV-positive BM, 27 47% became urine polymerase chain reaction CMV-positive. There was no significant difference in gestational age, birth weight, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or necrotizing enterocolitis between the CMV-positive and CMV-negative groups. However, CMV-positive infants had a longer length of hospital stay and more episodes of prolonged neutropenia. Of the CMV-positive infants, 30% 8/27 remained asymptomatic, 48% 13/27 had symptoms categorized as mild and 22% 6/27 as severe. Conclusion(s): About half of preterm and very-low-birth-weight infants exposed to CMV-positive BM become infected, and a fifth develop significant clinical symptoms. Future studies should address the maternal and neonatal factors that determine the risk of mother-to-infant CMV transmission, as well as those leading to clinical deterioration and long-term sequelae.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - The aim of the research was to study the polymorphism of the genes of the detoxification system and genes of the main histocompatibility complex HLA class II in premature infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g and a gestation period of less than 32 weeks. Materials and methods of research: 103 extremely premature infants without congenital malformations, having respiratory disorders and requiring respiratory therapy in one volume or another, were under observation. All children were divided into 2 groups: 1st - 81 extremely premature babies with favorable outcome (recovery); 2nd - 22 children with unfavorable outcome (death, disability). Result(s): an association was established between the presence of DQA1*0301 alleles in the genotype and the development of unfavorable outcome in extremely premature infants with respiratory pathology (p=0.041). In addition, the genotype GSTM1+/+ GSTT1+/+ DRB1*13 DQA1*0301 DQB1*0602 was determined only in children with poor outcomes (p=0.041). The presence of genotypes GSTM1 - GSTT1+/+ DRB1*11 DQA1*0501 DQB1*0301 and GSTM1 - GSTT1+/+ DRB1*15 DQA1*0102 DQB1*0602 17 times, and the presence of the DQA1*0401 allele 8 times increases the risk of death (p=0.028).Copyright © 2022 The authors.

AB  - The aim of the study - to analyze the morbidity and search for predictors of death in premature infants with a gestational age (GA) of 32 weeks or less, born in perinatal centers and received Poractant alfa (PA) in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), in order to improve the quality of medical care for premature babies. Materials and methods of research: a multicenter prospective open-label non-randomized continuous comparative study was conducted in five perinatal centers from 2020 to 2021. A total of 264 patients, and inclusion criteria: GA less than 32 weeks, the need for PA replacement therapy in the first minutes of life, the first dose of PA - 200 mg/kg, the second dose of PA - 100 mg/kg, strict adherence to the study protocol. Children who did not require PA therapy in the delivery room, who received other types of surfactants, as well as those with congenital malformations, genetic and/or chromosomal abnormalities, early neonatal sepsis, and deviations from the study protocol were excluded. Children were divided into 3 groups: group 1 (200 children) - invasive PA (ETT), group 2 (19 children) - PA injection by INSURE method, group 3 (45 children) - PA injection by LISA method. Result(s): the median birth weight of all 264 children was 1090.0 g, GA - 28.0 weeks. The median age of the first PA injection is 10.0 [10.0; 10.0] min of life. PA was reintroduced in 20.1% (53/264) of children, invasive mechanical ventilation (IV) was required in 82.6% (218/264) of cases, high-frequency oscillatory mechanical ventilation (HFOV) - in 24.0% (59/264). The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 37.5% (99/264) of cases and prevailed in the ETT group in comparison with LISA (43.0% versus 27.0%, respectively, p=0.043) and INSURE (43.0% versus 5.0 %, p=0.001). Predictors of death were low gestational age and birth weight, surgical stage of necrotizing enterocolitis, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, grade III intraventricular hemorrhage, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The development of the latter in the first 72 hours of life increases the risk of death by 19.7 times. Conclusion(s): minimally invasive administration of PA by INSURE and LISA methods associated with reduce of morbidity and improves outcomes in premature infants who less than 32 weeks of GA. Pulmonary hemorrhage was the most dangerous among the predictors of death, increasing the risk of death by almost 20 times.Copyright © 2022, Pediatria Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is common in neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and is associated with higher morbidity. This study evaluates the value of a CT protocol to assess the degree of TBM and gauge the adequacy of prescribed PEEP. Study Design: Four infants with severe BPD on invasive mechanical ventilation underwent a chest CT protocol, including limited reduced-dose expiratory scans with varying PEEP levels. Result(s): Baseline PEEP was adjusted in all subjects after performing the Dynamic PEEP CT. In two infants, the PEEP was increased due to significant TBM and in the other two without signs of TBM PEEP was decreased. The clinical course improved in all patients after adjusting PEEP. Conclusion(s): A "Dynamic PEEP" study may be reliable and non-invasive imaging modality for the evaluation of adequate ventilator settings in infants with severe BPD who are not optimal candidates for bronchoscopy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aims: Report the case of death of a premature infant with congenital malformations exposed to cocaine during pregnancy. Case history: Emergency services are called for a delivery at home. The child, in cardiopulmonary arrest, died during the transfer to hospital. Gestational age was estimated at 33 weeks of amenorrhoea. The examination shows multiple malformations. Result(s): Peripheral blood tests revealed morphine at a concentration of 210 mug/L, as well as cocaine, benzoylecgonine, and ecgonine methylester at respective concentrations of 2.5, 645, and 35 mug/L. Morphine concentration is compatible with those described in preterm infants and corresponds to the administration of morphine by emergency services. Cocaine and metabolites concentrations are consistent with those measured in the cord blood of exposed newborns. Pathological examination reveals hyaline membrane disease. No genetic diagnosis is requested. Discussion/Conclusion: If the death seems to be directly caused by pulmonary immaturity, the responsibility of cocaine in the induction of labor and malformations has to be discussed. While the risk of prematurity in cocaine-exposed fetuses is accepted, its teratogenicity is controversial. In this case, some of the malformations are consistent with those described in the literature, and there is no evidence of a genetic pathology. However, a genetic diagnosis and analysis of the mother's hair would have made it possible to rule out a genetic cause and to document exposure to cocaine during the first trimester of pregnancy. In conclusion, it seems important in these situations to carry out all the necessary investigations to determine the exact cause of death.Copyright © 2021

AB  - OBJECTIVE This study evaluates the value of inhaled budesonide (BUD) administration in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) cases especially for near-term neonates. METHODS A randomized controlled trial involving 120 neonates with respiratory distress, which was diagnosed as RDS, was conducted from July 2016 to March 2018. The neonates studied were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (the inhaled BUD group), consisting of 60 neonates who received BUD (2 mL, 0.25-mg/mL suspension) inhalation, twice daily for 5 days; and group 2 (the placebo group), consisting of 60 neonates with RDS who received humidified distilled sterile water inhalation (2 mL). Downes score, RDS grades, and interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels were monitored and measured on the first and fifth days of incubation. RESULTS Statistically significant differences (SSDs) in RDS grades, Downes score, and IL-8 levels on the fifth day of admission were observed between groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.001) and between the first and fifth days of incubation in group 1 (p = 0.001). The SSDs in the duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001) and the number of neonates receiving mechanical ventilation (p = 0.032) were found between both groups. CONCLUSIONS Budesonide inhalation is associated with improvements in clinical and laboratory parameters in neonates with RDS ABBREVIATIONS BPD, bronchopulmonary dysplasia; BUD, budesonide; IL-8, interleukin 8; MV, mechanical ventilation; NICU, neonatal intensive care unit; non-SSD, non-statistically significant difference; RDS, respiratory distress syndrome; SSD, statistically significant difference.Copyright © Pediatric Pharmacy Association.

AB  - Background: Early pulmonary oxygen exposure is one of the most important factors implicated in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., Methods: Here, we analyzed short- and long-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia on NOS3 and STAT3 expression and corresponding epigenetic signatures using a hyperoxia-based mouse model of BPD., Results: Early hyperoxia exposure led to a significant increase in NOS3 (median fold change x 2.37, IQR 1.54-3.68) and STAT3 (median fold change x 2.83, IQR 2.21-3.88) mRNA levels in pulmonary endothelial cells with corresponding changes in histone modification patterns such as H2aZac and H3K9ac hyperacetylation at the respective gene loci. No complete restoration in histone signatures at these loci was observed, and responsivity to later hyperoxia was altered in mouse lungs. In vitro, histone signatures in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) remained altered for several weeks after an initial long-term exposure to trichostatin A. This was associated with a substantial increase in baseline eNOS (median 27.2, IQR 22.3-35.6) and STAT3alpha (median 5.8, IQR 4.8-7.3) mRNA levels with a subsequent significant reduction in eNOS expression upon exposure to hypoxia., Conclusions: Early hyperoxia induced permanent changes in histones signatures at the NOS3 and STAT3 gene locus might partly explain the altered vascular response patterns in children with BPD.

AB  - Premature infants who require surgery for retinopathy of prematurity often exhibit bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Reactive airway is a clinical manifestation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We describe premature infant twins who had difficulty with positive pressure ventilation during anesthesia. Both cases occurred during induction of anesthesia for binocular anterior chamber puncture and vitreous cavity injection. The most likely cause in each case was airway malacia. We recommend that endotracheal intubation is performed in infant patients with low body weight; the possibility of airway malacia occurrence should be considered, especially for infants with comorbid bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common inflammation-related neonatal diseases of prematurity affecting approximately 50% of extremely preterm infants. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in breast milk (BM) may predispose the offspring to inflammation through immunological modulation. In addition, omega(n)-6 and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) play a critical role in lung development. We aimed to test the role of BM cytokines, and n-6 and n-3 LC-PUFAs in the development of BPD in preterm infants in the first month of life. Fifty-two infants born less than 28 weeks from the Nutrition and Infant Health program were enrolled at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA). Inclusion criteria were infant on full enteral feedings at day 14, receiving greater than 70% of mother's BM, and feeding samples available at day 14 and day 28. BPD was defined as a need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (62.3% in the cohort). In feeding samples, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 levels were determined by semiquantitative enzyme-linked Immuno-Assay and arachidonic (ARA), alpha-linolenic (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) were quantified by GC/MS. The association between cytokines and LC-PUFAs with BPD was tested by multivariate logistic regression models using a stepwise time-oriented approach, adjusted for maternal/ neonatal variables. In feeding samples at day 14, ARA, ALA, EPA, and DHA levels, but not ARA:DHA or n-3:n-6 ratios, were significantly lower in BPD infants compared to non-BPD. At day 28, in feeding samples the level of MCP-1 was significantly higher in BPD than non- BPD infants. Adjusted models at day 14 corroborated the protective association between EPA (aOR=0.65 [0.41; 0.90]; P=0.027) and DHA (aOR=0.51 [0.25; 0.91]; P=0.039) with BPD. In the first month of life, low BM n-3 LC-PUFAs, and potentially later an increase in MCP-1, were biomarkers of BPD development. Lipids and cytokines are part of a network of metabolites that needs to be explored in depth. Additionally, the exposure to bioactive compounds should be explored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children living with chronic comorbid conditions are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease, though there is limited evidence regarding the risks associated with specific conditions and which children may benefit from targeted COVID-19 therapies. Age-specific baseline indicators of COVID-19 severity are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies in the paediatric population. OBJECTIVE(S): In this study, we aimed to 1) identify factors associated with severe COVID-19 in children, and 2) describe rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and severe COVID-19 within specific pediatric age groups. DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted a national prospective study on hospitalized children with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection via the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program from March 2020-May 2021. Cases were reported voluntarily by a network of >2800 paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists. SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations were classified as COVID-19-related, incidental infection, or infection control/social admissions. Severe disease was defined as intensive care, ventilatory or hemodynamic requirements, select organ system complications, or death. Outcomes were described among children aged <6 months, 6-23 months, 2-4 years, 5-11 years, and 12-17 years. Risk factors for severe disease were identified using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for child age and sex, coinfections, and timing of hospitalization. RESULT(S): We identified 541 children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 329 (60.8%) with COVID-19-related disease. Median age at admission was 2.8 years (IQR 0.3-13.5) and 42.9% (n=232) had at least one comorbidity. Among COVID-19-related hospitalizations, severe disease occurred in 29.5% of children (n=97/329), including a higher proportion of children aged 2-4 years (48.7%) and 12-17 years (41.3%) (Table 1). Comorbidities associated with severe disease are described in Figure 1, and included technology dependence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-2.95), neurologic conditions (e.g. epilepsy and chromosomal/genetic conditions) (aRR 1.87, 95% CI 1.34-2.61), and pulmonary conditions (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia and uncontrolled asthma) (aRR 1.66, 95% CI 1.13-2.42). CONCLUSION(S): While severe outcomes were detected at all ages and among patients with and without comorbidities, neurologic and pulmonary conditions as well as technology dependence were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. Children aged 2-4 years more commonly experienced severe COVID-19 in this study, which was conducted at a time when no children were eligible for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Notably, this high-risk group remains without access to approved vaccines. These findings may help guide vaccination programs and prioritize targeted COVID-19 therapies for children.

AB  - Introduction: Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) is considered as a genetic risk factor for intellectual disability and specifically for impairment on verbal skills. Prenatal and perinatal morbidity concurrent with this diagnosis determine the entity and typology of neurodevelopmental deficits. Objective(s): To describe the intellectual and adaptive functioning of a patient with KS and prenatal and perinatal difficulties, assessed in the Service of Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology and Mental Health at La Paz University Hospital (Madrid). Method(s): A descriptive study was conducted of a 6 year and 7-month-old boy with diagnosis of KS (karyotype XXY), extremely low weight at birth (752 gr.), Arnold Chiari type I malformation with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intra-atrial septal defect, left kidney agenesis with iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, and acute ventriculitis due to E. Coli. Neuropsychological evaluation was carried out in October 2021. Leiter-3 scale was selected due to the absence of expressive language; and his parents completed the questionnaire Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II. Result(s): The nonverbal intelligence quotient was observed in the very low range (full-scale IQ = 69). The result of general adaptive behavior (z = -2.83), showed very high functional disability both in the conceptual, social, and practical domains. Conclusion(s): The high number of causes of disability in this patient is consistent with a high degree of functional disability. Efficient evaluation sessions of intellectual performance, adaptive functioning, and necessary supports, due to the absence of expressive language and limited receptive language, are required. A specific neuropsychological evaluation profile should be established for KS.

AB  - Background: Nephrocalcinosis (NC) is defined as calcium deposits in renal tubules and interstitium. Often detected as an incidental finding, NC have been suggested to be caused by factors such as prematurity, metabolic and monogenic disorders. Recently, there was a few reports that NC might be a specific finding of hereditary renal disease of various outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors and underlying diseases including genetic causes and assess clinical outcomes of Korean children with NC. Method(s): Total 256 children who visited Samsung Medical Center from January 2017 to December 2021 with a confirmative or suspected diagnosis of NC at age under 18 using ultrasonography were enrolled. Medical records including sex, gestational age, underlying disease, medication history, genetic analysis, and ultrasonography were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Male to female ratio was 0.9:1 and the average age at first diagnosis of NC was 598.4 days after birth. One hundred eighty-one children (70.7%) were born as prematurity. Underlying disease of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were found in 34.7 % and 25.0%, respectively. Each of 143 (55.8 %) and 107 (41.7%) of patients had medication history of furosemide and vitamin D. Incidence of BPD, PDA and taking vitamin D were remarkably high in premature group comparing with full term group. Among 142 children in whom the follow-up data were available, NC was spontaneously resolved over time averaging to 310 days in 96 children (67.6 %). Progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) was noted in 8 (3.1%) patients. For 44 patients without the clinical risk factors, genetic studies were performed and 20 pathogenic variants including HNF1B, SLC25A13, and PKHD1 were detected in 22 children. Among the 22 showing genetic mutations, 2 patients with HNF1B and CFH mutation progressed to CKD. Conclusion(s): The majority of current study group had histories highly relevant with preterm birth and most of them showed spontaneous resolution of NC within a year. On the other hand, full-term born children without the known risk factors were more likely to have genetic causes and to develop CKD. Therefore, our study suggests that although the children with NC present the favorable outcomes, regular follow-up and genetic analysis are necessary for the patients without the clinical risk factors.

AB  - Recent data have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are mainly responsible for the paracrine efficacy of parent MSCs through the transfer of mRNA, miRNA and proteins. Previously, we have demonstrated that the MSCs could be a therapeutic option through their paracrine action for the various neonatal intractable disorders such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia severe intraventricular hemorrhage, and severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which are major causes of mortality and significant acute and life-long morbidities of the newborn infants. Therefore, EVs derived from MSCs can be a promising new therapeutic modality since this therapy is cell-free and thus may bypass concerns associated with viable MSC treatment through direct transport of extracellular messages and mediate cell-to-cell communication. We have investigated and compared the amount and cargo content of EVs secreted from MSCs according to various preconditioning methods of MSCs and tested the preclinical efficacy and the mechanisms of EVs derived from MSCs in various intractable neonatal disorders of the neonatal rat pup models.

AB  - Rationale Preterm infants with oxygen supplementation frequently develop a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pathomechanistically, an inflammatory response with increased migration and activation of macrophages plays a major role. Elevated levels of CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), which has chemotactic and activating effects on proinflammatory inflammatory cells, were detected in lungs of infants evolving BPD. Therefore, we investigated whether CXCL10 deficiency protects newborn mice from hyperoxia-induced lung injury (as a model of BPD). Methods (1) Homozygous CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10-/- ) mice as well as wild-type mice (WT) were either exposed to hyperoxia (85% O , HYX) or normoxia (21% O2 , NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14 and studied at P14. (2) For recovery, some mice were transferred from HYX to NOX for two additional weeks and were then sacrificed at P28. Excised lungs were snap-frozen for molecular biology studies or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histomorphometric analyses. (3) J744A.1 macrophages were treated with CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist, and cell migration was studied. Results (1). Lungs of HYX-exposed WT showed significantly increased macrophage invasion at P14 compared with the control group. This inflammatory response after HYX resulted in impaired alveolarization, increased apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. CXCL10-/- protected the newborn mice from the inflammation and partially from the HYX-induced structural changes. (2) After recovery at P28, CXCL10 mice exhibited improved lung structure and attenuated matrix remodeling in comparison to WT. (3) Loss of CXCL10-/- prevented the macrophage influx to the lungs at both P14 and P28 after HYX. (3) Treatment with recombinant CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist significantly promoted and reduced the migration of macrophages, respectively. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that deficiency of CXCR3-CXCL10 axis blocks macrophage chemotaxis to the lung partially enables lung growth, and protects from ECM in experimental BPD.

AB  - Rationale Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of the premature infant following respiratory support, e.g., oxygen supplementation, and characterized by impaired alveolar and microvascular formation and a higher risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prior studies identified IL-6 signaling being central in clinical and experimental BPD. Since inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular and bronchial disease, we now investigate the functional role of IL-6 in vascular and bronchial remodeling in experimental BPD. Methods (1) Neonatal WT, IL-6 knockout mice (IL-6 ) as well as WT mice with pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis (IL-6 mAb) - and trans (sgp130-Fc) signaling were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O , HYX) or normoxia (21% O , NOX). Lungs were excised and used either for molecular biology studies or for histomorphometric analysis. (2) Primary murine bronchial smooth muscle cells (pmBSMCs) were exposed to hyperoxia and IL-6/sIL-6 receptor (IL-6+R), followed by assessment of viability and proliferation. Results (1) Histomorphometric analysis revealed a thickening of the vascular and bronchial wall of WT compared to WTNOX . WTHYX mice showed reduced microvascular formation and a higher number of partly and completely muscularized small vessels (20-100 micrometer) compared to WT . Moreover, the number of vascular KI-67+ /aSMA+ cells and the amount of aSMA cells per vessel, both indicators of proliferation, were higher in WTNOX than in WTHYX . In contrast, IL-6 deficiency (IL-6 ) and pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling protected from hyperoxia-induced vascular and bronchial remodeling, but not from reduced microvascularization. (2) Exposure of pmBSMCs to HYX decreased viability compared to NOX. While IL-6+R decreased viability of pmBSMCs under NOX, we detected an increase under HYX. Finally IL-6+R increased proliferation of pmBSMCs under both NOX and HYX. Conclusion Our data demonstrate a critical role of IL-6 signaling in vascular and bronchial remodeling via hyperproliferation of SMCs.

AB  - Introduction: We report a case of hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria caused by compound heterozygousmutations in SLC34A3 gene in an extremely preterm girl with horseshoe kidney. Material(s) and Method(s): Our patient is a girl born extremely pretermat 23 gestational weeks with a birth weight of 440 g. She developed severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia needing steroids and diuretics for the first months of life. Our patient has horseshoe kidney and since the first months of life her renal ultrasounds have shown bilateral nephrocalcinosis with consequent pyelectasia. Bone densitometry detected osteopenia, worsening at the following checks. Laboratory tests revealed hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, in the presence of low values of PTH and of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. To the contrary, calcitriol was highly increased and the patient showed hypersensitivity to the treatment with vitamin D. Genetic testing for CYP24A1 mutations resulted negative. Over time laboratory tests have shown a trend to low levels of phosphataemia and incostant phosphate reabsorption. Nephrocalcinosis has been significant and the patient underwent lithotripsy at the age of ten. The genetic testing was then widened with clinical exome sequencing. Result(s): Clinical exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations c.1304delG and novel c.986-1000del in SLC34A3 genewhich encodes the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi2a. These mutations cause FGF23 suppression and consequent calcitriol increase. The clinical features described for homozygous mutations are similar to our patients. Therapy consists in phosphorus supplementation. Conclusion(s): Nephrocalcinosis and rickets with hypercalciuric hypercalcemia and low levels of PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be consistent with mutations of tubular phosphate transporter, even without clear alterations of phosphataemia and phosphaturia. The extreme prematurity of our patient acted as a confounding factor but the genetic testing has been diagnostic and suggested a targeted therapy with good prognosis.

AB  - Introduction: Endotracheal lesions in the pediatric population are rare and, of these, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, infantile hemangiomas, and carcinoid tumors have been well described. We present a unique case of a vascular malformation with both endotracheal and central neck components in an asymptomatic pediatric patient. Method(s): We present a retrospective case report of a single pediatric patient. Result(s): A 7-year-old girl with a history of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia requiring ventilator and tracheostomy dependence until age 3, and congenital mediastinal hemangioma managed with observation as an infant underwent surgical treatment for tracheocutaneous fistula excision. During routine direct microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy prior to the fistula excision, a vascular-appearing mass obstructing 80% of the lumen at the level of the mid-trachea was visualized. The patient was not symptomatic from this lesion. The fistula excision was aborted until further investigation with computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Findings demonstrated a mass with both endotracheal and paratracheal central neck components. The masses were then excised with a combination of endoscopic and open central neck dissection without need for a tracheal resection, and the patient did well postoperatively. Final pathology demonstrated a capillary-venous malformation and tissue that was sent for genetic analysis. This was consistent with a molecular diagnosis of PIK3CArelated overgrowth spectrum disorder and a molecular diagnosis of a GNA14-related vascular tumor. Conclusion(s): Airway evaluations are routinely performed in the pediatric population prior to tracheostomy decannulation or tracheocutaneous fistula excision, and this case demonstrates a rare asymptomatic finding. Vascular malformations are due to somatic mutations, so tissue analysis for genetic alterations after resection is essential for further characterization and, as this body of literature grows, prognostication and treatment.

AB  - The present study investigated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 7 in a newborn rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and the biological effects of BMP7 on newborn rat lung fibroblast (LF) cells. For this purpose, a total of 196 newborn rats were randomly and equally assigned to a model group and a control group. Lung tissue was collected at days 3, 7, 14 and 21 for histological analysis. The location and expression of BMP7 was examined by immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. A total of 38 full-term newborn rats on the day of birth were sacrificed and LF cells were isolated and treated with BMP7. The biological effects of BMP7 on LF cells were assessed by cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis. The findings demonstrated that abnormal alveolar development due to BPD was gradually intensified in the model group over time. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the location of BMP7 in lung tissue was altered. Immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR assays demonstrated a gradual decrease in BMP7 expression in the model group induced by hyperoxia. MTT assays demonstrated that BMP7 inhibited LF cells and the inhibitory effect was dose-dependent and time-dependent. Flow cytometry revealed that the inhibitory effect of BMP7 in LF cells was causing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The present study demonstrated that BMP7 may serve an important role in alveolar development in a BPD model. BMP7 may be involved in abnormal alveolar development through the regulation of LF proliferation.

AB  - Aims Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or neonatal chronic lung disease is the commonest adverse outcome in very premature neonates. BPD incidence is increasing unlike other prematurity associated conditions and despite advances in aetiological understanding. BPD incurs substantial healthcare costs which extend beyond initial hospitalisation, such as home oxygen therapy, recurrent admissions and pulmonary hypertension. This review compares BPD service provision and organisation across the North West of England and provides the evidence base for such practices, with an aim to create a centralised North West BPD service. Methods A semi-structured interview was performed by two authors of all 20 neonatal units in the North West of England (Merseyside and Manchester deaneries) during 2021. The questions were designed by the authors comprising four main themes; discharge from hospital, oxygen at home, follow up team, and BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension. Data was recorded and analysed in Microsoft Excel. Results 7 (35%) hospitals in North West England had a dedicated BPD team and service. Home oxygen eligibility criteria existed in 13 (65%) of hospitals and this decision was made by the designated or current consultant in all units. There were no consistent criteria for home oxygen but common themes included corrected gestational age >36 weeks, gaining weight and no safeguarding concerns. 17 (85%) neonatal units had a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discharge planning meeting before discharge with home oxygen. All MDTs included a consultant and neonatal nurse but other members varied including BPD team, community outreach, health visitor, dietician and social worker. 4 (20%) of hospitals included parents in their discharge MDT and 9 (45%) hospitals performed predischarge home visits. Only 2 units (10%) performed pre discharge echocardiograms to asses for BPD associated pulmonary hypertension. Community care for babies requiring oxygen at home was provided by community neonatal nurses in 8 (40%) hospitals, general community team in 4 (20%) and respiratory paediatric nurses in 5 (25%) of hospitals. 12 (60%) hospitals had home oxygen weaning guidelines but there was no consensus regarding the frequency of community visits or overnight saturation studies (ONSS). Half of units stopped community visits after home oxygen discontinuation and half continued a further 1-2 visits. Babies with BPD were largely followed up by their named consultant with only 3 (15%) of units providing specific BPD follow up clinics. The periodicity of follow up was heterogenous with 8 (40%) units providing 2 monthly follow up, 8 (40%) had no set criteria and 2 (10%) had 6 monthly appointments. 13 (65%) hospitals followed up patients until 2 years but 5 (25%) of units had no set criteria and 2 (10%) provided follow up until 4-5 years of age. Conclusion This review of BPD services in the entire North West England shows diverse heterogeneity of BPD teams, discharge criteria, community care and outpatient follow up. There is no consensus regarding home oxygen eligibility or weaning despite evidence based reviews from European Respiratory Society and BMJ. We suggest the creation of a centralised North West BPD service would standardise evidence based practice for patients in this area.

AB  - Aims To describe the incidence, risk factors and short-term hospital outcomes for varying severity of BPD. This would help us in designing local quality improvement project. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary neonatal unit. Data were collected for five-year period (2016-2020) using neonatal electronic database and case notes. We included data on all preterm infants with birth gestational age <=29 weeks either born in our center or received most of the intensive care treatment in our unit. We excluded infants with major congenital malformations or with more than 50% missing data. We defined BPD as any infant receiving respiratory support (mechanical ventilation, CPAP, high flow) or low flow oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation in the target range at 36 weeks of gestation and we defined Severe BPD as any infant receiving positive pressure respiratory support (mechanical ventilation, CPAP, high flow) maintain oxygen saturation in the target range at 36 weeks of gestation. Ethics approval was obtained (HRA & REC approval: 302448). All statistics were performed using SPSS software. Results We had 185 preterm infants during the study period, with 32 babies died during the hospital stay, we had data on 153 infants available for final analysis. There were 31 out born babies during the study period (included for analysis). Table 1 provides trends in BPD, Severe BPD, and death over the 5-year period. There were no infants receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks. Generally, there was increasing trend in rates of BPD, Severe BPD and higher proportion of infants receiving CPAP/High flow at 36 weeks. Table 2 provides comparison of risk factors between infants with 'BPD' and infants with 'no BPD'. Overall, infants with diagnosis of BPD had lower birth gestational age and birth weight, received more ROP treatment, received longer duration of respiratory support, higher proportions were discharged on home oxygen and had a longer hospital stay duration (approximately 30 days longer stay). 29 (57%) of preterm infants of birth gestation >=26 weeks were diagnosed with severe BPD. Conclusion In our center we noticed increasing trend in diagnosis of BPD and severe BPD. Higher proportion of preterm infants with this diagnosis were discharged on home oxygen and had a longer hospital stay duration (approximately 30 days longer stay). More than half of preterm infants with a diagnosis of severe BPD was of birth gestation >=26 weeks. We could not identify specific modifiable risk factors for BPD/severe BPD. Introduction of Quality improvement bundle would help in reducing the incidence of severe BPD/ BPD.. (Table Presented).

AB  - SESSION TITLE: Biological Markers in Patients with COVID-19 Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/18/2022 01:30 pm - 02:30 pm PURPOSE: Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), like other respiratory viruses, caused a massive incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prior literature showed that influenza infection results in a significant increase in the level of circulating High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) in infected mice, cotton rats, and in humans; and a small molecule inhibitor of HMGB1 blocked lung pathology and lethality in influenza-infected mice and cotton rats. Moreover, HMGB1 has also been shown to be elevated in the serum of patients with ARDS and is an indicator of increased mortality. Gastrin Releasing Peptide (GRP) has been implicated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and fibrosis. In addition to HMGB1, GRP represents a novel DAMP that, when targeted therapeutically in influenza-infected mice, is highly protective. The interaction between GRP and HMGB1 is currently under study. We examined if these DAMPS are associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. METHOD(S): Deidentified patient plasma and serum samples were obtained from discarded, clinical blood samples from 100 patients with COVID-19 admitted to UMMC's intensive care unit (ICU). Demographic and clinical data were collected from the patient's electronic medical record. HMGB1 and GRP ELISA kits were used to analyze their concentrations in patients' sera at Day 1 of admission to ICU. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the relationship between risk factors and severity of hypoxemia (P/F ratio), need for mechanical ventilation, and need for mechanical circulatory support (VV-ECMO). RESULT(S): The average age of study participants was 59.1 years of which 59.2% were men and 57.1% were African American. The mean BMI was 34.3 kg/m2. The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease was 57.1%, 26.5%, 42.9%, 32.7%, and 42.9%, respectively. We found that GRP concentration was associated with worsening hypoxemia (mild 31.9, mod. 42.7, severe 79.0 ng/ml; p=0.014), requirement for mechanical ventilation (No 40.1, Yes 61.5 ng/ml; p=0.063), and need for VV-ECMO (No 48.6, Yes 93.1 ng/ml; p=0.026). HMGB1 concentration was associated with worsening hypoxemia (mild 24.4, mod. 55.1, severe 40.9 ng/ml; p=0.021) but did not correlate with other outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): GRP and HMGB1 have been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, such as influenza, and ARDS in animal models and human. Our results suggest that these DAMPs maybe associated with severity of disease in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Future studies should elucidate the specific cellular and biochemical pathways implicated in pathogenesis of ARDS, identify whether HMGB1 and GRP could be potential biomarkers for severe illness outcomes, and test novel anti-HMGB1 and GRP therapeutics in ARDS.

AB  - SESSION TITLE: Pulmonary Manifestations of Systemic Disease Case Posters SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/19/2022 12:45 pm - 01:45 pm INTRODUCTION: ALK+ histiocytosis is a rare histiocytic neoplasm cytogenetically defined by translocation involving the ALK locus. Castleman disease (CD) is a heterogenous group of lymphoproliferative disorders with the unicentric form localized to one area of the body. Although CD has been associated with histiocytic neoplasms, its co-recurrence with ALK+ histiocytosis has not been reported. Here we present a rare case of unicentric CD adjacent to pulmonary ALK+ histiocytosis. CASE PRESENTATION: 28-year-old male born prematurely with bronchopulmonary dysplasia initially presented with cough. Chest x-ray noted a 3 cm right peri-hilar nodule. Follow-up computed tomography confirmed a right lower lobe mass and bulky right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy; these were metabolically active on positron emission tomography. Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of the hilar mass and subcarinal lymph node was non-diagnostic. The patient subsequently underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical biopsy of the hilar mass. This specimen was reviewed at multiple centers with concern for possible spindle cell neoplasm. He ultimately underwent right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy, and resection of subcarinal lymph node. Pathology from the subcarinal node was consistent with hyaline vascular Castleman disease and testing for human herpesvirus 8 was negative. Further review of tissue from the hilar mass again suggested a spindle cell neoplasm with prominent chronic inflammatory cells. The spindle cells had positive immunoreactivity to CD68, CD163, CD14, CD13 and CD11c and lacked expression of Langerin, S100 and BRAF VE. While ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization testing was initially negative, a sarcoma fusion panel by next-generation sequencing detected EML4-ALK fusion. The patient had no evidence of disease recurrence on initial post-operative imaging. DISCUSSION: This represents a rare case of a lung mass due to ALK+ histiocytosis, a distinct entity associated with EML4-ALK fusion. The lack of immunoreactivity to Langerin, S100 and absence of BRAF V600E mutation helps exclude other histiocytic neoplasms including Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease. Concurrent presentation with CD has not been previously reported. Very little is known regarding underlying pathophysiological link between these two diseases. Surgical resection of unicentric CD is a standard treatment. ALK+ histiocytosis may be treated with resection and ALK inhibitors represent an alternative for systematic treatment. CONCLUSION(S): ALK+ histiocytosis is an emerging entity that is important to consider on the differential diagnosis of lung mass. The co-occurrence of unicentric CD raises the possibility that these two rare conditions may be linked.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a common pathology of premature newborns caused by oxidative stress and mechanical ventilation, resulting in hypoalveolization and impaired angiogenesis. It can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension (HTP-DBP) with excess mortality. Celastrol has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Objective(s): So, we addressed its potential therapeutic interest in HTP-DBP. Method(s): Different concentrations of celastrol were used in a murine model of hyperoxic HTP-DBP (14 days with 90% O2) and we evaluated hemodynamic parameters with echocardiography and lung remodeling with histological methods. Pulmonary arterial (PA) reactivity was addressed with myograph. Cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2 + i) response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) was evaluated in human fetal PA smooth muscle cells (fPASMC) with spectrophotometry in normoxic (21% O2) and hyperoxic conditions (48 h with 60% O2). Inflammation was addressed with IL6 ELISA assay in fPASMC. Result(s): Celastrol reduces mortality at doses of 1 and 0.5 mg/kg/d compared to the hyperoxic control group. At 1 mg/kg/d, it normalizes PAAT (PA acceleration time) (P < 0.001) and reduces vascular hyperreactivity to phenylephrine and ET-1 (P < 0.001) with no effect on the alteration of the response to acetylcholine induced by hyperoxia. At doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/d, it decreases right heart hypertrophy and vascular remodeling (wall thickness) but has no effect on alveolization and vascular density (vWF staining). Finally, although celastrol (0.1 and 0.3 muM) decreases the increased Ca2 + i response to ET-1 in hyperoxia in fPASMC, expression of ET-1 receptors (Western blotting and qPCR for ET-A and ET-B) was unchanged. However, celastrol 0.5 muM decreases ET-1 concentration measured with an ELISA assay in human umbilical arterial endothelial cells. An increased concentration of IL6 was also observed in fPASMC in hyperoxia and was decreased by celastrol 0.5 muM. Conclusion(s): Celastrol has a preventive dose-dependent effect on some hallmarks of HTP induced by hyperoxia and could thus be considered as an interesting new potential therapeutic option for HTP-DBP.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Background: Neonatal intubations have been shown to have frequent complications, including severe desaturation <60%. Studies have examined strategies to reduce complications, but no studies have examined the association of complicated intubations with adverse long-term outcomes in the neonatal population. The objective was to evaluate the association between desaturation <60% (severe desaturation) during intubation and total number of intubation attempts in the first week of life in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with adverse long-term outcomes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and periventricular/intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or 4 (severe PIVH). Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed on infants less than 1500 grams (VLBW) who were intubated in the neonatal intensive care unit during the first week of life between January 2017 and July 2020. Descriptive tables were generated for two outcomes including BPD and PIVH. Multivariable logistic regression was then performed for each outcome including significant predictors that differed between groups with a p-value of <0.2. Result(s): A total of 146 patients were included. Patients with BPD and PIVH had a lower gestational age, and patients with BPD also had a lower birth weight. Patients who developed BPD had a greater number of intubation attempts in the first week of life (4 vs. 3, P<0.001). In a multivariable logistic regression controlling for confounding variables, the odds of developing BPD were higher for patients with an increased cumulative number of intubation attempts in the first week of life (OR=1.29, CI 1.03-1.62, P=0.029). Post-hoc analyses to better determine the relationship between BPD and intubations revealed an increased number of intubation encounters in the first week of life was associated with increased odds of developing BPD (OR=2.20, CI 1.04-4.82, P=0.043). In this model, desaturation <60% in any intubation in the first week of life was also associated with increased odds of BPD (OR=2.35, CI 1.02-5.63, P=0.048). However, BPD development was not affected by the average number of intubation attempts per encounter (OR =1.06, CI 0.85-1.42, P=0.7). When including intubation encounters in the model, desaturation <60% during intubation in the first week of life was associated with increased odds of developing BPD (OR=2.35, CI 1.02-5.63, P=0.048). Conclusion(s): The odds of developing BPD for VLBW infants are higher with more intubation attempts and intubation encounters during intubation in the first week of life. There is a possible association between severe desaturation and BPD, however additional studies are needed to evaluate this relationship as it was only detected in post-hoc analyses. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms of the relationship between complicated intubations and the development of BPD.

UR  - http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed23&NEWS=N&AN=638786510
AB  - Background: Hyperoxia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Hyperoxia stimulates the inflammasome pathway which leads to activation of gasdermin D (GSDMD), a key executor of inflammatory cell death, also known as pyroptosis. Our research has shown that inhibition of GSDMD activation attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal mice and recently obtained novel preliminary data shows that GSDMD is also activated in the retinas of neonatal mice. This suggests a critical role of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of BPD and ROP, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our objective was to determine whether GSDMD gene knockout (KO) affects hyperoxia-induced lung and retina injury in neonatal mice. Method(s): We utilized GSDMD KO mice and both hyperoxiainduced neonatal lung injury and ROP models. For the lung injury model, newborn GSDMD KO mice and their wildtype (WT) littermates were randomized to room air (RA, 21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 1 to P14. Alveolarization was determined by mean linear intercept (MLI). Vascular development and vascular remodeling were assessed by vascular density (VD) and muscularized vessels on vWF and alphaSMA double immunofluorescence-staining. Lung inflammation was assessed by macrophage staining. Ki67 immunofluorescence and DAPI nuclear staining was used to determine cell proliferation index and total cell count. TUNEL assay was performed to quantify cell apoptotic index. For the retinopathy model, newborn GSDMD KO mice and their WT littermates were randomized to RA or hyperoxia (75% O2) from P7 to P12, then RA until P17. Vascularization was determined using isolectin immunostaining and quantification of avascular and neovascular area. Retinal thickness was determined by H&E staining and quantification of tissue thickness. The data are presented as Mean+/-SD and analyzed by ANOVA. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Hyperoxiaexposed WT mice (WT+O2) had decreased alveolarization, reduced vascular density and increased vascular remodeling, increased macrophage infiltration, decreased cell proliferation and total cell counts as well as increased apoptotic cells compared to RA-exposed WT mice (WT+RA). While RA-exposed KO mice (KO+RA) behaved similarly to WT+RA mice, hyperoxiaexposed KO mice (KO+O2) had improved alveolarization, vascular development and vascular remodeling, increased cell proliferation and total cell count as well as reduced apoptotic cells compared to WT+O2 mice. WT+O2 mice had increased vasoobliteration and neovascularization, and thinning of some retinal layers. Conversely, KO+O2 mice had improved retinal vascularization and decreased retinal thinning compared to WT+O2 mice. Conclusion(s): GSDMD gene KO prevents hyperoxiainduced lung and retina injury in neonatal mouse models. This suggests that GSDMD plays a pathogenic role in both BPD and ROP and that targeting GSDMD may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of BPD and ROP in preterm infants.

AB  - The yield of early postnatal cardiac phenotype in predicting adverse outcomes [mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH)] in preterm newborns is unknown. We sought to describe the association between early echocardiographic (ECHO) parameters and the composite outcomes of death or severe BPD, as well as death or BPD-PH. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants <29 weeks born between 2015 and 2019. Included were infants with an available ECHO performed for clinical indications <=21 days after birth. We excluded major genetic/congenital anomalies, and those admitted >24 h postnatally. ECHOs were analyzed by an expert blinded to outcomes. Severe BPD was defined as any ventilation or oxygen <=30% at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). PH (evaluated at 36 weeks PMA) was defined as a systolic pulmonary pressure <=40 mmHg or a left ventricular (LV) eccentricity index (EI) <= 1.3. Among 176 infants, death/severe BPD occurred in 31(18%). Those with death/severe BPD had lower birth weight (745 +/- 227 vs 852 +/- 211 grams, p =.01) and were more frequently exposed to maternal hypertension, invasive ventilation, late onset sepsis, inotropes and/or postnatal steroids. ECHOs in infants with death/severe BPD demonstrated lower right ventricular (RV) function and LV function. While PDA size and LV output were similar, those with death/severe BPD had increased incidence of flat/bowing septum. Infants with death/PH at 36 weeks (n = 59 combined; n = 42 PH), had an increased EI (1.35 +/- 0.20 vs 1.26 +/- 0.19, p =.02), and frequency of flat/bowing septum (18/53[34%] vs 20/106[19%], p =.048) on early ECHO. Logistic regression adjustment revealed that EI and RV/LV diameter ratio were associated with death/PH. In conclusion, indices of increased pulmonary pressure and altered ventricular function within 21 days after birth were associated with adverse outcomes in extremely premature infants. Studies should evaluate the impact of interventions addressing early cardiac markers on these outcomes.

AB  - Sixty years ago, the Ciba Foundation organized a symposium in which distinguished scientists (mostly Anglo-Saxon males, including several Nobel prize winners) discussed about how humans could "use the immense creative opportunities for a happier and healthier world" generated by modern biology. Browsing today the book that summarized the symposium (unsurprisingly called "Man and his Future"), the reader must conclude that attempting to foresee the future is a foolhardy enterprise. As humans, we are simply too ignorant, too stuck in the preoccupations and insights of the present and it is thus impossible for even the most enlightened scholars to predict at any time what are unimaginable future developments. Inevitably, fundamental new trends will be missed. When asked about the future of pediatric pulmonology, and based on the above considerations, I decided to provide a very personal framework for a discussion, heavily influenced and even biased by my own current concerns and endeavors. I will limit myself to the next 20-30 years. Anything beyond that is science fiction. In some of the points I will make, I will be purposely controversial. In most, I will stress issues for which we do not have a solution today, with the hope that we will have advances in the future. A premise for these disquisitions is my own wish to create the opportunity for a better life for all children. In this, I am not very different from the much more distinguished scholars that preceded me six decades ago in the Ciba symposium. I am not fond, however, of buoyant, overly optimistic predictions. The challenges we have in front of us require overcoming profound and entrenched biological, social, or equity barriers that may be beyond human capacities to surpass in the foreseeable future. 1. The future of prevention. An important insight of the last decades has been the discovery that the developmental pathways that underlie health and disease are determined by complex and often subtle gene-environment interactions. The two most common chronic respiratory diseases, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have their roots in early life, and this raises the hope that in the future, a major task of pediatric pulmonary medicine will be to identify children at risk and be able manipulate the environment or provide medicines according to the readily usable prediction algorithms. In one of the most spectacularly successful applications of this approach in any area of medicine, less than two CF carriers of at least one copy of the G551D-CFTR mutation had to be treated with Ivacaftor to induce a 5% change in FEV1. In other words, almost everybody responded (1). There is good reason to believe that similar advances in more frequent forms of CF will allow patients long-term survival rates that were simply unimaginable just 10 years ago. I also expect that the path opened by CF will derive in similar advances for many of the rare monogenic diseases causing respiratory problems that are part of our practice today. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to elicit in complex diseases the type of precision response that can be obtained when treating a monogenic disease with a drug tailored to the specific molecular derangement that causes it. In asthma for example, biologics have markedly improved the lives of many patients, but we still do not have a way to know with any certainty which patient will respond to which monoclonal antibody. I am sure there will be progress, but the initial promise (or overpromise) for the whole field of personalized (or precision) will be hard to fulfill for any disease in which environmental factors alter complex growth trajectories at specific times during the lifespan. Much more appealing are, at least to me, potential prevention strategies that are based on accurate description of "natural experiments" in which specific populations are found to be protected or at higher risk for a disease. The explosion of new insights about the pathogenesis of complex diseases that has come from observations of decreased incidence of asthma and allergies in rural communities is a good example of such natural experiments. The whole field of microbiome sciences got a major boost from those observations, and it is now well established that interactions between microbes and the innate and adaptive immune systems, are critical determinants of the risk for many chronic illnesses that involve abnormal immune responses to environmental stimuli including asthma and chronic lung disease. I expect that in the next decades we will see major development in the use of bacteria and their products to prevent these conditions. 2. The future of technology. In the decades since I started training in medicine and science, the explosion of new technologies has been exhilarating and at time overwhelming. It is hard to keep up for any practitioner and, contrary to what happened at my beginnings, increasingly interpretation of results is being left to specialists. One trend seems unmistakable: diagnostic and therapeutic interventions tend to become less invasive with time. Diagnoses that required surgical biopsies are now obtained with targeted imaging using nanotechnologies or with minimally invasive procedures. Major surgeries that required days of recovery are now performed thoracoscopically. Panels of protein biomarkers and RNA signatures obtained from blood or accessible secretions are becoming available that can replace cultures and the need to obtain samples invasively. Non-radiating technologies now being developed in animal models carry the promise of providing images of tissues that will compete with those obtained from direct vision. This trend will continue inexorably. With time, once the new techniques are established, costs will decrease. I have no doubt that our diagnostic and therapeutic tools will markedly enhance our capacity for early diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases in the next 20 years. Bronchoscopy has been the procedure that has almost defined pediatric pulmonology since its inception. Given the above developments, I do not think that 30 years from now, diagnostic pediatric bronchoscopy will be the procedure of choice for most of its current indications. However, I do believe that interventional flexible bronchoscopy will greatly expand its usefulness, as it has in adult practice. As the ERS workforce has stated(2), today's indications for use of this technology are limited, and this has constrained the training experience for pediatric bronchoscopists. The experience has been that, once a technology becomes more extensively used, new applications that were not imagined before can be imagined and implemented. Pediatric pulmonologists need to get ready for that new era by collaborating with adult pulmonologists that have been using these procedures for decades. 3. Defeating inequities and discrimination: infectious disease in the developing world, racism and discrimination everywhere. Pediatric pulmonology cannot be an aseptic discipline. We often treat diseases that preferentially affect the poor, children that are discriminated or suffer inequities. Two million children die of respiratory illnesses in developing countries and of those, over 200,000 die of tuberculosis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Not all is bad news: deaths due to tuberculosis decreased between 2000 and 2020, although among African countries, trends have varied and mortality has increased in some (https://www.who.int/teams/globaltuberculosis- programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2021/ disease-burden/mortality). This shows that tackling with respiratory illnesses and tuberculosis is possible. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, enormous assets were dedicated to finding vaccines and treatments, and the ones that were developed proved essential to prevent millions of deaths. It is time to put all needed resources to defeat childhood tuberculosis in the next 20 years. Equally, racism and discrimination cause severe early adversity and predispose for chronic respiratory diseases. I do believe that pressure is increasing and that these scourges will sooner or later be, if not defeated, limited in their effects on the health and life of our children. Addressing inequities should be a major goal of pediatric pulmonologists worldwide. 4. The future of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Preterm infants are exposed to a higher risk of developing Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD) with an increased bone fragility, a higher fracture risk and a long-term reduced linear growth and childhood height. Monitoring bone growth has become mandatory in neonatology. Several risk factors have been identified among the population of extremely low birth weight infants, but we still do not know which is the real incidence of MBD since its evaluation is not routinely performed worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of MBD in preterm infants and in those suffering from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)., METHODS: Prospective evaluation of patients who developed BPD (BPD group) versus infants who did not develop it (no-BPD group). We examined, in preterms <1.250 g, the metacarpus bone transmission time (mc-BTT) at birth, 21 days and 36 weeks of gestational age (GA) together with biochemical markers of bone status., RESULTS: We included 135 patients, 55 with BPD. BPD patients received less total proteins in the first two weeks and less energy in the first month of life (p = 0.007 and p < 0.001 respectively). BPD patients had a worse growth velocity at two weeks of age (12.36 +/- 7.86 vs 16.59 +/- 7.05 g/kg/day, p = 0.001). At 21 days, BPD patients had lower phosphatemia (1.65 +/- 0.031 mmol/L vs 1.85 +/- 0.034 mmol/L, p = 0.007) and higher alkaline phosphatase levels (411.62 +/- 135.31 IU/l vs 338.98 +/- 102.20 IU/l, p = 0.005). BPD patients had significantly worse mc-BTT at 36 weeks GA (0.45 +/- 0.06 vs 0.50 +/- 0.08 musec, p < 0.001) and a higher incidence of MBD (60% vs 34%; p = 0.012)., CONCLUSIONS: BPD infants are a special subset of patients among preterms who receive, in the first month of life, a lower energy intake than patients without BPD. BPD patients have a suboptimal bone growth and a higher incidence of MBD. Monitoring growth, bone status and optimizing nutritional intakes need to be further improved in preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - Objectives and Study: There is increasing scientific evidence around the key role of microbiota acquisition on present and future health specially in preterm neonates. Our aim was to investigate the preterm microbiota colonization in order to assess the possible effect of the postnatal antibiotic treatment course on gut microbial ecosystem assembly. Method(s): A prospective, observational unicentric cohort study including consecutively admitted preterm infant (n=49) born at <=34 weeks.Gut microbiota profile was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in fecal samples collected at birth, 7 days, 1 and 2 months of life. Maternal age, delivery mode, anthropometrical data, feeding regime, and morbidity outcomes were recorded. Preterm infants were stratified according to the antibiotic treatment course (less or more than 72h). To investigate the in vitro biological effect of specific preterm microbiota on the inflammatory NF-kappaB pathway activation, NF-kappaB-HT-29-reporter cells and HEK-TRL4 were exposed to fecal supernatant at birth and 2 months of life. Result(s): Delivery mode showed an impact on the overall preterm microbial composition and the influence was also observed at 15 (R-square=0.069, p=0.049) and 30 (R-square=0.085, p=0.009) days of life. The multivariate analysis (constrained correspondence analysis-CCA-) and Adonis test revealed differences in beta-diversity of the microbial communities in neonatal gut across this period according to collection time point (p=0.001). At genus level, a neonate born by C-section harboured higher Enterobacter, Clostridium-sensuicto and Blautia compared to vaginal birth-neonates. Antibiotic course had an impact on gut microbial composition and diversity. Preterm infants that received a long-course antibiotic treatment showed lower microbial richness (p=0.005) and diversity (p=0.007), higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria phylum (p=<0.001, median=72.6 vs. 14.7%, long-and short-term, respectively) and lower proportion of Actinobacteria phylum (p=0.027, median=0.58 vs. 25.7%, long-and short-term, respectively). In order to assess the impact of those changes, fecal supernatant were exposed to NFkB reporter cell lines. C-section preterm fecal extract with longer duration of antibiotic treatment showed higher NF-kappaB activation from birth to 60d (p=0.007) which can be explained partially by TLR4 activation. In addition, higher inflammation activation via TLR4 was associated to higher Klebsiella (rho=0.579, p=0.011) and a tendency towards Enterobacter (rho=0.412, p=0.079) genus at 60days of life while no association was identified at birth. In addition, we identified in our cohort higher morbidity in preterm infants with >72h antibiotic course including higher rates bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (p=0.041) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (p=0.011) in infants from the long-course treatment group. However, the incidence of disorders of central nervous system (CNS) showed no differences among both groups (p=0.149). Conclusion(s): Prolong antibiotic treatment strongly affects the pattern of microbiota acquisition. Antibiotics course can change the microbial developmental trajectory during a critical time favouring a pro-inflammatory status linked to higher risk of morbidity.

AB  - Objectives and Study: In the neonatal period, preterm infants show low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and this may further be exacerbated by inflammation. Clinical IGF-1 supplementation studies are ongoing, based on negative associations between IGF-1 levels and a series of morbidities. However, effects of IGF-1 on the developing neonatal immune system are largely unknown. We hypothesized that circulating IGF-1 levels would associate with plasma immune markers in preterm infants and that IGF-1 supplementation influences immune system development in preterm pigs, used as a model for preterm infants. Method(s): Plasma levels of IGF-1, cytokines and chemokines were measured in the first four weeks of life in very preterm infants (n=232, NCT03537365 randomized trial, mean gestational age 29 weeks). In preterm pigs (90% gestation, reared for 19 days), immune development was compared between IGF-1 supplemented (2.25 mg/kg/day, from day 1 of life) and control animals. To further assess immune function, whole blood was challenged in vitro with live Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (PMA), with or without further addition of IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) to evaluate cytokine production and leucocyte gene expression. Result(s): In preterm infants, plasma IGF-1 levels across the neonatal period were positively correlated with levels of macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 and negatively correlated with interleukin 6 (MCP-1, IL-6, both pro-inflammatory factors). Preterm pigs treated with IGF-1 showed slower increases in blood leucocyte counts, with increased spleen size, and higher levels of immature neutrophils, without effects on neutrophil phagocytic function. In the second week of life, IGF-1 treated pigs showed reduced plasma Interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels and reduced Interleukin 2 (IL-2 responses to PMA stimulation. By day 19 the reduced IL-2 responses remained, together with reduced plasma levels of interferon gamma (IFNgamma). In vitro, addition of IGF-1 further reduced the IL-2 and IFNgamma responses to PMA, but improved the IL-10 response to SE. Meanwhile, basal expression of several immune-related genes (IFNG, TNFA, IL10, IL17), as well as endogenous expression of IGF1, was reduced in blood leucocytes of IGF-1 treated animals. Conclusion(s): In preterm infants, only one pro-inflammatory marker, IL-6, inversely correlated with IGF-1 levels and some may show positive correlations (MCP-1), indicating that the relation between circulating IGF-1 and systemic immunity development is highly complex. Supplementation of IGF-1 to preterm pigs had marginal effects on leucocyte pools but tended to reduce Th1 and increase Th2 blood cytokine responses. Potentially this may mediate protective effects against common hyperinflammatory conditions in preterm infants (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis) but could reduce their immune responses against intracellular pathogens.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the significance of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in non-invasively obtained amniotic fluid predicting neonatal respiratory outcomes in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Method(s): A prospective cohort study was performed in Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, and was funded by Research Council of Lithuania. Amniotic fluid was obtained vaginally less than 48 hours before delivery from 144 women with PPROM at 22-34 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid EGF concentrations were determined by the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. The newborn evaluation with the follow-up assessments until discharge was conducted after delivery. The following outcomes were included: severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), surfactant need, a duration of respiratory support, a need for mechanical ventilation (MV), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) according to umbilical cord blood IL-6 level >11ng/ml and/or histological funisitis. The data were analyzed using R software version R-4.0.5. Result(s): Median amniotic fluid EGF concentrations were lower in neonates with severe RDS, surfactant need, longer duration of respiratory support, MV, BPD than in neonates without these outcomes (p<0,007). There was no significant difference in EGF concentrations between infants with FIRS and without FIRS. The amniotic fluid EGF cut-off concentration <=35ng/ml significantly predicted the likelihood of respiratory outcomes: severe RDS (odds ratio (OR), 3.2; 95% CI, 1.12-8.91), respiratory support for >4 days (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.02-14.6), need of surfactant (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.72-19.91), MV (OR, 4.2; 95%CI, 1.12-8.90), BPD (OR, 6.6; 95%CI, 1.98-22.7). Conclusion(s): EGF in non-invasively collected amniotic fluid is reliable predictor for respiratory neonatal outcomes in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes before 34 weeks of gestation. The noninvasive amniotic fluid analysis could be an alternative to invasive amniocentesis.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Introduction: The main cause of congenital pathologies of the bronchopulmonary system in children is disorders during initiation and differentiation of the respiratory tract both at the organ (congenital malformations (CM)) and tissue (bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) levels. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular MMP-12 (metalloelastase, macrophage elastase), play a decisive role in the formation and development of physiological processes (morphogenesis, resorption and tissue remodeling, migration, adhesion, differentiation and proliferation of cells). The MMP-12 gene code reading is under control of growth factors such as the cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6. Thus the study seems relevant. Material(s) and Method(s): 126 children were examined. 2 randomized groups by sex, age (up to 3 years) were formed: 72 people with BPD, 54 patients with CM (informed parental consent provided). The diagnosis was made according to generally accepted clinical and laboratory criteria. Genotyping of MMP-12 (A82G), TNF-alpha (G308A), and IL-6 (C174G) was performed by PCR (CFX-96 Bio rad, USA). Results and discussion: A significant difference was revealed in the frequency of MMP-12 (A82G) polymorphisms. Normal homozygous variants were noted in 93.1% of cases in children with BPD and in 65.5% with CM (p=0.0047). Heterozygous alleles of MMP-12 (p=0.035) are found 3.5 times more often (24.1%) in children with CM than with BPD (6.9%). Mutant homozygous variants are found in 10.3% of patients (p=0.038). The study of cytokine gene polymorphisms affecting the expression of MMP-12 revealed a slight increase in the frequency of the G/G TNF-alpha (86.1%) and C/C IL-6 (50.0%) alleles in CM cases compared with those in the BPD group (77.1% and 46.5%, respectively).It also revealed heterozygous polymorphisms variants of TNF -alpha G/A (13.9%), C/G IL-6 (41.2%) with CM and TNF-alpha G/A (12.5%), C/G IL-6 (32.6%) with BPD. The features of genotyping of immune control factors in BPD were determined: A/A TNF-alpha - 10.4% and G/G IL-6 - 20.9%. In case of CM, the frequency corresponded to A/A TNF-alpha - 0% (p=0.023), G/G IL-6 - 8.8% (p=0.053), which is 2.4 times lower than the level of occurrence in BPD. Conclusion(s): If CM arises at earlier stages of the respiratory system formation, MMP-12 (A82G) gene is mutated, affecting the main components of the connective tissue matrix. If BPD is a result of lung tissue remodeling and complex biochemical, structural imbalance in the later period of ontogenesis, mutations in the genes of signaling molecules (TNF-alpha G308A, IL-6 C174G) that control the expression of MMP-12 (A82G) occur.

AB  - Gene Regulatory Networks are key to understanding the developmental processes with integrated details and mechanistic perspective. The disruption of any gene on the developmental GRN would impair the normal development and then cause disease. There are diseases with their causes as simple as single gene disorders while a lot of them as complex as multi-factorial such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants hallmarked with immature and reduced alveolarization. In recent clinical trials, therapy with recombinant human insulin growth factor 1 (rhIGF1) protein has shown initial promises and then limitations for BPD prevention and treatment. One impediment is that the function of IGF1 signaling for alveologenesis has not been systematically characterized. Here, we generate a transgenic mouse exhibiting mild severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling specifically in alveolar myofibroblast (AMF) cells at the onset of alveologenesis. With data collected from a list of integrated approaches including gene expression assay, in vivo and in vitro perturbation, and bioinformatics, we constructed the Igf1 signaling GRN behind this mouse model of BPD. The GRN constructed provides a bird view of all genes downstream of Igf1 signaling and a mechanistic view of how the effect of the IGF1 signaling is transduced from AMF cells to their neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with Wnt5a and Fgf10 signaling as the bridge. The block of Wnt5a signaling was confirmed to cause BPD lung as seen in Igf1r BPD mouse. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD. A new strategy for a better efficacy on BPD calls for the examination of all regulators involved and then the intervention on those impaired, which is now becoming feasible with our constructed GRN on hand.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and asthma are two distinct clinical diagnoses with similar symptomatology and lung function abnormalities. Because of the different underlying pathophysiologic processes children with BPD have been more recently identified as having "asthma-like" symptoms. We aimed to characterize the differences in respiratory health outcomes among school age children with diagnosis of BPD, asthma, or BPD and asthma based on symptoms, asthma control test (ACT) scores, and lung function. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional descriptive comparative study utilizing data from the baseline characterization visit of 3 prospective clinical research studies. We included children from the School Inner-City Asthma (SICAS-1 and SICAS-2) and the Air, Environment, and Respiratory Outcomes in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (AERO-BPD) cohorts (n=643). Diagnostic groups were classified as asthma only (n=598), BPD only (n=19), or asthma and BPD (n=26). Differences between groups were assessed by unadjusted generalized linear models for outcomes of spirometry, bronchodilator response, ACT score and maximum number of days with asthma symptoms over a 2-week recall. To assess the overall difference in outcomes across diagnostic groups, we tested for the equality of three slopes using a two degrees of freedom F-test. An F-test with a p-value <0.05 was followed with Tukey-Kramer adjusted pairwise comparisons between individual diagnostic groups. Result(s): There was a significant difference among the groups for FEV1% predicted (p=0.0023) and FEV1/FVC ratio (p<0.0001) without significant distinction between groups for symptom days in the prior 2 weeks or bronchodilator responsiveness (Table 1). In pairwise comparisons, the Asthma Only group had greater FEV1% predicted compared to the BPD Only group (mean difference 14.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7%, 27.3% predicted). The degree of obstruction measured by FEV1/FVC ratio was significantly greater (lower FEV1/FVC%) in the Asthma & BPD (mean difference 11%, 95% CI 6.4%, 15.7%) and BPD Only group (mean difference 6.8%, 95% CI 1.3%, 12.2%) compared to Asthma Only, and a nominal, nonsignificant, difference between Asthma & BPD and BPD only. Notably, bronchodilator response was similar across all three groups. Despite the differences in lung function, there were no statistically significant differences between individual groups for asthma symptom days and no clinically meaningful differences in ACT score. Conclusion(s): Children with BPD, with and without concurrent asthma, are at higher risk for airflow obstruction than children with asthma, despite similar symptom scores. Children with BPD and concurrent asthma may have the greatest risk. (Table Presented).

AB  - Rationale: In premature infants, airway colonization with gram-negative bacteria is associated with development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease characterized by impaired alveolarization and dysmorphic vasculature. Inflammation precedes BPD development and persists later during disease progression. We have shown that in immature mice chronic airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases inflammation and results in hypoalveolarization. We also demonstrated LPS increased the population of IL-17a-producing gamma-delta (gammaDELTA) T cells (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2020;201:A2779). The natural-killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor mediates activation and IL-17a production in gammaDELTA T cells and other immune cells by binding to cell stress molecules. LPS induces DNA damage and increases the expression of NKG2D ligands, including retinoic acid early inducible-1 (Rae-1), murine ULBP-like transcript 1 (MULT-1), and others. We hypothesized that NKG2D mediates neonatal LPS exposureinduced pulmonary immunopathology. Method(s): Immature C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with 3ug/10ul of LPS from E. coli O26:B6 or 10ul of PBS intranasally on day of life 3, 5, 7, and 10. Selected mice were treated with neutralizing antibody against NKG2D or control IgG intraperitoneally. Lung immune cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. Alveolar growth was assessed by lung morphometry. Result(s): LPS induced whole lung mRNA expression of NKG2D and the expression of NKG2D ligands and downstream effectors, including Rae-1, MULT-1, beta2-microglobulin, p53, Granzyme B, as well as proinflammatory cytokines Il-17a, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta and Ccl2. NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T cells, NK cells, NKT cells and CD8+ T cells were present in the lung after LPS. LPS increased per cell NKG2D expression in gammaDELTA T cells, NK cells and NKT cells. After repeated LPS exposure, NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T cells were the most expanded NKG2D+ population (10 times more than control). LPS stimulated Granzyme B expression in NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T, NK and NKT cells. Anti-NKG2D treatment attenuated the effect of LPS on total gammaDELTA T cell and Granzyme B+ NKG2D+ gammaDELTA T cell numbers. Anti-NKG2D treatment also blocked the effect of LPS on beta2-microglobulin, NKG2D, Granzyme B, Il-17a, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta and Ccl2 mRNA expression. Finally, anti-NKG2D treatment reduced immune cell infiltration and attenuated hypoalveolarization induced by LPS. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate a central role for activated NKG2D signaling in neonatal LPS-induced lung injury. Future studies will determine the role of individual NKG2D+ cells, NKG2D ligands and effectors in early-life endotoxin-induced pulmonary immunopathology and in BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Diseases that distort the lung structure, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung fibrosis are characterized by disrupted alveolar morphology. Understanding the process of lung alveolarization might help to develop new therapeutic strategies for these diseases. Cells expressing adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP), known as lipofibroblasts, have been demonstrated to impact lung alveolarization: Rationale: The present study aims to characterize the cell-lineage of ADRP positive cells (ADRPlin) by elucidating the molecular signature and contribution to mouse lung cell populations during alveolarization. Method(s): Using a Plin2tm1.1(creERT-2)/mort/+; Gt(Rosa)mtmg/+ transgenic mouse model ADRP-positive (ADRP+) cells were labeled at postnatal day (P) 1 by a single tamoxifen intraperitoneal injection. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) was performed on 8791 and 9095 ADRP-lineaged (ADRPlin) cells respectively from P7 and P14 mouse lungs. High-quality imaging was carried out on 150 mum sections from P7 and P14 mouse lungs using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Result(s): Using sc-RNAseq seven major cell clusters were identified. These clusters of the ADRPlin mainly covered epithelial as well as mesenchymal and vascular cell populations during late lung development. High-quality imaging confirmed cell type features of identified cell clusters. Moreover, two subpopulations of lipofibroblasts were identified: ADRP-high expressing and Tcf21-high expressing mesenchymal lipofibroblasts. Conclusion(s): Exploring the molecular signature of the ADRPlin different cell populations were identified during alveolarization. Further in silico analyses will give insights into possible functions and characteristics of identified cell clones. Comparing the nature of the two different identified lipofibroblast subpopulations might contribute to a better understanding and better targeting of lipofibroblasts during alveolarization.

AB  - RATIONALE: Alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells occupy nearly 95% of the alveolar surface area and are critical for establishing efficient gas exchange function in the mature lung. AT1 cells arise from progenitors specified during embryonic stages and alveolar epithelial progenitors expressing surfactant protein C (Sftpc) during postnatal and adult stages. Our previous study demonstrated that saccular stage AT1 cell differentiation is dependent on Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, that plays essential roles in many aspects of cellular activities. Both aberrant activation and inactivation of Wnt5a have been observed in different lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) indicating sophisticated key roles of Wnt5a signaling in the lung. To further investigate the roles of Wnt5a in lung development especially in AT1 cell differentiation, we characterized embryonic and neonatal lungs of Wnt5a gain-of-function models. METHOD(S): To investigate the roles of Wnt5a in alveologenesis, we generated a regulable Wnt5a gain-of-function model, Rosa26-rtTA;tetO-Wnt5a (Wnt5aRosa), which expresses mouse Wnt5a upon administration of doxycycline at postnatal days 4 and 5 (P4 and P5). We characterized the impact of Wnt5a gain-of-function on cell differentiation and proliferation as well as canonical Wnt activity at P7 by quantitative RT-PCR, FACS, and immunostaining. We also determined the effects of Wnt5a gain-of-function on epithelial progenitors during the embryonic stage by characterizing a Sftpc- Wnt5a transgenic model. Furthermore, we examined the impact of WNT5a on human embryonic lung epithelial progenitors in organoid cultures. RESULT(S): Postnatal Wnt5a gain-of-function disrupted alveologenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation. By FACS, we identified 2 subpopulations of Sftpc-positive cells with distinct levels of Sftpc. Interestingly, levels of AT1 cell markers were increased in both subpopulations while AT2 cell markers were decreased in the Sftpc-low subpopulation in the Wnt5aRosa lungs compared to control lungs. In addition, our study revealed that decreased AT2 gene expression was associated with down-regulation of canonical Wnt signaling. The pro-AT1 and anti-AT2 regulatory functions of Wnt5a were also observed in embryonic stage Sftpc-Wnt5a lungs. Furthermore, we found that WNT5a promotes expression of AT1 cell markers in human lung epithelial progenitors. CONCLUSION(S): Our results clearly demonstrate the intricate role of Wnt5a as a bimodal, key regulator of alveolar epithelial cell differentiation. The Wnt5a anti- AT2 regulatory pathway is associated with suppressing canonical Wnt signaling. Importantly, the Wnt5a pro-AT1 regulatory pathway is evolutionarily conserved between mouse and human and may act independent of canonical Wnt signaling.

AB  - RATIONALE: Tracheal aspirate (TA) is non-invasive biofluid, easily obtained in intubated preterm infants. Its transcriptomic expression has been studied in complications of prematurity including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (1). However, TAs can be difficult to obtain in non-intubated infants. This study examines saliva as non-invasive source for microRNAs (miRNA) analysis in the preterm infants at risk for BPD. METHODS : This cross-sectional study included six extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks gestation), who later were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate BPD. TAs were obtained at multiple time points along with saliva using DNA Genotek saliva collection swabs within 30 days of delivery. Exosomes were isolated from TAs samples using ExoQuick reagent and total RNAs were extracted, and all circulating RNAs were extracted from saliva samples using Quick-RNA Microprep (Zymo Research). Small RNA-sequencing libraries were prepared from using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit (QIAGEN), per manufacturer instructions (2). The resulting multiplexed high-throughput sequencing data was mapped and UMI analysis conducted via the GeneGlobe Data Analysis Center (QIAGEN). The DESeq2 R package (REF) was used to identify miRNA features with similar expression patterns between paired TA and saliva samples (which might serve as non-invasive markers of BPD). Similarly expressed miRNAs were those with adjusted p-value > 0.1 (calculated by the Benjamini-Hochberg method) and fold change < 2. The list of similarly expressed small RNAs was analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for functional enrichment (3). RESULTS We isolated 939 miRNAs from TA exosomes, and 917 of these were also expressed in the salivary samples. We identified 161 miRNAs as similarly expressed in both TA and saliva samples with high correlation (r=0.97). IPA Bioinformatic analysis of the 161 similarly expressed exosomal miRNAs in TAs and salivary samples identified organismal injury and abnormalities as the top disease, cellular development as the top molecular function and organismal development as the top physiological system development and function. CONCLUSIONS Our study establishes feasibility of saliva collection in extreme preterm infants born < 28 weeks of gestation at less than 30 days of age. Although TA and saliva are distinct biofluids, arising from lower airway and upper airway microenvironments, we isolated 161 miRNAs similarly expressed in both biofluids. These miRNAs may represent non-coding RNA signals that regulate pathways of organismal growth, development and injury throughout the infant respiratory tract. Noninvasive measurement of these miRNAs in the saliva of extreme preterm infants with BPD may provide molecular information about pulmonary disease. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multi-factorial disease that results from multiple clinical factors, including lung immaturity, mechanical ventilation, oxidative stress, pulmonary congestion due to increasing cardiac blood shunting, nutritional and immunological factors. Twin studies have indicated that susceptibility to BPD can be strongly inherited in some settings. Studies have reported associations between common genetic variants and BPD in preterm infants. Recent genomic studies have highlighted a potential role for molecular pathways involved in inflammation and lung development in affected infants. Rare mutations in genes encoding the lipid transporter ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 3 (ABCA3 gene) which is involved in surfactant synthesis in alveolar type II cells, as well as surfactant protein B (SFTPB) and C (SFTPC) can also result in severe form of neonatal-onset interstitial lung diseases and may also potentially affect the course of BPD. This chapter summarizes the current state of knowledge on the genetics of BPD. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify prenatal and postnatal risk factors associated with abnormal newborn hearing screen (NHS) results and subsequently confirmed sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in preterm twin neonates., METHODS: Electronic medical records of 159 twin neonates who were born alive after <=32 weeks were retrospectively reviewed for hearing loss in both ears. Histopathologic examination of the placenta was performed and clinical data, including method of conception and factors specific to twins, were retrieved from a computerized perinatal database. The main outcome measure was failure to pass the NHS test. The generalized estimation equations model was used for twins., RESULTS: Thirty-two neonates (20.1%) had a "refer" result, and, on the confirmation test, permanent SNHL was identified in 4.4% (7/159) of all neonates. Neonates who had a "refer" result on the NHS test were more likely to be of lower birth weight, more likely to have been conceived with the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF), and more likely to have higher rates of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, monochorionic placentation, death of the co-twin, or being born first was not associated with a "refer" result on the NHS test. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that conception after IVF and the presence of IVH were the only variables to be statistically significantly associated with "refer" on the NHS test. No parameters studied were found to be significantly different between the SNHL and no SNHL groups, probably because of the relatively small number of cases of SNHL., CONCLUSION: In preterm twin newborns, IVF and the presence of IVH were independently associated with an increased risk of abnormal NHS results, whereas the factors specific to twins were not associated with abnormal NHS results.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a large contributor to morbidity and mortality in premature infants; central in this disease process is impaired alveologenesis. Humans living at high-altitude have adapted their physiology to survive in this low-oxygen environment in multiple ways, one of which is increased pulmonary vascular and alveolar growth allowing for greater gas exchanging ability. RNA sequencing data from a novel murine model that mimics the human phenotypical response to chronic hypoxia suggested estrogen signaling via estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a key mediator in this adaptation. Insights into the underlying biochemical mechanisms involved in hypoxic alveologenesis and pulmonary vasculogenesis could provide potential therapeutic targets to induce alveolar lung growth in disease processes in which alveolar growth is impaired. We sought to delineate the mechanistic role ERalpha contributes to this process by exposing novel homozygous loss-of-function ERalpha mutant rats to a novel murine model of human high-altitude exposure. Using rats maintained at normoxia as controls, loss-of-function ERalpha mutant rats were exposed to hypoxia starting at conception and continued postnatally until 6 weeks of age at which time in vivo and in vitro studies were conducted. A factorial ANOVA was utilized to compare each group for each outcome measured, and a p-value of 0.05 was used as our significance threshold. A total of 58 animals were successfully bred and harvested: 11 normoxia wild type rats (RA wt; 5 female, 6 male), 17 normoxia ERalpha mutant rats (RA ERalphaMut; 7 female, 10 male), 17 hypoxia wt rats (HH wt; 9 female, 8 male), and 13 hypoxia ERalpha mutant rats (HH ERalphaMut; 6 female, 7 male). Mirroring a previously published murine model of chronic hypoxia exposure, both wt and ERalphaMut animals born and raised in hypoxia had significantly lower body mass and higher hematocrits, total alveolar volumes, diffusion capacities of carbon monoxide, and Fulton indexes than RA wt and RA ERalphaMut animals. No major differences were seen between wt and ERalphaMut animals at either exposure, but some potential sex differences were noted. (Figure 1) In conclusion, for the time points and degree of hypoxia studied, ERalpha does not seem to have a pivotal role in the cardiopulmonary physiologic adaptation to chronic hypoxia. Given the potential sex differences, further research into the role of ERalpha on hypoxia-induced pulmonary histologic changes and the underlying biochemical pathways involved in hypoxia-induced adaptive lung growth is warranted.

AB  - Rationale: Cellular senescence has been demonstrated in aging, age-related diseases and stressrelated injury. Paradoxically, it is also essential for organismal development. Whether senescence contributes to lung development or injury in early life remains unclear. We hypothesized that senescence participates in postnatal lung development, and that this is abnormally enhanced with hyperoxic exposure, leading to alveolar simplification. Method(s): Senescence biomarkers, including SA-beta-gal and loss of nuclear lamin b1, were measured in the lung of newborn mice at postnatal day (pnd) 0 until pnd60 under normoxic condition. Lung senescence was also evaluated in C57BL/6J mice (<12 h old) exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 3 days during the saccular stage of lung development followed by air recovery until adulthood. We employed p21 knockout mice (C57BL/6J background) and a specific p21 inhibitor UC2288 (2 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) to determine the pathways underlying lung developmental and hyperoxia-induced senescence. A senolytic cocktail quercetin/dasatinib (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered into mice at the saccular or alveolar stage to evaluate the role of senescence in lung development and hyperoxic lung injury, using the mean linear intercept (Lm) and radial alveolar counts (RAC). Result(s): Lung senescence peaked at birth and dramatically decreased throughout the saccular stage in mice. Removing senescent cells early in postnatal life, using the senolytic cocktail quercetin/dasatinib or via embryonic p21 deletion, disrupted lung development. In contrast, in mice exposed to hyperoxia during the saccular stage followed by air recovery until adulthood, lung senescence increased at pnd7, compared to air controls, particularly in type II cells. This was mediated by the p53/p21 pathway. Eliminating senescent cells during the alveolar stage, using quercetin/dasatinib or UC2288, inhibited hyperoxiainduced alveolar simplification. Conclusion(s): Early programmed senescence orchestrates postnatal lung development whereas later hyperoxia-induced senescence causes alveolar simplification. This work defines the ontogeny of lung senescence and provides an optimal therapeutic window for clearing senescent cells to mitigate neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Rationale: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a prominent regulatory role in lung vascular growth, development, and maintenance, and impaired signaling is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypertension. Whether VEGF measured in adults born preterm associates with neonatal factors or pulmonary vascular function is unknown. Therefore, we measured plasma VEGF levels to determine the relationships with neonatal factors and vascular function in a well characterized cohort of adults born preterm. Method(s): Young adults born preterm (gestational age 29.0+/-2.7 weeks and birth weight 1205+/-392 grams; adult age 26.6+/-4.1 years, N = 26) were recruited from the Newborn Lung Project. Age-matched term-born participants (25.8+/-4.3 years, N = 14) were recruited from the local population. All subjects underwent pulmonary function testing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood biobanking. VEGF levels were measured from plasma by commercially available ELISA. Pulmonary artery relative area change (RAC), calculated by (maximum vessel area minimum vessel area)/maximum vessel area, and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were used as noninvasive metrics of adult pulmonary vascular function. To test for group differences, we utilized the Mann-Whitney test. Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine associations between variables. Data is presented as mean (SD) unless otherwise noted. Result(s): VEGF levels were not significantly different between adults born preterm and at term (87.7+/-56.8 pg/ml vs 75.0+/-35.2 pg/ml; p=0.73). However, VEGF levels were higher in preterm individuals with a history of BPD compared to preterm without BPD (111.8+/-59.6 pg/ml vs 72.8+/-53.5 pg/ml; p=0.065) and in those with a history of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; 117.8+/-57.6 pg/ml vs 65.6+/-46.4 pg/ml; p=0.01). Further, total days on ventilation at birth was directly associated with adult VEGF level (r=0.50, p=0.01). Adult RAC (0.34+/-0.07 vs 0.40+/-0.11; p=0.058) and DLCO % predicted (82.5+/-11.3 vs 100.9+/-19.4; p=0.003) were lower in the preterm adults. Although there was no relationship with adult DLCO, VEGF level was inversely associated with RAC (r=-0.40, p=0.04). Conclusion(s): VEGF levels in adults born preterm are influenced by neonatal factors, including history of BPD, PDA, and assisted ventilation. Given that VEGF also associates with adult RAC, a marker of vascular stiffening, additional study of its role in promoting or ameliorating long-term vascular remodeling after preterm birth is warranted. These data support the hypothesis that VEGF plays a prominent role in both growth and maintenance of lung vasculature throughout life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxygen supplementation is a life-saving treatment, but it can potentially induce long-term pulmonary injury by triggering inflammatory processes. Xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP enzymes play a critical role in hyperoxic lung injury. Murine studies have shown that CYP1B1 exacerbates, while CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 protect from hyperoxic lung injury. OBJECTIVE(S): In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to hyperoxia of Cyp1b1-null mice would revert the transcriptomic changes induced by hyperoxia in WT mice, both at the transcript and pathway level. DESIGN/METHODS: C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice, as well as Cyp1b1-/- knockout mice aged 8- 10 weeks were used in this study. WT and mutant mice were maintained in room air (21% O2), as a control group, or exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) into a sealed Plexiglas chamber for 48h. RNA profiling was conducted using Illumina Gene Expression MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip Kit. Significantly changed probes were determined using the limma R package, for fold change exceeding 1.5x and FDR<0.05. Enriched pathways were determined using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), with significance achieved at FDR<0.25. Human lung transcriptome data sets were scored using summed z-scores for each murine gene signature; association with phenotype was determined using Pearson correlation, with significance achieved at p<0.05. RESULT(S): Hyperoxia exposure leads to robust and correlated responses in WT mice, as well in the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 null mice. At the transcriptome level, all three CYP1 murine models mitigate the hyperoxia effects. Cdkn1a and Ccnd1 were induced by hyperoxia in both WT and Cyp1b1 null mice but reduced in Cyp1b1 null O2 mice compared to WT O2 mice. The GSEA results identified 69 pathways affected by hyperoxia and mitigated in Cyp1b1 null mice only, including lipid, glutamate, and amino acids metabolism. Hyperoxia gene signatures of all murine models associated positively with lung diseases including Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) and lung adenocarcinoma, but hyperoxia mitigation signature in Cyp1b1 null correlated negatively with BPD. CONCLUSION(S): Distinct phenotypes of Cyp1b1 null mice that were observed after hyperoxia exposure, compared to Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 null mice, are partially explained by mechanisms entailing protein and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of the premature infant following respiratory support, e.g., oxygen supplementation. Lungs of infants with BPD are characterized by impaired alveolar and microvascular formation and a higher risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prior studies from our group identified an inflammatory network with IL- 6 signaling being central in clinical and experimental BPD. Since inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular and bronchial disease, we now investigate the functional role of IL-6 in vascular and bronchial remodeling in experimental BPD. Method(s): (1) Neonatal wildtype (WT) and IL-6 knockout mice (IL-6-/-) were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2, HYX) or normoxia (21% O2, NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to 28 (P28). In addition, we pharmacologically inhibited IL-6 cisand trans-signaling in WT mice exposed to NOX or HYX from P1 to P28 using IL-6 monoclonal antibody (IL-6 mAb) or sgp130-Fc, respectively. Lungs were excised and either snap frozen for molecular biology studies or fixed with paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded for histomorphometric analysis. (2) Primary murine bronchial smooth muscle cells (pmBSMCs) were exposed to hyperoxia and IL-6/sIL-6 receptor (IL-6+R), followed by assessment of viability and proliferation. Result(s): (1) Histomorphometric analysis revealed a thickening of the vascular and bronchial wall of WTHYX when compared to WTNOX. Vascular and bronchial remodeling in WTHYX was associated with reduced microvascular formation and a higher number of partly and completely muscularized small vessels (20-100 micrometer). Moreover, we found a greater number of vascular KI-67+/aSMA+ cells per vessel as well as a higher total amount of aSMA+ cells per vessel, both indicators of proliferation, in the WTHYX than in WTNOX. In contrast, both genetically modified mice with IL-6 deficiency (IL-6-/-) and pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling were protected from hyperoxia-induced vascular and bronchial remodeling, but not from reduced microvascularisation. (2) Exposure of pmBSMCs to HYX decreased viability when compared to NOX. While IL-6+R decreased viability of pmBSMCs under NOX, we detected an increase under HYX. Finally, IL-6+R increased proliferation of pmBSMCs under both NOX and HYX. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a critical role of IL-6 signaling in vascular and bronchial remodeling via hyperproliferation of SMCs, a pathomechanism that was prevented by IL-6 deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling. The pharmacological amenability of IL-6 offers a new therapeutic strategy for severe BPD and early origins of PAH.

AB  - Background/Rationale: Recent work has highlighted the role of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) in driving Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis. Here, we use three complementary approaches to investigate how TGFb modulates secondary septation in both normal alveolar development and in the murine model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. 1) The TGFb-activating integrin ITGB6 has a critical role in acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, so we hypothesized that deletion of Itgb6 would protect against hyperoxia-induced BPD. 2) We characterized changes in the lung microenvironment of mice undergoing hyperoxia treatment to identify the cell types most impacted during disease progression. 3) Identify the critical TGFbresponding cell type in the lung mesenchyme in normal lung development and in hyperoxia. Method(s): We implemented the hyperoxia-induced murine model of BPD in which we treated newborn mice from P0-P10 with 75% oxygen and harvest lungs at P40 for morphometric analysis. We crossed Itgb6 floxed mice to Nkx2.1-cre and Shh-cre to delete Itgb6 in lung epithelium, and then analyzed lungs after room air vs hyperoxia treatment. In parallel, we analyzed wildtype mice undergoing hyperoxia treatment by flow cytometry to characterize changes in the lung microenvironment during hyperoxia treatment. Finally, we generated Nkx2.1-cre x Tgfbr2 floxed mice to determine the role of TGFb to the lung epithelium. Result(s): Surprisingly, we found that ITGB6 is not required in lung epithelium for either normal septation or for hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Using mice with conditional deletion of the critical TGFb receptor TGFBR2 in lung epithelial cells, we confirmed previous reports that TGFb signaling in epithelial cells is required for normal secondary septation. In contrast to published data, we found no role for TGFb signaling in the alveolar simplification induced by hyperoxia. In our flow cytometry experiments, we found profound and highly reproducible changes within the lung mesenchyme in response to hyperoxia. We are currently testing the hypothesis that TGFb signaling in the lung mesenchyme is the major driver of TGFb effects in hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Conclusion(s): ITGB6 is not required in the lung for normal septation or for hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Deletion of TGFBR2 in lung epithelium causes alveolar simplification, but in contrast to prior reports, does not appear to have a role in hyperoxia-induced simplification. Given the profound impact of hyperoxia on the lung mesenchyme, our further studies will test the role of TGFb signaling in specific lung mesenchymal populations.

AB  - RATIONALE: Preterm infants with oxygen supplementation frequently develop a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pathomechanistically, an inflammatory response with increased migration and activation of macrophages plays a major role. Elevated levels of CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), which has chemotactic and activating effects on proinflammatory inflammatory cells, were detected in lungs of infants evolving BPD as well as in prior studies from our group using an experimental model of BPD. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated whether CXCL10 deficiency protects newborn mice from hyperoxia-induced lung injury (as a model of BPD). METHOD(S): (1) Homozygous CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10-/-) mice as well as wild-type mice (WT, C57Bl/6J) were either exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2, HYX) or normoxia (21% O2, NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to 14 (P14) and studied at P14. (2) For recovery, some mice were transferred from HYX to NOX for two additional weeks and were then sacrificed at P28. Excised lungs were snap-frozen for molecular biology studies or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histomorphometric analyses. (3) J744A.1 macrophages were treated with CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist, and cell migration was checked. RESULT(S): (1). Lungs of HYX-exposed WT showed significantly increased macrophage invasion at P14 compared with the control group. This inflammatory response after HYX resulted in impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis as well as increased apoptosis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Deficiency of CXCL10 protected the newborn mice from the inflammation as well as partially from the HYX-induced structural changes. (2) After recovery at P28, CXCL10-/- mice exhibited improved lung structure and attenuated extracellular matrix remodeling when compared to WT. (3) Loss of CXCL10 drastically reduced macrophages influx in the lung of both P14 and P28 after HYX compared to WT. (3) Treatment with CXCL10 and CXCR3 antagonist significantly promoted and reduced the migration of macrophages respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Our data demonstrate that deficiency of CXCR3-CXCL10 axis blocks macrophage chemotaxis to the lung and partially enables lung growth and protects from extracellular matrix remodeling in experimental BPD, offering thereby a possible novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic target for BPD treatment.

AB  - Rationale: Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes are unknown. To distinguish sex differences caused by gonadal hormones versus sex chromosome complement (XX versus XY), at single-cell resolution, we used the four Core Genotype mice (FCG). In the FCG model Sry is a transgene and is not present on the Y chromosome, so that XX and XY mice can each have either testes (with Sry, XXM or XYM) or ovaries (without Sry, XXF or XYF). Sc-RNA-seq was used to elucidate the sex-specific transcriptomic differences in coding genes in the lung in vivo in a model of murine neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, mapping affected genes to biological pathways. We hypothesized that hormonal and sex chromosome mechanisms interact in the sexspecific modulation of biological pathways in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): Neonatal FCG mice were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-4: saccular stage) or room air and euthanized on PND5. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to generate transcriptional profiles of >40000 cells isolated from the lungs of C57BL/6 mice exposed to 95% oxygen between PND1-5 and their littermate controls. Viable single cells were isolated by FACS at PND5 (n=3/gp). Library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Sequencing data were mapped to mm10 and quantified using GENCODE. Data normalization, doublet removal, cell type clustering, and marker gene identification, and hyperoxia response gene signatures were performed using Seurat. Result(s): scRNAseq identified 31 cell clusters in both hyperoxia exposed and control lungs consistent with distinct populations of endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal and immune cells. Marked differences were seen in the immune and endothelial cell subpopulations due to the hyperoxia exposure and the responses further varied based on the gonadal/chromosomal sex. Specifically, in the distal alveolar endothelial cell (aCap and gCap) cells, distinct cellular transcriptomes were identified based on the gonadal or chromosomal sex. Genes related to endothelial to mesenchymal transition (Col4a2, Col4a1), Apoptosis (Bax) and p53 pathway (p21) were enriched in the hyperoxia exposed aCap and gCap cells. The distal alveolar epithelial cells are more vulnerable to hyperoxia exposed lung injury in chromosomal males (XXM and XYM) compared to chromosomal females (XXF and XYF). Conclusion(s): Sex hormones and sex chromosomes may cause sexspecific differences in the pathogenesis of BPD in premature neonates. Elucidation of these molecular mechanisms will lay the foundation for future sex-specific treatment strategies.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is marked by microbial dysbiosis, with an increased abundance of proteobacteria. Disease progression is characterized by progressive extracellular matrix breakdown and neutrophilic inflammation marked by matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) pathway activity. A respiratory-specific probiotic blend was created in collaboration with industry partners. We hypothesized that pulmonary delivery of this blend would decrease dysbiosis and attenuate MMP-9-mediated neutrophilic inflammation in BPD. Method(s):1. In vitro dysbiosis model of BPD: Human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) grown on collagen plates were treated with E. coli and exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2). Cells were further dosed with a live probiotic blend of Lactobacillus strains AB11, AB12, and AB13 (AB Blend #1, obtained from Alveolus Bio, Inc) versus control. Supernatants collected at 12 hours were tested for MMP-9, Ac- PGP, and cytokines.2. Murine double hit hyperoxia/LPS model of BPD: Double hit dysbiosis model of BPD was created by incremental intranasal instillation of proteobacterial (E. coli) LPS in C57BL/6 mice and exposure to hyperoxic conditions (85% FiO2) from PN3-14. Normoxic controls (21% FiO2) were used. Treatment: AB Blend #1 probiotic intranasal treatment versus a control were administered to both groups. General methods: Each group n = 5-6, pups harvested at PN14. Lung morphometry by RAC; BALF collection for MMP9, Ac-PGP, MPO and cytokines; lung tissue for RNA, protein and 16S microbiome analysis; serum for MMP9, cytokines, CRP. 3. 3. Human: Tracheal aspirates (TA) were collected from extremely preterm infants on DOL 1. Patients were divided into ones who developed BPD at 36 weeks PMA (BPD predisposed) and those who did not (BPD resistant). TA samples were analyzed MMP9, cytokines, and microbiome by 16S sequencing. Result(s): All differences between groups - p<0.05.1. Cell supernatants from E. colitreated hyperoxic NHBE cells showed elevated MMP-9, Ac-PGP, and IL-1beta compared to normoxic cells. AB Blend #1 treatment decreased MMP-9 levels compared in E. coli-treated hyperoxic NHBE cells.2. Mice treated with AB Blend #1, had better RAC, decreased MPO, decreased neutrophils, decreased MMP9 and Ac-PGP, decreased lung resistance, improved lung compliance, decreased systemic cytokines, and increased microbial diversity, in the murine BPD model. 3. BPD predisposed infants showed significantly lower populations of bacteria Lactobacillus, decreased bacterial diversity, increased MMP9, increased Ac-PGP, increased MPO in their TA compared to BPD-resistant infants. Conclusion(s): Administration of a live probiotic blend mitigated lung neutrophilic inflammation and lung damage in models of BPD, suggesting a potential therapeutic potential of respiratory probiotics.

AB  - Introduction/Aim: Pneumofibrosis is a natural outcome of chronic nonspecific lung diseases (CNSLD). A disbalance in the oxidant-antioxidant system (AOS) is an integral and mandatory link in the pathogenesis of CNSLD. In this regard, the aim of this study was to study the contribution of the polymorphic variant of gene the SOD1 G7958A to the formation of a predisposition to pneumofibrosis in children with CNSLD.Materials and methods. Were examined 79 children with CNSLD with pneumofibrosis. The presence of pneumofibrosis was confirmed by computed tomography. The comparison group included 46 children with HCL without pneumofibrosis. The control group included 30 healthy children. The study SNP of the SOD1 G7958A gene enzyme was carried out by the method of polymerase chain reaction.Results. A comparative analysis of the frequency distribution of the G7958A genotype of the gene SOD1 in children with pneumofibrosis showed that the GG variant was detected significantly less often in children with CNSLD (71.2%) than in children of the control group (96.7%, p<0.05). There were no significant differences in this genotype between the groups of patients with CNSLD without pneumofibrosis (80.4%) and with pneumofibrosis (64.6%) (p>0.05). The GA genotype of the SOD1 gene was determined in 30.4% of patients with CNSLD, including 21.7% of children with pneumofibrosis and 8.7% of children with CNSLD without pneumofibrosis and only 3.3% of healthy patients (p<0.05). In the presence of the GA genotype, the risk of developing pneumofibrosis in children with CNSLD increases by 2.5 times (OR = 2.53, chi2=0.0043). The most significant is the presence of polymorphism in children with pneumofibrosis, as the outcome of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), where 50% of children had the GA genotype, compared to 37.5% (p>0.05) in children with chronic bronchitis and 5.9% (p<0.001) in children with congenital lung malformations.Conclusion. The GA genotype of the SOD1 gene is associated with a predisposition to the development of pneumofibrosis in children with CNSLD, more pronounced in children with BPD.

AB  - Importance: Substantial quality improvements in neonatal care have occurred over the past decade yet racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality remain. It is uncertain whether disparate patterns of care by race and ethnicity contribute to disparities in neonatal outcomes., Objectives: To examine differences in neonatal morbidity and mortality rates among non-Hispanic black (black), Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white (white) very preterm infants and to determine whether these differences are explained by site of delivery., Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study of 7177 nonanomalous infants born between 24 and 31 completed gestational weeks in 39 New York City hospitals using linked 2010 to 2014 New York City discharge abstract and birth certificate data sets. Mixed-effects logistic regression with a random hospital-specific intercept was used to generate risk-adjusted neonatal morbidity and mortality rates for very preterm infants in each hospital. Hospitals were ranked using this measure, and differences in the distribution of black, Hispanic, and white very preterm births were assessed among these hospitals. The statistical analysis was performed in 2016-2017., Exposure: Race/ethnicity., Main Outcomes and Measures: Composite of mortality (neonatal or in-hospital up to 1 year) or severe neonatal morbidity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity stage 3 or greater, or intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or greater)., Results: Among 7177 very preterm births (VPTBs), morbidity and mortality occurred in 2011 (28%) and was higher among black (893 [32.2%]) and Hispanic (610 [28.1%]) than white (319 [22.5%]) VPTBs (2-tailed P < .001). The risk-standardized morbidity and mortality rate was twice as great for VPTB infants born in hospitals in the highest morbidity and mortality tertile (0.40; 95% CI, 0.38-0.41) as for those born in the lowest morbidity and mortality tertile (0.16; 95% CI, 0.14-0.18). Black (1204 of 2775 [43.4%]) and Hispanic (746 of 2168 [34.4%]) VPTB infants were more likely than white (325 of 1418 [22.9%]) VPTB infants to be born in hospitals in the highest morbidity and mortality tertile (2-tailed P < .001; black-white difference, 20%; 95% CI, 18%-23% and Hispanic-white difference, 11%; 95% CI, 9%-14%). The largest proportion of the explained disparities can be attributed to differences in infant health risks among black, Hispanic, and white VPTB infants. However, 40% (95% CI, 30%-50%) of the black-white disparity and 30% (95% CI, 10%-49%) of the Hispanic-white disparity was explained by birth hospital., Conclusions and Relevance: Black and Hispanic VPTB infants are more likely to be born at hospitals with higher risk-adjusted neonatal morbidity and mortality rates, and these differences contribute to excess morbidity and mortality among black and Hispanic infants.

AB  - Introduction: Lower airway injury and obstruction are clinically significant in severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). We previously showed that airway epithelial cells (AEC) from patients with evolving BPD have aberrant regulation of transcriptional pathways controlling cilia assembly; this may be due to abnormal epithelial differentiation and/or reconstitution of cilia after injury. Here, we modeled BPD-related airway injury in vivo with hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) and ex vivo with hyperoxia-exposed organotypic AEC cultures to investigate roles of IL-33 and the downstream growth factor amphiregulin (Areg) in AEC differentiation and response to injury. Method(s): IL-33-deficient, Areg-deficient, and WT control mice were exposed to 0.9 FiO2 for 3-7d prior to preparation of paraffin-embedded H&E-stained lung sections. A comparative pathologist performed semi-quantitative histopathology scoring of airway and alveolar changes, including using loss of cilia, degree of bronchiolitis, epithelial hyperplasia, and alveolar hemorrhage. AECs were isolated from tracheas of PN1-2 mice, grown in submerged conditions to confluence, differentiated at air-liquid interface, and exposed to normoxia or 0.8 FiO2 for 4d. Immunocytochemistry for AEC differentiation or QPCR was then performed. Human CD45-EPCAM+ epithelial cells were isolated from tracheal aspirates by FACS for RNASeq analyses. Samples were prospectively collected in the first month of life from intubated premature infants with evolving BPD. Data analysis was performed with R, using Limma and edgeR packages. Result(s): Compared with WT controls, IL-33-deficient, and Areg-deficient mice had more severe HILI at 3d. After 5d of hyperoxia, Areg-deficient mice had increased airway epithelial injury as well as alveolar epithelial injury/hemorrhage (Figure 1A). In our ex vivo model (Figure 1B), WT AEC had loss of cilia and 3.4-fold decreased mRNA expression of basal cell proliferation marker TP63 (p=0.0003, t-test) after 4d of hyperoxia exposure. At baseline, IL-33-deficient and Areg-deficient AEC cultures had abnormal differentiation with decreased apical cilia and disorganized actin staining, with further loss of cilia after hyperoxia exposure. Areg-deficient AECs had decreased TP63 mRNA expression compared with controls, and further reduction in TP63 after hyperoxia exposure. In human AEC, expression of TP73, a proliferation gene co-expressed with TP63, is 13.6-fold lower in the first two weeks of life (during significant oxygen exposure) compared with later timepoints. Conclusion(s): Absence of the IL- 33/Areg axis results in dysregulated AEC differentiation and increased hyperoxia-induced airway epithelial injury in vivo and ex vivo. Changes in cilia structure and/or epithelial proliferation may be important mechanisms contributing to the development of airway injury and obstruction in sBPD.

AB  - Introduction: Congenital pathologies of the bronchopulmonary system (congenital malformations of the lungs - CM, bronchopulmonary dysplasia - BPD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) make up the majority of chronic nosologies of the respiratory tract in children. They have similar clinical manifestations, but different pathogenesis. We know the role of genetic regulation of simple inflammation in CM and BPD. However, COPD (except BA) are associated with a chronic infectious process, and therefore the genetics of the most specific interleukins - IL-10 (antibacterial regulator) and IL-12 (antiviral regulator) - is of particular interest. Material(s) and Method(s): We examined 156 children, of which 54 had CM, 72 had BPD, and 30 had COPD (except those with bronchial asthma). The groups were randomized by sex, age, place of residence. Polymorphisms of genes with single nucleotide substitution of interleukins (IL-4 C589T, IL-6 C174G, IL-10 G1082A, IL- 10 C592A, IL-10 C819T, IL-12 A1188C) were studied by PCR (CFX-96 Biorad, USA). Results and discussion: The study of the polymorphisms of genes regulating simple inflammation interleukins (IL-6 C174G), showed no significant differences: 46.5% of normal homozygous alleles in the BPD group and 50.0% each in the CM and COPD groups. On the contrary, when analyzing the polymorphisms of inflammation molecules genes specific for a particular type of pathogens, we found that mutations mostly in the genes of antibacterial response IL-10 (G1082A) and antiviral IL- 12 (A1188C) do not have significant differences in the CM and BPD groups, but are more often found in COPD (p<0.05). Normal homozygotes of IL-10 (G1082A) in CM are found in 56.2% of cases, in BPD - 55.6%, and in COPD only in 33.2%. Heterozygotes containing the mutant allele are found in COPD in 60.0% of cases (p=0.0098), with CM and BPD - half as often (33.3% and 27.1%, respectively). Normal homozygotes IL-12 (A1188C) were found in 70.6% of patients with CM, 67.4% with BPD, and only 50.0% in patients with COPD. A heterozygous genotype with a mutant allele of this polymorphism was detected in 29.4% and 28.3% of patients with CM and BPD, respectively, and almost twice as often, in 50.0% of patients with COPD (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Thus, mutations in genes that regulate the most specific links of the inflammatory process, are characteristic of children with COPD. It allows to identify a risk group for the formation of COPD among children with frequent infectious diseases of the respiratory tract.

AB  - Background: Early life factors, such as cigarette smoke (CS) exposure and prematurity, can determine impaired lung development and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Low circulating and pulmonary levels of Clara Cell 16-kDa protein (Cc16) have been associated with low function during the lifespan. We and others have shown that Cc16-deficient mice develop abundant lung inflammation, mucus metaplasia and emphysema when exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). The interplay between prenatal CS exposure, Cc16 and lung development has not been elucidated before. We hypothesize that Cc16-/- weanlings born from CS-exposed mothers would exhibit early severe lung pathologies. Method(s): Breeding cages composed of adult male and female WT and Cc16-/- mice (8-12 weeks of age) were exposed to room air or CS for six days-a-week (TPM ~ 150 mg/m3) for six months. Once the pups were born, they were not exposed to CS. At 1, 7, 14 and 28 days post birth (p1, p7, p14, and p28, respectively), the weanlings were sacrificed and the following readouts of lung function and pathology were measured: 1) respiratory mechanics by a Flexivent device; 2) emphysema and small airway remodeling by morphometric quantification of Gill's and Masson's trichrome stained-lung slides, respectively; and 3) pulmonary levels of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Result(s): WT and Cc16-/- weanlings from air-exposed mothers had no significant differences in lung function, and in particular quasi-static compliance, peripheral airway resistance and elastance, and tissue elastance. Strikingly, Cc16-/- weanlings from CS-exposed mothers compared to WT weanlings from CSexposed mother had: 1) significantly lower compliance, higher peripheral airway resistance and elastance, higher tissue elastance, and right shift of the pressure-volume loops, suggesting restrictive lung mechanics; 2) significantly increased alveolar chord length and reduced radial alveolar count, suggesting compromised alveolarization process; 3) increased small airway remodeling; and 4) higher expression of metalloproteinases and fibroblast-associated growth factors. Conclusion(s): CC16 deficiency during prenatal lung development is associated with fibrotic changes of the lung, alveolar simplification, and airway thickening, similar to the pathologies observed in prematurity-associated BPD. These results suggest that CC16 deficiency, if associated with maternal CS exposure, may play a key role in determining impaired lung development. Thus, early identification of CC16 deficiency in children might pave the way to novel strategies to treat impaired lung growth in the first years of life.

AB  - Introduction/Rationale: The outcomes of patients with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with community acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain unknown. Method(s): Retrospective case series of patients with established BPD, defined by 2019 Neonatal Research Network criteria, followed by the multidisciplinary outpatient BPD program at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH). Included patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by real-time polymerase-chain-reaction or rapid antigen testing between March 1, 2020-October 27, 2021. Clinical characteristics of patients were abstracted from the electronic medical record and presented using standard descriptive statistics. The institutional review board at NCH approved this study with a waiver of consent. Result(s): From a clinic census of 469 distinct patients, we identified 30 patients with BPD and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In general, members of the cohort were born extremely preterm, with extremely low birth weights and most (21, 70%) had grade 2 BPD at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (Table 1). The median age at the time of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was 15 months (IQR 11-23). At the time of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, 26 (87%) patients were on room air, 2 (7%) patients were on low-flow nasal cannula, and 2 (7%) patients were on tracheostomy collar. Most patients were prescribed inhaled beta-agonists (25, 83%) at the time of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Twenty-four (80%) of the patients, including 1 patient with tracheostomy collar, had mild symptoms and were treated with supportive care in the outpatient setting. Five (17%) patients were admitted to the general ward for management of hypoxemia or dehydration related to poor feeding, and 1 patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for treatment with non-invasive positive airway pressure. One asymptomatic patient was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive during admission for evaluation of seizure activity. The median hospital length of stay for patients admitted to the general ward was 6 days (IQR 4-7). The patient admitted to the PICU was hospitalized for 44 days during which the patient was diagnosed with subglottic stenosis and treated with dilation. All patients in the cohort survived and returned to their pre-illness clinical baseline following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1). Conclusion(s): Patients with established BPD are susceptible to community acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections following initial neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization. Though most patients in this series had relatively benign clinical courses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, future studies are needed to determine effective SARS-CoV-2 prevention measures, including vaccine safety and efficacy, for patients with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (Table Presented).

AB  - Problem: New Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a developmental lung disease that begins in utero and manifests as impaired alveolarization and inflammation. It is theorized that new BPD may be a consequence of placental dysfunction. Risk factors for new BPD include prematurity and low birthweight-conditions that are often associated with placental dysfunction. Using a mousemodel, our group previously reported that a history of paternal toxicant exposure promotes placental dysfunction in his unexposed partner, as well as prematurity, low birthweight, and new BPD in his offspring. In human neonates, diet has also been shown to influence the development and severity of new BPD. Our group found that postnatal formula supplementation increased severity of new BPD in neonatal mice with a paternal history of toxicant exposure. However, intervening with a paternal fish oil diet preconception following a history of toxicant exposure reduced the risk of placental dysfunction in unexposed partners, as well as premature birth, low birthweight, and new BPD in offspring. Herein, to address potential mechanisms by which the paternal fish oil diet reduced the risk of new BPD we examined inflammatory markers in neonatal lungs from all groups. Method of Study: Pregnant mice (F0) were exposed to TCDD on embryonic day 15.5. Offspring (F1 males) were weaned to a 5% fish oil diet then mated at 10 weeks of age with unexposed females. The F2 pups were randomized to a maternal milk or supplemental formula diet (3x/4 days) on postnatal day (PND)7. On PND11 pups were sacrificed and lung tissue collected. Lung tissues were analyzed for signs of inflammation including edema, and transcript/protein expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune receptors. Result(s): Edema was not observed in control pups regardless of paternal diet. F2 pups born to F1 males on the standard diet exhibited pulmonary hemorrhaging based on gross analyses and lung edema based on fluid retention measurements. Edema was associated with increased gene expression of CXCR2, IL-1 alpha, and aberrant IL- 1 beta expression. Lung edema was also associated with increased gene and protein expression of TLR4, and this expression was localized to the alveolar space. Overall, a paternal fish oil diet following a history of toxicant exposure reduced the risk of lung edema in F2 offspring in association with the modulation of gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers that are hallmarks for new BPD. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that a history of paternal toxicant exposure promotes edema-associated new BPD in his offspring via an inflammatory pathway. Specifically, edema was associated with increased gene and protein expression of pulmonary TLR4, as well as increased gene expression of CXCR2 and IL-1 alpha. Intervening with a paternal fish oil diet preconception normalized the gene and protein expression of TLR4, as well as the gene expression of CXCR2 and IL-1 alpha. In all groups, IL-1 beta expression was aberrant and varied depending on history of toxicant exposure, as well as paternal and neonatal diet.

AB  - Purpose of Study Infants weighing less than 1 kg at birth (ELBW) are at high risk for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), in part because of the need for mechanical ventilation utilizing an endotracheal tube (MVET). Various noninvasive (NIV) strategies have been utilized following elective extubation to prevent the need for reintubation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and NIPPV are modalities frequently used. Studies have shown decreased elective extubation failure when placed on NIPPV compared to CPAP. Furthermore, synchronized noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (sNIPPV) utilizing NAVA compared to NIPPV has demonstrated improvements in pulmonary mechanics, work of breathing, and extubation success in preterm infants. To our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing sNIPPV using NAVA with NIPPV in ELBW infants during elective extubation. This study investigates the effectiveness of extubation from conventional mechanical ventilation (MVET) to sNIPPV using NAVA or NIPPV in ELBW infants. Methods Used Consented ELBW infants are randomized to sNIPPV using NAVA or NIPPV in a one to one computer-generated scheme. Patient demographics are collected and infants are assessed for duration infant remain extubated. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of New York Medical College approved this study. Summary of Results At the time of analysis our data included 47 ELBW infants of which 27 were randomized to NIPPV and 20 to NAVA. The average birth weight was 782 (153) grams [mean (SD)] and 808 (158) grams in the NIPPV and sNIPPV groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the two group demographics. Median time to reintubation was 2 (1, 9) [median (IQR)] days in the NIPPV group and 2 (1, 5) days in the NAVA group, which was not statistically significant. Overall there was a 40% extubation failure across the groups. There were no infants in the sNIPPV group requiring oxygen at time of discharge compared to 9 in the NIPPV group (p = 0.006). Conclusions This interim analysis has shown similar extubation failure among ELBW infants in comparison to prior studies. While there were no statistically significant differences in extubation success, time to reintubation, BPD, or length of stay there were no infants in the NAVA group discharged home on oxygen, which may improve outcome variables not measured in this study. The use of NAVA may be a possible alternative mode of NIV in the ELBW population. (Table Presented).

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease caused by a combination of prenatal and postnatal environmental insults that predisposes to lifelong respiratory morbidities. Resident pulmonary immune cells regulate host immune response to airborne toxins and microbes and are thus crucial in respiratory disorders. We previously showed that combined prenatal inflammation induced by chorioamnionitis and postnatal inflammation induced by hyperoxia in neonatal rats led to significantly altered pulmonary- specific immune cell gene expression that persisted longterm. However, mechanisms by which prenatal inflammation primes the pulmonary immune cells to postnatal lung injury are unknown. Purpose of the study is to quantify differences in resident pulmonary immune cell composition in response to hyperoxiainduced lung injury subsequent to prenatal priming induced by chorioamnionitis in a double-hit rat model of BPD. We hypothesized that pulmonary immune cells are primed by prenatal inflammation resulting in altered pulmonary immune cell composition in response to postnatal hyperoxia. Methods Used Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1ug) or normal saline (NS) at 20 days of gestation. Upon delivery, pups were placed in a hyperoxia chamber with 85% O2 or room air (RA) for 14 days. Pups were euthanized on postnatal days 1 (P1) and 14 (P14). Single-cell suspension of the lung was stained with DAPI and rat-specific fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD161, CD43, and CD45R for flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using FCS ExpressTM software. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test for two groups and ANOVA test for three groups. Summary of Results On P1, prenatal LPS exposure decreased CD3+CD4+ T-cells (3.5+/-0.8% vs 1.9+/-0.2%; NS+RA vs LPS +RA), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (2.7+/-0.9% vs 1.4+/-0.2%; NS+RA vs LPS+RA) and CD45R+ B-cells (44.9+/-6.3% vs 30.8 +/-3.1%; NS+RA vs LPS+RA)(p=0.0079). In contrast, CD161 + cells (49.8+/-7.2% vs 66.5+/-3.3%; NS+RA vs LPS+RA) and CD43+ monocytes were significantly increased compared to control pups (p=0.0079) (figure 1). Secondary exposure to postnatal hyperoxia increased CD161+ cells in LPS+O2 group compared to NS+O2 (6.1+/-2.4% vs 52.9+/-12.7%; NS +O2 vs LPS+O2, p < 0.0001) but decreased CD43+ cells (32.9+/-3.5% vs 25.5+/-1.7%; NS+O2 vs LPS+O2, p=0.0009) (figure 2). Conclusions Chorioamnionitis induced priming of neonatal lung immune cells results in differential response to postnatal hyperoxia, which may have clinical implications in the subset of preterm infants with respiratory failure who are exposed to chorioamnionitis prenatally.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common causes of death and morbidity in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. It is characterized by exposure to environmental stimuli such as: mechanical ventilationpressure, volume; hyperoxia; and inflammation; within a background of genetic susceptibility. Impaired lung development affects the respiratory epithelium, the vascular endothelium, and the extracellular matrix. The Hippo signaling pathway is known to play a key role in tissue growth suppression and modulation in lung development, physiology, and injury. Specifically, variants of yes-associated protein (YAP), transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and transcription enhancer factor (TEA/ATTS) domain (TEAD) are important regulators of the Hippo pathway and are associated with changes in lung function in asthma and in small-cell lung cancer. Perturbations to YAP, TAZ and TEAD of the Hippo pathway result in altered pulmonary tissue growth and vascular development. Because alterations in pulmonary lung and vascular development are also characteristic of BPD, we hypothesize that genetic variants in YAP, TAZ and TEAD of the Hippo pathway are associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. Methods Used DNA extracted from buccal swabs collected from ELBW infants following IRB-approved parental consent was subjected to allelic discrimination using specific Taqman probes for rs10895256, rs2846836, rs1820453, rs16861979, rs2304733, rs6918698 and rs11225163 during RT-PCR. Statistics included Chi-square, t-test, and z-test, with significant p value 0.05. Summary of Results Demographic characteristics did not differ between those with BPD and those without BPD except for gestational age and postnatal steroids (table 1). TEAD variant rs2304733 was found to have a significantly different genotype distribution in the BPD group compared to the Non-BPD group (p=0.05) (table 2). There were no statistical differences in the genotype distributions of the other YAP1 or TAZ variants tested. Conclusions The TEAD variant rs2304733 is associated with BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that while preterm birth perturbs the HIPPO pathway and accelerates pulmonary growth suppression, this specific TEAD genetic variant may play a role in modulating YAP/TAZ nuclear localization, contributing to increased susceptibility to BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study Preterm infants with BPD are at risk for adverse health outcomes after discharge. Whether neighborhood factors affect healthcare utilization in infants with BPD is unknown. We aimed to quantify the association of the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) at the census tract level with acute respiratory illness in the first year after NICU discharge in infants with BPD. Methods Used We generated a dataset comprising infants with BPD from a local research registry and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia electronic health record. Included infants were born <32 weeks gestation (GA) between 2010-2020 and met criteria for BPD at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. We geocoded each patient's address at hospital discharge to assign a CDC SVI value from 2018. SVI includes 15 social factors (e. g., census tract poverty, education, household structure, demographics, housing & transportation) and ranges from 0-1; higher SVI values indicate more vulnerability. Logistic regression models including census track as a random effect were used to quantify associations of SVI with the primary outcome of acute respiratory illness defined as an ED visit or readmission in the first year after NICU discharge, adjusting for GA, sex, birth year, respiratory support at 36 weeks, race, ethnicity, and insurance. A secondary analysis restricted to metro Philadelphia was performed. Summary of Results 540 infants met inclusion criteria. Table 1 shows bivariate associations of characteristics and SVI with acute respiratory illness. Per standard deviation increment increase in SVI, infants had higher odds of acute respiratory illness in unadjusted (OR 1.48, 95%CI: 1.22-1.79) and adjusted models for GA, sex, birth year, and respiratory support at 36 weeks (aOR 1.51, 95%CI: 1.24-1.84) (table 2). Further adjustment for patient race, ethnicity, and insurance attenuated the association (aOR 1.18, 95%CI: 0.93-1.49). Results were similar when restricted to metro Philadelphia. Conclusions In preterm infants with BPD, census tract SVI was associated with an ED visit or hospital admission in the year after NICU discharge in models adjusted for severity of illness. However, this association may be driven by insurance and other factors associated with race and ethnicity. Larger studies from broader geographic regions are required to clarify the relationship between SVI and healthcare utilization in patients with BPD. (Table Presented).

AB  - Purpose of Study Extremely preterm infants born under 28 weeks of gestation are at risk of developing the acute pulmonary disease of prematurity as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and chronic disease as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Meanwhile, there are no sensitive biomarkers available to identify the transition from RDS to BPD, predict prognosis and monitor therapeutic response. One promising biomarker may be present in circulating extracellular vesicles (EV). Secreted by cells into biological fluids, EVs are nanoparticles that play an important role in local and systemic cell-to-cell communication by transporting genetic (microRNA, DNA) and protein cargo to distal recipient cells. As a suitable liquid biopsy, EVs encapsulate molecular information cargo in a bilayer lipid membrane that is stable to freezing and thawing and protects from degradation. However, EVs are not well characterized in extremely preterm infants. In this study, we sought to investigate the proteomic profile of EVs from preterm infants at risk for BPD. Methods Used Preterm infants born under 28-week gestation and 1500-gram birth weight at Penn State Children's Hospital NICU are consented to and included in the study. Infants with chromosomal abnormalities, congenital heart disease, or multisystem organ failure were excluded from the study. Blood and tracheal aspirates were collected from the infants within 7 days of life. EVs were isolated using the pureEXO precipitation kit (101Bio, CA, USA). The isolated EVs were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western blot analysis of EV markers CD63, HSP70, and Flotillin. EV size distribution and concentration were quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The EV proteomic profile was investigated by mass spectrometry analysis and identification tools. Venn diagrams and protein ontology classifications analysis was performed using the functional enrichment analysis tool (FunRich). This ongoing study is approved by the IRB at Penn State College of Medicine Summary of Results EVs were successfully isolated from extremely preterm infants' biofluids collected from blood and tracheal aspirates as indicated by morphological, biophysical (figure 1), and biochemical criteria. In addition, protein comparison and ontology analysis of mass spectrometry data revealed unique proteins and enrichment of proteins involved in BPD samples compared to EV proteins in Exocarta and Vesiclepedia databases (figure 2). Conclusions We report the successful isolation of EVs from biofluids of extremely preterm infants. BPD EVs are a promising approach to identify biomarkers and obtain a mechanistic understanding of disease related to prematurity and the development of BPD. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Oxidative stress is regarded as a key regulator in the pathogenesis of prolonged hyperoxia-induced lung injury, which causes injury to alveolar epithelial cells and eventually leads to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Many studies have shown that hydrogen has a protective effect in a variety of cells. However, the mechanisms by which hydrogen rescues cells from damage due to oxidative stress in BPD remains to be fully elucidated. This study sought to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on hyperoxia-induced lung injury and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) were divided into four groups: control (21% oxygen), hyperoxia (95% oxygen), hyperoxia + hydrogen, and hyperoxia + hydrogen + LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor). Proliferation and apoptosis of AECIIs were assessed using MTS assay and flow cytometry (FCM), respectively. Gene and protein expression were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and western blot analysis. Stimulation with hyperoxia decreased the expression of P-Akt, P- FoxO3a, cyclinD1 and Bcl-2. Hyperoxic conditions increased levels of Bim, Bax, and Foxo3a, which induced proliferation restriction and apoptosis of AECIIs. These effects of hyperoxia were reversed with hydrogen pretreatment. Furthermore, the protective effects of hydrogen were abrogated by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. The results indicate that hydrogen protects AECIIs from hyperoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibiting apoptosis factors and promoting the expression of anti-apoptosis factors. These effects were associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Hennekam syndrome (HS) and van Maldergem syndrome (VMS) are two entities sharing some clinical features. While unusual facial gestalt and some degree of developmental delay is observed in both conditions intestinal lymphangiectasia and lymphedema have been considered exclusive for HS. Material(s) and Method(s): We present a case of 5 year-old girl of Syrian descent with severe protein loosing enteropathy (PLE) due to lymphangiectasia, lymphatic malformation in mediastinum, asymmetric lymphedema, facial dysmorphisms (flat nasal bridge, epicanthus, microtia), bilateral hearing loss and growth retardation. No parental consanguinity was reported. She was born preterm, had severe course of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and developed symptoms of PLE in the first year of life. The girl had hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin. Right arm and left leg lymphedema became obvious by the age of 5. The patient was suspected to have Hennekam syndrome and subjected to clinical exome sequencing. Result(s): No pathogenic variants in Hennekam syndromeassociated genes (CD55, FAT4, CCBE1 and ADAMTS3) have been found. Rare DCHS1 variant c.1954A>G (p.S652G) was detected in homozygous state; biallelic DCHS1 alterations have been previously described in some patients with van Maldergem syndrome type 1. Conclusion(s): Since DCHS1 and FAT4 molecules form a receptor -ligand pair, we hypothesize that DCHS1 mutation may cause HSlike phenotype. We demonstrate that lymphatic pathology including PLE, lymphatic malformation and lymphedema can be a part of both conditions. This observation extends existing data on clinical overlap between VMS and HS.

AB  - Introduction: Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is a common complication in premature babies whether or not in association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties in the diagnosis of PHT in premature babies little is known about the true prevalence of this condition and its evolution during the growth of the baby, a notion that is useful in the proposal of screening programs and eventual initiation of a treatment for such population. Method(s): In this prospective study we enrolled all premature babies born at < 30 weeks of gestational age at S. Orsola - Malpighi hospital in Bologna. Exclusion criteria were the presence of diaphragmatic ernia, congenital heart disease other than ASD and PDA and genetic disease. All patients were evaluated with echocardiography at 10 days of life, 32 and 40Wof post-conceptional age and at 3, 6 and 12 weeks of corrected age. Presence of PHT was defined as the presence of any of the following findings: estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) > 40 mmHg, any cardiac shunt with bidirectional or right-to-left flow, RV/LV diameter in systole in short axis > 1, Exentricity index > 1,4 or End-dyastolic RVarea/ End-dyastolic LVarea in 4 chamber view > 1. Result(s): 30 patients (56% males) were included in the study. The prevalence of echocardiographic parameters compatible with pulmonary hypertension was 83,3% at birth, 20% at 32 weeks, 50% at 40 weeks, 0% at 3 and 6 moths and 80% at 12 months of corrected age. All patients were asymptomatic during the follow-up. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of PHT shows a bimodal curve with a first peak after birth, probably due to a delayed reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance and a second peak at about 12 months of corrected age. This late recurrence suggests that if a screening for PHT in preterm babies is to be successful should be performed at about this age to minimize false positive and negative results.

AB  - Background: We report a unique clinical case of an 18-month-old patient with skeletal dysplasia, neurologic dysfunction, and apneic events caused by a novel combination of genetic variants. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified two likely pathogenic variants, with one being mosaic, which is distinctive given the difficult nature of WES technology. The first variant was a de novo, heterozygous missense variant (c.1882T>C; p.Cys628Arg) in exon 19 of the TCF12 gene. The second is a mosaic single amino acid deletion (c.4299_4301delCAT; p.Ile1434del) in exon 38 of the NALCN gene, which was detected in 30% of the sequencing reads. Pathogenic variants in TCF12 are well known to be associated with syndromic and non-syndromic craniosynostosis (CS) as the gene product regulates skeletal development. Heterozygous loss-of-function pathogenic variants in TCF12 have been described in association with both bilateral and unilateral forms of coronal synostosis and have been reported with both intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability. The second was a heterozygous, de novo, mosaic single amino acid deletion in the NALCN gene. The NALCN gene encodes for a voltage-independent nonselective cation channel. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a role in regulation of neuronal excitability which plays an essential role in CNS function and is associated with syndromes such as congenital contractures of the limb and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD). Case presentation: The patient was born preterm at 26 weeks and 3 days, possibly due to infection, to a 38-year-old multigravida mother with no significant past medical history. Neonatal concerns included periventricular leukomalacia, hydronephrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring G-tube feeding, and recurrent inguinal hernias that demonstrated poor wound healing following bilateral orchiopexy. Following discharge from the NICU, the patient continued to display a plethora of medical problems, including global developmental delay (GDD), seizures, abnormal muscle tone, ventriculomegaly, dysphagia with continued G-tube dependence, and respiratory difficulty with frequent apneas. The patient was followed by Pediatric Neurosurgery for management of his neurologic abnormalities. He was also referred to Pediatric Neurodevelopment due to concerns with development, poor feeding, low muscle tone, and dysmorphic features. Given this complex history, the patient was referred to the Spectrum Health Medical Genetics Clinic at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital at age 13 months. The clinical phenotype was confounded by prematurity, but included unique features such as brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia, micrognathia, short neck, with some shortening of the limbs (rhizomelic mainly). At 18 months he also had a complete lack of tooth development, doughy skin, and poor wound healing, as evidence by an open sore from prior hernia repair surgeries. Notable skin features include single transverse palmar creases bilaterally, a small, hard, blanching red skin lesion on the left chest, and a small, hard white papule on the dorsum of the left foot. Due to possible skeletal dysplasia, the patient underwent a complete skeletal survey that yielded many features consistent with non-syndromic skeletal dysplasia. Findings included decreased bone mineralization, increased craniofacial ratio, mild scoliosis, handlebar clavicles, flared iliac wings and uniform rhizomelic and mesomelic shortening. For further investigation of possible CS, 3-dimensional spiral computed tomography (3D CT) imaging of the skull was also performed. This was negative for CS. In addition to these findings, the patient's overall clinical presentation made for a perplexing phenotype that included a broad differential diagnosis. Thus, we ordered WES genetic testing for the patient and both parents, which yielded the two likely pathogenic variants in the TCF12 and NALCN genes. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first documented instance of a patient who carries pathogenic variants in the TCF12 and NALCN genes simultaneously. It is also the first reported case of mosaicism in the NALCN gene. In this report, we discuss the potential impact of these two gene variants on medical management. The patient presents with a unique phenotype that does not quite fit with any known syndrome. While our patient does not have the expected skull abnormalities of CS, he displays skeletal malformations of the limbs, neck, and spine that are not typically seen in this condition. Likewise, our patient displays some, but not all, pathologic features associated with NALCN variants, namely neurologic dysfunction, severe breathing problems, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Both conditions have implicated apneic concerns, compounding the risk for respiratory dysregulation. Certain clinical features-eg, limb abnormalities, neurologic dysfunction, GDD, and respiratory disease-could reasonably be associated with either gene variant based on current literature. Although he has findings consistent with skeletal dysplasia, the absence of CS may reduce the need for craniofacial surgical intervention. On the other hand, it is possible that both gene variants in combination may cause more severe respiratory disease than either variant alone. Given the known apneic events that were previously thought to be related to prematurity, it is more likely that aggressive respiratory management will be needed, especially during sleep.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Background: Partial monosomy of the short arm (p) of chromosome 7 is a rare chromosomal disorder associated with a variable phenotype, depending on the size and location of the deleted region. When the deletion involves the interstitial deletion of 7p22.1p21.2 region, literature review describes phenotypic features that include craniosynostosis, microcephaly, ocular hypotelorism or hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, dysplastic ears, depressed nasal bridge, and cleft palate. Abnormalities of the thumbs and feet have been described, and also cardiovascular, renal and genital anomalies. The 7p22.1 chromosomal region encompasses, among others, the ACTB gene. Deletion of this region presents overlapping features as previously described and is associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS, OMIM 243310). Haploinsufficiency of ACTB has been recently suggested as a probable disease mechanism explaining the clinical phenotype observed in patients with 7p22.1 deletion. Case presentation: We report a 1-year-old girl with healthy nonconsanguineous parents, born prematurely at 33 weeks of gestation, by elective cesarean section due to pre-eclampsia. First trimester combined screening revealed high risk for trisomy 18 (1:4), trisomy 13 (1:10) and trisomy 21 (1:127), but parents refused invasive testing. Ultrasound performed at 28 weeks and 3 days of gestation showed abnormality of the cavum septum pellucidum, omphalocele with hyperechogenic bowel, hepatomegaly, right wrist angulation, hand digits malformation, and duplex left kidney. Neonatal period was complicated due to bradycardia and low Apgar score (4, 6 and 6 at 1, 5 and 10 minutes respectively), needing intubation, ventilation, resuscitation, and epinephrine. Weight at birth was 1100 g (3rd percentile), height was 35.7 cm (3rd percentile) and occipitofrontal circumference of 26 cm. She was admitted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, with the following diagnosis: prematurity, very low birth weight, polymalformative syndrome including cardiovascular, renal and neurological alterations, peri-natal hypoxia, hyaline membrane disease thrombocytopenia and hypothyroidism. She was first observed in our Genetics Clinic at 3 months old, presenting with dolichocephaly, hypotelorism, dense eyelashes, broad nasal bridge, thin upper lip vermilion, short arms and bilateral nonfunctional thumb hypoplasia. Patient also presented with umbilical hernia, hypertonia and psychomotor development delay. Karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis identified an 8.96 Mb heterozygous deletion involving the interstitial chromosome region 7p22.1p21.2. Parental testing revealed normal results, establishing the diagnosis of a de novo 7p22.1p21.2 microdeletion. Conclusion(s): Interstitial deletion of chromosome 7p22.1p21.2 is a rare chromosomal disorder, and review of recent literature found few descriptions for this disorder. This report highlights the importance of distinguishing prematurity complications from syndromatic features associated with a genetic syndrome. Also, it brings to attention the importance of chromosomal microarray analysis as a molecular genetic tool that is effective to detect copy number variations and determine its breakpoints. The molecular diagnosis allowed suitable genetic counseling, facilitated informed decision-making and provided for a proper prognostic assessment.Copyright © 2022

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common health complications of premature birth. Corticosteroids are commonly used for treatment of BPD, but their use is challenging due to variability in treatment response. Previous pharmacometabolomics study has established patterns of metabolite levels with response to dexamethasone. We obtained additional patient samples for metabolomics analysis to find associations between the metabolome and dexamethasone response in a validation cohort. METHOD(S): Sixteen infants provided 15 plasma and 12 urine samples. The measure of treatment response was the calculated change in respiratory severity score (deltaRSS) from pre-to- post treatment. Each metabolite was assessed with paired analysis of pre and posttreatment samples using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Correlation analysis was conducted between deltaRSS and pre-to- post change in metabolite level. RESULT(S): Analysis identified 18 plasma and 26 urine metabolites with significant level difference comparing pre to post treatment samples (P < 0.05). Three plasma and 4 urine metabolites were also significant in the original study. Pre-to- post treatment change in metabolite analysis found 4 plasma and 8 urine metabolites significantly associated with deltaRSS (P < 0.05). Change in urine citrulline levels showed a similar correlation pattern with deltaRSS in the first study, with increasing level associated with improved drug response. CONCLUSION(S): These results help validate the first major findings from pharmacometabolomics of BPD including key metabolites within the urea cycle and trans-4- hydroxyproline as a potential marker for lung injury. Ultimately, this study furthers our understanding of the mechanisms of steroid response in BPD patients. Future animal and mechanistic studies will augment our project.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in premature infants, which is characterized by alveolar dysplasia and impaired vascularization. Supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation commonly used in premature infants may result in BPD. Senescence is a state of permanent proliferation arrest resulting in enlarged and irregular cells. This is mediated by the p53/p21 and p16/RB pathways. We and others have shown that exposure to high concentration of oxygen (hyperoxia) causes senescence in lung fibroblasts, epithelial and smooth muscle cells. The mechanisms underlying these findings remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that miR-34a is increased in the lung of patients with BPD and hyperoxia-exposed mice. Although miR-34a participates in cellular senescence, it is unclear whether increased miR-34a contributes to hyperoxia-induced senescence. We hypothesized that hyperoxia increases miR-34a levels, leading to cellular senescence. To test this hypothesis, we exposed mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) for 24 h and newborn mice (<12 h old) to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 3 days then allowed to recover in room air until postnatal days (PND) 7. We found that miR-34a and markers of senescence, including nuclear loss of lamin B1, p53 and p21 gene expression, were increased in mouse lungs at PND3 or PND7 and MLE-12 cells at 24 h in response to hyperoxic exposure. Transfection of miR-34a inhibitor (20 nM) suppressed its expression and reduced hyperoxia-induced senescence in MLE-12 cells, while transfection of miR-34a mimic (0.1 nM) did not alter hyperoxia induced senescence. Interestingly, miR-34a overexpression under room air conditions did not induce senescence. We conclude that hyperoxia increases miR-34a, which results in lung epithelial cell senescence. Therefore, preventing hyperoxia induced senescence via the suppression of miR-34a may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate the detrimental consequences of hyperoxia in the neonatal lung. doi: xxxxxCopyright © 2021

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease observed in premature infants. Some BPD survivors show evidence of pulmonary dysfunction and vascular remodeling as adults. We have shown that hyperoxia reduced carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme of carnitine shuttle during fatty-acid oxidation (FAO), in lung endothelial cells (ECs) and that EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice are susceptible to developing hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. Whether enhancing Cpt1a reduces hyperoxia-induced persistent lung injury is unclear. We hypothesized that upregulation of Cpt1a attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced persistent alveolar simplification and vascular remodeling. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL/6J mice (<12 h old) were exposed to room air or hyperoxia (50% and >95% O2) for 3 days followed by air recovery until postnatal day 14 (pnd14) and pnd60. They were intraperitoneally injected with the Cpt1a upregulators baicalin (50 or 100 mg/kg) or L-carnitine (150 or 300 mg/kg) daily between pnd9 and pnd13. Lung function was evaluated using the FlexiVent system (SCIREQ Inc). H&E staining was performed to measure mean linear intercept (Lm) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Immunohistochemical detection of alpha-SMA was carried out to measure pulmonary vascular wall thickness. Result(s): Hyperoxia caused persistent alveolar simplification and vascular remodeling in a concentration-dependent manner. Hyperoxia also increased lung compliance in adult mice. Both baicalin and L-carnitine increased Cpt1a levels and FAO in lung ECs. Baicalin and L-carnitine attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increase in lung compliance in adult mice. Baicalin and L-carnitine attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increase in Lm and decrease in RAC at both pnd14 and pnd60. These effects were diminished in mice with disrupted endothelial Cpt1a. The hyperoxia-induced increase in vascular wall thickness was inhibited by baicalin and L-carnitine. Conclusion(s): Increased Cpt1a via baicalin or L-carnitine attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced persistent lung injury. Upregulating Cpt1a could be a therapeutic approach to prevent persistent lung injury in BPD. doi: xxxxxCopyright © 2021

AB  - Purpose of Study Over the past 50 years, because of the advancement in neonatology research, the neonatal mortality rate has decreased by 4-fold. However, despite this advancement in research, there is significant disparity between the morbidity and mortality rates of neonates born to white women vs. neonates born to women of color. If current research is not representative of the neonatal population, the findings from trials may not be generalizable to NICUs across the United States. The objective of this study is to assess whether racial and ethnic minority groups are appropriately represented in neonatal clinical trials involving respiratory disease, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Methods Used This cross-sectional study examined data from completed clinical trials involving neonates and lung pathology in the United States that were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The search terms neonates and lung were used to identify trials. The main outcome measured was the number and percentage of racial and ethnic minority groups enrolled in clinical trials. Secondary outcome measures included sex distribution, year of completion, funding source, study type, and trial phase. Summary of Results A total of 56 studies with a total of 14,390 participants were included in the study. Most studies were randomized clinical trials (45 [80.4%]), sponsored by an academic institution (41 [73.2%]), and were published (42 [75.0%]). The major types of lung disease studied were bronchopulmonary dysplasia (22 [39.3%]) and respiratory distress syndrome (24 [42.9%]). Most studies reported sex (50 [89.3%]). Of the studies that reported sex, 7,246 participants were male (53.0%). Twenty-three studies did not report race or ethnicity (41.1%). Only 33 studies reported race (58.9%). Of the 33 studies that reported race, 5,612 participants were White or Caucasian (45.3%), 4,095 participants were Black or African American (33.0%), 228 participants were Asian (1.8%), 17 participants were American Indian (0.1%), 1 participant was Pacific Islander (0.0%), 5 participants were more than one race (0.0%), and 2,437 participants were classified as other or unknown (19.7%). Only 19 studies reported ethnicity (33.9%). Of the 19 studies that reported ethnicity, 850 participants were Hispanic or Latino (17.3%). As the decades have progressed, the reporting of race has decreased: 100.0% of the studies from the 1990s reported race, 71.4% of the studies from the 2000s reported race, and 41.4% of the studies from the 2010s reported race. Conclusions This cross-sectional study found that among clinical trials involving neonates and lung pathology in the United States, many studies did not report race or ethnicity. Additionally, the reporting of race has declined over the decades. This finding suggests that there needs to be a change in neonatal clinical trials to improve the reporting of race. As the United States becomes more diverse, future trials should include neonates that reflect our country's population.

AB  - Introduction: A subset of Still's patients receiving treatment with IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors developed features (e.g., eosinophilia, atypical rash) that raised the possibility of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Objective(s): To identify features of DRESS that distinguish it from active disease in Still's patients. Method(s): We organized a multi-center (48 institutions, 11 countries), retrospective case/control study of Still's patients treated with anakinra, canakinumab, or tocilizumab (anti-IL-1/IL-6). Inclusion as a case required physician suspicion of a drug reaction during anti-IL-1/IL-6 treatment. Drug-exposed controls from the same sites (institutional controls) were randomly selected Still's subjects not satisfying the case definition. Each subject was scored for DRESS using the validated scoring system, RegiSCAR for DRESS, which specifies that features may be asynchronous and discontinuous. Demographic and clinical features of cases and controls were compared frequencies of some features were compared to population frequencies. HLA allelic frequencies were compared in 71 DRESS cases and 30 drug-tolerant controls. Result(s): Still's onset age was enriched for <2.5 years in cases vs institutional controls no significant differences were found in frequency of onset age >10 years, adult (>16y) onset of Still's, sex, or MAS occurrence pre-treatment. Interestingly, ten cases reported serious comorbidities: four with severe congenital heart disease (CHD),~40X expected live birth rate for CHD, pre-term birth (3) resulting in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in 2 (~30X expected live birth rate), congenital lung disease (1), severe neonatal pneumonia (1), and 2 with CHD and 1 with BPD were among four with Trisomy 21 (~50X expected live birth rate). Comorbid conditions were mostly (7/10) among those with Still's onset age <2.5 years. Eosinophilia and atypical rash were markedly enriched in cases vs controls, as expected (P values 7.1 x10-31 and 2.5 x10-28, respectively). Unexpectedly, differences were also observed in frequencies of abdominal pain (P=9.6 x 10-6) and of transfusion in absence of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or bleeding (P= 1.9x10-4). MAS during treatment occurred almost exclusively in DRESS cases (P= 6.2 x 10-16). HLA-DRB1*15 alleles were strikingly associated with DRESS, but did not distinguish DRESS cases with versus without diffuse lung disease (DLD) developing during anti-IL-1/IL-6, MAS or comorbid conditions. Preliminary data on outcome after careful drug removal include improvement or resolution of lung disease in 11 cases stopping drug with >=3mos of follow up. Conclusion(s): A number of clinical features characterize serious DRESS to IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors in Still's disease patients. These features are shared by subjects with (~80%) and without the HLA risk allele. For the former, HLA testing allows pre-prescription risk determination. DRESS to IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors in Still's may be enriched in those with younger onset age, co-occurring cardiopulmonary disease, prematurity, or Trisomy 21. Patient outcome with drug removal, as indicated for DRESS, will be important to evaluate.

AB  - TYPE: Abstract TOPIC: Signs and Symptoms of Chest Diseases PURPOSE: More than 50 years since Northway described bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), it remains the most common cause of pulmonary morbidity in preterm neonates. As the first generation of preterm infants to receive exogenous surfactant therapy enters adulthood, the long-term impacts of BPD on lung function remains poorly described. METHOD(S): We conducted a single-center, retrospective review of 59 adult patients with a history of BPD. This study was approved by The Ohio State University institutional review board (#2021H0217). RESULT(S): Of the 59 patients identified, 27 (46%) were male. Average age was 30 years old. 12 (20%) had adult PFT data available, 12 (20%) had CT scans, and 25 (42%) had chest X-rays. The mean and median FEV1/FVC ratio were 60.00 +/- 15.5 and 55.00 (48.50-71.00), respectively. On CT scan, 4 (33%) had opacities, 3 (25%) had emphysematous changes, 2 (17%) had bronchial wall thickening, and 2 (17%) showed mosaic attenuation. CONCLUSION(S): Our data re-demonstrates previously reported persistence of structural changes on chest imaging, however, is unique in following an older than previously reported cohort. Additionally, while previously reported literature has described pulmonary function abnormalities, to our knowledge, this is the first report of chronic obstructive lung disease persisting into adulthood as a consequence of BPD. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: At present, conservative estimates indicated there are 1,000,000 survivors of BPD in the United States. Unfortunately, literature describing imaging, pulomonary pathophysiology, and long-term outcomes for these patients is scant. Our review adds unique data to the existing literature.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of 14 cytokine gene polymorphisms with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) among Han Chinese newborns. The 14 polymorphisms investigated were IL18 rs1946519, rs1946518, rs187238, rs360718, and rs360717 polymorphisms, IL10 rs3024493 polymorphism, IL6 rs1800795, rs1800796, and rs1800797 polymorphisms, TNF rs361525 and rs1800629 polymorphisms, and TGFB1 rs1800469, rs1800468, and rs1800471 polymorphisms., WORKING HYPOTHESIS: The polymorphisms could be associated with the risk of BPD among Han Chinese newborns., STUDY DESIGN, PATIENT-SUBJECT SELECTION, AND METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective study. Genotyping of these polymorphisms were performed on BPD cases (N = 1022) and non-BPD controls (N = 1039) who were ascertained using the established Jobe and Bancalari criteria. The odds ratios (ORs) of polymorphisms whose genotype distribution in the controls fulfilled the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were calculated to evaluate the strengths of genetic association., RESULTS: Genotype distributions of IL6 rs1800795 and rs1800797 polymorphisms deviated significantly from HWE and were omitted from the analysis. Among the 12 remaining polymorphisms, only TNF rs361525 polymorphism demonstrated a statistically significant association with BPD risk. The heterozygous GA genotype of TNF rs361525 polymorphism showed an OR of 1.932 (1.512-2.470), while the homozygous AA variant genotype showed an OR of 2.927 (1.216-7.048) (P = 0.000 and P = 0.017, respectively). Besides, the allelic OR was also analyzed, and it was found that the variant A allele of TNF rs361525 polymorphism showed an OR of 2.146 (1.718-2.680) (P = 0.000)., CONCLUSION: TNF rs361525 polymorphism could influence BPD risk among Han Chinese newborns.

AB  - Objective: Aerobic vaginitis (AV) is one of the normal vaginal flora disturbances, characterized by abnormal vaginal flora with the disruption of lactobacillus and the presence of aerobic microflora, and vaginal inflammation. The effect of AV on perinatal outcomes in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) has not been yet fully investigated. The objective of this study was to address this issue. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in singleton pregnant women (N=240) who were admitted due to pPROM (<=34 weeks of gestation) in a single tertiary hospital between 2007 and 2017 and who underwent the Gram-stain and culture for bacteria in vaginal swab samples. The vaginal condition associated with aerobic vaginitis (VC-AV) was defined when there were one or more findings among the following: 1) the presence of aerobic bacteria by cultivation, 2) lack of lactobacillus, and 3) relatively abundant leukocytes compared to the epithelial cells on Gram-stained vaginal smears. Result(s): During the study period, VC-AV was observed in 197 patients (82.1%). The presence of VC-AV was associated with a higher rate of histological chorioamnionitis (p< 0.05). Patients with VC-AV had a lower mean gestational age at delivery and higher rates of preterm delivery (PTD) and spontaneous PTD (<= 32 weeks) than those without (p< 0.05, for all). Adverse neonatal outcomes such as neonatal intensive care unit admission and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome were associated with the presence of VC-AV (p< 0.05, for all). When the study population was classified into 3 groups according to the severity of VC-AV (intermediate: 1 or 2 findings; severe: all 3 findings), additional findings were discovered that the rates of elevated maternal serum C-reactive protein concentration (>8 mg/dL), spontaneous PTD (<=34 weeks), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia and were increasing as AV-VC was more severe. Conclusion(s): VC-AV in preterm PROM was related to maternal and placental inflammation and adverse perinatal outcomes. These data can give us an insight into the importance of AV in patients with preterm PROM.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Background: Animal studies have shown that a leukocyte influx precedes the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature sheep. The CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD because of the predominance of CXCR2 ligands in tracheal aspirates of preterm infants who later developed BPD. Purpose(s): To test the effect of CXCR2 antagonist on postnatal systemic and pulmonary inflammation and alveolarization in a newborn Sprague-Dawley rat model of BPD. Method(s): Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into the newborn rats on postnatal day 1 (P1), P3, and P5 to induce systemic inflammation and inhibit alveolariza tion. In the same time with LPS administration, CXCR2 antagonist (SB-265610) or vehicle was injected i.p. to investigate whether CXCR2 antagonist can alleviate the detrimental effect of LPS on alveolarization by attenuating inflammation. On P7 and P14, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from the pups. To assess alveolarization, mean cord length and alveolar surface area were measured on 4 random nonoverlapping fields per animal in 2 distal lung sections at x100 magnification. Result(s): Early postnatal LPS administration significantly increased neutrophil counts in BALF and PB and inhibited al-veolarization, which was indicated by a greater mean cord length and lesser alveolar surface area. CXCR2 antagonist significantly attenuated the increase of neutrophil counts in BALF and PB and restored alveolarization as indicated by a decreased mean cord length and increased alveolar surface area in rat pups exposed to early postnatal systemic LPS. Conclusion(s): CXCR2 antagonist preserved alveolarization by alleviating pulmonary and systemic inflammation induced by early postnatal systemic LPS administration. These results suggest that CXCR2 antagonist can be considered a potential therapeutic agent for BPD that results from disrupted alveolarization induced by inflammation.Copyright © 2021, Korean Pediatric Society.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease in premature infants. Accumulating evidence shows that dysregulated metabolism of glucose, lipids and amino acids are observed in premature infants. Animal and cell studies demonstrate that abnormal metabolism of these substrates results in apoptosis, inflammation, reduced migration, abnormal proliferation or senescence in response to hyperoxic exposure, and that rectifying metabolic dysfunction attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification and vascular dysgenesis in the lung. BPD is often associated with several comorbidities, including pulmonary hypertension and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, which significantly increase the morbidity and mortality of this disease. Here, we discuss recent progress on dysregulated metabolism of glucose, lipids and amino acids in premature infants with BPD and in related in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest that metabolic dysregulation may serve as a biomarker of BPD and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. We also highlight that targeting metabolic pathways could be employed in the prevention and treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Pathological angiogenesis is the hallmark of ischemic retinal diseases among them retinopa-thy of prematurity (ROP) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is a pure hypoxia-driven angiogenesis model and a widely used model for ischemic retinopathies. We explored whether the vascular homing peptide CAR (CARSKNKDC) which recognizes angiogenic blood vessels can be used to target the retina in OIR. We were able to demonstrate that the systemically administered CAR vascular homing peptide homed selectively to the preretinal neovessels in OIR. As a cell and tissue-penetrating peptide, CAR also penetrated into the retina. Hyperoxia used to induce OIR in the retina also causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the lungs. We showed that the CAR peptide is not targeted to the lungs in normal mice but is targeted to the lungs after hyperoxia-/hypoxia-treatment of the animals. The site-specific delivery of the CAR peptide to the pathologic retinal vasculature and the penetration of the retinal tissue may offer new opportunities for treating retinopathies more selectively and with less side effects.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The decision to pursue chronic mechanical ventilation involves a complex mix of clinical and social considerations. Understanding the medical indications to pursue tracheostomy would reduce the ambiguity for both providers and families and facilitate focus on appropriate clinical goals. Objective(s): To describe potential indications to pursue tracheostomy and chronic mechanical ventilation in infants with severe BPD (sBPD). Study design: We surveyed centers participating in the Children's Hospitals Neonatal Consortium to describe their approach to proceed with tracheostomy in infants with sBPD. We requested a single representative response per institution. Question types were fixed form and free text responses. Result(s): The response rate was high (31/34, 91%). Tracheostomy was strongly considered when: airway malacia was present, PCO2 >= 76-85 mmHg, FiO2 >= 0.60, PEEP >= 9-11 cm H2O, respiratory rate >= 61-70 breaths/min, PMA >= 44 weeks, and weight <10th %ile at 44 weeks PMA. Conclusion(s): Understanding the range of indications utilized by high level NICUs around the country to pursue a tracheostomy in an infant with sBPD is one step toward standardizing consensus indications for tracheostomy in the future.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Background: Platelets play an important role in the formation of pulmonary blood vessels, and thrombocytopenia is common in patients with pulmonary diseases. However, a few studies have reported on the role of platelets in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to explore the relationship between platelet metabolism and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Method(s): A prospective case-control study was performed in a cohort of premature infants (born with a gestational age <32 weeks and a birth weight <1,500 g) from June 1, 2017 to June 1, 2018. Subjects were stratified into two groups according to the diagnostic of bronchopulmonary dysplasia: with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD group) and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (control group). Platelet count, circulating megakaryocyte count (MK), platelet-activating markers (CD62P and CD63), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were recorded and compared in two groups 28 days after birth; then serial thrombopoietin levels and concomitant platelet counts were measured in infants with BPD. Result(s): A total of 252 premature infants were included in this study. Forty-eight premature infants developed BPD, 48 premature infants without BPD in the control group who were matched against the study infants for gestational age, birth weight, and admission diagnosis at the age of postnatal day 28. Compared with the controls, infants with BPD had significantly lower peripheral platelet count [BPD vs. controls: 180.3 (24.2) x 109/L vs. 345.6 (28.5) x 109/L, p = 0.001]. Circulating MK count in the BPD group was significantly more abundant than that in the control group [BPD vs. controls: 30.7 (4.5)/ml vs. 13.3 (2.6)/ml, p = 0.025]. The level of CD62p, CD63, and TPO in BPD group was significantly higher than the control group [29.7 (3.1%) vs. 14.5 (2.5%), 15.4 (2.0%) vs. 5.8 (1.7%), 301.4 (25.9) pg/ml vs. 120.4 (14.2) pg/ml, all p < 0.05]. Furthermore, the concentration of TPO was negatively correlated with platelet count in BPD group with thrombocytopenia. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that platelet metabolism is involved in the development of BPD in preterm infants. The possible mechanism might be through increased platelet activation and promoted TPO production by feedback.Copyright © 2021 Yan, Ren, Wang, Xia, Yang, Miao, Xu, Gao and Yang.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has multifactorial origins and is characterized by distorted physiological lung development. The impact of nutrition on the incidence of BPD is less studied so far. Method(s): A retrospective single center analysis was performed on n = 207 preterm infants <1,000 g and <32 weeks of gestation without severe gastrointestinal complications to assess the impact of variations in nutritional supply during the first 2 weeks of life on the pulmonary outcome. Infants were grouped into no/mild and moderate/severe BPD to separate minor and major limitations in lung function. Result(s): After risk adjustment for gestational age, birth weight, sex, multiples, and antenatal steroids, a reduced total caloric intake and carbohydrate supply as the dominant energy source during the first 2 weeks of life prevailed statistically significant in infants developing moderate/severe BPD (p < 0.05). Enteral nutritional supply was increased at a slower rate with prolonged need for parenteral nutrition in the moderate/severe BPD group while breast milk provision and objective criteria of feeding intolerance were equally distributed in both groups. Conclusion(s): Early high caloric intake is correlated with a better pulmonary outcome in preterm infants <1,000 g. Our results are in line with the known strong impact of nutrient supply on somatic growth and psychomotor development. Our data encourage paying special attention to further decipher the ideal nutritional requirements for unrestricted lung development and promoting progressive enteral nutrition in the absence of objective criteria of feeding intolerance.© Copyright © 2021 Thiess, Lauer, Woesler, Neusius, Stehle, Zimmer, Eckert and Ehrhardt.

AB  - Aims: The aim of the study is to evaluate two different patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) management approaches and their impact on neonatal mortality and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and 2-year outcomes. Subjects and Methods: For two consecutive periods, data on early mortality and morbidity were obtained retrospectively, while long-term morbidity data in children born before 28 weeks of gestation were collected prospectively. In the early targeted treatment period (TTP), ibuprofen was early indicated on patients with high clinical risk and PDA diameter of more than two millimeters in the first 3 days. In the expectant treatment period (EXP), the expectant approach was used. Result(s): A total of 201 eligible infants were screened. Of these, 99 were managed in the TTP and 102 in the EXP. From 99 infants in the TTP, 24 patients were treated early and 17 later. From 102 infants in the EXP, 17 infants with symptomatic PDA were treated. Severe BPD and/or death were more frequent in the TTP as compared to EXP (28 and 16 infants, respectively; P = 0.007; odds ratio = 2.12; confidence interval = 1.06-4.23; c = 0.216). Moreover, infants who underwent the expectant approach did not need further cardiological interventions after discharge. Conclusion(s): Early targeted treatment of large PDAs was associated with an increased risk of severe BPD and/or death. We must pay attention to the side effects of early ibuprofen treatment because these may outweigh the benefits of ductus closure, especially in the vulnerable population of extremely preterm infants.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Background. Protein-calorie deficiency is common multifactorial medical condition in infants. Nutrition therapy of protein-calorie deficiency in premature infants with special medical food is not always quite effective. It can be associated with residual manifestations of overlapping perinatal pathology. Clinical case description. Extremely premature child with severe protein-calorie deficiency in the late period with combined perinatal pathology (perinatal central nervous system damage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) was administrated with therapeutic highly nutritious (high-protein/high-energy) milk formula according to individual plan. The positive dynamics in clinical manifestations of the main and associated diseases was noted on nutrition therapy. Conclusion. High-calorie and protein-enriched therapeutic formula can effectively correct protein-calorie deficiency in premature infants with associated perinatal pathology in the recovery period (disfunction compensation).Copyright © 2021 Publishing House of the Union of Pediatricians.

AB  - Aim. To explore the relationship between the quantitative indicators (biparietal width, interhemispheric distance) of the cranial MRI for preterm infants at 37 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA) and neurodevelopment at 6 months of corrected age. Methods. A total of 113 preterm infants (gestational age<37 weeks) delivered in the Obstetrics Department of the First People's Hospital of Lianyungang from September 2018 to February 2020 and directly transferred to the Neonatology Department for treatment were enrolled in this study. Based on their development quotient (DQ), the patients were divided into the normal (DQ>=85, n=76) group and the abnormal (DQ<85, n=37) group. Routine cranial MRI (cMRI) was performed at 37 weeks of PMA to measure the biparietal width (BPW) and interhemispheric distance (IHD). At the corrected age of 6 months, Development Screening Test (for children under six) was used to assess the participants' neurodevelopment. Results. Univariate analysis showed statistically significant differences in BPW, IHD, and the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia between the normal and the abnormal groups (P<0.05), while no statistically significant differences were found in maternal complications and other clinical conditions between the two groups (P>0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences in IHD and BPW between the normal and the abnormal groups (95% CI: 1.629-12.651 and 0.570-0.805, respectively; P=0.004 and P<0.001, respectively), while no significant differences were found in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia between the two groups (95% CI: 0.669-77.227, P=0.104). Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that the area under the curve of BPW, IHD, and the joint predictor (BPW + IHD) were 0.867, 0.805, and 0.881, respectively (95% CI: 0.800-0.933, 0.710-0.900, and 0.819-0.943, respectively; all P values < 0.001). Conclusion. BPW and IHD, the two quantitative indicators acquired by cMRI, could predict the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants at the corrected age of 6 months. The combination of the two indicators showed an even higher predictive value.Copyright © 2021 Jing Yin et al.

AB  - A prospective study was performed to investigate the effects of hyperoxia on the expression of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) proteins, and to examine interactions between these proteins in premature neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from residual venous blood samples of 20 premature infants with BPD and 20 gender-matched premature infants without BPD (non-BPD group). Expression levels of SUMO and SIRT1 proteins in PBMCs were assessed by western blot analysis, and their interactions in PBMCs were detected using the immunoprecipitation assay. Based on the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) administered, neonates were divided into normoxia, low-(21%<FiO2<30%), medium-(30%<=FiO2<40%) and high-oxygen (FiO2>=40%) groups. Expression levels of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 proteins in the normoxia group were significantly lower than those in the medium- or high-oxygen groups (P<0.01), but were comparable to those in the low-oxygen group. SIRT1 expression levels in both the medium- and high-oxygen groups were significantly lower than those in the normoxia group (P<0.01). In the BPD group, the expression of SIRT1 protein was significantly lower (P<0.01), and its interaction with SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 was significantly attenuated compared with that in the non-BPD group (P<0.01). Supplemental oxygen with FiO2>=30% was associated with upregulation of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 expression and downregulation of SIRT1 expression. The present findings suggest that decreased SIRT1 expression and its SUMOylation by SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 may be associated with the development of BPD.

AB  - Aims: Different forms of apheresis have been proposed as potential therapeutic approaches to remove soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and allow safe pregnancy prolongation in cases of extremely preterm preeclampsia. This is a follow-up study presenting our experiences with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in 5 women with preeclampsia at < 28 weeks of gestational age. Material(s) and Method(s): All women received standard treatment for preeclampsia and 2 - 3 TPE treatments per week. Blood samples for sFlt-1 and placental growth factor (PlGF) measurements were collected before and after each TPE. Result(s): Seventeen TPE procedures were performed, 2 - 5 per patient. TPE significantly reduced sFlt-1 (by 35 +/- 6%), sFlt-1/PlGF ratio (by 24 +/- 13%), and to a lesser degree also PlGF (by 12 +/- 16%), with a rebound observed on day 1 post procedure. TPE procedures were well tolerated by pregnant women and fetuses. Stabilization of sFlt-1 allowed pregnancy prolongation for a median of 8 (range 2 - 14) days from first TPE and for a median of 10 (range 4 - 17) days from hospital admission. There were no signs of increased risks of adverse neonatal outcome associated with TPE. One neonate died due to extreme prematurity 3 days after delivery, 2 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and 1 had retinopathy of prematurity. Conclusion(s): This study provides new evidence of effective reduction in sFlt- 1 and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio with TPE treatment, which seems to allow a clinically meaningful prolongation of pregnancy. Controlled studies are necessary to convincingly show the potential benefit of apheresis treatment in preeclampsia at extremely preterm gestation.Copyright © 2021 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

AB  - Background: In late preterm infants born in nontertiary hospitals, the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome requires postnatal transport. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the timing of surfactant administration in late preterm infants needing postnatal transport. Method(s): This is a retrospective study evaluating surfactant administration in late preterm infants during emergency transports by the Eastern Veneto Neonatal Emergency Transport Service between January 2005 and December 2019. The outcome measures included short-term clinical complications, stabilization time, oxygen concentration, duration of mechanical ventilation and noninvasive respiratory support, length of hospital stay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and sepsis. Result(s): Surfactant was administered to 155/303 neonates (51.1%) at 3 different time points: at a referring hospital (50 neonates), when the transport team arrived (25 neonates), or at a referral hospital (80 neonates). Stabilization time was longer in neonates receiving surfactant by the transport team (adjusted mean difference 17 min, 95% confidence interval, 4-29 min; p = 0.01). Decrease in oxygen concentrations during the transport was larger in neonates receiving surfactant at a referring hospital (adjusted mean difference -11%, 95% confidence interval, -15 to -3%; p = 0.01). The other outcome measures were not statistically different according to the timing of surfactant administration. Conclusion(s): In late preterm infants with respiratory distress needing postnatal transfer, stabilization time was longer when the first surfactant was administered by the transport team, but such delay did not affect safety and clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Background: Vitamin A has anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. We aimed to assess whether enteral water-soluble vitamin A supplementation in extremely preterm infants decreases fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation. Method(s): This was a prospective observational study nested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating enteral vitamin A (5,000 IU/day) for reducing the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely preterm infants. Fecal calprotectin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 28 days of Vitamin A or placebo supplementation. Result(s): Fecal calprotectin was measured in 66 infants (Vitamin A: 33, Placebo: 33). The mean (standard deviation) gestational age (25.5 [1.55] vs. 25.8 [1.48]; p = 0.341) (week), birth weight (810 [200] vs. 877 [251]; p = 0.240) (gram), and factors influencing fecal calprotectin levels were comparable between the vitamin A versus placebo group infants. All infants were exclusively fed with mother's or donor's human breast milk if mother's milk was unavailable using a standardized feeding regimen and received prophylactic probiotic supplementation. Fecal calprotectin levels (median; 25th-75th centiles) (micrograms/gram of feces) were not significantly different between vitamin A (152; 97-212) and placebo groups (179; 91-313) (p = 0.195). Two infants in the vitamin A group developed definite necrotizing enterocolitis compared to none in the placebo group. Incidence of BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was similar between the groups (vitamin A: 18/33, placebo: 13/33, p = 0.218). Conclusion(s): Enteral supplementation with water-soluble vitamin A did not affect fecal calprotectin levels in extremely preterm infants. Studies with a larger sample size are required to confirm the findings.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Background aims: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are being tested for their use as novel therapeutics. However, the optimal source of EVs is currently under investigation. Amniotic fluid (AF) is a natural source of EVs that can be easily obtained for use in regenerative medicine, yet AF-EV characterization has not been fully explored. Method(s): Here the authors demonstrate AF as a rich source of EVs and identify the microRNA and proteomic cargo. Bioinformatics analysis of this cargo revealed multiple pathway targets, including immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and free radical scavenging networks. The authors further demonstrated the therapeutic potential of this EV product as a novel preventative agent for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Result(s): Intra-tracheal administration of AF-EVs preserved alveolar development, attenuated vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension, decreased lung pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and reduced macrophage infiltration in an experimental BPD model. Conclusion(s): The authors' results suggest that AF is a viable biological fluid for EV harvest and that AF-EVs have strong therapeutic potential for pulmonary diseases, such as BPD, warranting further development to transition this novel EV product into the clinic.Copyright © 2021 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy

AB  - We present an asthmatic 39 year old female frontline healthcare worker in contact with COVID-19 patients, who suffered from respiratory problems for a few days, after which she was found dead by her spouse. Post-mortem (PM) examination showed lung consolidation and histological evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), in form of hyaline membrane disease, as well as atypical cells, thrombi and fibrin plugs inside pulmonary capillaries. Swab sample testing for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed the infection status. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which first emerged in Wuhan, China, and PM is contributing immensely to uncovering the pathophysiological mechanism of this disease. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and can lead to a fatal pneumonia characterized histologically by DAD (the most consistent PM finding). This is due to invasion by the virus of type II pneumocytes, which leads to the death of both type I and II pneumocytes and increased capillary permeability. This compromises gas exchange which can lead eventually to cardiorespiratory failure and death.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Given the sharply increased infection rate, the number of pregnant women and children with COVID-19 is correspondingly on the rise. SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through droplets; though hypothesized, other transmission routes have not been confirmed. As of now, it remains unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can possibly be transmitted from the mother to the fetus. Method(s): This study examines the medical records of 30 neonates born to women with COVID-19, the objective being to provide documented information on maternal-child transmission and infant outcomes. Result(s): Out of the 30 newborns, 28 had negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2; among their mothers, fifteen had fever, nine had cough and twenty had delivered by cesarean section. The median birth term was 37wk2dy, and twenty of the neonates were male. Most of them were asymptomatic, except for the three who presented with shortness of breath. Two of them were intubated and both died, the first because of severe sepsis and the second due to severe hyaline membrane disease. As regards the two infected neonates, the first represents a probable case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears unlikely in the second case. The outcome for both of them was good, without any complications. Conclusion(s): Maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 virus was not detected in the majority of the reported cases, although two of 30 neonates had positive qRT-PCR test results. Our study supports the hypothesis that though it seldom actually occurs, in utero SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin supplementation is a debated strategy in fighting sepsis. We evaluated a polyclonal IgM and IgA enriched immunoglobulin (IgMeIVIG) preparation in reducing the short-term mortality in extremely low birth weight neonates (ELBW) with proven infection. METHOD(S): ELBW infants born from January 2008 to December 2014 were eligible for this retrospective case-control analysis if they were symptomatic and had a positive blood culture after 72 hours of life. Patients received antibiotic treatment with or without IgMeIVIG (intravenously, 250 mg/kg/day for 3 days) within the 24 hours from clinical suspicion as per indication of the attending physician. Short-term (7 and 21 days) mortality was the study primary outcome while secondary outcomes were: mortality at discharge, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity. RESULT(S): Each group was composed by thirty-nine infants. Both groups were similar for antenatal steroids, mode of delivery, birth weight, gestational age and SNAPII score as indicator of disease severity. Infants receiving IgMeIVIG had a significantly lower short-term mortality compared with neonates receiving antibiotics alone: 6/39 (15%) vs. 14/39 (36%); P=0.038. No differences in other outcomes were found. CONCLUSION(S): This study shows that IgMeIVIG may have a role as adjuvant therapy in ELBW infants with proven sepsis. We warrant future prospective, blinded RCT studies where IgMeIVIG can be consistently used if needed throughout the NICU admission in ELBW septic neonates to appropriately evaluate its effect on mortality at discharge.Copyright © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - Background To assess the prognostic value of early echocardiographic indices of right ventricular function and vasoactive peptides for prediction of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death in very preterm infants. Methods Prospective study involving 294 very preterm infants (median [IQR] gestational age 28.4 [26.4-30.4] weeks, birth weight 1065 [800-1380] g), of whom 57 developed BPD (oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks postmenstrual age) and 10 died. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular index of myocardial performance (RIMP), plasma concentrations of mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET1) were measured on day 7 of life. Results RIMP was significantly increased (median [IQR] 0.3 [0.23-0.38] vs 0.22 [0.15-0.29]), TAPSE decreased (median [IQR] 5.0 [5.0-6.0] vs 6.0 [5.4-7.0] mm), MR-proANP increased (median [IQR] 784 [540-936] vs 353 [247-625] pmol/L), and CT-proET1 increased (median [IQR] 249 [190-345] vs 199 [158-284] pmol/L) in infants who developed BPD or died, as compared to controls. All variables showed significant but weak correlations with each other (rS -0.182 to 0.359) and predicted BPD/death with similar accuracy (areas under receiver operator characteristic curves 0.62 to 0.77). Multiple regression revealed only RIMP and birth weight as independent predictors of BPD or death. Conclusions Vasoactive peptide concentrations and echocardiographic assessment employing standardized measures, notably RIMP, on day 7 of life are useful to identify preterm infants at increased risk for BPD or death.Copyright © 2021 Neumann et al.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to determine whether ventilator bias gas flow affects tracheal aspirate (TA) cytokine concentrations in ventilated extremely preterm infants. Method(s): This is a randomized controlled trial in a tertiary neonatal unit in New Zealand. Preterm infants (<28 weeks' gestation/<1,000 g) requiring intubation in the first 7 days after birth were randomized to bias gas flows of 4 or 10 L/min. Cytokine concentrations in TA and plasma were measured at 24, 72, and 120 h after the onset of ventilation. The primary outcome measure was concentration of interleukin (IL)-8 in TA 24 h after the onset of mechanical ventilation. Result(s): Baseline demographics were similar in babies randomized to 4 (n = 50) and 10 (n = 45) L/min bias gas flow. TA IL-8 concentrations were not different between groups. Plasma IL-8 concentrations decreased over time (p < 0.05). Respiratory support and incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age were similar between groups. Fewer babies ventilated at 4 L/min developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) >= stage 2 (n = 0 vs. n = 5; p = 0.02) and fewer died (n = 1 vs. n = 5, p = 0.06). Conclusion(s): Lower bias gas flow in ventilated extremely preterm infants did not alter TA cytokine concentrations but the lower incidence of NEC and mortality warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

AB  - The study investigates the role of the oxidative and proteolytic inactivation of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected on the 3rd day of life from mechanically ventilated neonates with gestational age <= 30 weeks and analyzed without previous treatment (top-down proteomics) by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. AAT fragments were identified by high-resolution LTQ Orbitrap XL experiments and the relative abundances determined by considering the extracted ion current (XIC) peak area. Forty preterm neonates were studied: 20 (50%) did not develop BPD (no-BPD group), 17 (42.5%) developed mild or moderate new-BPD (mild + moderate BPD group), and 3 (7.5%) developed severe new-BPD (severe BPD group). Eighteen fragments of AAT and a fragment of AAT oxidized at a methionine residue were identified: significantly higher values of AAT fragments 25-57, 375-418, 397-418, 144-171, and 397-418 with oxidized methionine were found in the severe BPD group. The significantly higher levels of several AAT fragments and of the fragment 397-418, oxidized in BALF of preterm infants developing BPD, underlie the central role of an imbalance between proteases and protease inhibitors in exacerbating lung injury and inducing most severe forms of BPD. The study has some limitations, and between them, the small sample size implies the need for further confirmation by larger studies.© Copyright © 2021 Tirone, Iavarone, Tana, Lio, Aurilia, Costa, Castagnola, Messana and Vento.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids play an important role in endocrine control. The association of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene polymorphisms with altered sensitivity to glucocorticoid therapy has been reported in adults. However, there are few such reports in infants. The present study analyzed the prevalence of four GR polymorphisms in preterm infants born before 30 weeks of gestation and determined the associations between these polymorphisms and clinical outcomes in the infants., METHODS: Totally, 41 preterm infants born at two hospitals in Fukushima were retrospectively screened for the presence of four GR gene polymorphisms, using a TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay. The effect of GR gene polymorphisms on clinical outcomes during hospitalization was evaluated. The following primary clinical outcomes were assessed: refractory hypotension in the acute phase and/or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, maximum dopamine and dobutamine doses administered, and total hydrocortisone dose administered in the first 48 h of life. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was used to assess the association between clinical factors and refractory hypotension., RESULTS: Of the four GR polymorphisms, only the BclI polymorphism was detected. The genotype distribution was as follows: C/C, 33; C/G, 8; and G/G, 0 infants. Significant differences were observed between the C/C and C/G genotypes with respect to the following variables: refractory hypotension (6% vs. 50%), dopamine dose [3.0 (2.0-4.0) vs. 4.8 (4.0-7.5) mug/kg/min], dobutamine dose [2.4 (0.0-3.6) vs. 4.0 (0-10.0) mug/kg/min], and total hydrocortisone dose administered in the first 48 h of life [2.0 (0-10.0) vs. 6.0 (0-12.0) mg/kg]. Multivariate analysis showed that the BclI genotype (C/C) was significantly less associated with refractory hypotension in the acute phase (odds ratio, 0.008; 95% confidence interval, 0.000-0.371; p = 0.013)., CONCLUSION: The incidence of refractory hypotension in infants with the C/C genotype was initially expected to be higher than that in infants with the C/G genotype. However, the results of this study were rather different from what we originally expected. The suppressive effect of antenatal steroid use on the HPA axis of the preterm infants with the BclI variant may be associated with refractory hypotension in the acute phase. Copyright © 2017.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of nutritional intake in the first two weeks of life on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with gestational age (GA) <= 32 weeks. Method(s): A retrospective case-control study was conducted 154 preterm infants with birth weight <= 1500 g and GA <= 32 weeks were enrolled from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. These infants were divided into BPD group or non-BPD group. All clinical and nutritional data were collected and analyzed to investigate the effects of early-life (within 2 weeks after birth) nutritional intake on BPD. Result(s): Among a total of 154 eligible neonates, 68 were without BPD and 86 with BPD (55.8%). Mild, moderate and severe BPD accounted for 39.5% (34/86), 58.1%(50/86)and 2.4%(2/86)of all BPD cases respectively. GA and birth-weight of BPD group were significantly lower than that of non-BPD group [(28.35 +/- 1.55)weeks vs. (30.12 +/- 1.23)weeks; (1050.91 +/- 190.6)g vs. (1205.88 +/- 195.83)g, both P = 0.000]. The duration of mechanical ventilation in BPD group was longer than that in non-BPD group [(2.65 +/- 1.08)days vs. (0.47 +/- 0.12)days, P < 0.05]. The incidences of complications in BPD group, including neonatal asphyxia, sepsis and patent ductus arteriosus, were all higher than those in non-BPD group(P < 0.05). The fluids and caloric intake, enteral fluids and caloric intake were significantly lower in BPD group on Day 7 and 14 of life (P < 0.05). The macronutrient intake in BPD group was also consistently lower, reaching statistical significance for carbohydrate intake on Day 7 and 14 of life, and for protein and lipid intake on Day 14 of life (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.257, 95% CI: 1.143~4.456, P = 0.019) and GA (OR = 0.325, 95% CI: 0.215~0.49, P = 0.000) were high-risk factors for BPD. The decreased odds of developing BPD were associated with higher levels of enteral calories on Day 14 of life (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94~0.98, P = 0.000), fluids on Day 7 of life (OR = 0.927, 95% CI: 0.876~0.981, P = 0.009) and protein intake on Day 14 of life (OR = 0.044, 95% CI: 0.011~0.177, P = 0.000). Conclusion(s): GA and mechanical ventilation were independent high-risk factors for BPD. Higher intake of protein and enteral calories were protective factors. Proactive early enteral nutrition support, adequate protein intake and decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation may reduce the risk of BPD.Copyright © 2021 by the Chinese Medical Association.

AB  - Refeeding syndrome (RS) has not been well defined in the neonatal population, although hypophosphatemia is identified as the most common manifestation. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recently provided recommendations for the prevention and management of RS in children and adults; however, specific neonatal recommendations were not provided. In an effort to provide an overview of the incidence of RS or hypophosphatemia in the neonatal population and the impact of patient-specific and nutrition factors, a review of the literature was conducted. The literature search included articles published in the English language in Medline, PubMed, and EPub between 1946 and December 2020. Relevant citations within identified articles were also reviewed. Sixteen studies representing 3688 neonates were included. There was variation in the incidence of hypophosphatemia (20%-90%), hypokalemia (8.8%-66.7%), and hypomagnesemia (1%-8.3%) between studies. There was significant variability in definitions of hypophosphatemia, patient populations (e.g., gestational age, small for gestational age status, intrauterine growth restriction), and initial nutrition between studies (i.e., initial amino acid intake, calcium and phosphate ratio), proving it difficult to identify the overall incidence of neonatal RS. Clinical outcomes associated with hypophosphatemia identified in the studies included increased duration of mechanical ventilation, development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and increased mortality. Vigilant monitoring of serum phosphate, potassium, and magnesium is required in the first week of life. In addition, early addition of phosphate in a 1:1 molar ratio with calcium is recommended in the first week of life for patients who are at greatest risk for RS.Copyright .© Pediatric Pharmacy Association.

AB  - Background. Neonates of extremely low birthweight (ELBW; <1 000 g) have the highest neonatal mortality in South Africa (SA). Objective. To describe the morbidity and mortality of ELBW neonates treated at a tertiary hospital in SA. Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study including all live-born ELBW neonates treated at Tygerberg Hospital between 1 January and 31 December 2016. Data were extrapolated from a prospectively collected neonatal database and patient records. Multiple logistic regression and survival analysis were performed to identify risk factors of mortality. Results. The sample included 256 neonates. The following morbidities were recorded: respiratory distress syndrome (83.2%); bronchopulmonary dysplasia (8.2%); intraventricular haemorrhage (34.5%); periventricular leukomalacia (0.6%); necrotising enterocolitis (10.5%); and retinopathy of prematurity (31.2%). The survival-to-discharge rate was 63.3%. Cause of death was documented as extreme prematurity in 41% of the inpatient deaths. Birthweight was a significant predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.992-0.999). Of the 162 neonates who survived until discharge, 11 died following discharge. Conclusion. Morbidity and mortality rates remain high among ELBW neonates. To improve survival, resources need to be allocated to neonatal resuscitation, surfactant therapy and increasing availability of intensive-care beds.Copyright © 2021, Health and Medical Publishing Group.

AB  - Background Lung inflammation and impaired alveolarization are hallmarks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesize that human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) are anti-inflammatory and reduce lung injury in preterm lambs born after antenatal exposure to inflammation. Methods Pregnant ewes received either intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from E.coli 055:B5; 4mg) or saline (Sal) on day 126 of gestation. Lambs were delivered by cesarean section at 128 d gestation (term ~150 d). Lambs received intravenous hAECs (LPS/hAECs: n = 7; 30x106cells) or equivalent volumes of saline (LPS/Sal, n = 10; or Sal/Sal, n = 9) immediately after birth. Respiratory support was gradually de-escalated, aimed at early weaning from mechanical ventilation towards unassisted respiration. Lung tissue was collected 1 week after birth. Lung morphology was assessed and mRNA levels for inflammatory mediators were measured. Results Respiratory support required by LPS/hAEC lambs was not different to Sal/Sal or LPS/Sal lambs. Lung tissue:airspace ratio was lower in the LPS/Sal compared to Sal/Sal lambs (P<0.05), but not LPS/hAEC lambs. LPS/hAEC lambs tended to have increased septation in their lungs versus LPS/Sal (P = 0.08). Expression of inflammatory cytokines was highest in LPS/hAECs lambs. Conclusions Postnatal administration of a single dose of hAECs stimulates a pulmonary immune response without changing ventilator requirements in preterm lambs born after intrauterine inflammation.Copyright © 2021 Papagianis et al.

AB  - Preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) causes preterm delivery, and increases maternal T-cell response against the fetus. Fetal inflammatory response prompts maturation of the newborn's immunocompetent cells, and could be associated with unfavorable neonatal outcome. The aims were (1) to examine the effects of pPROM on the newborn's and mother's immune system and (2) to assess the predictive value of immune system changes in neonatal morbidity. Mother-newborn pairs (18 mothers and 23 newborns) who experienced pPROM and controls (11 mothers and 14 newborns), were enrolled. Maternal and neonatal whole blood samples underwent flow cytometry to measure lymphocyte subpopulations. pPROM-newborns had fewer naive CD4 T-cells, and more memory CD4 T-cells than control newborns. The effect was the same for increasing pPROM latency times before delivery. Gestational age and birth weight influenced maturation of the newborns' lymphocyte subpopulations and white blood cells, notably cytotoxic T-cells, regulatory T-cells, T-helper cells (absolute count), and CD4/CD8 ratio. Among morbidities, fewer naive CD8 T-cells were found in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (p=0.0009), and more T-helper cells in early onset sepsis (p=0.04). pPROM prompts maturation of the newborn's T-cell immune system secondary to antigenic stimulation, which correlates with pPROM latency. Maternal immunity to inflammatory conditions is associated with a decrease in non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic cells.Copyright © 2021 2021 Margherita Amadi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - We examined the biological roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neonatal rats were randomly assigned to hyperoxia (85% O2) and normoxia (21% O2) groups, and each group had eight neonatal. Twenty differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by deep sequencing, of which 10 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated in the hyperoxia group. A total of 5,794 molecular related to gene ontology functions were enriched, including cell location and biological processes. rno-miR-29b-3p were up-regulated, and rno-miR-322-5p and rno-miR-335 were down-regulated in the hyperoxia sample based on quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, BPD appears to be caused by activation of extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, RNA transport, cell cycle, and cell adhesion molecule pathways. These miRNAs may play a role in the occurrence and development of BPD. Our study provides new insight into the biological processes of BPD.Copyright © FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.br.

AB  - The recently recognized connection between the gut microbiota and pulmonary disease has been termed the gut-lung axis. However, broader connections link the gut and the lungs and these organ systems are tightly interrelated in both homeostasis and disease. This concept is often ignored in the compartmentalized treatment of pulmonary or gastrointestinal disease. In newborns, the most severe gastrointestinal complication of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the most severe pulmonary complication, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, both produce significant systemic morbidity. In this review, we highlight the often neglected pathophysiology of the gut-lung axis contributes to increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Neonatal Broncho Pulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic chest disease that is caused by prolonged ventilation and oxygenation, leading to sever neonatal disability. Aim of the study: Determination the role of zinc supplementation in neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Patients and Methods: Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) study which was done at Tanta University Hospital (TUH) from July 2016 to March 2018 on 100 preterm neonates who had Respiratory Distress (RD) and were put on Mechanical Ventilation (MV). The studied neonates were divided into 2 groups: Group 1, which received Zn supplementation, and group 2, which received placebo. Urinary beta2-Microglobulin (B2M) and plasma Krebs van den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels were estimated on the 3rd day and the10th day of presence in the hospital. Result(s): Significant decline in urinary B2M and plasma KL-6 levels occurred in neonates of group 1 who were given Zn compared with those in group 2 neonates, who received placebo (P<0.05). There was a significant decline in the time of incubator stay in group 1 neonates, compared with that of group 2 neonates (P<0.05). Group 1 neonates showed a significant decline in the development of established cases of BPD if compared with group 2 (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Zn supplementation is beneficial in the prevention of neonatal BPD.Copyright © 2021, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Rate and outcomes of small for gestational age (SGA) infants admitted to Chinese neonatal intensive care units (NICU) has been poorly demonstrated. We aimed to describe the rate and outcomes of SGA preterm infants in Chinese NICU, and to evaluate the association of SGA status with neonatal outcomes in different gestational age (GA) and birth weight percentile groups. Method(s): This cohort study included all infants born at 26-33 weeks' gestation and admitted to 25 tertiary Chinese NICUs from April 2015 to May 2018. SGA was defined as a birthweight <10th percentile for GA based on the Chinese neonatal birth weight curve. Result(s): A total of 24,596 infants were included, and 1,867 (7.6%) infants were SGA. SGA infants had significantly higher rates of death or any major morbidity (29.8% vs. 20.5%), mortality (7.0% vs. 4.1%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 17.6% vs. 9.8%), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, 4.8% vs. 3.2%) and sepsis (7.3% vs. 4.8%) than non-SGA infants. SGA status was independently associated with increased risk of death or any major morbidity [adjusted odds ratio: 2.37 (2.08-2.71)] as well as increased risks of death, BPD, ROP, death or BPD, death or ROP, NEC and sepsis. The increased risks of adverse outcomes for SGA infants existed across GA groups. The risks of adverse outcomes were highest among infants with a birthweight <3rd percentile. Conclusion(s): SGA contributes significantly to adverse neonatal outcomes. Specific attentions are warranted when caring for SGA preterm infants.Copyright © Translational Pediatrics.

AB  - We previously demonstrated the safety and feasibility of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants in a phase I clinical trial. We thus investigated the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs for BPD in premature infants. A phase II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on preterm infants at 23 to 28 gestational weeks (GW) receiving mechanical ventilator support with respiratory deterioration between postnatal days 5 and 14. Infants were stratified by 23 to 24 GW and 25 to 28 GW and randomly allocated (1:1) to receive stem cells (1 x 107 cells/kg, n = 33) or placebo (n = 33). Although the inflammatory cytokines in the tracheal aspirate fluid were significantly reduced with MSCs, the primary outcome of death or severe/moderate BPD in the control group (18/33, 55%) was not significantly improved with MSC transplantation (17/33, 52%). In the subgroup analysis, the secondary outcome of severe BPD was significantly improved from 53% (8/15) to 19% (3/16) with MSC transplantation in the 23 to 24 GW group but not in the 25 to 28 GW subgroup. In summary, although MSC transplantation might be safe and feasible, this small study was underpowered to detect its therapeutic efficacy in preterm infants at 23 to 28 GW. Accordingly, we are now conducting an additional larger and controlled phase II clinical trial focusing on infants at 23 to 24 GW (NCT03392467).

AB  - RATIONALE: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapies have shown promise in preclinical models of pathologies relevant to newborn medicine, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We have reported that the therapeutic capacity of MSCs is comprised in their secretome, and demonstrated that the therapeutic vectors are exosomes produced by MSCs (MSC-exos)., OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy of MSC-exo treatment in a preclinical model of BPD and to investigate mechanisms underlying MSC-exo therapeutic action., METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from media conditioned by human MSC cultures. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (HYRX; 75% O2), treated with exosomes on Postnatal Day (PN) 4 and returned to room air on PN7. Treated animals and appropriate controls were harvested on PN7, -14, or -42 for assessment of pulmonary parameters., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: HYRX-exposed mice presented with pronounced alveolar simplification, fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was effectively ameliorated by MSC-exo treatment. Pulmonary function tests and assessment of pulmonary hypertension showed functional improvements after MSC-exo treatment. Lung mRNA sequencing demonstrated that MSC-exo treatment induced pleiotropic effects on gene expression associated with HYRX-induced inflammation and immune responses. MSC-exos modulate the macrophage phenotype fulcrum, suppressing the proinflammatory "M1" state and augmenting an antiinflammatory "M2-like" state, both in vitro and in vivo., CONCLUSIONS: MSC-exo treatment blunts HYRX-associated inflammation and alters the hyperoxic lung transcriptome. This results in alleviation of HYRX-induced BPD, improvement of lung function, decrease in fibrosis and pulmonary vascular remodeling, and amelioration of pulmonary hypertension. The MSC-exo mechanism of action is associated with modulation of lung macrophage phenotype.

AB  - Although survival has improved dramatically for extremely preterm infants, those with the most severe forms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) fail to improve in the neonatal period and go on to develop chronic respiratory failure. When careful weaning of respiratory support is not tolerated, the difficult decision of whether or not to pursue chronic ventilation via tracheostomy must be made. This requires shared decision-making with an interdisciplinary medical team and the child's family. Although they suffer from increased morbidity and mortality, the majority of these children will survive to tolerate ventilator liberation and tracheostomy decannulation. Care coordination for the technology-dependent preterm infant is complex, but there is a growing consensus that chronic ventilation can best support neurodevelopmental progress and improve long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Studies in preterm infants have shown an association between late-onset sepsis (LOS) and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). It is unknown whether clinical or biochemical characteristics during sepsis modulate the risk for BPD. This single-center retrospective cohort study included all patients with a gestational age < 30 weeks, born between 2009 and 2015, in whom empiric antimicrobial treatment was initiated > 72 h after birth and continued for at least 5 days, independent on microbiological results. The association between clinical and biochemical characteristics of LOS and the development of BPD in survivors were assessed with multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for early-onset sepsis, small for gestational age, and gestational age. Of the 756 admitted infants, 256 infants (mean GA: 27.0 weeks; birthweight: 924 grams) had at least one LOS episode, of whom 79 (30.9%) developed BPD. Analyses showed that only the need for and duration of mechanical ventilation during LOS were independently associated with an increased risk for BPD (adjusted OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.38, 4.96, p value 0.003, and OR 1.004, 95% CI 1.00, 1.007, p value 0.045, respectively). Conclusion(s): During a LOS, the need for and duration of mechanical ventilation are independently associated with the risk of developing BPD in preterm infants.What is Known:* Premature infants diagnosed with a late-onset sepsis are at higher risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia* This association is mainly shown in infants with a positive blood cultureWhat is New:* This study investigates the clinical and biochemical characteristics of late-onset sepsis and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia* The need for mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation during late-onset sepsis are associated with an increased risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Perinatal inflammatory stress is strongly associated with adverse pulmonary outcomes after preterm birth. Antenatal infections are an essential perinatal stress factor and contribute to preterm delivery, induction of lung inflammation and injury, pre-disposing preterm infants to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Considering the polymicrobial nature of antenatal infection, which was reported to result in diverse effects and outcomes in preterm lungs, the aim was to examine the consequences of sequential inflammatory stimuli on endogenous epithelial stem/progenitor cells and vascular maturation, which are crucial drivers of lung development. Therefore, a translational ovine model of antenatal infection/inflammation with consecutive exposures to chronic and acute stimuli was used. Ovine fetuses were exposed intra-amniotically to Ureaplasma parvum 42 days (chronic stimulus) and/or to lipopolysaccharide 2 or 7 days (acute stimulus) prior to preterm delivery at 125 days of gestation. Pulmonary inflammation, endogenous epithelial stem cell populations, vascular modulators and morphology were investigated in preterm lungs. Pre-exposure to UP attenuated neutrophil infiltration in 7d LPS-exposed lungs and prevented reduction of SOX-9 expression and increased SP-B expression, which could indicate protective responses induced by re-exposure. Sequential exposures did not markedly impact stem/progenitors of the proximal airways (P63+ basal cells) compared to single exposure to LPS. In contrast, the alveolar size was increased solely in the UP+7d LPS group. In line, the most pronounced reduction of AEC2 and proliferating cells (Ki67+) was detected in these sequentially UP + 7d LPS-exposed lambs. A similar sensitization effect of UP pre-exposure was reflected by the vessel density and expression of vascular markers VEGFR-2 and Ang-1 that were significantly reduced after UP exposure prior to 2d LPS, when compared to UP and LPS exposure alone. Strikingly, while morphological changes of alveoli and vessels were seen after sequential microbial exposure, improved lung function was observed in UP, 7d LPS, and UP+7d LPS-exposed lambs. In conclusion, although sequential exposures did not markedly further impact epithelial stem/progenitor cell populations, re-exposure to an inflammatory stimulus resulted in disturbed alveolarization and abnormal pulmonary vascular development. Whether these negative effects on lung development can be rescued by the potentially protective responses observed, should be examined at later time points.© Copyright © 2021 Widowski, Reynaert, Ophelders, Hutten, Nikkels, Severens-Rijvers, Cleutjens, Kemp, Newnham, Saito, Usuda, Payne, Jobe, Kramer, Delhaas and Wolfs.

AB  - Background: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common complication in very preterm infants. It is known that there is an association between PDA and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death before the postmenstrual age (PMA) of 36 weeks, but this association remains one of the most controversial aspects of the problem. The study aimed to evaluate the relationship between PDA, serum NT-proBNP levels at 2-3 and 8-9 days of life, and BPD/death in very preterm infants. Method(s): Data of 52 preterm infants with a gestational age < 32 weeks, chronological age < 72 h, and PDA diameter > 1.5 mm, enrolled in a randomized controlled trial, were used for the retrospective analysis. All patients underwent daily echocardiographic and two serum NT-proBNP measurements within the first 10 days after birth. Two groups of infants were formed retrospectively at PMA of 36 weeks depending on the outcome, BPD (n = 18)/death (n = 7) or survival without BPD (n = 27). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive performance of serum NT-proBNP levels for BPD/death occurrence. Result(s): The percentage of infants who received pharmacological treatment for PDA did not differ between the groups. Based on the area under the ROC curve, serum NT-proBNP levels on the 2-3 day of life (AUC = 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.9; p = 0.014)) and on the 8-9 day of life (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.6-0.9; p = 0.002) could reliably predict BPD/death in very preterm infants who had PDA diameter > 1.5 mm in the first 72 h of life. Hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) was significantly more often detected in newborns with BPD/death, however, treatment of infants with hsPDA did not reduce the incidence of BPD/death. Conclusion(s): In very preterm infants with PDA > 1.5 mm at the age of 24-48 h, serum NT-proBNP concentration could reliably predict the development of BPD or death, regardless of the persistence of PDA, with the highest diagnostic value at 8-9 days.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in infants, but the ways to prevent and treat BPD are still very limited. We tried to find an effective method for treating BPD by studying the effect of fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) on hyperoxia-induced lung injury in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We placed newborn mice in high-oxygen environment (60-70%) and collected mouse lung tissue for histological examination at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after birth. The correlation between FGF18 and BPD was studied by analyzing the expression of FGF18 in mouse lung tissue. In addition, we used exogenous FGF18 to stimulate primary mouse type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs II), and detected changes in oxidative stress, inflammation and NF-kappaB signaling pathway activity of AECs II to analyze the effects of FGF18 on AECs II. RESULT(S): From the 7th day after the birth of the mouse, the lung tissue of the hyperoxia-induced mice suffered significant lung injury relative to the control group. The expression of FGF18 in lung tissue induced by hyperoxia was lower than that in the control group. Cell viability of AECs II stimulated by exogenous FGF18 increased, and FGF18 also reduced oxidative stress and inflammation levels of AECs II and inhibited the AECs II injury caused by hyperoxia. NF-kappaB signaling pathway activity in hyperoxia-induced lung increased, while exogenous FGF18 could reduce the expression and phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 in AECs II. CONCLUSION(S): Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was accompanied by a decrease in FGF18. FGF18 can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation levels of AECs II by inhibiting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, thereby reducing hyperoxia-induced cell injury.Copyright © 2021 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

AB  - Background: Intra-amniotic infection or inflammation is common in early preterm birth and associated with substantial neonatal lung morbidity owing to fetal exposure to proinflammatory cytokines and infectious organisms. Amniotic fluid interleukin 8, a proinflammatory cytokine, was previously correlated with the development of neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but whether amniotic fluid cytokines or placental pathology more accurately predicts neonatal lung pathology and morbidity is unknown. We have used a pregnant nonhuman primate model of group B Streptococcus infection to study the pathogenesis of intra-amniotic infection, bacterial invasion of the amniotic cavity and fetus, and microbial-host interactions. In this nonhuman primate model, we have studied the pathogenesis of group B Streptococcus strains with differing potential for virulence, which has resulted in a spectrum of intra-amniotic infection and fetal lung injury that affords the opportunity to study the inflammatory predictors of fetal lung pathology and injury. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine whether fetal lung injury is best predicted by placental histopathology or the cytokine response in amniotic fluid or maternal plasma. Study Design: Chronically catheterized pregnant monkeys (Macaca nemestrina, pigtail macaque) at 116 to 125 days gestation (term at 172 days) received a choriodecidual inoculation of saline (n=5), weakly hemolytic group B Streptococcus strain (n=5, low virulence), or hyperhemolytic group B Streptococcus strain (n=5, high virulence). Adverse pregnancy outcomes were defined as either preterm labor, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity, or development of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Amniotic fluid and maternal and fetal plasma samples were collected after inoculation, and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin beta, interleukin 6, interleukin 8) were measured by a multiplex assay. Cesarean delivery was performed at the time of preterm labor or within 1 week of inoculation. Fetal necropsy was performed at the time of delivery. Placental pathology was scored in a blinded fashion by a pediatric pathologist, and fetal lung injury was determined by a semiquantitative score from histopathology evaluating inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, tissue thickening, or collapse scored by a veterinary pathologist. Result(s): The principal findings in our study are as follows: (1) adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred more frequently in animals receiving hyperhemolytic group B Streptococcus (80% with preterm labor, 80% with fetal inflammatory response syndrome) than in animals receiving weakly hemolytic group B Streptococcus (40% with preterm labor, 20% with fetal inflammatory response syndrome) and in controls (0% preterm labor, 0% fetal inflammatory response syndrome); (2) despite differences in the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal inflammatory response syndrome, fetal lung injury scores were similar between animals receiving the weakly hemolytic group B Streptococcus strains and animals receiving the hyperhemolytic group B Streptococcus strains; (3) fetal lung injury score was significantly correlated with peak amniotic fluid cytokines interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 but not tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin 1 beta; and (4) fetal lung scores were poorly correlated with maternal and fetal plasma cytokine levels and placental pathology. Conclusion(s): Amniotic fluid interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 levels were superior predictors of fetal lung injury than placental histopathology or maternal plasma cytokines. This evidence supports a role for amniocentesis in the prediction of neonatal lung morbidity owing to intra-amniotic infection, which cannot be provided by cytokine analysis of maternal plasma or placental histopathology.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is common among extremely preterm infants. In selected cases, surgical PDA ligation may be required. The timing for PDA ligation may depend upon a variety of factors, with potential clinical implications. We aimed to investigate the impact of different surgical PDA managements on ligation timing and neonatal outcomes. Inborn infants < 32 weeks of gestation and < 1500 g admitted at two tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Units that underwent PDA ligation between 2007 and 2018 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study and split into the following groups based on their surgical management: on-site bedside PDA ligation (ONS) vs. referral to an off-site pediatric cardiac surgery (OFS). Neonatal characteristics, surgical timing, and clinical outcomes of the enrolled infants were compared between the groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of PDA ligation timing on significantly different outcomes. Seventy-eight neonates (ONS, n = 39; OFS, n = 39) were included. Infants in the ONS group underwent PDA ligation significantly earlier than those in the OFS group (median age 12 vs. 36 days, p < 0.001) with no increase in postoperative mortality and complications. The multivariate analysis revealed a significant association between PDA ligation timing, late-onset sepsis prevalence (OR 1.045, 0.032), and oxygen need at discharge (OR 1.037, p = 0.025). Conclusion(s): Compared with off-site surgery, on-site bedside ligation allows an earlier surgical closure of PDA, with no apparent increase in mortality or complications. Earlier PDA ligation may contribute to reduced rates of late-onset sepsis and post-discharge home oxygen therapy, with possible cost-benefit implications.What is known:* Ineffective or contraindicated pharmacological closure of a hemodynamically significant PDA may require a surgical ligation.* Available literature comparing the effect of early vs. late PDA ligation on the main neonatal morbidities has yield contrasting results.What is new:* The availability of a cardiac surgery service performing bedside PDA ligation allows an earlier intervention compared to patient referral to an off-site center, with no difference in postoperative mortality and complications compared to off-site surgery.* Earlier PDA ligation was associated with a lower prevalence of late-onset sepsis and of oxygen need at discharge, with possible cost-benefit implications.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Developing, regenerating, and repairing a lung all require interstitial resident fibroblasts (iReFs) to direct the behavior of the epithelial stem cell niche. During lung development, distal lung fibroblasts, in the form of matrix-, myo-, and lipofibroblasts, form the extra cellular matrix (ECM), create tensile strength, and support distal epithelial differentiation, respectively. During de novo septation in a murine pneumonectomy lung regeneration model, developmental processes are reactivated within the iReFs, indicating progenitor function well into adulthood. In contrast to the regenerative activation of fibroblasts upon acute injury, chronic injury results in fibrotic activation. In murine lung fibrosis models, fibroblasts can pathologically differentiate into lineages beyond their normal commitment during homeostasis. In lung injury, recently defined alveolar niche cells support the expansion of alveolar epithelial progenitors to regenerate the epithelium. In human fibrotic lung diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dynamic changes in matrix-, myo-, lipofibroblasts, and alveolar niche cells suggest differential requirements for injury pathogenesis and repair. In this review, we summarize the role of alveolar fibroblasts and their activation stage in alveolar septation and regeneration and incorporate them into the context of human lung disease, discussing fibroblast activation stages and how they contribute to BPD, IPF, and COPD.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The relevance of respiratory syncytial virus infection is due to its widespread, severity of the course in young children with a predominant lesion of the lower respiratory tract with acute respiratory failure and absence of etiotropic therapy with proven efficacy. The risk group for severe course and mortality is made up of premature babies, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. In addition, according to individual indications, by the decision of the council, specific prophylaxis is carried out for newborns and premature infants with severe neuromuscular pathology, CNS injury with impaired respiratory function, patients with congenital anomalies and genetic pathology of the respiratory system, as well as congenital immunodeficiency. The article presents a description and analysis of the severe course of respiratory syncytial infection with the development of obstructive bronchitis with respiratory failure of the 2nd degree in a child aged 1 year 4 months with Charge syndrome - a severe genetic pathology, including combined congenital heart disease, choanal artesia, protein-energy malnutrition, congenital immunodeficiency. The child had bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic paralytic laryngeal stenosis. The disease required oxygen support and the patient's stay in the intensive care unit. The described clinical example demonstrates a severe course of respiratory syncytial virus infection with the damage of the lower respiratory tract in a child over one year old from the risk group.Copyright © 2021, Dynasty Publishing House.

AB  - Background: Endogenous pulmonary stem cells (PSCs) play an important role in lung development and repair; however, little is known about their role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesize that an endogenous PSC marker stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) and its enzyme, alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase IX (FUT9) play an important role in decreasing inflammation and restoring lung structure in experimental BPD. Method(s): We studied the expression of SSEA-1, and its enzyme FUT9, in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, in room air and hyperoxia. Effects of intraperitoneal administration of recombinant human FUT9 (rhFUT9) on lung airway and parenchymal inflammation, alveolarization, and apoptosis were evaluated. Result(s): On hyperoxia exposure, SSEA-1 significantly decreased at postnatal day 14 in hyperoxia-exposed BPD mice, accompanied by a decrease in FUT9. BPD and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in human lungs showed decreased expression of SSEA-1 as compared to their term controls. Importantly, intraperitoneal administration of FUT9 in the neonatal BPD mouse model resulted in significant decrease in pulmonary airway (but not lung parenchymal) inflammation, alveolar-capillary leakage, alveolar simplification, and cell death in the hyperoxia-exposed BPD mice. Conclusion(s): An important role of endogenous PSC marker SSEA-1 and its enzyme FUT9 is demonstrated, indicating early systemic intervention with FUT9 as a potential therapeutic option for BPD. Impact: Administration of rhFUT9, an enzyme of endogenous stem cell marker SSEA-1, reduces pulmonary airway (but not lung parenchymal) inflammation, alveolar-capillary leak and cell death in the BPD mouse model.SSEA-1 is reported for the first time in experimental BPD models, and in human RDS and BPD.rhFUT9 treatment ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a developmentally appropriate BPD mouse model.Our results have translational potential as a therapeutic modality for BPD in the developing lung.Copyright © 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is commonly used as a plasticizer in many medical devices. We previously showed that maternal DEHP exposure led to restricted growth and delayed lung maturation in newborn rats. As oxygen toxicity continues to be a major risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of hyperoxia, DEHP or DEHP combined with hyperoxia on the growth and lung maturation of newborn rats., METHODS: Newborn rats received DEHP injection, hyperoxia exposure or DEHP injection combined with hyperoxia exposure for one week or two weeks. A control group received an equal volume of vehicle and was maintained in room air., RESULTS: Hyperoxia and hyperoxia + DEHP exposure for one week led to growth failure in newborn rats. Pups in the hyperoxia group showed catch-up growth after being maintained in room air for an additional 7 days but this was not the case with the latter group, which continued to receive DEHP. Hyperoxia and DEHP both delayed lung development, as evidenced by decreased radial alveolar count. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that hyperoxia decreased the transcripts of VEGF, VEGFR-2 and eNOS on days 7 and 14, and DEHP exposure alone also led to decreased expression of VEGF gene in 14-day-old rat pups., CONCLUSION: Postnatal hyperoxia and/or DEHP exposure lead to growth restriction and delayed lung alveolar development. The VEGF gene expression was altered and may be involved as one of the possible molecular mechanisms. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective:To observe the therapeutic effects of sildenafil in the neonatal rats with bronchopulmonary dysplasiaBPD,and to explore its possible molecular mechanism. Method(s):Sixty full-term newborn SD rats within 12 h were randomly divided into control groupinjected with saline,indoor air exposure,model groupintraperitoneally injected with LPS,85% oxygen exposure,and treatment group after BPD modeling,100 mug.g-1sildenafil per day,intraperitoneal injection,and there were 20 rats in each group. The pathomorphology of lung tissue of the rats in various groups were observed by HE staining. The number of CD31 positive cells of the rats in various groups was detected by immunohistochemistrythe expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factorVEGF,CD31,hypoxia-inducible factor-1alphaHIF-1alphaand hypoxia-inducible factor-2alphaHIF-2alphaproteins in lung tissue of the rats in various groups were detected by Western blotting method. Result(s):The HE staining results showed that the alveoli of the rats in the control group was uniform in size and regular in structurethe number of alveoli of the rats in model group was significantly reduced,showing over-inflation,and alveolar capillaries were significantly reduced,which was consistent with the pathological changes of BPDthe alveolar development of the rats in treatment group was improved. The immunohistochemistry results showed that compared with model group,the number of CD31 positive cells in treatment group was increasedP< 0. 05. The results of immunofluorescence showed that the expression amounts of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins in lung tissue of the rats in model group were decreased compared with control group at 1 week and 2 weeks after oxygen exposure,while the expression amounts of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins in the lung tissue of the rats in treatment group were increased compared with model group. The Western blotting results showed that the expression amounts of VEGF,CD31 ,HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins in lungt issue of the rats in model group were lower than those in control group at 2 weeks after oxygen exposue,while the expression amounts of VEGF,CD31,HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in lung tissue of the rats in treatment group were increased compared with model group. Conclusion(s):Sildenafil can treat BPD and improve the development of alveoli and pulmonary microvascular development,and its mechanism may be related to the activation of HIF-1alpha/2alpha-VEGF pathway.Copyright © 2021 Jilin University Press.

AB  - Background: The potential contribution of vitamin D and its receptor (VDR) to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm neonates is still unknown. The objective of the study was to test the relationship between VDR Taq 1 and Fok 1 gene polymorphisms and BPD in preterm neonates. VDR Fok 1 and Taq 1 gene polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Result(s): No statistically significant differences of genotypic distributions and allele frequencies of Fok 1 and Taq 1 VDR polymorphisms were detected between cases and controls. Moreover, no risk association was detected between both polymorphisms and BPD development in preterm neonates. Homozygous mutant (ff) genotype was the least frequent genotype among BPD and non-BPD groups (2.6%, 13.0% respectively) (p = 0.1). The same was detected for the mutant (CC) genotype frequency in both groups (10.5% and 15.2%, respectively). However, Taq 1 VDR polymorphism was significantly associated with the severity of BPD, as the genotypes with mutant allele C (CC +CT) were more frequent among severe cases (52.2%). Conclusion(s): Fok 1and Taq 1 VDR polymorphisms have no role in BPD development in preterm neonates. However, the presence of a mutant allele of Taq 1 VDR polymorphism may be associated with a more severe form of the disease.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the impact of invasive mechanical ventilation associated with two serum inflammatory cytokines and clinical indicators, on the second day of life, as predictors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very low birth weight preterm infants. It was hypothesized that the use of invasive mechanical ventilation in the first hours of life is associated with biomarkers that may predict the chances of preterm infants to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Method(s): Prospective cohort of 40 preterm infants with gestational age <34 weeks and birth weight <1500 g. The following were analyzed: clinical variables; types of ventilator support used (there is a higher occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia when oxygen supplementation is performed by long periods of invasive mechanical ventilation); hospitalization time; quantification of two cytokines (granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF] and eotaxin) in blood between 36 and 48 h of life. The preterm infants were divided in two groups: with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Result(s): The GM-CSF levels presented a significantly higher value in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia group (p = 0.002), while eotaxin presented higher levels in the group without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p = 0.02). The use of continuous invasive mechanical ventilation was associated with increased ratios between GM-CSF and eotaxin (100% sensitivity and 80% specificity; receiver operating characteristic area = 0.9013, CI = 0.7791-1.024, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation performed in the first 48 h of life in the very low birth weight infants is a significant clinical predictor of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The use of continuous invasive mechanical ventilation was associated with increased ratios between GM-CSF and eotaxin, suggesting increased lung injury and consequent progression of the disease.Copyright © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extremely preterm birth. This study was aimed at detecting cytokine and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels to evaluate their mechanisms and predicted significance for BPD. Preterm infants born at gestational age<=32 weeks were recruited, and clinical data were collected. We detected ten cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha on Days 1-3, Days 7-14, and Days 21-28 after birth by using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology. The FeNO levels of infants were measured when they met the discharge criteria. A total of 46 preterm infants were enrolled, consisting of 14 infants in BPD group and 32 infants in the control group. The gestational age (27.5+/-1.3 vs. 29.9+/-1.3 weeks) and birth weight (1021+/-261 g vs. 1489 +/- 357 g) were lower in the BPD group. The following were high-risk factors for BPD, as determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis: gestational age<30 weeks, birth weight<1000 g, PDA, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher FeNO. The cytokines of IL-6 and IL-8 on Days 7-14 and IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha on Days 21-28 were also high-risk factors for BPD. IL-6 contributed to BPD disease severity. Conclusion. The preterm infants with PDA and prolonged mechanical ventilation tended to develop BPD. The IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased on Days 7-14 and were high-risk factors for BPD. Moreover, the IL-6 level was associated with BPD disease severity. We speculated that NO was related to BPD via Th2 cell-mediated inflammatory responses such as IL-4 and IL-6. Cytokines might predict the occurrence of BPD.Copyright © 2021 Zhenjie Zhang et al.

AB  - Background: Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a common complication among premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Factors associated with PAH among premature Vietnamese infants with BPD are unknown. The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of premature infants with BPD who had PAH and to identify the factors associated with PAH in these patients. Method(s): This descriptive study included 150 infants with BPD admitted to VNCH from August 2017 to July 2018.Clinical data were collected for all BPD patients. PAH screening was performed by echocardiography. Result(s): PAH was more common among male BPD patients (71.9%). Median gestational age was 29 +/- 2.1 weeks, 96.5% of cases were <32 gestational weeks of age. Median birth weight was 1100 +/- 305.1 g. The prevalence of severe, moderate, mild PAH was 52.6%; 35.1%; 12.3%, respectively. Mean pulmonary pressure was 39.9 +/- 7.8 mmHg, the majority had mild PAH (66.7%).The threshold level of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide for PAH in BPD patients was 546 ng/L. Prematurity, low birth weight, severe BPD, long-lasting oxygen-dependence were significantly related to PAH (P < 0.05).PAH-associated factors were: no prenatal corticosteroid administration (OR, 2.1;95% CI,1.1-4.1;P = 0.04), oligohydramnios (OR,4.2; 95% CI,1.4-12.8; P = 0.01), inflammation of amniotic membrane (OR, 5.7; 95% CI,2.1-15.5; P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): PAH was common among premature infants with BPD. Prematurity, low birth weight, severe BPD, long-lasting oxygen-dependence were related to PAH in BPD patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors

AB  - OBJECTIVE Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with rapid bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Reports regarding the use of daptomycin in infants are still limited. Thus, the objective of this report is to describe the safety and efficacy of daptomycin in premature infants with persistent coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) infection. METHODS This was a retrospective chart review of 10 premature infants with persistent CoNS infection who received daptomycin therapy between January 2018 and September 2019. Four patients had endocarditis and 1 had bacterial meningitis and infectious endocarditis. The other 5 patients had persistent CoNS bacteraemia only. RESULTS Daptomycin treatment was successful for 5 patients. The others died owing to multiple factors such as prematurity, sepsis, and chronic lung disease. Adverse drug reactions, including elevation of creatine phosphokinase and/or hepatotoxicity, were noted in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS Large and randomized studies are necessary to ensure daptomycin's safety and efficacy for the treatment of infants with persistent sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria.

AB  - Background. We aimed to establish whether knowledge of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on day 1, as well as the change in these levels in the first three days, could be of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and/or prediction of severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Methods. A retrospective study was conducted on 275 term infants (35 with RDS and 240 with TTN) admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from January 2014 to June 2019. LDH levels were measured on admission and after three days. Results. Both RDS and TTN groups had elevated LDH levels during admission. LDH levels were significantly higher in the RDS group than in the TTN group on both days. LDH levels in both groups significantly correlated with both the duration of respiratory support required, as well as the number of hospital days. We used these outcomes as a measure of severity of these conditions. Conclusions. In patients with respiratory distress, it may not be clinically useful to use LDH levels on day 1 to differentiate between RDS and TTN, despite the statistically significant differences, because of the overlapping values. However, LDH levels on day 1 and day 3 may predict the degree and duration of the required respiratory support for both RDS and TTN groups.Copyright © 2021, Turkish National Pediatric Society.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth and postnatal insults alter normal lung development, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Preterm rabbit is being recognized as a relevant BPD model, but a deeper molecular characterization is needed. Aims and objectives: To characterize rabbit lung development in order to evaluate its translational potential as a BPD model. Method(s): Lung samples were collected at multiple gestational ages (GA) comprised between day 20 and day 42, and from preterm pups delivered at GA 28th, at birth, and postnatal days 3 and 7. Histological and transcriptomic analyses were performed. Radial alveolar count (RAC), tissue density (TD%), and arteries medial thickness (MT%) were assessed. A network-based analysis was performed to identify modules of co-expressed genes, and to monitor time-dependent gene expression (GE) modulation in correlation with histological data. Result(s): RAC values increased from 0.75+/-0.5 to 9+/-1.3 during lung development, while TD and MT decreased from 81.5+/-6.9% to 18.2+/-2.7% and from 61.9+/-7.9% to 35.8+/-17.2%, respectively. Foetal GE modules are enriched in pathways such as cell cycle, epithelium morphogenesis, and VEGF signalling, positively correlated with TD and MT (p-val<0.001). Surfactant metabolism was upregulated from late-foetal up to postnatal stages and positively correlated with RAC (p-val<0.001). Postnatally upregulated modules showed complement system and lymphocyte activation. Immune system activation and developmental patterns were delayed in preterm pups compared with agematched term ones. Conclusion(s): Our in-depth characterization of normal rabbit lung development highlights the specific impact of prematurity on such process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sphingosine- 1-Phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid and an intracellular as well as an extracellular signaling molecule. S1P ligand specifically binds to five related cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-5). S1P levels are tightly regulated by its synthesis catalyzed by sphingosine kinases (SphKs) 1 & 2 and catabolism by S1P phosphatases, lipid phosphate phosphatases and S1P lyase. We previously reported that knock down of SphK1 (Sphk1 -/- ) in a neonatal mouse BPD model conferred significant protection against hyperoxia induced lung injury. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed on mouse lung tissue using Affymetrix MoGene 2.0 array., RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA analysis was performed and differentially expressed genes under hyperoxia were identified using Sphk1 -/- mice and their wild type (WT) equivalents. Pathway (PW) enrichment analyses identified several signaling pathways that are likely to play a key role in hyperoxia induced lung injury in the neonates. These included signaling pathways that were anticipated such as those involved in lipid signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage/apoptosis, inflammation/immune response, and cell adhesion/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We noted hyperoxia induced downregulation of the expression of genes related to mitotic spindle formation in the WT which was not observed in Sphk1 -/- neonates. Our data clearly suggests a role for SphK1 in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury through elevated inflammation and apoptosis in lung tissue. Further, validation by RT-PCR on 24 differentially expressed genes showed 83% concordance both in terms of fold change and vectorial changes. Our findings are in agreement with previously reported human BPD microarray data and completely support our published in vivo findings. In addition, the data also revealed a significant role for additional unanticipitated signaling pathways involving Wnt and GADD45., CONCLUSION: Using SphK1 knockout mice and differential gene expression analysis, we have shown here that S1P/SphK1 signaling plays a key role in promoting hyperoxia induced DNA damage, inflammation, apoptosis and ECM remodeling in neonatal lungs. It also appears to suppress pro-survival cellular responses involved in normal lung development. We therefore propose SphK1 as a therapeutic target for the development drugs to combat BPD.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), driven by postnatal exposure to oxygen (O ) or mechanical ventilation (MV), is an independent risk factor for adverse neurologic outcome. We thus characterized the impact of O and MV on brain development in a preclinical mouse model of BPD, where functional MRI in infants with the disease informed the brain areas studied. Male newborn mice (PND 5-7) were exposed to O2 (fiO2 =0.4) with or without MV (tidal volume 5mul/g) for 2 and 8 hours. Whole-genome expression in mouse brain and lung (n=3/group) was analyzed in each organ and by intersection analysis. To verify changes in spatial and cellular resolution, immunofluorescent staining of critical candidates was performed in paraffin-embedded sections. Quantification focussed on brain regions with most significant changes observed in functional network analysis (MRI) at term in infants with BPD. Transcriptome expression revealed most significant regulation after 2h of O2 (upregulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, downregulation of olfactory receptor signalling), whereas regulation after 8h of MV-O2 was dominated by chemotaxis and inflammation together with downregulation of cell adhesion. Intersection analysis demonstrated the shared regulation of inflammation and cell adhesion in brain and lung. Staining verified pronounced apoptosis in the pre-defined regions, e.g., the prelimbic area, without differences in proliferation. Mouse brain MRI and studies in Ccr2 deficient mice are ongoing to further define structural and mechanistic changes. Molecular mechanism of newborn lung and brain comorbidity provoked by O2 and MV will inform future therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Introduction Extremely low birth weight infants have immature lungs at birth as well as low levels of antiinflammatory and antioxidative defences, placing them at high risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Adiponectin (APN) is produced by adipocytes and has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, and anti-proliferative effects; APN levels are quite low in premature infants. We showed that exogenous APN markedly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury (Ivanovska et al. 2020) in newborn rats. Recombinant APN is not available for human use; however, L-citrulline (L-CIT) increases APN gene expression in adult rats (Joffin et al., 2015) and upregulates expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator alpha (PGC-1alpha). PGC-1alpha is a master coactivator of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress. L-CIT levels are also low in premature infants. Thus, we sought to determine the effect of exogenous L-CIT on LPS-induced changes in protein expression of PGC-1alpha, APN, APN receptors (AdipoR1/2), cytokines, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in lung and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) homogenates, and on LPS-induced changes of intracellular ROS levels in PASMC. Methods in-vivo: Sprague Dawley rat pups were treated with L-CIT (2.5 g/kg) or saline intraperitoneally from postnatal day (PND) 1-5. On PND 5, intra-pharyngeal LPS (5mg/kg) or saline was given to L-CIT (n=4-6) or saline (n=4-6) treated animals; pups were euthanized 24 h after LPS treatment and lungs were removed and processed for western blot. In-vitro: PASMCisolated from PND 4 rats were treated with L-CIT (4 mM/ml), LPS (5mug/ml) and a combination of the two, for 3 h; cells were harvested and processed for protein expression (n=4 replicate experiments). PASMC were assayed for the level of LPS-induced intracellular ROS with fluorescence dye in the presence and absence of blocker for PGC-1alpha (SR 18292) Results In vivo, L-CIT, in the presence of LPS, increased lung protein expression of APN (1.36-fold), AdipoR1/2 (2-fold), PGC-1alpha (1.8-fold), phosphorylated AMP-kinase (2.1-fold), SOD1 (2.3-fold), SOD2 (1.7-fold), SOD3 (1.43-fold), and decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (1.2-fold), and interleukin-8 (1.28-fold) compared to saline and LPS treated animals (p<0.05 L-CIT+LPS vs saline+LPS for all proteins). In vitro, in the presence of LPS, L-CIT increased PASMC protein expression of PGC-1alpha (1.55-fold), SOD1 (2-fold), SOD2 (1.57-fold), and SOD3 (2.2-fold) compared to cells only exposed to LPS (p<0.05; L-CIT+LPS vs medium+LPS). L-CIT decreased LPS-induced ROS production in PASMC, an effect that was inhibited in the presence of PGC1alpha blocker. Conclusion L-CIT upregulates APN signaling in presence of LPS and decreases LPS-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress in newborn rats through activation of PGC1-alpha. The translational significance of these findings warrants further clinical studies of the L-CIT potential preventative/curative benefit in BPD.

AB  - Background Distinct airway microbial dysbiosis is seen in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition to dysbiosis, oxidative stress has been shown to exacerbate BPD, and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidants are protective. Previous studies revealed protected lung structure in germ free (GF) mice. In order to understand the protective mechanisms in GF mice, we analyzed Nrf2 dependent genes heme-oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) and NADPH quinone oxidoreducase-1 (Nqo1), which both neutralize reactive oxygen species and maintain redox balance. In addition, we analyzed pulmonary mechanics in an Nrf2 knockout murine model after colonization with E. coli, respiratory probiotic, or E. coli followed by respiratory probiotic. Methods 1. GF mice were intranasally inoculated with three separate doses of E. coli at P3, P6, and P9. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) treated GF mice as well as non-germ free mice (NGF) were used as controls. All groups were exposed to normoxia (21% FiO2 ) or hyperoxia (85% FiO2 ). The expression of Hmox1 and Nqo1 in lung tissue harvested at P14 was measured by qPCR. 2. C57BL/6 mice with an Nrf2 knockout were colonized through intranasal inoculation with PBS, E. coli, respiratory probiotic, or E. coli followed by respiratory probiotic on P3, P6, and P9. All groups were exposed to normoxia (21% FiO2 ) or hyperoxia (85% FiO2 ) from P3-P14. On P14, pulmonary function tests were performed. Results GF mice colonized with E. coli show a significant increase in Hmox1 and Nqo1 expression independent of hyperoxia exposure. In an Nrf2 knockout model, treatment with E. coli resulted in worsening pulmonary function in both normoxia and hyperoxia (high resistance P<0.001, low compliance). Treatment with a respiratory probiotic resulted in improvement in pulmonary function even in hyperoxic conditions (decreased resistance P<0.05, increased compliance). Conclusion Our results suggest the presence of an interaction between airway microbiome and Nrf2- dependent antioxidant responses in the lung. Through these studies, we hope to lay the foundation for microbiome related therapeutics development for BPD.

AB  - Objective Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with mortality in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and BPD-PH is characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling. Patients often receive chronic supplemental oxygen and nitric oxide (NO)/sildenifil therapy to dilate the pulmonary vasculature. In vitro studies of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) have shown that dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) promotes NO-mediated apoptosis. In this study, we hypothesized that DDAH1 is regulated by hyperoxia, and that hyperoxia regulates hPMVEC proliferation. Methods hPMVEC were grown at 37degreeC in a 60mm plate to ~70% confluence. hPMVEC were then exposed to 85% O2 or 21% O2 for 6, 12, or 24 hours, and RNA or protein harvested for RTPCR or Western blot, respectively. In a separate experiment, hPMVEC were seeded at 1x10 cells in 30mm plates, exposed to 85% O2 or 21% O2 for 24 or 72 hours and viable cell number counted by trypan blue exclusion. Newborn wild-type DDAH1 mice were exposed to 85% O2 or 21% O2 for 14 days, followed by an additional 14 days of 21% O2 , then protein was isolated from lung for DDAH1 protein by Western blot. Groups were compared by t-test, p<0.05 was significant. Results hPMVEC exposed to 24 hours of hyperoxia had lower DDAH1 RNA (N=5, p<0.05) and protein (N=6, p<0.05) compared to normoxic control cells, with no differences at 6 or 12 hours. The number of viable hPMVEC (x10 ) was greater (1.83 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.38 +/- 0.17; N=6, p<0.05) after 24 hours, and the number of viable hPMVEC (x10 ) was lower (1.26 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.19 +/- 0.22; N=6, p<0.01) after 72 hours of hyperoxia compared to normoxia control. DDAH1 protein expression in mouse lung homogenates was significantly lower after 85% O2 compared to 21% O2 mice (N=3, p<0.05). Conclusions These data support the concept that in hPMVEC, hyperoxia negatively regulates DDAH1. We observed that hyperoxia results in a proliferative phenotype that coincided with lower DDAH1 levels. In BPD-PH, where patients routinely receive life-saving hyperoxia treatment, the pathophysiology may include pulmonary endothelial-DDAH1 depletion, therefore, we speculate that therapies that up-regulate pulmonary endothelial-DDAH1 activity may protect endogenous NO production to prevent and/or treat PH. Future studies will determine the role of DDAH1 in hyperoxia-mediated hPMVEC proliferation, with a particular focus on the effects of hyperoxia-mediated DDAH1 suppression on NO-mediated apoptosis in hPMVEC.

AB  - Background: Preterm infants are at risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome. Controversial data concerning the mental and psychomotor developmental outcome exist. In this study, we compare outcome at 48 months corrected age between very preterm infants, who were exposed to chorioamnionitis, and controls. Furthermore, influential factors for mental and psychomotor development are investigated. Method(s): In this retrospective observational register study, data on preterm infants with < 32+0 weeks of gestation delivered between 2007 and 2017 were included (n = 466). Inclusion criteria were (1) a histological placental examination and (2) a complete neurodevelopmental assessment with the Bayley Scale of Infant Development II or III (n = 168). Secondary analyses consisted of linear regression models to identify which peripartal factors significantly influence later mental and psychomotor outcome (normal vs. adverse). Result(s): Overall, included infants showed a mean MDI of 91.2 (SD: 20.7) and a mean PDI of 99.4 (SD: 14.8). Infants with (n = 71) and without (n = 97) chorioamnionitis did not statistically differ either with regard to mean MDI (91.8 vs. 90.3; p = 0.29) or to mean PDI (98.3 vs. 100.9 points; p = 0.81), even after controlling for gestational age, mean APGAR scores, and administration of antenatal steroids. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was identified as the most influential factor for both MDI and PDI. Conclusion(s): We could not find an impact of chorioamnionitis on neurodevelopmental outcome of very preterm infants over an 11-year period. Our analysis shows that postpartal factors have higher impacts than does chorioamnionitis on neurodevelopmental outcome in these babies.

AB  - Background. Antibiotic overuse in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has been associated with adverse patient outcomes such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis, invasive candidiasis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurodevelopmental impairment, and death. On 11/2020 at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, the Neonatal Antimicrobial Stewardship Program Committee recommended 5 days of antibiotic therapy with a subsequent antibiotic "timeout" for uncomplicated UTI without bacteremia as part of ongoing efforts to reduce antibiotic exposure among high risk infants in 7 Level 2/3/4 NICUs. Methods. Retrospective review of all infants who received antimicrobial therapy for UTI after implementation of a UTI Diagnosis and Management Protocol. Twice weekly NEO-ASP meetings provided prospective audit and feedback to neonatologists on appropriate antibiotic therapy and duration. Pertinent clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were obtained from the infants' electronic health record. Safety measure evaluated include recurrence of infection with the same previously identified pathogen in the fourteen days after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy and mortality. Results. Since implementation of the UTI protocol, 28 infants (median gestational age, 28 wk [IQR, 26-30 wk; median birth weight, 1203 g [IQR, 731-1801 g]) received antimicrobial therapy for treatment of a UTI at a median age of 50 days (IQR, 28-69 days). The most frequent pathogens were E. coli (n=8), K. pneumoniae (n=5), and Enterobacter spp. (n=4). Median duration of antibiotic therapy was 6 calendar days (IQR, 5-6 days). Only 1 (4%) infant had antibiotic therapy restarted within 14 days of discontinuation of initial therapy; infant had fever but blood, urine, and CSF cultures were sterile and antibiotic therapy was discontinued after 48 hours. One (4%) infant (23 wk gestational age) died at 6 weeks of age from NEC totalis not related to the previous UTI. 22 (81%) infants have been discharged home while 6 remain in the NICU. Conclusion. Our preliminary data suggests that short course antibiotic therapy (with a timeout) [SP1] for uncomplicated UTIs in the NICU is an effective and safe therapy that ultimately may lead to less antibiotic exposure among high risk infants.

AB  - Purpose of Study Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) during pregnancy is associated with chronic lung disease in preterm infants, and the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We have shown that vitamin D (VD) preserves lung structure and prevents pulmonary hypertension (PH) in an experimental model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that VD treatment increases pulmonary artery endothelial cell growth and function. However, the direct effects of maternal VDD on pulmonary endothelial cell (PEC) growth and function are unknown. Thus, we seek to determine whether PEC from newborn rats exhibit altered growth and mRNA expression at birth after exposure to maternal VDD and whether these changes persist during infancy. Methods Used Female rats were fed VDD chow and shielded from UV-B light to achieve 25-OHD levels less than 10 ng/ml before mating. PEC were isolated from offspring of maternal VDD (VDD) or control (CTL) dams at postnatal days 0 and 14. PECs were used for proliferation assays and response to exogenous VEGF and 1,25-OHD. PEC lysates were also collected for RT-qPCR analysis. Summary of Results PEC isolated from VDD pups at both D0 and D14 demonstrate decreased growth compared to CTL D0 and D14 (p<0.01). VEGF or 1,25-OHD treatment increased CTL PEC growth from both D0 and D14 when compared to untreated CTL D0 and D14 PEC (p<0.01). In contrast, neither VEGF nor 1,25-OH treatment increased D0 VDD PEC growth. D14 VDD PEC showed an increased growth with VEGF treatment compared to untreated D14 VDD PEC (p<0.01). RNA isolated from D0 VDD PEC demonstrate decreased expression of KDR and eNOS and increased VEGF expression compared to D0 CTL PEC (p<0.01), no expression changes seen at D14. Conclusions We found that D0 PEC from newborn offspring of maternal VDD dams demonstrate decreased baseline PEC growth and no responsiveness to angiogenic stimuli. At D14 VDD PEC grew poorly at baseline, and were responsive to VEGF but not 1,25-OHD treatment. We speculate that maternal VDD disrupts normal PEC function, which persists into postnatal life and may contribute to high risk for late cardiopulmonary disease.

AB  - Purpose of Study Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) leads to worse outcomes in former preterm neonates. Elevated platelets at birth are an independent predictor of BPD, increased platelet derived protein after birth is associated with higher rates of neonatal pulmonary vascular disease, and perinatal platelet transfusions are associated with higher rates of mortality and BPD. Circulating platelets from neonatal mice with experimental PH are increased and express a higher percentage of active aIIbb3, a marker of platelet activation. NBEAL 2 knock-out (KO) mice lack platelet alpha granules, have low platelet counts, and have decreased platelet function in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that NBEAL 2 KO neonatal mice would be protected from hypoxia-induced PH. Methods Used Neonatal wild-type (WT) and NBEAL 2 KO offspring were placed in hypobaric hypoxia (18,000 feet) or remained in normoxia at Denver altitude for 2 weeks. PH was assessed by Fulton's index as a marker of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP). Data were analyzed by Prism with unpaired t-test or 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. Significance level p<0.05. Summary of Results Right ventricular systolic pressure is higher in NBEAL2 KO mice than in WT mice at baseline (24.2+/-0.5 - 21.5+/-0.3, p<0.0001, mmHg). There is no difference between baseline right ventricular hypertrophy between NBEAL2 KO mice and WT mice (0.27+/-0.01 -0.31+/- 0.01, ns). NBEAL2 KO mice display comparable hypoxia-induced increase in RVSP compared to WT mice (29+/-1 - 30+/-1, ns, mmHg). NBEAL2 KO mice display comparable hypoxiainduced increase in RVH compared to WT mice (0.3+/- 0.03 - 0.4+/-0.03, ns). Conclusions Platelet alpha granule deficiency is a risk factor for neonatal pulmonary vasoconstriction at baseline. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of platelets in neonatal PH associated with BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) leads to worse outcomes in former preterm neonates. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor, smooth muscle mitogen, and is increased in the lungs of infants who died with severe BDP. Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, is increased in adult patients and animals with experimental PH. Serotonin signaling blockade decreases pulmonary vascular resistance and prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling in preclinical models. We hypothesized that TPH1 knock-out (KO) neonatal mice would be protected from hypoxia induced BPD associated with PH. Methods Used Neonatal wild-type (WT) and TPH1 KO offspring were placed in hypoxia or remained in normoxia at Denver altitude for 2 weeks. To assess alveolar development, inflation fixed lungs were analyzed for surface area (SA) and mean linear intercept (MLI). To identify total number of small vessels (<30 mm), lung sections were immunostained with Factor VIII. PH was assessed by Fulton's index and right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP). Platelet poor plasma (PPP), platelet, and lung homogenate 5-HT levels were measured by ELISA. Data were analyzed by Prism with unpaired t-test or 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. Significance level p<0.05. Summary of Results At baseline, WT mice have more platelet poor plasma, platelet, and lung 5-HT than KO mice (53+/-6 - 9+/-1, p<0.0001; 275+/-11 - 56+/-12, p<0.0001; 18+/-2 - 10+/-1, p<0.004; respectively, ng/mL). TPH1 KO mice were not protected from hypoxia-induced alveolar simplification, shown by no difference compared to WT mice MLI and SA, nor were they protected against hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular simplification, shown by no difference compared to WT mice vessel density. TPH1 KO mice were attenuated to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, shown by reduction in RVSP (32+/-0.66 - 29+/-0.55, p<0.006, mmHg). There was less PPP and platelet 5-HT in hypoxia-exposed WT mice compared to WT mice at baseline (20+/-2 - 53+/-6, p<0.0001 and 117+/-27 - 275+/-11, p<0.0001, respectively, ng/mL). There was less lung 5-HT in hypoxia-exposed KO mice than in KO mice at baseline (2+/-1 - 10+/-1, p<0.001, ng/mL). Conclusions Neonatal TPH1 KO mice are not protected against hypoxia-induced lung injury. Surprisingly, this study contradicts the current understanding of the role of 5-HT in adults with PH and in adult models of hypoxia-induced PH. We found decreased plasma and platelet 5-HT following hypoxia exposure. We speculate that decreased 5-HT observed in hypoxia may contribute to neonatal hypoxia-induced alveolar simplification and impaired vascular development. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of 5-HT in the developing lung.

AB  - Purpose of Study In adult lung, alveolar type II cells (AT2s) serve as facultative stem cells. They proliferate in response to injuries to regenerate and repair the alveoli. There is lack of information on whether AT2s in immature lungs undergoing alveologenesis, such as those of preterm neonates may act as resident stem cells and undergo proliferation in response to injuries that cause BPD. Genetic inactivation of both TGFb receptors in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) arrested alveologenesis causing a BPD phenocopy. Alveolar arrest was accompanied by decreased number of SCMF and AT2s, thus suggesting cross-communication between the two cell types during alveologenesis. To determine the mechanism, we quantified AT2 cell numbers in control and mutant lungs at postnatal days 7 and 14 (PN7 and PN14) during alveologenesis. Methods Used A total of 12 mouse lungs, (control, n=6, and mutant, n=6) were examined at PN7 and PN14 (n=3 for each control and mutant.) Immuno-histochemistry and immuno-fluorescence were performed on multiple samples of lung tissues. AT2s were identified as SPC positive cells. Proliferating AT2s (pAT2s) were identified as SPC; KI67 double positive cell. To correct for hypoplasia in BPD samples, all results were normalized against total lung cells, identified as DAPI positive. Summary of Results In PN7 lungs, the ratio of AT2s/total cells (SPC+/DAPI+) was higher in mutant vs control (AT2s: 10.77% vs 8.58, respectively) likely due to reduction in DAPI + cells that included reduced SCMF. The pAT2s remained unchanged (pAT2: mutant 0.47% vs control 0.54%). In contrast, in PN14 lungs, both total AT2s, and pAT2s decreased in the mutant lungs vs control (total AT2s: 8.62% vs 10.54%, respectively) and (pAT2: 0.50% vs 0.93%, respectively) indicating that proliferation of both SCMF and AT2s has decreased. Conclusions In mutant lungs, TGFb receptors inactivation decreases SCMF numbers, while AT2s are unaffected in early phases of BPD-like pathogenesis. As the phenotype and loss of SCMF become more established and widespread, inhibition of AT2 proliferation becomes measurable. Two conclusions are derived from these observations: 1) targeted SCMF have a regulatory impact on AT2 proliferation, which is a regenerative response to injury. 2) Despite important differences between mouse phenocopy and human BPD, similar dynamics may occur in the lungs of preterm infants who develop BPD. Response of the endogenous stem cells (i.e. AT2s) in the lung to initial injuries may be governed by an orthologous mesenchymal cell type (SCMF-like) and their communications with AT2 stem cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal chronic lung disease characterized by impaired pulmonary alveolar development in preterm infants. Until now, little is known about the molecular and cellular basis of BPD. There is increasing evidence that lncRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis during lung organogenesis. The potential role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of BPD is unclear. This study aims to clarify the role of MALAT1 during the process of BPD in preterm infants and illustrate the protective effect of MALAT1 involved in preterm infants., METHODS: We assessed the expression of MALAT1 in BPD mice lung tissues by reanalyzing dataset GSE25286 (Mouse GEO Genome 4302 Array) from gene expression database gene expression omnibus (GEO), and verified MALAT1 expression in BPD patients by realtime q-PCR. Then the role of MALAT1 in regulating cell biology was examined by profiling dataset GSE43830. The expression of CDC6, a known antiapoptopic gene was verified in BPD patients and the alveolar epithelial cell line A549 cells in which MALAT1 was knocked down. Cell apoptosis was determined by FACS using PI/Annexin-V staining., RESULTS: The expression of MALAT1 was significantly evaluated in lung tissues of BPD mice at day 14 and day 29 compared to WT (P < 0.05). In consistent with mRNA array profiling analysis, MALAT1 expression level in blood samples from preterm infants with BPD was significantly increased. Bioinformative data analysis of MALAT1 knockdown in WI-38 cells showed various differentially expressed genes were found enriched in apoptosis related pathway. Down-regulation of antiapoptopic gene, CDC6 expression was further verified by q-PCR result. PI/Annexin-V apoptisis assay results showed that MALAT1 knocked down in the alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) promotes cell apoptosis., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that up-regulation of lncRNA MALAT1 could protect preterm infants with BPD by inhibiting cell apoptosis. These data provide novel insights into MALAT1 regulation which may be relevant to cell fate and shed light on BPD prevention and treatment.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is histopathologically characterized alveolar simplification in preterm infants who are chronically mechanically ventilated. Mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles (MEx) treatment improved alveolar formation in mouse neonatal hyperoxia models of BPD. We tested the hypothesis that MEx will improve alveolar formation in chronically mechanically ventilated preterm lambs. Methods Used Preterm lambs (128d; term ~150d; ~28w human gestation) were exposed to antenatal steroids, perinatal surfactant, and resuscitated and supported by mechanical ventilation for 6-7d (Drager VN500, SIMV). Physiological targets were PaO260-90 mmHg, PaCO245-60 mmHg, O2 saturation 88-92%, pH 7.25-7.35. One group was treated with MEx (60 x 106 cell equivalents; 10 mL; n=8; 4F 4M) at hours of life 6 and 78 (iv); the control group received vehicle (MEx diluent in saline; 10 mL; n=8; 4F 4M). We used morphometry and stereology to quantify structural indices of alveolar formation, and immunoblot to quantify apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) and proliferation (PCNA). Summary of Results Radial alveolar count and secondary septal volume density were significantly greater (* p<0.05) in the MEx-treated group compared to the control group (figure 1A and B). Distal airspace wall thickness was significantly narrower in the MEx-treated group compared to the control group (figure 1C). Normalized cleaved caspase 3 protein abundance was not different between the MEx-treated and control groups (0.71+/-0.05 vs 0.69+/-0.04, respectively). Normalized PCNA protein abundance was significantly lower in the MExtreated group versus the control group (0.43+/-0.05 vs 0.55 +/-0.05, respectively). No differences were detected between females and males. Conclusions We conclude that MEx improved alveolar formation in chronically mechanically ventilated preterm lambs. We speculate that MEx may be an effective therapy to promote normal structural development of the lung in preterm infants who require mechanical ventilation and are at-risk of developing BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study The AAP recommends use of expressed breast milk (EBM) or donor human milk (DHM) in preterm infants fortified with proteins, minerals, and vitamins to ensure optimum nutrient intake. Unfortunately, the implementation of EBM/DHM fortified with human milk-based fortifiers (EHM) can place an economic burden on individual institutions raising concerns on the economic feasibility of such products. The objective of this study is to assess the clinical impact of using EHM in very low birth weight infants (VLBW) infants, and to perform a cost-benefit analysis of its use. Methods Used Retrospective study of all VLBW infants admitted to neonatal intensive unit before and after the implementation on the use of EHM. Neonatal demographics and clinical outcomes such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), late-onset sepsis (LOS), and average length-ofstay (ALOS) were collected from January - December 2016 (before implementation) and January - December 2020 (after implementation). The net cost to the institution was estimated using published data for each outcome measure. Summary of Results After excluding deceased infants in both time periods, 45 infants were included in the pre-EHM analysis period, (mean birth weight (BW): 1034 g, mean gestational age (GA): 27.9 weeks), and 27 infants were included in the post-EHM analysis period (mean BW: 1070 g, mean GA: 28.8 weeks). Our institution's product acquisition cost in 2020 was estimated to be $313,784. The implementation of the EHM protocol saw a reduction in the ALOS by 12.9 days and average total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use by 7 days per infant in the post-EHM group equating to a net savings of $1,176,670. While there was a small difference in the number of morbidities between the two time periods, when combining the cost avoidance to include medical NEC, and BPD, the estimated financial impact excluding insurance reimbursement rose to $1,331,130 (table 1). Conclusions Our preliminary findings suggest that implementation of exclusive human-milk feeding in VLBW infants is a cost-effective option for NICUs that can result in decrease in NEC, BPD, TPN use and length of stay for these infants at nominal cost.

AB  - Purpose of Study Human neonates rely on adequate uptake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for appropriate lung development. Low circulating neonatal DHA is associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and is exacerbated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Lung uptake of DHA from the neonatal circulation is primarily in the form of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lisophosphatidylcholine (LPC) DHA. Cellular uptake of PC-DHA and LPC-DHA is maximized by the omega-3 fatty acid transporter MFSD2a, which in other tissue types increases expression under conditions of low DHA. We previously demonstrated, in a rat model, that IUGR decreases total circulating DHA in male but not female rat pups. However, the effect of IUGR on serum and lung PC-DHA and LPC-DHA, as well as on lung Mfsd2a mRNA levels is currently unknown. We hypothesize that IUGR causes sex-divergent decreases in serum and lung PC-DHA and LPCDHA in association increased Mfsd2a in the rat. Methods Used IUGR was induced via bilateral uterine artery ligation in pregnant Sprague Dawley rats. Control dams received anesthesia only. Rat pups were euthanized at term csection delivery, and serum and lung tissue collected. PC-DHA and LPC-DHA were measured using GC/MS. MFSD2a mRNA was measured using real-time RT PCR. Two-way ANOVA was used to assess interaction effects, t-test was used to assess group differences. Summary of Results Results are IUGR as% of control+/-SD, *P<.05. A significant IUGR-sex interaction effect occurred for serum PC-DHA whereby IUGR decreased serum PC-DHA in male rat pups (64+/-7%*), with no change in female rat pups. No other interaction effects were observed. IUGR decreased serum LPC-DHA (65+/-30%*). Within the lung, IUGR decreased PC-DHA and LPC DHA (85+/-8%* and 79+/-23%* respectively). IUGR also increased lung Mfsd2a mRNA (159 +/-76%*). Conclusions IUGR decreases lung PC-DHA and LPC-DHA in rat pups in association with increased Mfsd2a mRNA expression of both sexes. In contrast, the IUGR-induced decreased serum PC-DHA is restricted to male rat pups. We speculate that upregulation of lung Mfsd2a may be a compensatory mechanism to maximize lung DHA uptake in IUGR.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) primarily affects extremely preterm infants and has been associated with high mortality and morbidity. An online estimator for BPD severity was developed by NICHD that may guide interventions. This study aims to investigate the optimal use of the estimator for BPD prediction. Methods Used This retrospective single-center study included infants of 23-30 weeks gestation weighing  1,250 grams. Relevant variables were entered into the estimator which provides severity probability scores for five categories: no BPD, mild, moderate, severe, or death. Generalized additive modeling was used to develop probability score trajectories for each severity category. A receiver operating characteristic curve and the Youden's J statistics, followed by a narrowed grid search, were used to assess predictability of severe BPD or death. Summary of Results A total of 469 infants were included in the study. Direct use of the highest probability score for BPD prediction yielded 29% accuracy due to close proximity of probability scores between categories as assessed by probability score trajectories (figure 1A). Using combined severe and death scores as well as combined no BPD and mild BPD scores resulted in improved trajectory separations, which may convey improved predictability (figure 1B). After a grid serach, we found a combined severe and death probability score with a cutoff value of 21% resulted in an optimal overall accuracy rate of 75% in predicting a composite outcome of severe BPD or death (table 1 and figure 1C). Conclusions Combining probability scores of different categories may improve BPD outcome prediction.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of premature birth. Whether right ventricular (RV) injury or chronically increased afterload are more responsible for long-term RV dysfunction in BPD is unknown. We aim to determine key drivers of RV dysfunction in BPD using both experimental data and a computational model. We hypothesize that decreased mitochondrial energetics and active force generation are critical contributors. Method(s): Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were delivered at term to timed-pregnant dams and exposed to either room air (Nx) or 85% fraction inspired O (Hx) for 4, 8, or 14 days. Multiscale experimental data was obtained at postnatal day 21 and used to parameterize the previously published computational model of the heart and circulation, which integrates myocardial mechanics and mitochondrial energetics. Result(s): Despite increased RV afterload in the 8-and 14-day exposure groups (Fig. 1A) and significant RV hypertrophy in the 14-day group (Fig. 1B), there was no change in ejection fraction (EF) due to high variability (Fig. 1C). We used the computational model to explore how multiscale features of RV injury impact RV EF (Fig. 1D). Whereas decreased mitochondrial function, decreased cross-bridge maximum force, and increased RV afterload further reduce predicted RV EF in the 14- day Hx rat with the lowest EF (red symbol) and RV EF in the 14-day Nx rat with the highest EF (blue symbol), EF can be restored in a simulated reversal of these injuries in the Hx rat. Conclusion(s): Our approach provides valuable insight into key features of RV injury in BPD. Different degrees and combination of injuries at multiple scales can explain functional heterogeneity and may enable more accurate predictions of long-term RV dysfunction.

AB  - Background Medical team composition at the delivery of high-risk neonates may contribute to better outcomes. The presence of 24-hour (h) in-house staff neonatologist (NN) may improve delivery room (DR) care practices and outcomes. Objectives To assess if 24-h in-house NN coverage is associated with better care practices and outcomes among inborn infants born < 29 weeks GA. Design/Methods Cross-sectional cohort study of 2476 inborn infants born at 23-28 weeks gestation, admitted in 2014-2015 to Canadian Neonatal Network level 3 NICUs with a maternity unit that participated in a 2015 survey on NICU coverage. Exposures were classified using survey responses based on the most senior provider offering 24-h in-house coverage: NN, fellow, and no NN/fellow. Primary outcome was death and/or major morbidity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe neurological injury, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between exposures and outcomes and adjust for confounders with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within each site. Results Among the 28 participating NICUs, most senior providers ensuring 24-h in-house coverage were NN (32%, 9/28), fellows (39%, 11/28), and no NN/fellow (29%, 8/28). Infants' characteristics are shown in Table 1. No NN/fellow coverage and 24-h fellow coverage were associated with higher odds of infants receiving DR chest compressions or epinephrine compared to 24-h NN coverage (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.72, 95% CI 2.12-10.6 and AOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.44-7.70, respectively) (Table 2). 24-h fellow coverage was associated with higher odds of normothermia (36.5degreeC-37.2degreeC) on admission (AOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.51-3.37) compared to 24-h NN coverage (Table 2). Rates of mortality or major morbidity did not differ significantly among the three groups: NN, 63% (249/395); fellow, 64% (1092/1700); no NN/fellow, 70% (266/381). Compared to 24-h NN coverage, 24-h fellow coverage was associated with lower odds of mortality (AOR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.43-0.88) (Table 2). Conclusion 24-h in-house NN coverage was associated with lower rates of DR chest compressions or epinephrine use; however, it was not associated with death and/or major morbidity. These results are from a survey linked cohort, and data on the actual presence of individuals in NICU/resuscitation is unknown. Future prospective research on care providers present in the NICU, and its impact on outcomes, is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extremely premature infants are at a high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). Prolonged patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) may worsen PH; however, due to the lack of evidence supporting improvement in outcomes after strategies to promote ductal closure, our center has adopted a strict non-intervention policy since 2013. OBJECTIVE(S): Assess PH prevalence and severity, as well as the impact of BPD on echocardiographic parameters of cardiac performance. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective cohort of infants <29 weeks gestational age at birth, admitted between 2015 and 2019, and without genetic/congenital anomalies. Measurements from the echocardiography acquired closest to 36 weeks were done by masked experts. Severe BPD was defined as positive pressure support at 36 weeks. PH was defined as an estimated systolic pulmonary pressure (SPAP) =40 mmHg or an abnormal septal curvature by eccentricity index (EI) (>1.3). RESULT(S): Out of 387 infants, 222 were included, of which 27 (12%) were categorized as severe BPD and 78 (35%) had PH. Severe BPD was associated with lower birth weight (704+/-214 vs 842+/-229g, p<0.01), longer hospitalization (median 138 [IQR 108-167] vs 103 [IQR 86-125] days, p<0.01) and longer mechanical ventilation duration (median 82 [IQR 33-107] vs 17 [IQR 2-32] days, p<0.01), with no difference in gestational age at birth. Severe BPD was associated with PH (70% vs 43%, p<0.01). The combined outcome of death (after the 36 weeks echocardiography) or severe BPD was associated with PH (68% vs 30%, p<0.01), smaller left ventricle length in diastole (2.8+/-0.5 vs 3.0+/-0.5 cm, p=0.03), decrease in the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (0.7+/-0.2 vs 0.9+/-0.2 cm, p<0.01), abnormal EI (1.31+/-0.25 vs 1.17+/-0.18, p<0.01) and smaller right ventricle fraction area change (41.3+/-5.8 vs 47.8+/-7.6%, p<0.01), without a significant increase on SPAP (35+/-21 vs 35+/-14, p=0.15). Other echocardiographic markers were similar. CONCLUSION(S): In the context of a PDA non-intervention policy, a third of our population was affected by PH at 36 weeks. Furthermore, those with severe BPD or death had signs of RV dysfunction (despite similar SPAP estimate), indicating that the effect of BPD on pulmonary vascular remodelling and cardiac function may be underestimated.

AB  - Background In a health care system with limited resources, hospital organizational factors such as unit occupancy and nurse-topatient ratios may contribute to patient outcomes. Objectives We aimed to assess the association of NICU occupancy and nurse staffing with outcomes of very preterm infants born < 33 weeks gestational age (GA). Design/Methods This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of infants born 23-32 weeks GA without major congenital anomaly, admitted within 2 days after birth to one of four Level 3 NICUs in Quebec, Canada (2015-2018). For each 8 h shift, data on unit occupancy were obtained from a central provincial database (SiteNeo) and linked to the hospital nursing hours database (Logibec). Unit occupancy rates and nursing provision ratios (nursing hours/recommended nursing hours based on patient dependency categories) were pooled for the first shift, 24 h, and 7 days of admission for each infant. Patient data were obtained from the Canadian Neonatal Network database. Primary outcome was mortality and/or morbidity (severe neurological injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and lateonset sepsis, severe retinopathy of prematurity). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for association of exposure with outcomes were estimated using generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for center, while adjusting for confounders (gestational age, small for gestational age, sex, outborn, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology version 2, mode of delivery, and the other organizational variables). Results Among 1870 infants included in analyses, 796 (43%) had mortality/morbidity. Median occupancy was 89% (IQR 82-94) and median nursing provision was 1.13 (IQR 0.97-1.37). Overall higher NICU occupancy on shift of admission, first 24 h, and 7 days were associated with higher odds of mortality/morbidity (Figure 1) but nursing provision was not (Figure 2). Subgroup analysis by GA (< 29 and 29-32 weeks) yielded similar results (not shown). Generalized linear mixed model analyses showed that a 5% reduction in occupancy in the first 24 h of admission was associated with a 6% reduction in mortality/morbidity. Conclusion NICU occupancy is associated with mortality/morbidity among very preterm infants and may reflect lack of adequate resources in periods of high activity. Interventions aimed at reducing occupancy and maintaining adequate resources need to be considered as strategies to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Background and Objective(s): The incidence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes increases with each week of decreasing gestation in preterm birth. The General Movement Assessment (GMA), particularly the presence of fidgety movements (FM), is an indicator of neurological health in young infants. Atypical classifications of FM are related to the development of cerebral palsy (CP) and other neurodevelopmental atypia. Our objective was to describe the range of GMA findings between 12 and 16 weeks corrected age (CA) in a population of infants meeting criteria for high-risk follow-up clinics and also a cohort of late preterm infants who do not meet traditional follow-up criteria. Study Design: Prospective cohort design. Study Participants & Setting: Infants were recruited prospectively from three (level IV) NICU centers in Chicago between August 2019 and January 2021. Recruited infants required either a NICU hospitalization for moderate-late preterm birth (32-36 weeks gestation) or for high risk of cerebral palsy including very preterm birth (<32 weeks) or other neurological risk factors (abnormal head ultrasound or MRI findings). Materials/Methods: Parents of enrolled infants created GMA recordings using the Baby Moves smartphone app between 12 and 16 weeks CA. Infant's spontaneous movements were recorded for 3 minutes while the infant was supine, in a calm and alert state. Videos were scored by at least two blinded raters using the Prechtl methodology and FM were assigned either normal, abnormal, sporadic, or absent classifications. Result(s): 94 infants received a GMA score. 74 infants (79%) were rated as normal and 20 infants (21%) were scored as having an atypical FM classification (abnormal 1; sporadic 8; absent 11). Of the infants who were born moderate-late preterm (n=25), 23 (92%) were classified as normal, 1 (4%) as sporadic, and 1 (4%) as absent. In the high-risk cohort (n=69), 51 were classified as normal (74%), 1 abnormal (1%), 7 sporadic (10%), and 10 absent (14%). Children classified as having absent FM had at least one of the following co-morbidities: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, grade III or IV interventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, genetic syndrome, or congenital anomalies. Conclusions/Significance: In our sample, the incidence of atypical FM was lower in the moderate-late preterm cohort as compared to the high-risk infants who receive follow-up; this finding may be reflective of the well-known risk stratification of children's gestational age at birth. While the majority of moderate-late preterm infants had normal FM, screening may be beneficial in this population to triage early intervention to babies who demonstrate early behavioral deviations. Additionally, little is known about the absence of fidgety movements in children with congenital malformations and genetic syndromes; long-term follow-up is required to understand the developmental trajectories of infants with various risk factors.

AB  - Background Compared to appropriate for gestation (AGA) infants, small for gestation (SGA, defined as < 10 percentile birthweight for gestation and sex) infants are at higher risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity, diseases associated with oxidative stress. Although blood transfusions are associated with oxidative stress, it is unknown how SGA and AGA infants react to blood transfusion. Objectives To determine oxidative stress in SGA and AGA infants after blood transfusion. Methods A prospective observational study of infants <30 weeks gestation at birth who received blood transfusion. Exclusion criteria included any blood product administered within 3 weeks, sepsis, renal and liver disorders. Urine was collected pre-transfusion, and at 24-48 and 49-72-hours posttransfusion. ELISAs were used to measure thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), 8-isoprostane and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) as markers of lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidative injury. Levels were normalized to the urinary creatinine levels. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way non-paired Student t test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables as appropriate and c2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Linear regression was performed to adjust for confounders. Results 58 AGA & 14 SGA infants were enrolled in the study for analysis. The demographic characteristics of the study participants in each group were quite comparable except for difference in birth weight as expected, small but statistical difference in gestational age and rate of caesarean section. Higher rates of caesarean section among the SGA group could be explained probably by the factors that complicate the delivery; though all infants in the SGA group received antenatal corticosteroids. Mean age at blood transfusion was around 3 weeks in both the groups. Urinary TBARs were higher in the SGA infants at baseline, they increased at 24-48 hours post transfusion and then declined at 49-72 hours but still were higher than the AGA group, the difference being statistically insignificant. The pattern of results were similar to TBAR's with the difference being statistically insignificant. When we analyzed the results for urinary 8OHdG between the two groups, there were significantly higher levels of urinary 8-OHdG in SGA infants compared to AGA infants at the two post-transfusion time points. Oxidative stress was further increased in SGA infants at 49-72 hours whereas levels were declining in AGA infants (p 0.001). When the data was adjusted for gestational age, birthweight, post-natal age in days, sex, antenatal steroids and mode of delivery using a general linear model, the differences in 8-OHdG remained significant with p= 0.009 at 24-48 and p= 0.04 at 49-72 hours. Conclusions SGA infants have increased oxidative stress after blood transfusions which may contribute to the higher incidence of BPD and ROP in this population. Our data suggests that transfusing blood to SGA infants should be done judiciously.

AB  - Epigenetic age acceleration is a risk factor for chronic diseases of ageing and may reflect aspects of biological ageing. However, few studies have examined epigenetic ageing during the early neonatal period in preterm infants, who are at heightened risk of developmental problems. We examined relationships between neonatal age acceleration, neonatal morbidities, and neurobehavioral domains among very preterm (<30 weeks gestation) infants to characterize whether infants with early morbidities or different neurobehavioral characteristics had accelerated or decelerated epigenetic ageing. This study uses data from the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants (NOVI) study, restricted to infants with data on variables assessed (n = 519). We used generalized estimating equations to test for differences in age acceleration associated with severe neonatal medical morbidities and neurobehavioral characteristics. We found that infants with neonatal morbidities, in particular, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), had accelerated epigenetic age - and some evidence that infants with hypertonicity and asymmetric reflexes had increased and decreased age acceleration, respectively. Adjustment for gestational age attenuated some associations, suggesting that the relationships observed may be driven by the duration of gestation. Our most robust finding shows that very preterm infants with neonatal morbidities (BPD in particular) exhibit age acceleration, but most neonatal neurobehavioral characteristics and morbidities are not associated with early life age acceleration. Lower gestational age at birth may be an upstream factor driving these associations.

AB  - Hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in neonates, for which no specific preventive or therapeutic agent is available. Here we show that lung micro-RNA (miR)-34a levels are significantly increased in lungs of neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia. Deletion or inhibition of miR-34a improves the pulmonary phenotype and BPD-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in BPD mouse models, which, conversely, is worsened by miR-34a overexpression. Administration of angiopoietin-1, which is one of the downstream targets of miR34a, is able to ameliorate the BPD pulmonary and PAH phenotypes. Using three independent cohorts of human samples, we show that miR-34a expression is increased in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome and BPD. Our data suggest that pharmacologic miR-34a inhibition may be a therapeutic option to prevent or ameliorate HALI/BPD in neonates.

AB  - Background Respiratory Distress Syndrome affects approximately 50% of babies born under 32 weeks gestation. Surfactant is a key component in reducing surface lung tension, and despite the administration of antenatal steroids to mothers at risk of preterm delivery to promote surfactant production, many preterm babies are born with surfactant deficiency. If left untreated babies require increasing respiratory support, and potential complications such as pneumothorax, the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, home oxygen and increased susceptibility to infections. Traditionally surfactant administration requires babies to be intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. With this technique there are many potential complications, including the use of drugs for sedation during intubation, the risk of trauma and subsequent airway abnormalities, and the risk of barotrauma to the lungs due to persistent use of high pressure ventilation. Objectives Less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) delivers surfactant directly to the lungs via a tracheal fine-bore catheter avoiding invasive ventilation. Following introduction into our unit in May 2018 we determined LISA efficacy by comparing total ventilation days, total non-invasive ventilation days, total oxygen days and bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates between babies who received surfactant via LISA to those following intubation. Methods Between May 2018 and October 2019 89 babies were identified via Badgernet as having received surfactant. We included only those infants between 26 + 0 and 32 + 6 weeks gestation producing groups with comparable gestation and birth weight. Using a data collection form and retrospective analysis of the Badgernet generated database we compared the demographics and long-term outcomes for infants receiving surfactant via LISA to those following intubation. Rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were collected from NNAP data. Results We found that there was a reduction in median invasive ventilation days (0 vs. 2 days), non-invasive respiratory support days (0 days vs. 39 days) and total oxygen days (5 vs. 34.5 days) in the LISA cohort compared those receiving surfactant via endotracheal tube. One infant required home oxygen in the LISA cohort vs. eight in the non-LISA. There was a 9% reduction in BPD rates after introduction of LISA according to NNAP data. Eight babies required intubation following unsuccessful LISA. Compared to their successful counterparts median invasive ventilation days, non-invasive respiratory support days and total oxygen days were 1.5 days, 17.5 days and 10 days respectively. Of the babies who required intubation five had a complete course of antenatal steroids, and three an incomplete course. Conclusions Following the introduction of LISA we successfully saw a reduction in total ventilation days, total non-invasive ventilation days, total oxygen days and bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates. With LISA becoming a standard of care for infants requiring surfactant and part of a package aimed at reducing BPD rates in our unit, we hope to see a sustained reduction in ventilation days and BPD rates. As no discriminating factor amongst those infants requiring intubation post LISA could be identified no changes have been made to the eligibility criteria for LISA.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease with a significant genetic component. Novel genes and associated pathways may play an important role in susceptibility for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Our aim was to identify rare genetic variants contributing to the new form of BPD phenotype by full exome sequencing. Full exome sequencing was performed on 39 DNA samples from patients with moderate and severe new BPD and 30 DNA samples from control group without clinical signs of BPD. After mapping and annotation, each sample showed an average of 40,000 genetic variants with a reading depth of at least 70x. All autosomal variants were filtered for allelic frequency <1% according to the gnomAD database (version 2.1). Among them, 821 variants were found the most common (>=10%) in both the control and experimental group. Wherein 280 variants were presented with an alternative allele frequency of more than 10% in the experimental group, but were found with a lower frequency in the control. Interestingly, 10 of these 280 variants were located in the ZNF717 gene. This gene encodes a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc-finger protein, which belongs to a large group of transcriptional regulators in mammals and play important roles in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Extended bioinformatics analysis showed that 34 unique variants were found in the experimental group and were absent in the control group, which may indicate both the characteristics of Russian children with BPD and the insufficient representativeness of the control group and, in turn, requires a more in-depth analysis. For the first time in Russia, large-scale studies have been carried out to identify the molecular genetic characteristics of Russian children with BPD using full exome sequencing. Our study indicates ZNF717 gene may be relevant in BPD pathogenesis, but further research is required. These preliminary results may contribute to improving knowledge of the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and targeting therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Purpose : The objective of this case series is to discuss the role of repeat intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) in treating posterior retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). To our knowledge, there are only 2 other reported cases using repeat intravitreal injections (IVI) for ROP. Methods : We report 2 cases of premature infants born at gestational age (GA) 23-24 weeks (w) with birthweight (BW) of 540-601g at university neonatal intensive care units who were treated with IVR (0.25 mg/0.025 mL) for recurrent posterior ROP followed by delayed laser for anterior recurrence. Results : First case is a female (GA = 23-2/7w, BW = 540 g) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and sepsis. Exam at post-menstrual age (PMA) 31-3/7w showed zone 1, stage 3, no plus in both eyes (OU) and was treated with IVR OU. Repeat IVR was given OU at 38-0/7w for recurrence (zone 1-2, stage 2, pre-plus OU). Laser was performed OU at 47- 4/7w for zone 2, stage 3 with pre-plus OU. The following week, patient had worsening plus OU and was treated with additional laser. ROP regressed OU at follow up. Second case is a female (GA = 23 4/7w, BW = 601 g) with BPD, sepsis, and hypotension. IVR OU were given at 34-1/7w for vitreous hemorrhages (VH) OU and zone 1, stage 3 with plus OU. OS was reinjected at 39-1/7w for worsening VH and zone 1, stage 2, pre-plus and OD at 40-1/7w for zone 1, stage 2, pre-plus. At 51-1/7w, ROP reactivated (anterior zone 2, stage 3 without plus) and laser was performed. ROP regressed OU at follow up. Conclusions : Repeat IVI was selected over laser because of posterior recurrence. A second IVI was performed to allow further peripheral vascularization of the retina, with the added benefit of avoiding general anesthesia in critically ill infants until they are older. IVR was chosen because it has a shorter systemic half-life compared to bevacizumab, theoretically causing less side effects. However, ranibizumab has been associated with earlier ROP recurrence compared to bevacizumab. In conclusion, this case series demonstrates the use of repeat IVR in posterior recurrence of ROP. As advances in neonatal care continue to evolve and infant viability extends to younger GA, the use of repeat IVI for ROP may be increasingly necessary. Future studies could seek to determine the safest and most effective agent, dose, and interval for repeat IVI. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background & Aim: Complications of extreme prematurity are the number one killer of infants under 5 years of age. The chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most severe complication of prematurity. BPD occurs following ventilator treatment with supplemental oxygen for acute respiratory failure and early inflammation. The hallmarks of the lung pathology are arrested lung development including fewer and larger alveoli with less septation, thickening of alveolar septa and impaired development of the capillary network. These changes may lead to life-long respiratory morbidity including asthma, reduced exercise capacity, early-onset emphysema and pulmonary hypertension. So far, there is no cure for BPD. Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) improve lung structure and function in experimental BPD, and early phase clinical trials are underway. However, despite having the same tissue of origin, UC-MSCs are a heterogeneous cell population, and identification of optimal UC-MSC donor remains to be determined. The aim of this project is to compare healing effects of UC-MSC term donors in hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD. Methods, Results & Conclusion(s): UC-MSCs derived from 4 term donors (donor 1, donor 2, donor 3 and donor 4) were administered intratracheally at postnatal day (P) 4 in rat pups exposed to 85% O2 from P0 to P14. Survival, lung function, lung structure and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed at P21. Pulmonary blood flow and lung vasculature were assessed at P19 and P35 respectively. Moreover, to better understand intrinsic variability between UC-MSCs derived from different donors, transcription profiles of UC-MSCs were investigated by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Treatment of hyperoxic pups with UC-MSCs from donor 1, 3 and 4, but not from donor 2, increased survival in hyperoxia-exposed developing pups. In addition, UC-MSCs from donor 1, 3 and 4, but not from donor 2, improved lung compliance, lung growth and attenuated pulmonary hypertension when compared to control hyperoxic pups. Also, scRNAseq analysis revealed that while UC-MSCs from donor 1, 3 and 4 clustered together in cluster 0, UC-MSCs from donor 2 clustered by themselves in cluster 1, and have a distinct molecular signature. Thus, UC-MSCs derived from different term donors provide different therapeutic potential in a rat BPD model. In the future, understanding of UC-MSCs' transcriptome might enable the determination of a priori of UC-MSC with superior therapeutic potential.Copyright © 2021 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy

AB  - Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common severe complication of extreme preterm birth, affecting 10,000 to 15,000 children per year in the US. The incidence is higher with decreasing gestational age and varies between > 80% in children born before 24 weeks gestation to 8-38% in children born after 27 weeks. (1) The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and comprises prenatal risk factors such as infections, pre-eclampsia and genetic susceptibility, and postnatal risk factors such as mechanical ventilation, oxygen toxicity and postnatal infections. These risk factors lead to a pulmonary inflammatory response with distorted alveolarization and impaired vasculogenesis. (2) Children with BPD may experience lifelong respiratory and non-respiratory consequences. Respiratory symptoms and hospital admissions are more frequent than in preterm born children without BPD, in particular during the first years of life. Also, lung function in children with BPD is in general lower than normal. In a systematic review it was shown that the mean difference in FEV1 for children with BPD when compared with children born term was -16% (95% CI -20, -12); this lower lung function tracks during adulthood as was shown in a meta-analysis in late adolescence and early adulthood where FEV1 Z-Score was -0.81 for children born very preterm or with a low birthweight compared to a control group of term born controls with normal birth weight. (3,4) More than 85% of patients with BPD have structural abnormalities as shown on Chest CT scans. (5) Except for respiratory sequelae, patients with BPD are also at increased risk of cardiovascular complications such as increased risk of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure. (6) Also, neurodevelopmental consequences (e.g. motor impairment, cognitive delay, lower academic performance) are more common in children with BPD. (7) Although several randomized controlled trials addressed the question how to prevent the development of BPD, only very few studies examined how children with established BPD should be managed. This was the reason to start an ERS guideline on longterm management of children with established BPD after the neonatal intensive care period. ERS guideline on long-term management of BPD The ERS guideline addressed the 8 most clinically relevant and important PICO questions in children with established BPD and who were discharged from hospital, or who were >= 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). (8) After stepwise literature searches and study selection by working groups, evidence synthesis and grading according to GRADE, recommendations were based on the balance of consequences, certainty of evidence and values. Three questions addressed monitoring of children with BPD: monitoring with lung imaging, with lung function and the question if children with BPD should be discouraged to attend day care. The latter question was included as patients and patient representatives assessed this question as highly relevant to them. For lung imaging, the Task Force recommended, based on very low certainty of evidence, to monitor children with BPD with Chest X-ray or CT scan only if they had severe disease and/or recurrent hospital admissions due to respiratory morbidity. The main reason for this was that with imaging other diseases like interstitial lung disease may be excluded. For lung function, the Task Force suggested to monitor all children with lung function. Although this does not improve outcomes, many observational studies have shown lower lung function in later life. There was no evidence on discouraging day care attendance and individual advice to parents regarding day care attendance is needed. Four questions on treatment addressed whether specific treatments can reduce morbidity and related outcomes in children with BPD. These treatments were inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, diuretics and supplemental oxygen. All recommendations were based on very low certainty of evidence. Inhaled bronchodilators were only advised for subgroups of patients, for example those with asthma-like symptoms, recurrent hospital admissions due to respiratory morbidity, exercise intolerance or reversibility in lung function. Treatment with inhaled or systemic steroids was not recommended. The Task Force considered that there was no indication for diuretics in children with established BPD but recommended in children who were already on diuretics to wean them by not increasing the dose based on their weight (natural weaning). For supplemental oxygen, there were no randomized controlled trials on the best saturation targets. Based on a RCT in children from the age of 32 weeks PMA, the Task Force suggested that supplemental oxygen should be given with a minimum saturation target of 90%. (9) It is unknown if higher oxygen saturations translate in better outcomes. Future research In contrast to prevention of BPD, there is an impressive lack of studies in children with established BPD. Future research should focus on several areas. First, the definition of BPD is now based on total days of supplemental oxygen and the severity is assessed based on the respiratory support at 36 weeks PMA. This definition is arbitrary and it is well known that extreme preterm born children who do not fit this BPD definition have decreased lung function, although to a lesser extent than children with BPD, and may also show abnormalities on Chest CT. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or lung disease due to prematurity, is a gliding scale and, as such, all (extreme) preterm born children deserve thorough follow-up including pulmonary follow-up. Second, like in asthma, BPD is rather an umbrella concept and there may be several subtypes of BPD based on early-life factors, airway-, lung- and vascular-driven pathophysiology, and/or postnatal management strategies. There is a need for biomarkers e.g. in blood or exhaled breath and/or imaging techniques like MRI to predict the development of BPD, severity of disease and long-term outcomes early in life. There is an important lack of knowledge on the pathophysiology of BPD in older children and hence on potential treatment options. Like in other respiratory diseases, the role of the Microbiome may be important. Regarding the treatment of BPD, studies on intratracheal stem cells show promising results. (10) Less appealing but urgently needed are studies on oxygen saturation targets, anti-inflammatory treatments like inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators and azithromycin. Long-term follow-up into adulthood in standardized, multidisciplinary follow-up clinics is needed to assess not only respiratory outcomes but also cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the short- and long-term. The ultimate aim of further research is to improve clinical care and quality of life of patients with BPD, and prevent consequences across the life course.

AB  - The pathophysiology of BPD is based on an impairment of lung maturation with prenatal and postnatal multi-hit insults and genetic susceptibility. BPD is the clinical expression of a mixture of lung developmental plasticity, injury and repair that ultimately results in a remarkable ability of the lungs of surviving infants to remodel until perhaps 20 years of age.1 This multifactorial pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) suggests that no single 'magic bullet' will prevent it. Thus, to avoid BPD we need to implement a complex and comprehensive strategy.2 Lui K et al.3 evaluated the outcome trends of neonates born very preterm in eleven high-income countries participating in the International Network for Evaluating Outcomes of neonates. This was a retrospective cohort study, including 154,233 neonates admitted to 529 neonatal units born between 2007 and 2015, at 24 to 31 weeks+6 days gestational age. In most countries, mortality decreased whereas BPD increased. Thus, despite major efforts to minimize injurious but often life-saving postnatal interventions, BPD remains the most frequent complication of extreme preterm birth. The strongest risk factors for BPD are prematurity and low birth weight. Almost 80% of infants who are born at 22-24 weeks of gestation are diagnosed with BPD, whereas only 20% of infants born at 28 weeks of gestation develop BPD.1 In fact, most patients with BPD survive, and imaging studies reveal that they probably have a very heterogeneous pathology throughout the lungs, including regions of decreased alveolarization, cystic emphysema, fibrosis and variable airway injury.1 Studies found that three patterns of lung disease generally emerge in the first 2 weeks of life.4 In the first pattern, infants have fairly minimal lung disease and progressively recover. In the second pattern, early persistent pulmonary deterioration, substantial and prolonged respiratory support is required from birth. In the third pattern, an initial improvement in lung disease in the first week of life is followed by a respiratory decompensation which often requires respiratory support and an increase in supplemental oxygen.4 Pulmonary hypertension continues to be a prominent clinical challenge in the pathobiology and outcomes of infants with BPD.1 Although more often considered in near-term or term infants with hypoxemia at birth, pulmonary hypertension also occurs in preterm infants. Severe parenchymal lung disease can contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance; however, abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature can also contribute to high pulmonary vascular resistance, especially in the setting of antenatal events, such as oligohydramnios and prolonged premature rupture of membranes. The definition of BPD is a challenge in face of the changes in the treated population and is an evolving process. A proposal to revise the BPD definition suggested to remove the requirement for 28 days of oxygen therapy prior to 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA), to add a requirement for radiographic confirmation of parenchymal lung disease and to use a severity grading of I-III that incorporated newer modes of non-invasive ventilation.5 A recent modification uses positive pressure instead of supplemental oxygen to classify BPD severity at 36 weeks PMA; scale is: no BPD (no support), grade 1 (nasal cannula <=2 l/min), grade 2 (nasal cannula >2 l/min or non-invasive positive airway pressure) and grade 3 (invasive mechanical ventilation). These criteria predicted death or serious respiratory morbidity at 18-26 months corrected age in 81% of infants in the study.6 The prevention of BPD is difficult, because of the complex pathophysiology. While preventing prematurity could be the best measure, there are currently no effective interventions to prevent preterm birth. Antenatal steroids do not reduce the rate of BPD.7 To reduce the incidence of BPD we need to use a comprehensive approach.2,8 The strategy to prevent BPD is based on ventilatory and nonventilatory measures. The ventilatory route allows an individualized endotracheal intubation approach with early lung recruitment with nasal respiratory support. The recommended approach is to avoid if possible endotracheal ventilation and to use non-invasive ventilation.2,8 Noninvasive ventilation has a modest effect on BPD.1,2,9 If endotracheal ventilation is needed, gentle ventilation with targeted volume ventilation or high frequency ventilation are suggested. While using ventilation we have to keep adequate oxygenation and permissive hypercapnia. The non-ventilatory measures include caffeine (the best evaluated treatment for reducing BPD), vitamin A (which is not commonly used) and nutrition. Corticosteroids, systemic or inhaled or in combination with surfactant, should be used in a way that will not harm the neurodevelopmental outcome and in the recommended indications and timing. Surfactant is used as rescue therapy and, if needed, it should be administered in a noninvasive measure; the INSURE (intubation, surfactant, extubation) approach or, probably better, the minimally invasive surfactant therapy (MIST).8,10 Alternative approaches to surfactant administration, such as nebulization and administration into the pharynx or via a laryngeal mask airway, have potential but require further assessment before general use. Optimal management strategies to enhance long-term outcomes in patients with severe BPD remain uncertain.1 The developing lung has remarkable capacity for remodeling; yet disease of the airways, airspace and vasculature can persist.1 Multiple studies have shown abnormalities in lung function and structure in patients with BPD that persist throughout childhood, adolescence and young adulthood.1 However, in spite of severe lung dysfunction and injury associated with preterm birth, most infants with BPD achieve remarkable recovery of lung structure and function.

AB  - The lower airways constitute the conduction zone of the respiratory system. They allow the passage of air from the atmosphere into the alveoli. From the lumen outward, the AW can be divided into 4 layers: mucosa and submucosa (warming, moistening and removal of particles and protective mechanisms against the external environment), musculo-cartilaginous layer (maintenance of the appropriate diameter of the airway), and adventitia (binding of the airways to adjacent structures). The anterior trachea is made up of C-shaped cartilaginous rings linked by fibroconnective tissue. The posterior membranous portion of the tracheal wall lacks cartilage; only a thin band of smooth muscle supports it. Bronchial structure is very similar to that of the trachea, although in the main bronchi, cartilage completely encircles the lumen and in the more distal bronchi cartilage is non-continuous. Alterations of the AW in Respiratory Disorders -Prematurity and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Premature babies have a larger amount of ASM than normal for both their postconceptional age and their airway size. Babies who are ventilated artificially after birth have an even larger amount of muscle.1 Little epithelial loss is present in BPD patients. The inner wall area, outer wall area, epithelium area and ASM area are all substantially larger. The increased thickness of the airway wall components may contribute to airflow obstruction in BPD patients. -Tracheo-bronchomalacia Tracheomalacia or bronchomalacia refer to weakness/softening of the respective airway wall, due to damage to cartilage integrity, reduction/ atrophy of the elastic fibers of the posterior tracheal muscle membrane, or an abnormal increase in transbronchial pressure. Bronchomalacia is caused by abnormalities/deficiencies in the bronchial cartilage that lead to collapse, or bronchiectasis. Both may be primary, secondary or acquired. Williams-Campbell syndrome (WCS) is a congenital disorder of the bronchial cartilages characterized by atrophy or absence of the subsegmental bronchial cartilages of the 4th to 6th order bronchial divisions. Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is an infrequent congenital syndrome, whose hallmark is tracheal/proximal large bronchi enlargement. Typically, tracheal wall elastic fibers are absent or atrophic. -Postinfective bronchiolitis Obliteration or stenosis of bronchioles and small bronchi are the most striking features. The mucosa is usually completely destroyed and the lumina filled with fibrous tissue. Typically arranged smooth muscle and elastic fibers are present at the periphery. Inflammatory cells, usually lymphocytes and plasma cells, are sparse. Transition from the patent proximal airway to the occluded segment is usually abrupt at a concave epithelial-covered surface. There is a sudden reduction in external diameter at the point of occlusion. The bronchiolar lumina distal to the occlusions are dilated (not collapsed) with no epithelial lining. -Smoke exposure In pregnant mice exposed to cigarette smoke from 3 weeks prior to conception until birth, the ASM layer and collagen III deposition were increased in offsprings. The passage of nicotine across the placenta significantly increased AW area per unit epithelial basement membrane in the fetal lung. Nicotine stimulates lung branching morphogenesis through alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and may contribute to dysanaptic lung growth. In vitro, exposure to cigarette smoke affects mitochondrial function (i.e., energy metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis) in human ASM cells. In vivo, the airways in adult mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke are thickened and fibrotic, and the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial function is dramatically altered in the ASM of these mice. Cigarette smoke-induced changes in mitochondrial morphology (fission/fusion balance) correlate with mitochondrial function, and thus may control ASM proliferation.2 -Asthma The tracheobronchial tree is inherently stiffer in asthma, due to AW remodeling. There is no doubt that such AW changes as observed in adult asthma occur at a very young age 3,4 Airway remodeling features reported in preschool wheezers, after the age of 1 year, include Reticular Basement Membrane (RBM) thickening, angiogenesis, epithelial shedding, and increased ASM mass. The true relationship between inflammation and remodeling in children cannot be determined. But, it is now also clear that AHR and airway inflammation (Th-2 lymphocytedirected) can manifest independently5 and also concurrently. Biopsy studies indicate a gradual development of airway remodeling in severe wheezing between infancy and school age. When present, RBM thickening may protect against airway narrowing and air trapping, by adding load on ASM. Early ASM is the only predictor of future asthma development, not RBM thickness or eosinophilic inflammation.4 Immature ASM has the potential to actively participate in airway remodeling, to a greater degree than mature ASM. This may explain why bronchial hyper-reactivity is exhibited very early in life, and is further enhanced by transient or long-term noxious stimuli.6 The contractile function of ASM cells makes the mitochondria a central player in the dynamics through its role in energy production. Beyond controlling cellular energetics, mitochondria are involved in cell proliferation and survival, calcium homeostasis and inflammation through redox signaling. There is a bidirectional link between mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial function that can explain the role of the mitochondria and its dynamics in the development of chronic lung disease. Few data are available in children. A study that revealed the existence of mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms was associated with childhood asthma. In addition, recent experiments performed in our lab on ASM taken from preschool severe asthmatic children indicate an association between ASM hypertrophy, mitochondria and mitophagy (unpublished data). Isometric contraction of ASM is not a constant feature in asthma. However, an increase in maximal shortening velocity and shortening capacity has been demonstrated.7 This is related to an increased content of myosin light chain kinase, an enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylation of 20 kDa myosin light chain and promotes shortening and/or active force via actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling.7 However, the precise role of in situ ASM dynamics in asthma is incompletely understood.5 -Bronchiectasis & Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Bronchiectasis involves progressive destruction of bronchial AW architecture, bronchial dilatation associated with loss of elastin, AW fibrosis and, in advanced cases, destruction of muscle and cartilage. In children with CF aged 0.3-16.8 years, endobronchial biopsy showed 2 forms of airway remodeling: 1) matrix breakdown, related to inflammation and proteolysis, and 2) RBM thickening, related to TGF-beta1 concentration but independent of other markers of inflammation.8 The inflammatory response in the CF airway is compartmentalized: in contrast to the neutrophil-dominated inflammation present in the airway lumen, the bronchial mucosa is characterized by the recruitment and accumulation of lymphocytes. Structure - Function of Lower Airways Maturational changes in the bronchial wall have not been extensively studied. In pigs, semistatic pressure-volume curves in isolated bronchi showed that the specific compliance halved from 1 to 4 weeks of age. No change was observed either between 4-week-old and adult pigs. Changes in the total wall and cartilage areas did not correlate with changes in specific compliance. Inflation to 20 cmH2O transmural pressure reduced the total wall area of bronchi from 1-week-old pigs. The increase in luminal volume during inflation of bronchial segments occurs, partially, by compression of the AWagainst the cartilage layer. Thus, both the specific compliance and the maximum inflation of isolated bronchi decrease with maturation. Similarly, human tracheal compliance decreases progressively from infancy to adulthood. Infant bronchi are approximately twice as compliant as that of 4-11 year old children. Airway narrowing is increased in compliant airways and cartilage significantly loads ASM in whole bronchi.9 Relating the Airways to the Whole Lung (airwayparenchymal interdependence) The airway tree undergoes an enormous amplification in cross-sectional area from the proximal to the very distal airways.

AB  - Background: BPD is a common lung disease whose prevalence continues to rise with the increasing survival of ELBWs. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, with a strong genetic foundation. Genetic variants of FAM13A are associated with multiple human lung pathological conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and lung cancer. In our previous study, FAM13A SNP (rs2609255) was found to be associated with BPD in ELBWs. While FAM13A's function is still unknown, 3 possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) acting as a signal transduction gene, as its significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie within an intronic region downstream of a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain, which is important for regulation of cell proliferation and survival; (2) activating Wnt signaling pathway, which has a role in airway and alveolar epithelial development as well as repair; and (3) regulating carnitine palmitoyl transferase-fatty acid oxidation, which plays a role in regulating reactive oxygen species production, contributing to lung epithelial cell death. FAM13A protein level expression is increased in COPD patients. Objective(s):To determine if airway expression of FAM13A protein is higher in ELBW infants with BPD compared to NonBPD. Method(s):DNA from buccal swabs of ELBWs were collected, isolated, and analyzed with RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probes for rs2013701, rs2609264, rs2869967, rs7671167, rs2609261, rs6837671, rs6830970, rs2609260, rs1458551, rs7682431, rs1903003, rs17014601& rs2609255 following parental consent. BPD was defined as O2 dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Tracheal aspirates were collected from intubated infants within first 7 days of life. FAM13A airway protein concentrations were measured with ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, t-test, and z-test, with significant p < 0.05. Result(s):In our previous study, BPD infants were born earlier (p<0.001) and at lower birth weight (p<0.001). For rs2609255, there is a significant difference (p=0.04) in genotype distributions between BPD & NonBPD, although this difference was not independent from prematurity following multiple logistic regression analysis. Infants with BPD had higher airway concentrations of FAM13A [median (IQR) 138.5 (0-499) pg/ml] than those with NonBPD [0 (0-0) pg/ml; (p=0.013)]. Conclusion(s):FAM13A rs2609255 is associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. Airway expression of FAM13A in the first week of life was increased in ELBW infants who progressed to BPD. We speculate that this early increased FAM13A protein expression contributes to impaired alveolar epithelial development and subsequent BPD in ELBW infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely low birthweight infants consists of interrupted lung alveolar and microvascular development. Strategies that minimize the interruption of microvascularization are critically needed. Animal and clinical studies suggest Vitamin A (retinoic acid, RetA) and Nitric Oxide (NO) may benefit lung microvascularization in BPD. We showed that exposure to combined NO and RetA in O2-treated endothelial cells improved endothelial tube formation compared to 02 alone. The molecular pathways for positive microvascular effects of RetA plus NO are not understood. We hypothesize that moderate 02 exposure alters the balance of a set of angiogenic and angiostatic proteins impacting lung microvascular development, and that combined treatment with RetA+NO partially rectifies the O2-induced developmental imbalance. Gestational day 19 fetal mouse lung endothelial cells (ATCC) were cultured in Room Air (RA), 02 (0.4 FiO2), or O2+/-NO (1Oppm) +/- RetA (10-8) for 48 hours. A targeted protein microarray of angiogenesis regulatory proteins was used to analyze 32 angiogenic and 11 angiostatic proteins in cell lysates. Treatment responses were analyzed using R and Python. Significant changes were identified by multivariate analysis with a FDR of 0.01. Parallel coordinate plots showed that 02 alone, O2+RetA, O2+NO, and combined therapy (O2+RetA+NO) elicited response patterns distinct from each other and from RA. On multivariate analysis, 30 proteins were significantly altered by exposure to 0.4 FiO2 compared to RA. Among these 30 proteins, 19 angiogenic proteins were increased and 6 decreased; 2 angiostatic proteins were increased and 3 were decreased. Eight proteins (Table) were significantly altered by exposure to combined therapy with O2+NO+RetA compared to 02 alone. Five of the 8 proteins altered by combined therapy were also impacted by 02 alone, with all showing combined therapy reversed the 02 effect except IP1O which was further decreased by combined therapy. Three angiogenic proteins modified by combined therapy were not significantly impacted by 02 alone. O2-induced alterations in microvascular development in immature lung, and correction thereof, is a complex balancing of angiogenic and angiostatic signals. Moderate 02 exposure profoundly impacts a subset of vasculogenic regulatory proteins in fetal lung endothelial cells. Concomitant therapy with NO+RetA during 0.4 FiO2 exposure partially reverses 02 effects, and also impacts some vasculogenic proteins not changed by 02 alone. This work suggests that combined NO+RetA therapy might rebalance a subset of proteins controlling positive and negative angiogenic pathways in microvascular formation that are disrupted in developing lungs exposed to 02.

AB  - Rationale: Oxygen administration is the cornerstone therapy in the treatment of hypoxia in premature infants. Supplemental oxygen is typically provided on an intermittent basis and titrated to oxygen saturation. While the risks of hyperoxia per se is recognized in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma, the mechanisms by which intermittent hypoxia and subsequent hyperoxia in developing airways are less understood. We sought to determine the effects of intermittent hypoxia with hyperoxia (IHH) on fetal airway smooth muscle cells (fASM) focusing on mitochondria. Method(s): Human fASM cells were isolated from tracheobronchial samples of de-identified 18-22 week fetuses following demise (StemCell Express, CA; Mayo IRB approved as exempt). We subjected fASM cells to normoxia (21%), hypoxia (5%), hyperoxia (40%), or IHH (40%-5% O2 in a 50%-50% duty cycle) for a duration of 24 hours. Result(s): Mitochondrial stress tests using a Seahorse XF Bioanalyzer revealed decreased oxygen consumption rate in hyperoxia that was attenuated by IHH. Morphology studies using MitoTracker Green fluorescent staining showed decreased mitochondrial branching and networking in hyperoxia-exposed cells compared to both hypoxia and normoxia. IHH exposure decreased mitochondrial branching and networking but to a lesser extent than hyperoxia alone. IHH generated less reactive oxygen species (ROS; CellROX fluorescent dye) compared to hyperoxia alone, while both conditions showed more ROS compared to normoxia or hypoxia. Protein analysis showed differential Mitofusin-2 expression across all oxygen exposure groups. Conclusion(s): These novel findings highlight the potentially protective impact of intermittent oxygen exposure in the context of hypoxia in the developing airway that could impact on the longterm effect of hyperoxia on the immature airway.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is currently the most common severe complication in premature infants and is characterized by the arrest of alveolar and vascular growth. Alveolar type II cells play an important role in the pathological foundation of BPD. An association of BPD with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in type II cells exposed to hyperoxia was previously identified. SOX4, a transcription factor that is indispensable to embryogenesis, including lung development, participates in regulating EMT and cell survival, affecting tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of SOX4 in the occurrence of BPD, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously determined. For this purpose, newborn rats were randomly divided into two treatment groups: The model group was exposed to hyperoxia (80-85% O2), while the control group was kept under normoxic conditions (21% O2). Lung tissues were collected on postnatal days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 and morphological changes in the lungs were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The location of SOX4 in type II cells was detected by double immunofluorescence. The expression of SOX4 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in type II cells and lung tissues were detected by immunochemistry, western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results demonstrated that, compared with the control group, the radial alveolar count decreased rapidly in the model group, accompanied by increased mean alveolar diameter and alveolar septal thickness. SOX4 and EZH2 were highly expressed in type II cells exposed to hyperoxia. However, in total lung tissues, SOX4 and EZH2 expression was profoundly decreased in the early stages and increased in the late stages following exposure to hyperoxia. The expression of the EZH2 protein was positively correlated with that of the SOX4 protein. In conclusion, at the alveolar stage, which is a critical period after birth for lung development, hyperoxia induced dysregulation of SOX4 and EZH2 in rat lungs, indicating that SOX4 may contribute to the disruption of lung development in BPD by regulating EZH2 expression.

AB  - Rationale: Dysmorphic pulmonary vascular growth and abnormal endothelial cell (EC) proliferation are paradoxically observed in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) despite vascular pruning. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis, generates NADPH as a reducing equivalent and ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. It is unknown whether hyperoxia, a known mediator of BPD in rodent models, alters glycolysis and the PPP in lung ECs. We hypothesized that hyperoxia increases glycolysis and the PPP, resulting in abnormal EC proliferation and dysmorphic angiogenesis in neonatal mice. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL/6J mice (<12 h old) were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 3 days, which were allowed to recover in room air until postnatal day (pnd) 14. Mice were administered with 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN, 5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p) or dehydropiandrosterone (DHEA, 10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.), respective inhibitors of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), for 5 days between pnd9 and pnd13. Nanoparticles mixed with plasmid DNA expressing pgd under the control of the human CDH5 promoter, were administered into mice via retro-orbital injection at pnd9. Metabolomics, immunofluorescence and Western blot were performed to measure glycolysis and the PPP in mouse lungs. An EdU incorporation assay was carried out to assess lung EC proliferation. CD31(Pecam1) immunohistochemistry was performed to assess vascular distribution, while H&E staining was carried out to measure the mean linear intercept (Lm) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Result(s): Hyperoxia increased lung levels of glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, ribulose 5-phosphate, xylulose 5-phosphate, NADPH, and reduced glutathione, metabolites of the PPP and glycolysis pathways. Neonatal hyperoxia also increased lung endothelial expression of PGD, the second enzyme of the PPP. In addition to increased Lm and reduced RAC, hyperoxic exposure caused abnormal lung EC proliferation as indicated by increased EdU incorporation in the lung interstitium. Increased CD31 expression was observed within the lung interstitium and was not adjacent to distal airways in response to hyperoxic exposure. These morphological abnormalities were further augmented by nanoparticle-mediated endothelial overexpression of pgd. In contrast, blocking the PPP using both 6-AN and DHEA significantly attenuated hyperoxia-induced abnormal lung EC proliferation, dysmorphic angiogenesis and alveolar simplification in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion(s): Neonatal hyperoxia augments the PPP, causing abnormal lung EC proliferation, dysmorphic vascular development and alveolar simplification. These novel observations provide mechanisms and potential metabolic targets to prevent BPD-associated vascular dysgenesis.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants, but mechanisms causing abnormal alveolar development characterized by alveolar simplification are not well understood. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-17~92 expression is severely attenuated in human patients who died from BPD and confirmed this in a murine disease model. Global deletion of miR-17-92 results in fatal neonatal respiratory failure from alveolar epithelial hypoplasia; however, the cell specific effects of miR-17-92 deletion on alveolar development are not known. Rationale: We hypothesize that miR-17~92 deletion in Alveolar Type 2 (AT2) Epithelial Cells will cause alveolar simplification reminiscent of a BPD-like phenotype without oxygen exposure. Method(s): We used an inducible, fluorescent, lox-cre system (miR-17~92flox/flox x ERSPCCre x zsGreen) combined with flow cytometry, immunofluorescent microscopy and bulk RNA-seq to characterize the impact of miR-17-92 on AT2 epithelial cells during postnatal alveologenesis. By administering tamoxifen on the day of birth, we are able to target AT2 cells during the period of exponential alveolar growth when alveologenesis beings around day 4. Result(s): Using a tamoxifen-inducible AT2-specific, fate-mapping system, we achieved >98% of miR-17-92 in AT2 cells. Due to cell-specific deletion of miR-17-92, we demonstrated deficiencies in structural lung development evidenced by increased alveolar area in transgenic animals. Transcriptomic animals have decreased AT2 cell quantity within the population of lung cells determined by flow cytometry. Conclusion(s): Our data supported the hypothesis that miR-17~92 deletion specifically in AT2 cells would have a significant impact on alveolarization producing the alveolar simplification classically found in oxygen-induced BPD models. This could possibly be related to the decreased density of AT2 cells, which are the stem cells needed to transdifferentiate into the alveolar type 1 epithelial cells which comprise the walls of the alveoli. Pending transcriptomic data will provide insight regarding developmental pathways influenced by miR-17-92 that are vital for epithelial cell transdifferentiation. This inducible, cell-specific model provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the biologic impact of miR-17~92 on alveolar epithelial cell function without oxygen as a confounder.

AB  - RATIONALE: WNT5a is a WNT family member that mainly activates beta-catenin independent (non-canonical) WNT signaling. Several studies have demonstrated that WNT5a signaling plays essential roles in normal lung development, homeostasis and stem cell maintenance. Accumulating evidence also implicates WNT5a in pathogenesis of several lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Recently we found that postnatal inactivation of Wnt5a disrupts myofibroblast differentiation which results in abnormal alveologenesis. The current study further explored the function of WNT5a in alveologenesis and characterized its interaction with canonical WNT signaling. METHOD(S): We generated a regulable Wnt5a gain-of-function model, Rosa26-rtTA;tetO-Wnt5a (Wnt5aRosa), which expresses full length WNT5a upon administration of doxycycline at postnatal days 4 and 5 (P4 and P5). The transgenic lungs were analyzed at P7 for morphology and cell differentiation by histological analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunofluorescent staining. Furthermore, we characterized the signaling pathways mediating WNT5a functions by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses. To determine the role of canonical WNT signaling in myofibroblast cell differentiation and proliferation, we generated regulable Gli1creERT2; Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3) (Ctnnb1-Ex3Gli1) mice which express an N-terminal truncated, stabilized betacatenin (CTNNB1-EX3) upon administration of tamoxifen at P2, and characterized the lungs as described above. RESULT(S): Postnatal over-expression of WNT5a disrupted alveologenesis represented by simplification of the alveolar structures in the Rosa26-rtTA;tetO-Wnt5a lungs. Detailed analyses revealed that in Rosa26-rtTA;tetOWnt5a lungs expression of multiple type I (AT1) cell markers was increased, while type II (AT2) cell markers remained mostly unchanged. In addition, over-expression of WNT5a inhibited myofibroblast gene expression and cell proliferation both in vivo and in cultured fibroblasts isolated from Rosa26-trTA;tetO-Wnt5a lungs. Furthermore, over-expression of WNT5a activated Ca2+ dependent non-canonical WNT signaling and inhibited canonical WNT activity. We then activated canonical WNT signaling by expressing Ctnnb1-Ex3 in alveolar myofibroblasts using Ctnnb1-Ex3Gli1 mice. Interestingly, activation of canonical WNT signaling increased cell proliferation and induced expression of myofibroblast markers. CONCLUSION(S): These observations demonstrate that WNT5a regulates proliferation and differentiation of multiple cell types (AT1 and myofibroblasts) during alveologenesis. In neonatal fibroblasts, WNT5a inhibits proliferation by repressing canonical WNT activities, whereas activating canonical WNT signaling increases proliferation and myofibroblast gene expression, suggesting a balance between WNT5a signaling and canonical WNT signaling is essential for alveologenesis.

AB  - Rationale: Normal tidal breathing requires synchronized activity of several respiratory muscles, including in the diaphragm, thorax, and abdominal walls. While abnormal breathing patterns and underlying pulmonary functional deficits are well recognized in adult lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD), breathing disorders in infancy are poorly understood. Neonates with lung disease of prematurity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BPD) often have obstructed small airways and are hyperinflated, potentially yielding inspiratory subcostal retractions, but this phenomenon has only been descriptively identified. Further, diaphragmatic dysfunction and asynchrony following surgical repair in neonatal congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has been observed but is not well studied. Such breathing disorders result in inadequate tidal volumes, insufficient gas exchange, and ultimately respiratory distress, and few reliable clinical tools are available for spatiotemporal evaluation. Here, we present novel assessment of abnormal breathing patterns in non-sedated, tidal-breathing infants with either BPD or CDH, compared to an infant without respiratory disease, using dynamic 4D chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Method(s): Non-ionizing ultrashort echo-time (UTE) chest MRI (3D resolution = 0.7 mm) was acquired in 3 neonates during tidal breathing on clinically-indicated respiratory support: 1 respiratory-control (male, 36/40 weeks gestational age at birth/MRI), 1 severe BPD (male, 24/46 weeks), and 1 post-repair CDH (female, 38/43 weeks, left-sided abdominal muscle-flap repair). MRI was performed on a neonatal-sized 1.5T scanner, with no sedation ordered for imaging. Images were generated at end-expiration and end-inspiration via published retrospective respiratory-gating methods, and dynamic changes in respiratory anatomy were identified. Result(s): Normal breathing was observed in the control patient, with synchronized and caudal diaphragmatic motion at end-inspiration (Figure, pink) compared with end-expiration (green). The patient with severe BPD was noted to be markedly hyperinflated with subcostal retraction related to diaphragmatic contraction primarily in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior plans, rather than normal cranial-caudal contraction. Asynchronous breathing was observed in the CDH patient, with a lowered contralateral and raised ipsilateral diaphragm at end-inspiration. Conclusion(s): Current 4D chest MRI capabilities have strong potential to internally and externally assess breathing pattern disorders in neonatal lung disease, such as BPD or CDH, with minimal risk to the patient. Looking forward, this technique may be implemented serially to assess whether interventions in BPD (e.g., bronchodilators) resolve hyperinflated breathing patterns, and to evaluate surgical strategies and post-operative diaphragmatic function in CDH. Ultimately, this imaging tool has strong potential for better understanding neonatal breathing disorders and informing clinical care decisions in individual patients.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung injury of premature infants. BPD is a multicompartmental lung disease including progressive lower airway obstruction. Airway epithelial cell (AEC) injury and extracellular remodeling occur during BPD pathogenesis. Amphiregulin (Areg), an EGFR ligand, regulates epithelial differentiation, homeostasis, and repair in other epithelial injuries. We hypothesized that Areg regulates neonatal epithelial cell differentiation and repair and is protective during BPD pathogenesis. Method(s): Hyperoxiainduced lung injury (HILI) was used to model BPD in Areg-deficient mice and littermate controls. In parallel experiments, AECs were isolated from tracheas of PN1-2 Areg-deficient and wild type mice, grown in submerged conditions to confluence, and then differentiated at an air liquid interface (ALI) for 3 weeks to form organotypic AEC cultures. Differentiation of AEC cultures was confirmed by visual inspection, TEER measurements, and staining with anti-tubA4B for apical cilia and phalloidin to delineate cytoskeletal processes. ALI cultures were kept in normoxia or injured with 0.85 FiO2 before IHC or lysis for qPCR. Finally, CD45-EPCAM+ AECs were isolated by FACS of tracheal aspirates from premature infants with evolving BPD for RNA Sequencing. Result(s): Areg mRNA was increased by 2-fold in lungs of wild type newborn mice exposed to 0.9 FiO2 for 5d. When exposed to 0.9 FiO2 for 7d, lungs from Areg-deficient mice had more severe HILI than controls with increased capillary leak, subepithelial and luminal airway inflammation, and alveolar simplification. Areg mRNA increased by 2-fold in neonatal AECs differentiated at ALI when compared with freshly dissected AECs, and was further increased by 4-fold in differentiated AEC cultures exposed to 5d of hyperoxia when compared to normoxia controls. AECs grown from Areg-deficient mice had impaired differentiation with scant apical cilia and disorganized cytoskeletal processes when compared with controls (Figure 1). Differentiated ALI cultures from Areg-deficient mice expressed 6-fold more Tgm1 mRNA than ALI from Areg+/-mice. Finally, tracheal AECs from infants with Severe Type 2 BPD expressed 2-fold less Areg mRNA than AECs from infants with milder BPD. Conclusion(s): Areg is expressed during AEC differentiation and during hyperoxia-induced epithelial injuries in vivo and ex vivo. AECs from mice lacking Areg have abnormal growth and differentiation, potentially through increased expression of Tgm1 and altered extracellular matrix deposition. Decreased AEC-derived Areg expression is associated with more severe BPD. The Areg-Tgm1 axis may be a future therapeutic target to mitigate epithelial injury and extracellular remodeling in BPD.

AB  - Pregnant women exposed to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are at increased risk for premature delivery. Preterm infants often require supplemental oxygen, a known risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Both prenatal BP and postnatal hyperoxia exposure alter the neonatal gut microbiome, which may modulate neonatal hyperoxic lung injury via the gut-lung axis. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal administration of PAHs [i.e. benzo[a]pyrene (BP) or a mixture of BP and benzo(b)fluoranthene (BbF)] differentially exacerbates lung injury and alveolar simplification in neonatal mice following postnatal hyperoxia, and this effect is altered in mice lacking the gene for cytochrome P450 (Cyp)1a1,1a2, or 1b1. Timed pregnant WT (C57BL/6J), Cyp1a1-null, Cyp1a2-null, and Cyp1b1-null mice (n=4) treated orally with vehicle corn oil (CO) or a mixture of PAHs BP and BbF (7.5 mg/kg each) on gestational days 16-19. Newborn mice (term, day 21) were exposed to hyperoxia or room air for 14 days. Hyperoxic lung injury was augmented in a dose-dependent manner following prenatal PAH exposure. PAH exposure differentially altered lung injury in WT, Cyp1a1-null and Cyp1a2-null, but not Cyp1b1-null mice. PAH administration resulted in induction of CYP1A1 expression. Hyperoxia and PAH alone caused modest increase in CYP1B1 expression but together caused significant induction, suggesting that CYP1B1 may contribute to the potentiation of lung injury by PAH. Prenatal PAH exposure either alone or in combination of neonatal hyperoxia caused significant dysbiosis of the neonatal intestinal microbiome compared with mice exposed to the vehicle corn oil (CO) in room air conditions. Our results suggest that dysbiosis our the neonatal intestinal microbiome contributes to the increased susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury in neonatal mice that are maternally exposed to PAHs probably via the gut-lung axis. Future studies on the underlying mechanisms could lead to novel strategies in the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants.

AB  - Rationale-Extremely premature newborns are at high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]. BPD leads to pathologic remodelling of the pulmonary vascular bed and, ultimately, pulmonary hypertension [PH]. Our objectives were to assess the association between BPD and echocardiographic markers of cardiovascular dysfunction in premature newborns at 36 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA]. Methods-A retrospective cohort of infants born at <29 weeks gestational age, admitted between 2015 and 2019, without genetic or congenital anomalies and who survived to their echocardiography screening for PH. BPD was defined as respiratory support at 36 weeks, further categorized according to the Canadian Neonatal Network definitions. Measurements from the echocardiography acquired closest to 36 weeks PMA were done by masked experts. Results-Out of 387 infants, 222 were included, 27 (11%) categorized as severe BPD. Severe BPD was significantly associated with abnormal eccentricity index [EI] (1.32+/-0.27 vs 1.17+/-0.18, p<0.01) and left ventricle [LV] ejection fraction (64.9+/-8.54 vs 60+/-9.4%, p=0.04). The combined outcome of death (after the 36 weeks echocardiography) or severe BPD was associated with PH (68% vs 30%, p<0.01), smaller LV length in diastole (2.75+/-0.5 vs 2.98+/-0.49 cm, p=0.03), decrease in the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (0.74+/-0.24 vs 0.9+/-0.24 cm, p<0.01), increased eccentricity index (1.31+/-0.25 vs 1.17+/-0.18, p<0.01) and smaller right ventricle fraction area change (41.3+/-5.8 vs 47.8+/-7.6%, p<0.01). Other echocardiographic markers were similar. Conclusion-Extreme premature infants with severe BPD have right and left ventricular alterations in performance. Severe BPD was also significantly associated with PH. Future studies should investigate further the pathogenesis of vascular remodelling on BPD and involvement of biventricular function, specifically the LV, in this population.

AB  - Background: Exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) predisposes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterized by abnormal alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development, in preterm neonates. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure is used to recapitulate the phenotype of human BPD in murine models. Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD, but the main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes at single-cell resolution are unknown. Objective(s): To investigate sex-specific and cell-type-specific transcriptional changes that drive injury in the neonatal lung exposed to hyperoxia at single-cell resolution. Method(s): We used single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) to generate transcriptional profiles of >40000 cells isolated from the lungs of C57BL/6 mice exposed to 95% oxygen between PND1-5 and their littermate controls. Viable single cells were isolated by FACS at PND7 (n=3/gp). Library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Sequencing data were mapped to mm10 and quantified using GENCODE. Data normalization, cell type clustering, and marker gene identification, and hyperoxia response gene signatures were performed using Seurat. Gene ontology analysis was done with Metascape. Result(s): scRNA-seq identified 27 clusters in both hyperoxia-exposed and control lungs consistent with distinct populations of endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. The proportion of AT1, monocytes, and neutrophils increased in hyperoxia-exposed mice. In contrast, AT2, ciliated epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells, and alveolar macrophages were decreased. Notably, proliferating endothelial and epithelial cells were most susceptible to hyperoxia and were dramatically decreased. Strikingly, males showed a greater decrease in AT2 cells, while females in pericytes, in response to hyperoxia exposure. Differential gene expression analysis identified the most pronounced hyperoxia-induced changes in Car4+ capillary endothelial cells and interstitial macrophages. Sexual dimorphism was noted in the enrichment of biological pathways in Car4+ capillary endothelial cells. Females showed activation of vessel morphogenesis, while males in oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Conclusion(s): These novel findings provide evidence that neonatal hyperoxia exposure results in significant changes in the cellular composition of the lung and induces cell-type-specific transcriptional changes in all major cellular compartments of the lung. The disproportional decrease of proliferating endothelial and epithelial cells provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the abnormal lung development observed after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. Furthermore, we highlight the sex-specific differences in cell distribution and cell-specific transcriptional profiles in the neonatal lung. The remarkable heterogeneity in cell-specific response to neonatal hyperoxia has important implications for the identification of novel targets for future disease modification or prevention.

AB  - Rationale: Newborns diagnosed with tracheomalacia (TM) have breathing difficulties due to airway collapse. Studies in adults with obstructive lung disease have shown evidence of self-generated positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP) by glottic closure. It is not known if neonates generate auto-PEEP or how it changes airflow dynamics. Glottic motion can be measured by ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI, which can capture airway anatomy during the breathing cycle. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, based on MRI-derived boundary conditions, to model airflow through the airway, revealing clinically relevant information such as pressure difference across the glottis as an indicator of auto-PEEP. Method(s): Twelve neonatal intensive care unit subjects (6 TM, 6 non-TM diagnosed via bronchoscopy; 8 bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 4 tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia) were imaged using 3D UTE MRI. All subjects were not intubated and were breathing room air or were on non-invasive respiratory support (high flow nasal cannula or non-invasive pressure ventilation). MR data acquired throughout the breathing cycle were gated and reconstructed into 4 images representing different respiratory phases using the k0 waveform. Each image was segmented to create airway surfaces, which were registered to obtain airway motion during breathing. Airflow rates were calculated using the k0 waveform, and tidal lung volumes were derived from lung segmentations. A CFD simulation was performed for each subject using the moving airway surface and airflow rates to calculate the pressure loss across the glottis at peak expiration. A plane was placed before and after (+/- 3mm) the glottis to capture the pressure loss across the glottis (Figure 1A). Result(s): The average glottis cross-sectional area at peak expiration was 4.1mm2 in the subjects with TM and 10.9mm2 in subjects without TM (p=0.009, Figure 1B). The average total pressure loss across the glottis at peak expiration of the subjects with TM was increased by over 10x-0.94 cmH2O and 0.09 cmH2O in subjects with and without TM, respectively (p=0.015, Figure 1C). Conclusion(s): Neonates with TM have narrower glottises than subjects without TM. The large, increased pressure loss across the glottis during expiration raises the pressure throughout the subglottic airway, thereby acting as auto-PEEP. This is the first time auto-PEEP has been demonstrated in neonates. Auto-PEEP increases lung volumes, provides pneumatic stenting of the airway, and improves expiratory flow rates in infants with TM. In future studies, patient-specific CFD simulations with airway motion based on imaging can quantify the effect of these individual factors in the neonatal population.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease resulting from injury during postnatal lung development in premature infants. Supplemental oxygen exposure, as used in the NICU, may lead to alveolar simplification but also to loss of bronchial epithelial cilia. Mucociliary clearance can be perturbed by ciliary loss and/or dysfunction, which can lead to chronic infection and inflammation. Little is known about the mechanism of hyperoxic ciliary dysfunction in the respiratory tract and its impact in the pathogenesis of BPD. Method(s): Basal human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) were allowed to differentiate in cell culture at an air liquid interface. The HAEC were exposed to 95 % O2/5%CO2 or 5 % CO2 (controls) for up to 48 hours. Additionally, neonatal mice were exposed to 95 % O2 at <12 hours of life until pnd3 and recovered in air. Mice were sacrificed and tracheal samples were collected on pnd10 and pnd60. HAEC cilia length was measured from scanning electron microscopy images using a Matlab  program that measures curved cilia length. Maintenance of the cilia length is a function of intraflagellar transport (IFT) mechanics. IFT involves cilia regulatory proteins including Foxj1, motor proteins such as kinesin II and dynein II, and structural proteins including alpha tubulin. We therefore evaluated the levels of the IFT proteins via western blot in the mice and in HAEC. Additionally, we performed proteomics analysis to evaluate the global effect of hyperoxia exposure after 24 and 36 hours in HAEC. Result(s): In the HAEC, there was a significant time-dependent reduction (P<0.01) in cilia length after 24 hours of hyperoxia exposure. In addition, there was a significant decrease in kinesin II motor protein Kif3b and an increase in Foxj1 at 24 and 36 hours. In neonatal mice, there was a decrease in acetylated alpha tubulin expression up to pnd10 with recovery to normal expression levels at pnd60. In HAEC exposed to hyperoxia for 36 hours, proteomics analysis showed decrease in multiple proteins related to intraflagellar transport including tubulin, kinesin motor proteins, and dynein motor proteins. Additionally, the expression of multiple proteins that make up complex I of the electron transport chain were decreased suggesting a role for oxidative phosphorylation in ciliogenesis and/or maintenance. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that hyperoxic exposure leads to aberrant IFT protein expression and ATP synthesis with resultant decreased cilia length. This could result in dysfunctional mucociliary clearance, chronic infection and inflammation.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major challenge for premature infants; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cells influences the normal alveolar development process. In this study, we wished to examine whether Runx3 is an important factor for BPD by regulating EMT in AT2 cells. In vivo, animal models of BPD were established by placing newborn rats in hyperoxia tanks. Lung tissue and isolated AT2 cells were collected on different days following exposure to oxygen. The pathological changes in lung tissue, alveolar development and Runx3 expression were then investigated. In vitro, RLE-6TN cells were divided into 5 groups as follows: the cont-rol, Runx3, siRunx3, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and Runx3 + TGF-beta1 groups, and the biomarkers of EMT were investigated. In the newborn rat model of BPD, Runx3 protein and mRNA levels in both lung tissue and BPD-derived AT2 cells were significantly lower than those in the control group. The correlation between Runx3 protein expression and pulmonary development indicators was analyzed; Runx3 expression positively correlated with the radial alveolar count (RAC) and the percentage of smooth muscle actin-positive secondary septa, but negatively correlated with alveolar wall thickness. EMT was observed in the RLE-6TN cells in which the Runx3 gene was knocked down and follwoing TGF-beta1-induced EMT stimulation; however, TGF-beta1 failed to induce EMT in the RLE-6TN cells overexpressing Runx3. On the whole, our data indicte that low Runx3 levels may promote EMT, while high Runx3 levels inhibit TGF-beta1-induced EMT. Therefore, we predict that low levels of Runx3 in BPD lung tissue may promote EMT in AT2 cells, thus affecting alveolar development.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of infants born prematurely associated with impaired lung development. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been used to monitor disease in preterm-born children but do not provide a regional evaluation of lung function1. The free-breathing, contrast agent-free, MRI technique, phase-resolved functional lung (PREFUL) MRI2 has been shown to yield fractional ventilation (FV) maps of the lung. PREFUL has not been applied to children born prematurely, including those with BPD. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of PREFUL MRI in children born prematurely with and without BPD at two MRI centres (Hospital for Sick Children, SickKids; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, CHEO) and to compare MRI results with PFTs. Method(s): Twenty 6-9-year-old children (11 BPD and 9 with no BPD; all born prematurely,<28 weeks) were recruited at two different sites (SickKids and CHEO). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were obtained from spirometry, pre/post bronchodilator (BD). For PREFUL MRI, a 2D coronal image was obtained for 512 repetitions in ~1 minute3. PREFUL FV maps were generated in MATLAB as described in Voskrebenzev et al.2 and ventilation defect percentage (VDP) was calculated3. The average FV for each subject was calculated5 and compared between the BPD and non-BPD groups using one-way ANOVA & Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. VDP was also correlated to FEV1 and FEV1/FVC using linear regression. Result(s): The average mean FV across all subject was 0.42 (ranging from 0.30 to 0.61), while the average VDP was 4.2% (ranging from 0.1% to 16.1%). Mean FV and VDP were unable to differentiate the BPD and non-BPD sub-groups and did not correlate to spirometry, pre- or post-BD. Figure 1 shows the PREFUL results of representative BPD subjects. Discussion(s): PREFUL MRI was feasible for all participants. VDP did not correlate significantly with spirometry suggesting the two methods may be measuring different physiological outcomes or that standard spirometry is less sensitive to change than MRI. VDP and FV mean had high variance and fell outside average measures for healthy children3, supporting a role for PREFUL MRI in identifying abnormalities in the BPD lung. Further associations between VDP or FV and other factors are planned to investigate the relevance of these results. Overall, PREFUL MRI provides a novel measure of regional lung function in children born prematurely.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic respiratory diseases (groups of chronic bronchopulmonary diseases, different for reasons & development mechanisms, but having a number of common clinical, functional & morphological manifestations) are an urgent problem in pediatrics due to their significant prevalence & early disability. They are associated with a number of serious medical-social problems. The development of these diseases is connected to teratogenic & pathogenic effects of environmental factors at various stages of ontogenesis & depends on the detoxification system, including genetic predisposition. Material(s) and Method(s): 128 children with chronic bronchopulmonary diseases were examined: bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-57, congenital malformations (CM)-35, other chronic nonspecific lung diseases (CNLD)-36. The diagnosis was established according to generally accepted clinical & laboratory criteria. Genotyping of the detoxification system (GSTM+T, GSTP1-Ile105Val, GSTP1-Ala114Val, SOD-G7958A) was performed by PCR. Results & discussion: Different frequency of occurrence of polymorphisms of the studied genes was revealed. The mutant genotype GSTM1 (40.0%) is characteristic of children with BPD, which is 1.7 times more than in CM & CNLD. More significant disorders (mutant homozygous variants of GSTM/GSTT) were detected in patients with congenital malformations of the lungs, which were found in 21.2% of children (5.9 times more often than in BPD), as well as heterozygous alleles GSTP1 (Ala114Val)-in 22.9% (2.6 times more than with BPD & 4 times more than with COPD). The multifactorial nature of CNLD was confirmed by a deletion in GSTT1-in 17.6% of cases (2.4-2.9 times more often than other groups) & the same high level of mutant homozygotes GSTM/GSTT (23.5%) as in CM (21.2%). Despite the fact that in CNLD normal homozygous polymorphisms GSTP1 (Ile105Val) are determined more often-in 72.2% of children & 1.7 times lower than the mutant heterozygous variant (16.7%), 2 times more patients (11.1 %) with altered homozygous polymorphisms in comparison with BPD & CM. A fairly high percentage of children with CNLD had the heterozygous genotype SOD 1 (G7958A)-38.1%, which is 2.2-2.6 times higher than those in BPD & congenital malformations. Conclusion(s): Thus, the revealed genetic features of the detoxification system in various chronic bronchopulmonary pathologies (BPD, CM, CNLD) are one of the unmodifiable factors affecting the development & course of diseases, while their timely registration can contribute to the prognosis & reasonable effective correction of conditions.

AB  - Background: Repeated Red Blood Cells (RBC) transfusions in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGAN) predict a poor outcome, with a higher risk for mortality and morbidity. A close association between low levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and diseases driven by the oxidative damage, as retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, has been recently reported. In comparison with adult Hb (HbA), HbF is endowed with higher oxygen affinity, greater redox potential and higher tetrameric stability, all functions potentially protective in oxidative challenge. Cord blood RBC transfusions effectively prevent the HbF loss consequent to standard transfusions. Aim(s): To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the potential protective role of HbF, we assessed the expression profile of several genes involved in the oxidative stress pathways in endothelial cells exposed to either HbA or HbF. Method(s): Endothelial cells (EC) were obtained from umbilical cord blood and confluent layers at passages II were used. Packed RBC were obtained by fractionating whole blood units from adult donors or cord blood units from full term infants. Both packed RBC types with equal proportion of SAG-M were stored at +4degreeC for 7 days. Then, cord and adult packed RBCs were centrifuged; supernatant and RBCs were collected stored at -20degreeC. To obtain free hemoglobin, RBC aliquots were thawed at 37degreeC. Free Hb concentration was measured and samples were diluted in culture medium at a final concentration of 4g/L (corresponding to the average Hb concentration of a packed RBC unit with 0.8% of hemolysis, the maximum hemolysis rate allowed at term of storage).EC were then exposed for 6 hours to 7-day supernatants from cord or adult RBCs units, or to the medium containing free HbF or HbA. Total RNA was extracted and reverted. Gene expression profile was evaluated using the 'Human Oxidative Stress Plus' (PAHS- 065Y, SABiociences, Qiagen).Linear model fitting and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) estimation were done using the R package limma. DEGs were called at a significance level of P< 0.05, after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. DEGs enrichment analysis over Gene Ontology (biological process) were done using the online tool enrichR. Result(s): Adult and fetal free hemoglobin and cord RBC supernatant induced a similar expression pattern of the most significantly regulated genes (NOX4 , APOE# and AKR1C2#). This pattern of expression was opposite to that observed after the exposure to adult RBC supernatant, suggesting an eventual role for residual leukocytes contained in packed RBCs from adult donors. DEGs enrichment analysis showed that fetal and adult Hb act on similar but not identical pathways (see Best Gene Ontology in Table 1). Even more pronounced differences were observed in cells are exposed to day-7 supernatants of cord or adult packed RBC units (see Broader and Best Gene Ontology in Table 1). Summary/Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that fetal and adult Hb may have a different impact on the oxidative stress. This finding may be relevant to the transfusion management of ELGAN patients with diseases driven by the oxidative damage. (Table Presented).

AB  - Objectives and Study: Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for surfactant synthesis and for differentiation of lung epithelium. Very preterm infants have low plasma concentrations of retinol (< 0.7 mumol/l), reflecting reduced hepatic stores. Levels < 0.35 mumol/l may indicate severe deficiency. Vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but current recommendations for preterm infants span a wide range (400-1000 mug/kg/d) and needs after discharge are not defined. This study aims to evaluate the neonatal vitamin A status in premature infants with a gestational age (GA) < 29 weeks participating in a randomized nutritional intervention study (the ImNuT trial, NCT03555019). Method(s): Plasma retinol concentrations were measured at 28 days of life (DoL) and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). In line with the standardized nutritional protocol, the infants received vitamin A from the parenteral vitamin supplement, through fortified human milk and from the enteral multivitamins (fat-soluble). Daily dietary intake was calculated by the use of the nutritional database Nutrium. Result(s): In total, 78 infants (mean GA 26+3 weeks (range 23+1-28+6) and birth weight 862 g (444-1485) were included in the analysis at DoL 28. Mean retinol concentration was 0.81 mumol/l (SD 0.49). Subgroup analyses showed a significant difference in retinol concentrations between infants treated with dexamethasone (glucocorticoids) (n=34) postnatally compared to untreated infants (n=44): mean (SD); 1.2 (0.52) vs 0.54 (0.19) mumol/l, P < 0.001. (Figure 1a and 1b). The mean (SD) cumulative vitamin A intake from DoL 1-28 was similar between the groups: 775 (175) vs 851 (106) mug/kg/d, P=0.063. At 36 weeks PMA, mean (SD) retinol concentrations were 0.56 (0.26) and 0.46 (0.20) mumol/l, P=0.053, respectively. We did not find any correlation between vitamin A intake and retinol concentrations, P=0.189 (Figure1a). Conclusion(s): Studies on the effect of glucocorticoids on retinol concentrations are conflicting (1, 2). In this study, neonates treated with dexamethasone for BPD had a two-fold higher retinol concentration at DoL 28 compared to non-treated infants, with reduced and borderline significant differences observed at 36 weeks PMA. The vitamin A concentrations were independent of vitamin A intake and support the assumption that glucocorticoid administration results in a transient mobilization of vitamin A from the liver. Our data also suggest that vitamin A intakes within the range of current recommendations are insufficient to maintain adequate blood levels in very preterm infants. Our study will be followed up with measurements of retinol, retinol-binding protein and dexamethasone concentrations in dried blood spot samples obtained at study inclusion, DoL 7, 28 and PMA week 36.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the leading morbidity in survivors of preterm birth, with resulting impaired alveolarization and fibrosis. Infants with severe BPD have associated vascular changes and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The molecular mechanisms resulting in BPD and PH are poorly understood, and there are no curative therapies. Apelin is a peptide made by endothelial cells of the heart and lung that has been previously shown to be associated with endothelial repair, though its role in lung vascular development and injury is unclear. Methods To characterize expression of apelin and its receptor in lung development, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) across 7 time points from embryonic day 15 to postnatal (P) day 14. To study apelin expression during lung injury, we used a murine model combining hyperoxia (70% from P1-5) and inflammation (intratracheal lipopolysaccharide). For validation, we examined human lung tissue from preterm infants with and without lung injury. Apelin and apelin receptor expression were localized in lung tissue using RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), with quantification using Halo software. Results By scRNAseq, apelin and its receptor are expressed by distinct subpopulations of endothelial cells in the lung. Apelin expression increases before birth at embryonic day 18 and is relatively constant across the lifespan. In acute lung injury, we found decreased expression of apelin by RNA ISH in endothelial cells when compared with normoxia-exposed controls at P5 (p<0.001). This decrease in apelin expression persisted during recovery at P14 (p<0.01). There were no significant changes in apelin receptor expression with injury. Examination of human infant lungs in the saccular stage showed decreased apelin expression after 4 days of mechanical ventilation when compared with infants who were never mechanically ventilated (p<0.001). Conclusion Apelinergic signaling is a conserved pathway that emerges in the saccular stage of lung development. During acute neonatal injury and recovery, there is a significant decrease in apelin expression. Future work to target this pathway may identify novel therapies in infants with BPD and PH.Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation

AB  - Background: Delayed-interval delivery (DID) is the delivery of the first fetus in a multiple gestation pregnancy without promptly delivering the remaining fetus(es), usually in an attempt to decrease the risk of adverse outcome due to extreme prematurity in the retained fetus(es). Available information on DID is limited, resulting in a knowledge gap of how the benefits of DID in reducing known risks of prematurity are balanced with its complications. Objective(s): Determine the incidence of DID in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) and describe short- and long-term outcomes. Design/Methods: Retrospective cohort study of infants born at <28 weeks' gestation between 2006-2019 within the NRN. Infants without a documented birth time were excluded. DID was defined as passage of >24 hrs between birth of firstborn and retained infants. Rates of DID, major morbidities of prematurity, and death were described. Outcomes were compared for firstborn and retained infants born by DID. In addition, outcomes of DID-born infants were compared to those of (1) other multiples, and (2) all infants in the GDB and follow-up datasets (excluding DID-born). Result(s): DID (Figure Presnted) occurred in 2.1% (68/3211) of pregnancies with multiples. Median delay was 103.5 hrs (IQR 53.5-210.8). DIDborn multiples were smaller and less mature than other multiples (Table 1). Retained infants experienced significantly less bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) than first-borns (Table 2). Rates of death, BPD, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade 3-4, sepsis, and other morbidities were higher for DID-born multiples compared to other multiples, as well as all other infants (Table 2). After adjustment for gestational age and birth weight, only necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [RR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.10-2.99)] and hearing impairment [RR 3.22 (95% CI: 1.19-8.71)] remained significantly different compared to the general population of multiples. Hearing impairment [RR 3.47 (95% CI: 1.26-9.66)] remained significantly different compared to other infants in the GDB. Conclusion(s): Among DID infants, retained infants experience less BPD than firstborns. DID infants, overall, were smaller and less mature than other multiples. Rates of death and morbidities, including sepsis, IVH grade 3-4, NEC, BPD, and hearing impairment, were higher in DID infants. However, after adjustment for birth weight and GA, only NEC and hearing impairment remained significantly higher. a Missing data on race for 1 DID multiple and 143 multiples not born by DID b Missing data on ethnicity for 1 DID multiple and 125 multiples not born by DID c Missing data on antenatal steroids for 18 multiples not born by DID d Missing data on chorioamnionitis for 8 DID first-borns, 4 DID retained infants, and 914 multiples not born by DID. a Values are presented as n/N (%) b BPD defined as any oxygen use at 36 weeks adjusted age c Neurodevelopmental impairment characterized as BSID-III cognitive composite score level 2, bilateral blindness, permanent hearing loss that interferes with the ability to understand or communicate with or without amplification.

AB  - Purpose: Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have increased risk of viral respiratory infections throughout their lifetime. Lung resident immune cells, specifically, T lymphocytes are required for host defense against viral pathogens. Since a growing body of literature implicates that inflammatory environmental exposures during pregnancy and early postnatal period result in life-long alteration in immune cell health, we hypothesized that BPD induced by combined prenatal chorioamnionitis and postnatal hyperoxia results in short-term and long-term dysregulation of T cell receptor signaling in pulmonary immune cells. Method(s): Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with intra-amniotic LPS (1ug) or normal saline (NS) at 20 days of gestation. Upon delivery, pups were placed in hyperoxia chamber (85% O2) or room air (RA) for 14 days. Lungs were harvested at two weeks of age for short -term analysis or at two months of age for longterm analysis. Harvested lungs were processed into single-cell suspension. CD45+ immune cells were isolated from the single cell suspension using fluorescent activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted from immune cells and genome-wide microarray was performed using Affymetrix WT-plus Rat Clariom S Gene chip. Gene ontology terms of biological processes of differentially expressed genes with FDR < 0.01 were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes associated with T cell receptor signaling pathway were validated using RT-PCR. Result(s): Lungs from animals treated with prenatal LPS and postnatal O2 had significantly greater mean linear intercept indicating alveolar simplification (32+/-2 vs. 25+/-0.8; LPS+O2 vs. NS+RA, p < 0.001, n=5 per group). Purity of sorted immune cells was verified using qPCR. Percentage of CD45+ immune cells as a fraction of all pulmonary cells was similar between the two groups (27% vs. 21%, p = 0.25). Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed downregulation of several key T cell related biological processes (Fig.1). Specifically, genes involved in T cell receptor signaling were significantly downregulated in LPS+O2 group, compared to NS+ RA group. qPCR validation of select T-cell receptor genes showed significant downregulation of Cd3d, Cd3e, Cd5, Trat1, CD8a at two weeks (p <0.05, n = 5 per group) in LPS+O2 group compared to NS+RA group. Despite recovery in room air for six weeks, Cd8a gene expression remained significantly lower in LPS+O2 group compared to NS+RA group at 2 months (log2 fold change: -0.49+/-0.3 vs. 0+/-0.3; LPS+O2 vs. NS+RA respectively; p=0.01). Conclusion(s): Our study has highlighted that perinatal lung inflammation in a double-hit model of BPD results in short-term and long-term dysregulated pulmonary T lymphocyte gene expression, which may contribute to increased viral respiratory morbidities seen in children and adults with BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study This study will describe heart rate variability (HRV) during feeding in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and determine if a speech therapy intervention can correct autonomic dysfunction. Methods Used ECGs were collected during bottle feeding for 25 Low-Risk Preterm (LRP) infants and babies with BPD who were randomized (25 each) to receive a speech therapy intervention (BPDwTX) or standard care (BPDnTX). Heart rate (HR), mean RR interval (RR), standard deviation of consecutive RR intervals (SDRR), and standard deviation of the difference between consecutive RR intervals (SDDRR) were calculated for each. ECGs were converted to power spectra to measure low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. Independent variables were gestational age (GA), birthweight (BW), postmenstrual age (PMA), weeks before first oral feed (WBFN) and weeks post first oral feed (WPFN). Generalized estimating equations were fit to describe each group. Summary of Results LRP infants had larger BW and GA. BPD infants had greater WBFN. There were no associations for HR, RR, LF, HF or LF/HF. SDRR is larger in the BPD groups. SDRR increases with GA. There were no differences for SDDRR among groups. SDRR and SDDRR were correlated. In almost all cases, the results in BPDwTX were closer to the LRP than BPDnTX. Conclusions SDRR is increased in BPD. The balanced increase in SDRR and SDDRR suggests that altered respiration in BPD impinges on suck-swallow-breath integration and causes stress during feeding.

AB  - Purpose of Study Distinct airway microbial dysbiosis is seen in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition to dysbiosis, oxidative stress has been shown to exacerbate BPD, and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidants are protective. Previous studies revealed protected lung structure and function in germ free (GF) mice. In order to understand the protective mechanisms in GF mice, we analyzed Nrf2 dependent genes heme-oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) and NADPH quinone oxidoreducase-1 (Nqo1), which both neutralize reactive oxygen species and maintain redox balance. In addition, we analyzed pulmonary mechanics in an Nrf2 knockout murine model after colonization with E. coli, respiratory probiotic, or E. coli followed by respiratory probiotic. Methods Used GF mice were intranasally inoculated with three separate doses of E. coli at P3, P6, and P9. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) treated GF mice as well as non-germ free mice (NGF) were used as controls. All groups were exposed to normoxia (21% FiO2) or hyperoxia (85% FiO2). The expression of Hmox1 and Nqo1 in lung tissue harvested at P14 was measured by qPCR. C57BL/6 mice with an Nrf2 knockout were colonized through intranasal inoculation with PBS, E. coli, respiratory probiotic, or E. coli followed by respiratory probiotic on P3, P6, and P9. All groups were exposed to normoxia (21% FiO2) or hyperoxia (85% FiO2). On P14, pulmonary function tests were performed. Summary of Results GF mice colonized with E. coli showed a significant increase in Hmox1 and Nqo1 expression independent of hyperoxia exposure. In an Nrf2 knockout model, treatment with E. coli resulted in worsening pulmonary function in both normoxia and hyperoxia (high resistance P<0.001, low compliance). Treatment with a respiratory probiotic resulted in improvement in pulmonary function even in hyperoxic conditions (decreased resistance P<0.05, increased compliance). Conclusions Our results suggest the presence of an interaction between airway microbiome and Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses in the lung. Through these studies, we hope to lay the foundation for microbiome related therapeutics development for BPD.

AB  - Purpose of Study Obesity negatively impacts lung function in children and adolescents. Weight for length (W/L) is a useful marker of obesity in premature infants. To study if higher W/ L in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) correlated with higher Respiratory Severity Scores (RSS). Methods Used Supported by NIH (Award # 1U54GM115428). Preterm infants born @ <30 weeks requiring oxygen @ 30-33 weeks for >2 days were enrolled. Weight, length, and head circumference were measured weekly by the research nurse. Data on mean calories & protein, W/L z-scores & BMI was collected. RSS was calculated as per the STOP-ROP trial. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Linear mixed model regression was used to study the relationship between the continuous variables with potential covariates. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Summary of Results We enrolled 58 preterm infants. Maternal and neonatal demographics shown in figure 1. For every unit increase in Wt/L Z score, RSS increased by 0.06 (p <0.0001). RSS was significantly higher in grade 3 BPD- 1.0 vs 0.2 in grade 1 BPD (p <0.001). RSS significantly correlated with WT/L and BMI even after including postnatal steroids, gestational age, and sex in the regression model. Conclusions Our study is the first to demonstrate that higher BMI and WT/L may adversely affect respiratory severity in BPD infants. Hence, attention should be paid to avoid preterm obesity in infants with BPD. (Figure Presnted).

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily members are key regulators for lung development and progress of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mechanisms by which lipoxin A4 (LXA4) attenuates development of BPD have not been clarified. Neonatal murine BPD models were inducted by hyperoxia treatment. Neonatal mice were exposed to room air or 85% O2 hyperoxia with or without treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 or anti-TGF-beta antibodies. Mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12 cells) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3 cells) were cultured in room air or 85% O2 followed by treatment of LXA4, anti-TGF-beta antibodies, and let-7c mimic/anti-microRNA transfections. Treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies both attenuated the mice alveolar simplification induced by hyperoxia. Hyperoxia treatment significantly altered pulmonary basal mRNA and protein expressions of several important extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM remodeling proteins including fibronectin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), elastin, tenascin C, collagen I, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies suppressed the mRNA and protein expressions of TGF-beta1 and TGF-betaR1 but not TGF-betaR2 in the lungs exposed to hyperoxia. Treatment with LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies alleviated hyperoxia-induced injury of the NIH/3T3 cells identified by morphologic observation and flow cytometry, and expressions of ECM, ECM remodeling proteins, and TGF-beta1 signaling pathway, but reversed by transfection with let-7c anti-miRNA. LXA4 upregulated the let-7c expression in MLE-12 cells, transfection with let-7c anti-miRNA, inhibited the LXA4-induced let-7c expression in MLE-12 cells exposed to hyperoxia and reduced the relative luciferase activity of let-7c binding with let-7c binding sites of the TGF-betaR1 3' UTR. Treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies significantly improved histology, ECM, and ECM remodeling proteins in the lungs isolated from the murine BPD model induced by hyperoxia. The LXA4-imparted protective effects on hyperoxia-induced lung injury are mediated by upregulation of let-7c and inhibition of TGF-beta1 and subsequent downregulation of TGF-beta1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Purpose of Study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common morbidities among surviving premature infants. BPD is characterized by abnormal alveolar septation and aberrant vascular development. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is a divergent member of TGF-b superfamily and its expression increases under various stress conditions including inflammation, hyperoxia, and senescence. Our prior studies showed that GDF15 expression is increased in neonatal mouse BPD models and that GDF15 loss exacerbates oxidative stress and decreases viability in human pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. Our overall hypothesis that loss of GDF15 will exacerbate hyperoxic lung injury in the neonatal lung in vivo. Methods Used We exposed neonatal Gdf15-/-mice, and wild type (WT) controls on a similar background to room air or hyperoxia (95% O2) for 5 days after birth (saccular stage of lung development). The mice were euthanized on PND 21 (alveolar stage of lung development). Lung morphometry was evaluated by the mean linear intercept (MLI). Pulmonary vessel density and macrophage count were quantified using immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism 8 software. Summary of Results Upon exposure to hyperoxia, the survival in Gdf15-/-mice was significantly decreased compared to WT mice (26% vs 57% respectively, p <0.01) (n=32-54/group). MLI was increased by hyperoxia exposure in both genotypes. Interestingly, alveolar simplification was higher in the Gdf15-/-females than WT females when exposed to hyperoxia (MLI = 30.0mm vs 26.2mum respectively; n=3-5/group, p <0.001), with no significant difference among WT and Gdf15-/-males. Interestingly, Gdf15-/-mice had lower macrophage count in the lung compared to WT mice (macrophage counts/HPF = 4.9 vs 12.4 respectively, n=8/group, p <0.001), with no sexspecific differences. The pulmonary vascular density was decreased in hyperoxia with no significant differences between both genotypes. Conclusions Our results suggest that in the neonatal mouse BPD models, loss of GDF15 exacerbates neonatal hyperoxic lung injury with respect to alveolar development. We are currently measuring the cell-specific expression of GDF15 in the neonatal lung at different developmental time points. GDF15, a stress responsive cytokine, may modulate alveolarization in the developing lung.

AB  - Purpose of Study BPD-associated PH is a common life-threatening sequela of preterm infants that lacks curative therapies. We showed that hyperoxia increases lung AMPKalpha activation in neonatal mice. Whether this alteration is a compensatory or contributory phenomenon in hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD is unclear. Thus,we hypothesized that endothelial AMPKalpha-deficient neonatal mice would be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wildtype littermates. Methods Used To determine the necessary role of endothelial AMPKalpha signaling in neonatal lung injury, we decreased endothelial AMPKalpha expression by breeding AMPKalpha-1flox/flox mice with Tie-Cre mice, and exposed endothelial AMPKalpha-1 sufficient or deficient mouse pups to air or hyperoxia (70% O2) from PND1-14. Lung morphometric and echocardiographic studies were done on PND28 to determine the effects of AMPKalpha-1 gene and hyperoxia on alveolarization, lung vascularization, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH. To determine the sufficient role of AMPK signaling in neonatal lung injury, C57BL6J mice were treated with daily i.p. injections of 1 mg/kg of the AMPK agonist, aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) while they were exposed to air or hyperoxia through PND1-14. Lung morphometric studies were done on PND14 to determine the effects of hyperoxia and AMPKalpha activation on alveolarization and lung vascularization. Summary of Results Hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification, as evidenced by decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts. Hyperoxia also decreased lung angiogenesis. Further, hyperoxia induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, as evidenced by increased medial wall thickness of resistance lung vessels, decreased pulmonary acceleration time/ejection time ratio, and increased right ventricular systolic pressure. However, these effects of hyperoxia were augmented in the presence of endothelial AMPKalpha-1 deficiency. By contrast, AICAR-mediated AMPKalpha activation attenuated hyperoxic lung injury. Conclusions Our findings indicate that AMPKalpha signaling mitigates hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice. We propose that AMPKalpha is a potential therapeutic target for BPD infants with PH.

AB  - Case Report We present a six-year-old male (sibling 1) with a history of moderate persistent asthma and allergies followed by pediatric pulmonary who later required evaluation by cardiology due to episodes of diaphoresis and altered mental status during activity. Echocardiogram showed borderline elevated pulmonary pressures, thought to be a normal variant. Surveillance follow up was scheduled. Over the next three months, he continued to experience episodes of syncope. Review of family history at that point revealed a strong family history of pulmonary hypertension. A repeat echocardiogram showed worsening pulmonary pressures, and he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for further evaluation and triple therapy with sildenafil, bosentan, and epoprostenol. Cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary vascular resistance of 18.8 Wood Units on room air. Hospital course was complicated by rhino/enterovirus infection and multiple pulmonary hypertensive crises requiring ECMO. The child improved, was decannulated, and transferred to an outside hospital for transplant evaluation on tadalafil and subcutaneous remodulin therapy. Sibling 2 is a nine-year-old male with past medical history of recurrent bronchitis and autism spectrum disorder who was being followed for moderate persistent asthma, seasonal allergies, and increasing fatigue. Subsequent to his brother's admission, he was re-evaluated urgently and also admitted to the hospital floor for treatment of severe pulmonary hypertension. Genetic testing of both brothers revealed BMP2 mutation. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mmHg and increased pulmonary vascular resistance greater than three Wood Units x M2. In the pediatric population, it is often due to congenital heart defects, lung disease (such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and heritable mutations. Family history is an integral component of evaluation. The BMP2 mutation, as seen in these half-brothers, is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and is known to be associated with pulmonary hypertension. These sibling cases demonstrate the different diagnostic presentations and complexity around making this diagnosis in a pediatric patient.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of aspirin compared to placebo for the prevention of preterm birth (PTB) when initiated in early pregnancy in women with a previous spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). Study Design: We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (APRIL, NTR 5675). We recruited women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of SPTB (singleton pregnancy 22+0 - 37+0 weeks) following either preterm prelabor rupture of membranes or spontaneous contractions. After informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to daily aspirin (80 mg) or placebo started between 8+0 and 16+0 weeks gestation. Treatment was continued until 36+0 weeks gestation or delivery. Primary outcome was PTB before 37+0 weeks gestation. Secondary outcomes included a composite of poor neonatal outcome (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia >grade 1, intraventricular hemorrhage >grade 2, necrotizing enterocolitis >stage 1, retinopathy of prematurity, culture proven sepsis or perinatal death). A sample of 384 women was required to detect a PTB reduction from 36 to 23% (alpha-error 0.05, beta-error 0.2). Analyses were performed by intention to treat. Result(s): Between May 2016 and June 2019, we randomly allocated 194 women to aspirin and 193 to placebo. The PTB rate was 21.2% in the aspirin group versus 25.4% in the placebo group (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.58-1.2). SPTB occurred in 20.1% versus 23.8% of women (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.58-1.2). For women who were >=80% compliant with study medication, PTB rates were 18.5% versus 24.8% (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.46-1.2). The poor neonatal outcome rate was 4.6% versus 2.6% (RR 1.79; 95% CI 0.61 to 5.3). There were no significant differences in maternal morbidities such as hypertensive disorders and postpartum hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): Our data did not demonstrate a reduction of PTB in women with a previous SPTB who used aspirin 80 mg. The RR for PTB is comparable to larger studies on aspirin in other groups of women. A small reduction of PTB from aspirin in women with a previous SPTB cannot be excluded with the current sample size. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2019

AB  - Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by AIRE gene mutations. Clinical diagnosis is established by the presence of at least two components of the classic triad of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and Addisons disease. In Europe, the classic presentation is widely recognized and nonendocrine autoimmune manifestations are rarely reported. A recent study of 35 American APECED patients demonstrated a more heterologous presentation, with many nonendocrine manifestations including urticarial eruption, hepatitis, gastritis, intestinal dysfunction, pneumonitis and Sjogrens-like syndrome, all uncommon in European reports. Within the American cohort, 80% of patients developed a mean of three non-triad manifestations before reaching the classic triad. Finding of AIRE mutations and high-titer antiIFN- autoantibodies is seen in both European and American cohorts. We present the case of two siblings, who demonstrate an APECED-like phenotype with both classical and atypical features. They share the same heterozygous c132+1-132+3delinsCT AIRE mutation. The older, an eight-year-old boy, with history of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and onychomadesis in infancy, came to medical attention at 16 months of age due to failure to thrive (FTT), in addition to fevers and urticarial rash lasting months after his MMR vaccine. The fevers resolved with Anakinra, which was discontinued two years later due to pneumonia. From age 2-4 he developed an ALPs negative lymphadenopathy which self-resolved. Lung issues include chronic cough, initially treated as asthma but with poor bronchodilator response, and frequent lung infections, including 1-2 pneumonias per year. At age five evaluation for FTT revealed growth hormone deficiency. Two years later he was diagnosed with primary Addisons disease. Chronic abdominal discomfort, bloating, cyclical constipation/diarrhea, recurrent rashes, dystrophic nails, and SICCA symptoms are also present. His sister, age five, shows FTT, but no growth hormone deficiency. At age one, she too developed a fever and rash syndrome lasting 3 months. Severe GERD and constipation started in infancy and are ongoing. At age three she developed a transaminitis, initially diagnosed as EBV, but later thought to be autoimmune hepatitis. She has frequent viral respiratory infections, and pneumonia at age two. She has had a chronic cough, with poor bronchodilator response, for most of her life. Evaluation of seizure at age three showed normal brain activity. Brain MRI revealed partial agenesis of the corpus callosumand microgyria.Her brother has similarMRI findings.Both children have had developmental motor delay and poor tone. Brain dysgenesis and neurodevelopmental delay has not previously been described in APECED. Although there were both typical and atypical symptoms, the history in combination with genetic findings led to further investigation of an APECED-like syndrome. Autoantibody testing confirmed high-titer antiIFN- autoantibody typical of APECED in both children and hightiter BPIFB1 autoantibodies found almost exclusively in APECED pneumonitis in the brother. Whole exome sequencing and copy number variation analyses are underway to further evaluate the patients condition. This case demonstrates the importance of clinical presentation in the evaluation of genetic results and in the guidance of therapeutic management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Although erythropoiesis is impaired and anemia frequent in neonates born preterm, hematopoiesis in adults born preterm has not been previously studied. We hypothesize that adverse neonatal events durably affect erythropoiesis regulation, leading to a difference in hemoglobin levels in young adults born preterm compared to those born term. OBJECTIVE(S): We thus aimed to evaluate hemoglobin and erythropoietin levels in young adults born preterm, to identify neonatal events associated with erythropoiesis in adulthood and to examine the relationships of hemoglobin levels with respiratory function and blood pressure. DESIGN/METHODS: This study included 101 young adults (ages 18-29 years) born preterm (<=29 weeks of gestation) and 105 full-term controls. We measured office blood pressure using automated oscillometric device, complete blood count, serum erythropoietin levels (ELISA) and pulmonary function test. Group comparisons were performed using Student's t or Mann-Whitney U tests. Correlations were assessed using Pearson's coefficient and test. We performed a mediation analysis to assess the relationship between blood pressure, hemoglobin levels and preterm birth. RESULT(S): Tobacco use and sex adjusted hemoglobin levels were 5.3 (95% CI: 2.9, 7.7) g/L higher in preterm-born individuals compared to controls (Table). We did not observe a difference in erythropoietin levels (7.3+/-3.4 and 8.12+/-3.40 U/L in the term and the preterm groups, respectively, p=0.102). Duration of oxygen supplementation in the neonatal period was independently associated with higher hemoglobin levels in the preterm group. In adults born preterm with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, airflow limitation was associated with higher hemoglobin levels. Both systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were increased in individuals born preterm (p=0.042 and p=0.0008, respectively). Higher hemoglobin levels were associated with higher SBP and DBP, independently of term or preterm status. Mediation analysis (Figure) suggests that hemoglobin increase contributes to 37% and 32% of the effect of preterm birth on SBP and DBP, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): While erythropoietin levels are similar between groups, hemoglobin levels are higher in young adults born preterm, especially in cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and airflow limitation. Hemoglobin increase is associated with elevated blood pressure in this population. Understanding mechanisms of impaired erythropoiesis regulation in adults born preterm will be important in designing antihypertensive approaches specific to this population. Results shown as mean +/- SD or medians (25%-75%) and comparisons were performed using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test, when appropriate. (Figure Presented).

AB  - SESSION TITLE: Palliative Care and End-of-Life Issues Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: The decision to place a tracheostomy in a child with chronic respiratory failure (CRF) is best made through a shared decision-making (SDM) process involving the clinical team and the patient/family. To date, no studies describe the complex ecosystem in which these decisions occur. In this case series, we identified common threads and variables in the medical ecosystem for each child. METHOD(S): From July 2016, through December 2020, an SDM process was incorporated into routine care of children with CRF who were < 18 years old, admitted to an inpatient service, and for whom tracheostomy was a consideration. When completely implemented, the process included a palliative care consult, a standardized decision aid and 12 questions designed to elucidate medical and psychosocial considerations. The investigators performed retrospective chart reviews with a focus on the 3 core elements of a medical microsystem: the patient, the provider and information. Results were entered in a REDCap database with descriptive analysis performed. RESULT(S): The 29 patients who met inclusion criteria varied in age (0 to 18 years, median=1.3) and length of stay (9 to 333 days, median=45). 86% lived until discharge. 48% received tracheostomies. All patients were medically complex with multiple respiratory diagnoses and at least one co-morbidity. Frequent respiratory diagnoses included: neuromuscular weakness (66%), chronic aspiration (55%), chest wall deformity (31%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (31%) and asthma (21%). Comorbidities included: swallowing dysfunction (93%), neurologic diagnoses (83%), cardiac diagnoses (62%), and genetic syndromes (45%). 28% of patients' families required language interpreting services. 30% of patients required permission from a governmental agency before limiting interventions. During the hospitalization reviewed, each patient encountered a mean of 6.2 medical specialties, 1.93 surgical specialties, and 8.47 non-physician specialties. The most frequent medical consult services were pulmonology (86%) and palliative care (69%). Chart review identified clear documentation of information relevant to the SDM in at least one note in the following areas: respiratory diagnoses and co-morbidities (100%); family understanding of the diagnoses (83%); effect of tracheostomy on respiratory and overall prognosis (79%,69%); family's hopes for the child (51%). However, this information was not recorded systematically. CONCLUSION(S): Common threads included the overarching diagnoses of CRF, medical complexity, clinical services encountered, and type of information needed. Heterogeneity among patients posed a challenge to standardization of a process that enables health care providers and the family to form a well-functioning team. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Once the possibility of a tracheostomy is identified, an SDM team could be formed and organized around the unique information needed in each case.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of the overexpression of the placental growth factor (PGF) and hyperoxia on lung development and determines whether anti-PGF antibody ameliorates hyperoxia-mediated impairment of lung development in newborn rats. After exposure to normoxic conditions for seven days, newborn rats subjected to normoxia were intraperitoneally or intratracheally injected with physiological saline, adenovirus-negative control (Ad-NC), or adenovirus-PGF (Ad-PGF) to create the Normoxia, Normoxia+Ad-NC, and Normoxia+Ad-PGF groups, respectively. Newborn rats subjected to hyperoxia were intraperitoneally injected with physiological saline or anti-PGF antibodies to create the Hyperoxia and Hyperoxia+anti-PGF groups, respectively. Our results revealed significant augmentation in the levels of PGF and its receptor Flt-1 in the lung tissues of newborn rats belonging to the Normoxia+Ad-PGF or Hyperoxia groups. PGF overexpression in these groups caused lung injury in newborn rats, while anti-PGF antibody treatment significantly cured the hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Moreover, PGF overexpression significantly increased TNF-alpha and Il-6 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of the Normoxia+Ad-PGF and Hyperoxia groups. However, their levels were significantly reduced in the BAL fluid of the Hyperoxia+anti-PGF group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PGF overexpression and hyperoxia treatment significantly increased the expression of the angiogenesis marker, CD34. However, its expression was significantly decreased upon administration of anti-PGF antibodies (compared to the control group under hyperoxia). In conclusion, PGF overexpression impairs lung development in newborn rats while its inhibition using an anti-PGF antibody ameliorates the same. These results provided new insights for the clinical management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants.Copyright © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

AB  - Caffeine, the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug is a central nervous system(CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class. It is a white crystalline purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid which is bitter in taste. Caffeine is structurally related to the adenine and guanine bases of DNA and RNA. It is found in the nuts, seeds or leaves of a number of plants native to East Asia, Africa, and South America, and its natural function is to prevent germination of nearby seeds and to protect them against predator insects. Caffeine can have both positive and negative impact on human health. It can be used to treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines which confers a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Caffeine is classified by the US FDA as generally recognized as safe(GRAS). Toxic doses are over 10 gm/day for an adult, which are much higher than the typical dose of under 500 mg/day. However, pure powdered caffeine, available as a dietary supplement, can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts. In this review article, we discuss about the health benefits and adverse effects of caffeine along with its future prospects.Copyright © 2020, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - Male premature neonates are more susceptible than females to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. GDF15 (Growth and differentiation factor 15) is a secreted cytokine and plays a role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. In this study, we sought to elucidate the sex-specific expression of Gdf15 in the lung in vivo in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and its regulation by Hif-1alpha, and to delineate the differences in GDF15 expression in male and female human umbilical venous endothelial cells in an in vitro model of oxygen toxicity. Following hyperoxia exposure (95% FiO2, PND (postnatal day 1-5: saccular stage of lung development), neonatal male mice (C57BL/6) show increased GDF15 and decreased HIF-1alpha expression compared to female mice. For the in vitro experiments, male and female HUVECs were exposed to room air condition (21% O2, 5% CO2) or in hyperoxia condition (95% O2, 5% CO2) for up to 72h. Male HUVECs had greater expression of GDF15 mRNA and protein. To study the inter-relationship between GDF15 and HIF-1alpha, we measured the expression of GDF15 in H441 cells after HIF-1alpha knockdown using promoter dual luciferase reporter assay, which showed that HIF-1alpha and GDF15 expression are inversely related under normoxia and hyperoxia. The results indicate that sex differences exist in the expression and modulation of GDF15 by HIF-1alpha in neonatal hyperoxic injury both in vivo and in vitro. These differences could explain in part the mechanisms behind sex-specific differences in BPD. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common pulmonary complication in preterm infants. Acetate is a metabolite produced by the gut microbiota, and its anti-inflammatory function is well known. The role of acetate in BPD has not been studied. Here, we investigate the effects of acetate on lung inflammation and damage in mice model of BPD. Objective(s): To investigate the role of acetate in the development of BPD. Method(s): C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups on the 3rd day after birth: room air group, hyperoxia group, and hyperoxia + acetate (250 mM, 0.02 ml/g) group. The expression of inflammatory factors was determined by ELISA and RT-PCR, and NLRP3 and caspase-1 were detected by Western blot. High-throughput sequencing was used to detect bacterial communities in the mice intestines. Result(s): After acetate treatment, the expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18, NLRP3, and caspase-1 were significantly reduced, while the expression of GPR43 was increased. In the BPD mice treated with acetate, the proportion of Escherichia-Shigella was lower than in placebo-treated BPD mice, while the abundance of Ruminococcus was increased. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that acetate may regulate intestinal flora and reduce inflammatory reactions and lung injury in BPD. Therefore, acetate may be an effective drug to protect against neonatal BPD.© Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Ran, He, Ai and Shi.

AB  - Burkholderia cepacia is an important opportunistic organism in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients especially in newborns. The natural ecology of these bacteria associated with plants is also a cause of infectious potential. The disease-causing potential of bacteria as a nosocomial pathogen may be due to its ability to survive in antiseptic solutions, contamination equipment. The patient was hospitalized for prematurity and respiratory distress syndrome. He was treated with surfactant intratracheally for the respiratory distress syndrome. Umbilical catheter was inserted. Ampicillin and gentamicin treatments were initiated. The patient who received respiratory support for a long time was given a steroid protocol because of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Burkholderia cepacia was detected in the blood and tracheal aspirate cultures of the patient, whose infection markers increased and a new area of infection was detected on the chest radiograph. Colistin and ciprofloxacin treatments were given according to the culture antibiogram. Screening tests revealed B. cepacia colonization in incubator moistening solutions. All incubator humidification solutions in the hospital were changed. Burkholderia cepacia is a rare cause of nosocomial infection in intensive care units but resistant to many treatments. With its capability to colonize water and grow on microbicides, the presence of B. cepacia in a patient's blood warrants further investigation in institutions providing care.Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe complication of the respiratory system associated with preterm birth. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) play a major role in tissue homeostasis, inflammation, and wound healing. However, the role in BPD remains unclear. The present study showed that ILC2s, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages increased significantly in BPD mice as compared to the control mice. Administration with recombinant mouse IL-33 amplified the above phenomena and aggravated the alveolar structural disorder and functional injury in mice subjected to BPD, and the opposite was true with anti-ST2 antibody. In addition, the depletion of ILC2s in BPD mice with anti-CD90.2 antibody substantially abolished the destructive effect on BPD. In the treatment of BPD with dexamethasone, the number of ILC2s and M2 macrophages and levels of IL-4 and IL-13 decreased with remission as compared to the control group. This study identified a major destructive role of the ILC2s in BPD that could be attenuated as a therapeutic strategy.Copyright © 2020 Lanlan Mi et al.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by arrested alveolar and vascular development in premature infants. Metformin protects against the cardiovascular impairment induced by diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether metformin could also enhance pulmonary vascular development in hyperoxic neonatal mice and investigate possible mechanisms involved. C57BL/6J newborn mice were randomly assigned to either of two groups - the room air group or the hyperoxia group - within 12 h postnatally. The mice were subcutaneously injected with metformin (100 mg/kg) or saline for 14 days. Lung morphology and PECAM-1 (CD31) expression in the lung were evaluated at postnatal days 7 and 14. Ki-67 and Gli1 expression in vascular endothelial cells was evaluated at postnatal day 14 by immunofluorescence staining. Flow cytometry (FCM) was also used to analyze Gli1 expression. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) were used to investigate the role of metformin in vascular proliferation and tubular formation under 90% oxygen in vitro by cell counting Kti-8 (CCK8) assays and tube formation assays. Exposure to hyperoxia resulted in impaired lung development in newborn mice. Metformin enhanced the terminal airspace and radial alveolar count in newborn mice thus exposed. Immunohistochemistry staining and western blot assays revealed that metformin enhanced the expression of CD31 in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. Immunofluorescence staining showed that metformin enhanced the expression of Ki-67 in vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, both immunofluorescence staining and FCM demonstrated that metformin increased Gli1 expression in vascular endothelial cells. Additionally, cell counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and viability assays of HUVECs in vitro both indicated that metformin improved the vascular proliferation and tube formation of HUVECs under 90% oxygen. These results indicated that metformin enhanced lung vascular development and upregulated the expression of Gli1 in the pulmonary vascular endothelial cells in hyperoxic neonatal mice.Copyright © 2020 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Introduction: Hyperoxia-induced injury is a common form of damage in lung tissues, which could lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in newborns. Recent studies have discovered that FOXA2 played a substantial role in protecting lung tissues from various injuries and lncRNA-NEF could activate the expression of FOXA2. However, it is unclear whether lncRNA-NEF could alleviate hyperoxia-caused damage of lung tissues by activating FOXA2. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, we used the lentivirus to establish the lncRNA-NEF overexpression RLE-6TN and MLE-12 cells. After that, the lentivirus was also used to knockdown the expression of FOXA2 in the two lncRNA-NEF overexpression cells. ELISA was performed to detect the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. The production of ROS, SOD, MDA and LDH was determined with the commercial kits. The apoptosis rates of these cells were measured with the flow cytometry. Result(s): The secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 was inhibited in RLE-6TN and MLE-12 cells after the overexpression of lncRNA-NEF. Furthermore, the production of ROS, MDA and LDH was also suppressed after the upregulation of lncRNA-NEF. The promotion of lncRNA-NEF also restricted the hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. However, the knockdown of FOXA2 abolished all the inhibitory effects exerted by lncRNA-NEF. Conclusion(s): LncRNA-NEF regulated hyperoxia-caused inflammatory response, oxidative damage and apoptosis of RLE-6TN and MLE-12 cells by affecting the expression of FOXA2.Copyright © 2020 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the morbidity and mortality of live newborns born in a private hospital in Mexico, through admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the neonatal intermediate therapy unit (NITU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of cases were carried out of the births of the Hospital Angeles Lomas (State of Mexico) that have entered the NICU / NITU from 2016 to 2019. All live newborns older than 24 weeks were included. A descriptive analysis was performed calculating means, percentages and standard deviations. RESULT(S): 4,234 newborns were registered, of which 13.7% were premature. 478 (11.3%) newborns were admitted to pathological nurseries, 203 to the NICU (4.8%) and 275 to the NITU (6.5%). The main causes of admission to the NICU were retention of pulmonary fluid (32.5%), hyaline membrane disease (27.6%), and neonatal sepsis (10.3%). The main causes of admission to the NITU were retention of pulmonary fluid (41%), multifactorial hyperbilirubinemia (15.2%) and hyperbilirubinemia due to group incompatibility (11.6%). The neonatal mortality rate was 2.7 out of 1000 live births, the main causes of death were hyaline membrane disease complicated by neonatal sepsis and perinatal asphyxia. CONCLUSION(S): No significant differences were found in the private hospital studied compared to other studies evaluating neonatal morbidity and mortality. The mortality rate in this hospital was lower than that registered countrywide, however the average number of days in the NICU was higher and the prematurity rate slightly higher than that reported in developed countries.Copyright © 2020 Asociacion Mexicana de Ginecologia y Obstetricia.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common long-term lung complications of prematurely born infants caused by prolonged injury and repair during immature lung development. Resveratrol has reported to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, and antiapoptosis effects. This study aimed to investigate the effect of resveratrol in BPD. Method(s): Neonate rats were delivered spontaneously and randomized divided into four groups on postnatal day (PN) 0.5: room air (21% O2)+dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), room air + resveratrol, hyperoxia (80%)+DMSO, hyperoxia + resveratrol. Lung tissues were collected on PN1, PN7, and PN14. Protective effects of resveratrol on hyperoxia-induced lung injury were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, TUNEL staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, qRT-PCR, and western blotting. Result(s): Hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification and apoptosis were alleviated by resveratrol; resveratrol reduced ROS production, up-regulated SIRT1, decreased the expressing of p53, and acetyl-p53 in the lung of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal rats. Conclusion(s): This study showed that resveratrol alleviated hyperoxia-induced apoptosis in neonatal rats lung tissue via reducing ROS and p53. Resveratrol-induced SIRT1 upregulation and acetyl-p53 reduction may also be involved in lung protection.Copyright © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In order to evaluate the effect of budesonide combined with pulmonary surfactant on neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia.A total of 120 preterm infants were included in this study, and their pH, oxygen partial pressure (PO2) and blood gas analysis were evaluated.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by laser confocal method.Detection of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in PBMCs by immunofluorescence.Western blot was used to detect small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) specific protease 1 (SENP1).Compared with group B, the pH and PO2 of group C and group D were significantly improved (P<0.01).Compared with group B, the oxygen inhalation time and ventilator-assisted venous rate of other groups all used pulmonary surfactant (PS), and the incidence of BPD was significantly reduced (P<0.05).The incidence of BPD in group D was less than that in group C (x2=4.00, P<0.05).Compared with the control group, the ROS level in the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) group was significantly increased, SERP1 increased, and SIRT1 decreased.Compared with NRDS, when budesonide was combined with multi-actantAlfa, ROS decreased, SENP1 decreased, SIRT1 nuclear cytoplasmic shuttle rate decreased, and nuclear SIRT1 increased (P<0.01).Compared with the control group, the ROS level of NRDS increased significantly, SENP1 increased, and nuclear SIRT1 decreased (P<0.05).Compared with the NRDS group, when treated with budesonide and pulmonary surfactant, ROS levels decreased, SENP1 decreased, and nuclear SIRT1 increased (P<0.01).Budesonide combined with lung surfactant can prevent BPD in preterm infants by activating the SIRT1 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Board of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology.

AB  - During the newborn period, intestinal commensal bacteria influence pulmonary mucosal immunology via the gut-lung axis. Epidemiological studies have linked perinatal antibiotic exposure in human newborns to an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but whether this effect is mediated by the gut-lung axis is unknown. To explore antibiotic disruption of the newborn gut-lung axis, we studied how perinatal maternal antibiotic exposure influenced lung injury in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We report that disruption of intestinal commensal colonization during the perinatal period promotes a more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype characterized by increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, metagenomic shifts were associated with decreased IL-22 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage and were independent of hyperoxia-induced inflammasome activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unrecognized influence of the gut-lung axis during the development of neonatal lung injury, which could be leveraged to ameliorate the most severe and persistent pulmonary complication of preterm birth.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuate lung injury in experimental models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a chemokine secreted by MSCs, modulates angiogenesis and stem cell recruitment. Here we tested the hypothesis that SDF-1 mediates MSC protective effects in experimental BPD by modulating angiogenesis., METHODS: SDF-1 was knocked down in MSCs using lentiviral vectors carrying anti-SDF-1 short hairpin RNA (MSC-SDF KD). Non-silencing short hairpin RNA was used as control (MSC-NS control). Newborn rats exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (FiO2 = 0.85) for 3 weeks, were randomly assigned to receive a single intra-tracheal injection (IT) of MSC-NS control or MSC-SDF KD (1 x 106 cells/50 mul) or placebo on postnatal day 7. The degree of alveolarization, lung angiogenesis, inflammation, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) were assessed at postnatal day 21., RESULTS: Administration of IT MSC-NS control improved lung alveolarization, angiogenesis and inflammation, and attenuated PH in newborn rats with hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI). In contrast, knockdown of SDF-1 in MSCs significantly reduced their beneficial effects on alveolarization, angiogenesis, inflammation and PH., CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic benefits of MSCs in neonatal HILI are in part mediated by SDF-1, through anti-inflammatory and angiogenesis promoting mechanisms. Therapies directly targeting this chemokine may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Promoting endogenous pulmonary regeneration is crucial after damage to restore normal lungs and prevent the onset of chronic adult lung diseases. Objective(s): To investigate whether the cell-cycle inhibitor p16INK4a limits lung regeneration after newborn bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a condition characterized by the arrest of alveolar development, leading to adult sequelae. Method(s): We exposed p16INK4a2/2 and p16INK4a ATTAC (apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase 8) transgenic mice to postnatal hyperoxia, followed by pneumonectomy of the p16INK4a2/2 mice. We measured p16INK4a in blood mononuclear cells of preterm newborns, 7- to 15-year-old survivors of BPD, and the lungs of patients with BPD. Measurements and Main Results: p16INK4a concentrations increased in lung fibroblasts after hyperoxia-induced BPD in mice and persisted into adulthood. p16INK4a deficiency did not protect against hyperoxic lesions in newborn pups but promoted restoration of the lung architecture by adulthood. Curative clearance of p16INK4a-positive cells once hyperoxic lung lesions were established restored normal lungs by adulthood. p16INK4a deficiency increased neutral lipid synthesis and promoted lipofibroblast and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell development within the stem-cell niche. Besides, lipofibroblasts support self-renewal of AT2 cells into alveolospheres. Induction with a PPARg (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g) agonist after hyperoxia also increased lipofibroblast and AT2 cell numbers and restored alveolar architecture in hyperoxia-exposed mice. After pneumonectomy, p16INK4a deficiency again led to an increase in lipofibroblast and AT2 cell numbers in the contralateral lung. Finally, we observed p16INK4a mRNA overexpression in the blood and lungs of preterm newborns, which persisted in the blood of older survivors of BPD. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate the potential of targeting p16INK4a and promoting lipofibroblast development to stimulate alveolar regeneration from childhood to adulthood.Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society

AB  - Circular RNA (circRNA) has been increasingly proven as a new type of promising therapeutic RNA molecule in a variety of human diseases. However, the role of circRNA in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not yet been elucidated. Here, a new circRNA circABCC4 was identified from the Agilent circRNA chip as a differentially expressed circRNA in BPD. The relationship between circABCC4 level and BPD clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The function of circABCC4 was evaluated by performing CCK-8 and apoptosis analysis in vitro and BPD model analysis in vivo. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), luciferase reporter and rescue experiments were used to elucidate the interaction between circABCC4 and miR-663a. Luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to elucidate the interaction between PLA2G6 and miR-663a. CircABCC4 and PLA2G6 levels were increased, while miR-663a levels were decreased in the BPD group, compared to the control group. MiR-663a inhibited apoptosis by repressing PLA2G6 expression, while circABCC4 enhanced the apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells by sponging miR-663a and increasing PLA2G6 expression. In conclusion, circABCC4 promotes the evolving of BPD by spongening miR-663a and up-regulating PLA2G6 expression, which makes circABCC4 an ideal molecular target for early diagnosis and intervention of BPD.© Copyright © 2020 Chen, Feng, Wu, Lu, Banu Pasha, Permall, Chen, Sun, Li, Zhou, Yang, Zhang and Chen.

AB  - Objective: To quantify and compare levels of potential biomarkers in neonates with (i) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); (ii) BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH); (iii) PH without BPD; and (iv) neonates without lung disease at ~36 weeks postmenstrual age. Study design: Multiple potential biomarkers were measured in plasma samples of 90 patients using a multi-spot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical tests done included one-way ANOVA to compare levels of biomarkers between different groups. Result(s): Higher levels of ICAM-1 were present in infants with BPD and correlated with its severity. Infants with BPD have significantly higher levels of ANG-2 and lower levels of ANG-1. Infants with PH have higher levels of: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha. Infants with BPD-PH have significantly lower levels of MCP-1 and higher levels of IL-1beta than infants with PH without BPD. Conclusion(s): ICAM-1 may be used as a specific biomarker for diagnosis of BPD and its severity.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Background: Initial trials of lung-targeted budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) in surfactant to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants have shown benefit; however, the optimal safe dose is unknown. Method(s): Dose-escalation study of budesonide (0.025, 0.05, 0.10 mg/kg) in calfactatant in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) requiring intubation at 3-14 days. Tracheal aspirate (TA) cytokines, blood budesonide concentrations, and untargeted blood metabolomics were measured. Outcomes were compared with matched infants receiving surfactant in the Trial Of Late SURFactant (TOLSURF). Result(s): Twenty-four infants with mean gestational age 25.0 weeks and 743 g birth weight requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled at mean age 6 days. Budesonide was detected in the blood of all infants with a half-life of 3.4 h. Of 11 infants with elevated TA cytokine levels at baseline, treatment was associated with sustained decrease (mean 65%) at all three dosing levels. There were time- and dose-dependent decreases in blood cortisol concentrations and changes in total blood metabolites. Respiratory outcomes did not differ from the historic controls. Conclusion(s): Budesonide/surfactant had no clinical respiratory benefit at any dosing levels for intubated ELGANs. One-tenth the dose used in previous trials had minimal systemic metabolic effects and appeared effective for lung-targeted anti-inflammatory action.Copyright © 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are two debilitating disorders that develop in preterm infants exposed to supplemental oxygen to prevent respiratory failure. Both can lead to lifelong disabilities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vision loss. Due to the lack of a standard experimental model of coincident disease, the underlying associations between BPD and ROP are not well characterized. To address this gap, we used the robust mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy exposing C57BL/6 mice to 75% oxygen from postnatal day 7 to 12. The cardinal features of ROP were replicated by this strategy, and the lungs of the same mice were simultaneously examined for evidence of BPD-like lung injury, investigating both the short- and long-term effects of early-life supplemental oxygen exposure. At postnatal days 12 and 18, mild lung disease was evident by histopathologic analysis together with the expected vasculopathy in the inner retina. At later time points, the lung lesion had progressed to severe airspace enlargement and alveolar simplification, with concurrent thinning in the outer layer of the retina. In addition, critical angiogenic oxidative stress and inflammatory factors reported to be dysregulated in ROP were similarly impaired in the lungs. These data shed new light on the interconnectedness of these two neonatal disorders, holding potential for the discovery of novel targets to treat BPD and ROP.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology

AB  - Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus affects the health of premature infants. Palivizumab can reduce its complications. In Costa Rica, the efficiency of using this health technology is unknown. Objective(s): To evaluate the efficiency of prophylactic administration of palivizumab in premature infants versus traditional or usual clinical practice in the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, between 2013-2017. Method(s): An economic cost-effectiveness evaluation was carried out, from a socialsecurity approach (7 hospitals), with a one-year time horizon and without discount rate. The study population consisted of 173 premature infants: 38 were treated with palivizumab; and 135, without palivizumab. The clinical data were weight at birth, gestational age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and congenital heart disease. The cost data expressed in US dollars were medications, medical consultation, and diagnostic test. Effectiveness was assessed by the number of hospitalization days, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, bronchiolitis episodes, pneumonia, and deaths. The analyzes considered the decision tree, average and incremental cost-effectiveness, as well as of sensitivity. Result(s): Premature infants treated with palivizumab showed lower frequency in all the effectiveness variables, the decision tree showed an incremental cost-effectiveness of 78 US dollars, and mean cost-effectiveness was higher in premature infants treated with palivizumab. One additional hospitalization day with palivizumab treatment has a cost of 823 US dollars, while, in the intensive care unit, its cost represents 72 154 US dollars. Conclusion(s): Palivizumab produces health benefits for premature infants, in line with health policies in Costa Rica and worldwide. This technology can be considered as efficient in the social security of Costa Rica, insofar it generates health benefits that outweigh the costs circumscribed to the changes that occur in various aspects such as the number and conditions of premature infants who receive it, virus seasonality, or treatment cost.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

AB  - Objective: To identify postnatal risk factors for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development in preterm infants with gestational age <=32 weeks. Method(s): Seventy-two preterm infants(30 with BPD and 42 non-BPD controls) admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Children's Hospital of Soochow University during 2017 were enrolled in this prospective longitudinal study. Perinatal clinical data, a neonatal critical illness score (NCIS), different soluble B7-H3(sB7-H3), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels by days after birth were collected. An early predictive model for BPD development was established based on clinical data using multiple logistic regression analysis. And the sensitivity and specificity of the model were assesed by ROC curve. Result(s): Electrolyte disturbances, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hs-PDA), and the age that infants achieved 120 kcal/kg.d via enteral feeding >=40 days after birth were found to be associated with the BPD pathogenesis. Serum sB7-H3, IL-18, and NCIS were significantly higher in the BPD group compared to the non-BPD group (p < 0.05). BPD group had significantly lower enteral fluid and caloric intake compared to the non-BPD group at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days after birth. The risk factors were analyzed by multiple logistic regression and a predictive model of a combination of sB7-H3 (day 7), IL-18 (day 14), NCIS, and clinical risk factors was evaluated via ROC curve with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.960 having sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 97.6%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The causes of BPD are multifactorial postnatal risk factors. And the combination of sB7-H3 (day 7), IL-18 (day 14), NCIS, and clinical risk factors (electrolyte disturbances, hs-PDA, and the age that infants achieved 120 kcal/kg.d via enteral feeding >=40 days after birth) might be served as an optimal predictive model for the occurrence of BPD.© Copyright © 2020 Ding, Wang, Geng, Cui, Huang, Zhu and Zhu.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactor pathology. Animal studies and cohort studies suggest that poor nutrient intake after birth increases the risk of BPD. The objective of the present study was to determine the existence of association between BPD in very low birth weight (VLBW) and energy intake during the first week of life. We recorded in a retrospective cohort study the intake of enteral and parenteral macronutrients during this period by examining the nutritional and clinical history of 450 VLBW newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. After applying the relevant exclusion criteria, data for 389 VLBW infants were analysed, of whom 159 developed some degree of BPD. Among the newborns with BPD, energy and lipid intake was significantly lower and fluid intake was significantly higher. The energy intake for the 25th percentile in the group without BPD was 1778.2 kJ/kg during the first week of life. An energy intake <1778.2 kJ/kg in this period was associated with a 2-fold increase in the adjusted risk of BPD (OR 2.63, 95 % CI 1.30, 5.34). The early nutrition and the increase of energy intake in the first week of life are associated in our sample with a lower risk of BPD developing.Copyright © The Authors 2020.

AB  - Purpose: To study the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear transcription factor-kappaBp65 (NFkappaBp65) and TGF-1, and their correlation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonatal rats. Method(s): Twenty (20) pregnant rats were randomly divided into study and normal groups. Radial alveolar counts were carried out at 2, 8 and 15 days of age. The levels of ROS expression in the lung tissues of the two groups were assayed by ELISA while immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expressions of TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in neonatal lung tissues of the two groups. Pearson correlation test was used to analyze correlations amongst ROS, TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in the neonatal lung tissues. Result(s): At days 8 and 9 after birth, radial alveolar count was significantly lower in study rats than in control rats (p < 0.05). Expression levels of ROS, TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in study group were markedly raised at days 2, 4 and 8 after birth, relative to control (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The levels of ROS, TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaBp65 in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonatal rats are significantly and positively correlated, and are higher than those in normal rats. This provides a scientific basis for development of drugs for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Copyright © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

AB  - BackgroundCystein-rich protein 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) is a member of the CCN family of matricellular proteins that has an important role in tissue development and remodeling. However, the role of CCN1 in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. Accordingly, we have investigated the effects of CCN1 on a hyperoxia-induced lung injury model in neonatal rats. Methods In experiment 1, newborn rats were randomized to room air (RA) or 85% oxygen (O2) for 7 or 14 days, and we assessed the expression of CCN1. In experiment 2, rat pups were exposed to RA or O2 and received placebo or recombinant CCN1 by daily intraperitoneal injection for 10 days. The effects of CCN1 on hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation, alveolar and vascular development, vascular remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were observed. Results In experiment 1, hyperoxia downregulated CCN1 expression. In experiment 2, treatment with recombinant CCN1 significantly decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, reduced inflammasome activation, increased alveolar and vascular development, and reduced vascular remodeling and RVH in the hyperoxic animals. Conclusion These results demonstrate that hyperoxia-induced lung injury is associated with downregulated basal CCN1 expression, and treatment with CCN1 can largely reverse hyperoxic injury.

AB  - Airway microbial dysbiosis is associated with subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development in very preterm infants. However, the relationship of airway microbiome in normal pulmonary development has not been defined. To better understand the role of the airway microbiome, we compared normal and abnormal alveolar and pulmonary vascular development in mice with or without a microbiome. We hypothesized that the lungs of germ-free (GF) mice would have an exaggerated phenotypic response to hyperoxia compared with non- germ-free (NGF) mice. With the use of a novel gnotobiotic hyperoxia chamber, GF and NGF mice were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia. Alveolar morphometry, pulmonary mechanics, echocardiograms, inflammatory markers, and measures of pulmonary hypertension were studied. GF and NGF mice in normoxia showed no difference, whereas GF mice in hyperoxia showed protected lung structure and mechanics and decreased markers of inflammation compared with NGF mice. We speculate that an increase in abundance of pathogenic bacteria in NGF mice may play a role in BPD pathogenesis by regulating the proinflammatory signaling and neutrophilic inflammation in lungs. Manipulation of the airway microbiome may be a potential therapeutic intervention in BPD and other lung diseases.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society

AB  - Rationale: Antenatal factors, such as chorioamnionitis, preeclampsia, and postnatal injury, are associated with an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) after preterm birth. IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) is markedly decreased in normal preterm infants, but whether IGF-1 treatment can prevent BPD or PH is unknown. Objective(s): To evaluate whether postnatal treatment with rhIGF-1 (recombinant human IGF-1)/BP3 (binding peptide 3) improves lung growth and prevents PH in two antenatal models of BPD induced by intraamniotic exposure to endotoxin (ETX) or sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), and in a postnatal model due to prolonged hyperoxia. Method(s): ETX or sFlt-1 were administered into the amniotic sac of pregnant rats at Embryonic Day 20 to simulate antenatal models of chorioamnionitis and preeclampsia, respectively. Pups were delivered by cesarean section at Embryonic Day 22 and treated with rhIGF-1/BP3 (0.02-20 mg/kg/d intraperitoneal) or buffer for 2 weeks. Study endpoints included radial alveolar counts (RACs), vessel density, and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Direct effects of rhIGF-1/BP3 (250 ng/ml) on fetal lung endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation and alveolar type 2 cell proliferation were studied by standard methods in vitro. Measurements and Main Results: Antenatal ETX and antenatal sFlt-1 reduced RAC and decreased RVH in infant rats. In both models, postnatal rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment restored RAC and RVH to normal values when compared with placebo injections. rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment also preserved lung structure and prevented RVH after postnatal hyperoxia. In vitro studies showed that rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment increased lung endothelial cell and alveolar type 2 cell proliferation. Conclusion(s): Postnatal rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment preserved lung structure and prevented RVH in antenatal and postnatal BPD models. rhIGF-1/BP3 treatment may provide a novel strategy for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants.Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society.

AB  - Since March 2020, the world is involved in the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2. Some authors have described the ultrasonographic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in adults and children, but data on neonates are lacking. Our objective was to describe the ultrasonographic lung pattern on newborns with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Newborns who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in respiratory samples and were evaluated with point-of-care lung ultrasound (LU) from March to April 2020 were included. LU was performed bedside by a single investigator at the time of diagnosis and every 48 h during the first week following diagnosis. Six areas were studied. Three neonates were included. Infants' comorbidities included meconium aspiration syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and Hirschsprung's disease. One required mechanical ventilation. No deaths occurred. LU showed B-lines, consolidation, and spared areas. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion was observed Conclusion(s): LU could be of value when managing COVID-19 neonates. We describe the findings of lung ultrasound monitoring during the first week following diagnosis in three neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection.What is known:* Lung ultrasound (LU) is a useful tool in COVID-19 management in adults. To date, no report on LU and neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been published.What is new:* This study adds evidence about LU findings in neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Early intervention programs especially with a focus on parent-child interaction in the first year of life have been shown to improve outcome of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants; however, how the indications for early intervention of VLBW children are handled in Germany, has not yet been systematically investigated. Aim(s): The following questions were addressed: which offers are available from early intervention programs in Germany for VLBW infants? What barriers exist for utilization of early intervention measures by VLBW premature infants? Which VLBW premature infants receive an early intervention during their first year of life? Methods: Within the framework of a structured interview specialist institutions providing early intervention programs in Germany (N= 81) were questioned about the therapists and methods employed for VLBW infants. Simultaneously, barriers for the utilization of early intervention programs were collated. Using an online questionnaire follow-up institutions for VLBW infants (N= 44) were asked about the type of recommendation in the first year of life as well as barriers for early intervention programs. The data from a prospective cohort study of VLBW infants (German Neonatal Network, N= 1387) were analyzed with respect to the utilization of early intervention programs. Result(s): Of the specialist centers offering early intervention programs 38 out of 81 focused on parent-child-interaction in addition to developmental therapy. Barriers to initiation of early intervention measures in the first year of life were insufficient information or understanding of the benefits on the part of the parents and the primary care physicians. A sociomedical aftercare was considered to be a promoting factor. During the first year of life 346 (25%) VLBW infants participated in early intervention programs and received predominantly therapeutic measures following neonatal complications, such as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH, odds ratio OR, 95% confidence interval CI: 1.35, 1.17-1.55), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 1.75, 1.20-2.55) and lower gestational age (0.77, 0.62-0.95). The most important factor for access to an early intervention was whether the clinic or follow-up institution recommended early intervention measures after discharge (OR, 95% CI: 5.70, 2.78-11.69). Conclusion(s): The evidence-based implementation of early interventions with a focus on parent-child interaction has so far not been incorporated into treatment and shows a large regional variation. Early intervention programs in Germany are mostly carried out in the sense of tertiary prevention in VLBW infants while they are rarely used as health promotion or secondary prevention with a focus on socioemotional development and inclusion.Copyright © 2018, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic chest disease caused by prolonged ventilation and oxygenation which leads to neonatal disability. Method(s): It was a prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) (Study ID: TCTR20191211004) which was conducted in Tanta University Hospital (TUH) from July 2016 to March 2018 on 100 preterm neonates who exhibited severe respiratory distress (RD) on mechanical ventilation (MV). The studied neonates were assigned to two groups: group one which received melatonin supplementation and group two which did not. Urinary beta2-microglobulin (B2M) and serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels were measured 3 and 10 days after hospitalization. The length of neonates' stay in incubator was determined, and the number of newborns with established BPD was calculated. Result(s): Significant decreases were detected in urinary B2M and serum KL-6 levels of neonates in group one who received melatonin, as compared to their counterparts in group two who did not take melatonin (P< 0.05). In addition, there was a significant decline in the length of incubator stay of neonates in group one, in comparison to that of newborns in group two (P<0.05). Moreover, neonates in group one who received melatonin displayed a significant decline in the development of established cases of BPD, as compared to group two who did not take melatonin (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): As evidenced by the obtained results, melatonin supplementation could be used as adjuvant therapy for the prevention of BPD in preterm neonates. Nonetheless, further studies involving a larger number of neonates must be performed on this topic in order to recommend melatonin administration for ventilated premature neonates who are susceptible to the development of neonatal BPD.Copyright © 2020 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Objective: To describe the incidence, case-fatality rate and pathogen distribution of late-onset sepsis (LOS) among preterm infants in China. To investigate risk factors and short-term outcomes associated with LOS caused by Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Method(s): This cohort study included all infants born at <34 weeks' gestation and admitted to 25 tertiary hospitals in 19 provinces in China from May, 2015 to April, 2018. Infants were excluded who died or were discharged within 3 days of being born. Result(s): A total of 1199 episodes of culture-positive LOS were identified in 1133 infants, with an incidence of 4.4% (1133/25,725). Overall, 15.4% (175/1133) of infants with LOS died and 10.0% (113/1133) of infants died within 7 days of LOS onset. Among 1214 isolated pathogens, Gram-negative bacteria were the most common (51.8%, 629/1214) and fungi accounted for 17.1% (207/1214). Use of central lines, longer duration of antibiotics and previous carbapenem exposure were related to increased risk of fungal LOS compared with Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria LOS was independently associated with increased risk of death, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Fungal LOS was independently associated with increased risk of periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis. Conclusion(s): Late-onset sepsis was a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Chinese neonatal intensive care units, with a distinct pathogen distribution from industrial countries. Clinical guidelines on the prevention and treatment of LOS should be developed and tailored to these LOS characteristics in Chinese neonatal intensive care units.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Myocardial function in very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs) develops during early postnatal life, but different patterns of temporal evolution that might be related to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are not completely understood. Method(s): A prospective cohort study including VLBWIs admitted to our NICU from January 2015 to 2017 was conducted. Plasma N-terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) levels were measured, and echocardiograms were performed at 24 and 72 h of life and weekly thereafter until 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA). We measured the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) by M-mode; the lateral tricuspid E', A', and S' waves; and the myocardial performance index (MPI) by tissue doppler imaging (TDI). The subjects were divided into non-BPD and BPD groups. Result(s): We included 101 VLBWIs. The TAPSE and E', A', and S' waves increased while MPI-TDI decreased over time. Birth gestational age (GA) and postnatal PMA impacted these parameters, which evolved differently in those who developed BPD compared to those in the non-BPD group. The NTproBNP levels at 14 days of life and different echocardiographic parameters were associated with the development of BPD in different multivariate models. Conclusion(s): TAPSE and TDI values depend on GA and PMA and follow a different temporal evolution that is related to the later development of BPD. Combined biochemical and echocardiographic biomarkers can help identify which VLBWIs are at higher risk of developing BDP.© Copyright © 2020 Mendez-Abad, Zafra-Rodriguez, Lubian-Lopez and Benavente-Fernandez.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is associated with post-prematurity respiratory disease (PRD) in survivors of extreme preterm birth. Identifying early biomarkers that correlate with later development of BPD and PRD may provide insights for intervention. In a preterm baboon model, elevated gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is associated with BPD, and GRP inhibition mitigates BPD occurrence. Objective(s): We performed a prospective cohort study to investigate whether urine GRP levels obtained in the first postnatal week were associated with BPD, PRD, and other urinary biomarkers of oxidative stress. Method(s): Extremely low gestational age infants (23-28 completed weeks) were enrolled in a US multicenter observational study, The Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01435187). We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between urine GRP in the first postnatal week and multiple respiratory outcomes: BPD, defined as supplemental oxygen use at 36 + 0 weeks postmenstrual age, and post-PRD, defined by positive quarterly surveys for increased medical utilization over the first year (PRD score). Result(s): A total of 109 of 257 (42%) infants had BPD, and 120 of 217 (55%) had PRD. On adjusted analysis, GRP level more than 80 was associated with BPD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-3.25) and positive PRD score (aOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.35-4.48). Urine GRP levels correlated with duration of NICU ventilatory and oxygen support and with biomarkers of oxidative stress: allantoin and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. Conclusion(s): Urine GRP in the first postnatal week was associated with concurrent urine biomarkers of oxidative stress and with later diagnoses of BPD and PRD.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe acute respiratory infections (ARI) in preterm infants. The incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations has not been defined in Mexico. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of ARI- and RSV-associated hospitalizations in preterm infants during the first year of life. Method(s): Prospective cohort study of 294 preterm infants followed up through monthly telephone calls and routine outpatient visits. Hospitalized children were identified through daily visits to pediatric wards of participating hospitals and through telephone calls. Respiratory samples were tested for RSV by RT-PCR. Result(s): Mean gestational age of participating infants was 33 weeks. Ninety-six infants were diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and 17 with congenital heart disease (CHD); 11 had both conditions. There were 71 hospitalization episodes in 53 infants. Respiratory samples for RSV detection were available in 44 hospitalization episodes, and the result was positive in 16 (36.3%). At least one hospitalization for ARI was recorded in 33 of 96 participants with BPD, in seven of 17 with CHD, and 18 of 192 infants without these diagnoses. Five (71.4%) of CHD infants who required admission also had BPD. RSV-confirmed hospitalization rates were 9.4%, 5.9%, and 2.6% for infants with BPD, CHD, and otherwise healthy preterm infants, respectively. Attributable RSV admission frequencies were estimated to be 13.6%, 16.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Mexican preterm infants, particularly those with BPD, have high rates of ARI- and RSVassociated hospitalizations. Specific interventions to reduce the incidence of severe infections in this highrisk group are required.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the clinical utility of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for prediction of moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We hypothesized that elevated NT-proBNP levels at 4 weeks of postnatal age may predict the severity of BPD in preterm infants. Study Design: The study design was a prospective observational study. The research team enrolled and followed a cohort of 70 infants with gestational age less than or equal to 30 weeks. The plasma NT-proBNP levels were measured at the postnatal day 28th. We further followed and categorized infants into two groups. Infants with no or mild BPD (Group 1) and infants with moderate or severe BPD (Group 2). We compared plasma NT-proBNP levels at 28th day of postnatal life between Groups 1 and 2. The difference in NT-proBNP levels on day 28th between groups was used to predict the severity of BPD. Result(s): Plasma NT-proBNP was significantly elevated in Group 2 compared with Group 1, median (IQR) of 845 pg/mL (553, 1632) compared with 726 pg/mL (391, 923), P = 0.02. NT-proBNP had a fair predictive accuracy (C statistics of 0.68) to determine moderate to severe BPD. Conclusion(s): NT-proBNP may be a useful biomarker in conjunction with clinical factors as a predictor of severe BPD. For future directions, the trend of NT-proBNP in infants with BPD may have clinical significance in monitoring of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - PURPOSE: Oxygen therapy is often required to treat newborn infants with respiratory disorders. Prolonged exposure of neonatal rats to hyperoxia reduced alveolar septation, increased terminal air space size, and increased lung fibrosis; these conditions are very similar to those of human bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia development., METHOD: We reared Sprague-Dawley rat pups in either room air (RA, n = 24) or an atmosphere containing 85% O2 (n = 26) from Postnatal Days 1 to 14. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was used to analyze genome-wide DNA methylation in lung tissues of neonatal rats. Hyperoxia-exposed rats exhibited larger air spaces and thinner septa than RA-exposed rats did on Postnatal Day 14. The rats exposed to hyperoxia exhibited significantly higher mean linear intercepts than did the rats exposed to RA. We applied MeDIP next-generation sequencing for profiling changes in DNA methylation in the rat lungs exposed to hyperoxia and RA. We performed bioinformatics and pathway analyses on the raw sequencing data to identify differentially methylated candidate genes., RESULTS: Our in vivo model revealed that neonatal hyperoxia exposure arrested alveolarization on Postnatal Day 14. We found that the ErbB, actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion signaling pathways are epigenetically modulated by exposure to hyperoxia. We demonstrated that hyperoxia exposure contribute in delaying lung development through an epigenetic mechanism by disrupting the expression of genes in lungs that might be involved in alveolarization., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that aberrant DNA methylation and deregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion pathways of lung tissues may be involved in the pathophysiology of hyperoxia-induced arrested alveolarization.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the current study was to investigate expression levels of serum macrophages MIF and PLTP in neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), examining their value and significance in clinical diagnosis. Method(s): A total of 31 BPD neonatorum cases, admitted from January 2017 to January 2018, were assigned to the experimental group. A total of 31 non-BPD neonatorum cases were assigned to the control group. This study analyzed various data, including gender, gestational age, birth body mass, and times of oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation. Samples of blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected. Expression levels of MIF and PLTP of all subjects in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks after birth were detected via ELISA. ROC curves were plotted in line with expression levels of MIF and PLTP of the two groups the first week after birth. Correlation levels between MIF and PLTP were also determined. Result(s): Gestational ages and birth body masses of the experiment group were substantially lower than the control group. Times of oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation were significantly longer than those of the control group. Differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). At all time-points after birth, levels of MIF in the serum and BALF of the experimental group were higher, while levels of PLTP were lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). According to ROC curves, areas under the MIF curve, and critical values of diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity levels were 0.860 (0.771-0.948), 10.49 ng/mL, 64.52%, and 87.10%, respectively. Levels of PLTP curves were 0.761 (0.641-0.881), 12.89 ng/mL, 64.52%, and 83.87%, respectively. A positive correlation was exhibited between MIF expression in serum and in BALF (r=0.682, P<0.001), as well as PLTP expression in serum and in BALF (r=0.714, P<0.001). A negative correlation was determined between expression levels of serum MIF and serum PLPT in BPD neonatorum cases (r=-0.741, P<0.001), as well as expression levels of MIF and PLTP in BALF (r=-0.576, P<0.001). Conclusion(s): MIF was overexpressed and PLTP was under-expressed in the serum and BALF of BPD neonatorum cases. A negative correlation was exhibited between expression levels of MIF and PLTP. Early detection of serum MIF and serum PLTP expression in BPD neonatorum cases is of diagnostic significance.Copyright © 2020, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting extreme preterm newborn survivors with serious long-term sequela of wheezing. Oxygen therapy, which is inevitable for the survival of such extremely premature infants, is partly responsible for the development of BPD and associated airway remodeling (AWRM). Altered Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) signaling have been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of lung diseases; however, the role of SPHK1/S1P signaling in BPD and AWRM is not well understood. The neonatal mice were subjected to hyperoxia (HO) at 95% oxygen (postnatal day 3 to 10) and allowed to grow as adults for 8 weeks. During exposure to room air (RA) or HO, the mice received 5mg/kg of PF543, a specific inhibitor of SPHK1, intraperitoneally on alternate days. Lungs were then collected and prepared for histology as well as morphometry of alveoli/airways. Lung function studies were performed using a ventilator and methacholine challenge was used to measure airway hyper reactivity (AHR). Levels of S1P and sphingoid bases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and lung tissues were measured by LC-MS/MS. In vitro mechanistic studies on HO-induced AWRM and the protective effect of PF543 were performed using small airway epithelial cells (SAEC). The exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia resulted in AWRM in adults, as evidenced by increased peribronchial fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy. These changes were significantly less in Sphk1 knock out (Sphk1/) mice exposed to HO indicating a potential role of SPHK1 in the pathogenesis of AWRM. Subsequent experiments using a specific SPHK1 inhibitor, PF543, during neonatal HO prevented alveolar simplification and, more significantly, ameliorated AWRM in adult mice. Lung function studies revealed AHR in adult mice that were exposed to neonatal HO. Interestingly, PF543 therapy reduced methacholine-induced AHR and airway constriction along with a reduction in AWRM. Exposure of neonatal mice to HO showed epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes, which was reduced by PF543 treatment. Inhibition of SPHK1 with PF543 in SAECs ameliorated HO-induced loss of E-cadherin and gain of N-cadherin and vimentin, markers of EMT. In conclusion, our data indicate a novel role for SPHK1/S1P signaling in HO-induced BPD and AWRM, and amelioration by PF543.

AB  - Alveolar epithelial injury is central to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in lung diseases across the lifespan, from bronchopulmonary dysplasia and childhood interstitial lung disease to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Disturbances in mitochondrial structure that alter function have been associated with lung epithelial cell injury, yet molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial dynamics in the setting of pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear. Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) patients, especially those with mutations in HPS1 and HPS4, develop fibrosis in earlier age than patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), suggesting that loss of HPS gene function drives alveolar epithelial injury. Here we show enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation in HPS1-defective alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells associated with impaired phosphorylation of Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at Serine (Ser)637 (inactivating phosphorylation). Ectopic expression of constitutively active GTPase Rab32, Rab32(Q85L), designed to bypass the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) function of HPS1-HPS4 complex (BLOC-3), in MLE15/DHPS1 cells restores mitochondrial architecture and increases p-Ser637-Drp1. In addition, MLE15/DHPS1 cells exhibit markedly reduced mitochondrial respiration, signified by reduced oxygen consumption (OCR), and robust glycolysis, indicated by a brisk increase in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) after addition of glucose and accumulation of lactate in culture media. Despite robust glycolysis, MLE15/DHPS1 cells have lower total cellular ATP than MLE15/WT cells. Moreover, MLE15/DHPS1 cells demonstrate dependency on glucose as a nutrient source, reflected in activation of the energy sensor 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and cell death upon decreasing glucose in culture media. Taken together, our results suggest that HPS1, functioning in a heterodimer with HPS4 as an activator of Rab32, plays a central role in balancing mitochondrial fission/fusion in AT2 cells, while loss of HPS1 disrupts oxidative phosphorylation and drives metabolic reprogramming in AT2 cells.

AB  - Prolonged oxygen exposure of preterm infants results in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease characterized with lung inflammation, remodeling and airway reactivity. Unfortunately, therapeutic options are limited. Resveratrol is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties in different diseases, however it is not clear about its effects on BPD. In this study we investigated the effects of resveratrol in a rat pup model of BPD. We hypothesize that supplementation of rat pups with resveratrol prevents the lung inflammation induced by hyperoxia. At P5 rat pups were assigned either to room air (21% O )- or hyperoxic (>=95% O )-groups and exposed for seven days. During this time, animals were supplemented daily with resveratrol (30 mg/kg of body weight; i.p.) or vehicle. At day P12 animals were euthanized and lungs were harvested, and processed for biochemical and immunohistochemistry studies. Pro-inflammatory cytokines' levels (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) were measured in whole lung homogenate using ELISA method. Immunostaining for Tlymphocyte marker (CD3), B-lymphocyte marker (CD20) and CD45 was performed on 5 mum lung sections. Levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in lung tissue of hyperoxic group of animals were increased significantly (p < 0.01) compared to room air group animals. Supplementation of hyperoxic animals prevented this increase of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, while did not change in room air animals. In hyperoxic animals there was an abundance of CD3, CD20 and CD45 stained cells in the lungs of rat pups exposed to hyperoxia compared to room air exposed pups. Supplementation of hyperoxic animals with resveratrol reduced the number of CD3, CD20 and CD45 stained cells. We conclude that resveratrol prevents lung inflammation induced by neonatal hyperoxia and we speculate that resveratrol might be an effective therapeutic approach to prevent the adverse effects of neonatal hyperoxia.

AB  - Rationale Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) promotes fetal lung development in mice and baboons. Postnatally, GRP levels in lung normally drop, but rise in newborns who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease of newborns, with interstital fibrosis and arrested alveolarization. In premature baboons, blocking anti-GRP mAb2A11 abrogated BPD. Rodent BPD models could help to clarify mechanisms by which GRP mediates BPD. Mice are born at the canalicular stage of lung development, ~24-28 wks human gestation, when BPD peaks. Methods Newborn (NB) timed-pregnant Swiss Webster mice were treated with continuous 75% O and twice weekly injections of mAb MOPC21 (negative control IgG1) or mAb2A11. On day 18, right lungs were inflation-fixed and paraffin embedded. Myofibroblasts were immunostained with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated mAb1A4 (Sigma-Aldrich), developed with Vector Red. Eight-ten random lung 20x images were captured per mouse. Using ImageJ, the area-percent of SMA+ alveolar tissue was determined as: (area of SMA+ alveolae)/(alveolar tissue) x100%. Mean linear intercept (MLI) was used to determine alveolar size with a fixed grid with lines totaling 1-mm: 1/(#air-tissue interfaces)x1000 = mean distance between two air-tissue interfaces in microns. Data are shown as mean +/-SEM, with significance at p < 0.05 (one-way t-test). Results Normoxic (NO) mice +/- MOPC or 2A11, had area-percent SMA+ alveoli unchanged (5.1-6.3 +/-0.5-1.4). Hyperoxia+MOPC led to 3-fold increased SMA (15.6+/-2%). Hyperoxia+2A11 reduced SMA to 10.3+/-1.2%; P<0.01 comparing hyperoxia+2A11 vs. hyperoxia+MOPC. 2A11 had no effect on MLI with either normoxia or hyperoxia, possibly due to insufficient time. We performed Affymetrix cDNA analysis of lung RNA from hyperoxic mice +2A11 or MOPC for 18d. HO+2A11 vs. HO+MOPC altered expression of >1000 genes (FC>10, P<0.05), many potentially protective vs. lung injury/fibrosis. Increased gene expression included: nucleoredoxin, an antioxidant related to thioredoxin (FC x78); surfactant protein A (FC x140); Tom20, mitochondrial transport protein that reduces lung injury (x74), and multiple other mitochondrial genes (>20x). Reduced gene expression included: Adam10, profibrotic; amphiregulin, elevated in BPD; amyloid beta A4, toxic fragment; laminin B1, which usually declines by birth; Tgfb1i4, profibrotic; and Stat1, profibrotic. Conclusions After 18d exposure to 75% O2 , newborn mice have >3-fold more interstitial myofibroblasts that are significantly reduced by mAb2A11. Many pulmonary genes are up- or downregulated by mAb2A11 consistent with a multigenic downstream effect on reducing interstitial fibrosis via interacting signaling pathways. Mice can provide a useful model for carrying out preclinical investigations.

AB  - Alveologenesis is the most important and the least understood phase of lung development. Alveolar defects underlie both neonatal and adult lung diseases. Their arrested development is found in infants with BPD (BronchoPulmonary Dysplasia), while their destruction is characteristic of emphysematous lungs in adult COPD. We have developed 3 parallel, postnatal genetically-based models to analyze the molecular basis of alveologenesis. Conditional postnatal inactivation of genes encoding receptors for TGFb, or PDGFA or IGF1 in a unique cell type we have identified as Secondary Crest Myofibroblasts, or SCMF blocks alveologenesis & produces a phenotype similar to human BPD. We reasoned that due to nearly identical phenotypes, the three BPD phenocopy models must share genetic elements whose role in alveologenesis is indispensable. To test this hypothesis, we have isolated mutant and control SCMF and identified their transcriptomic profile by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data identified "pathway-specific" differentially expressed genes (DEG) for TGFb, PDGFA/PDGFRa and IGF1 mutant models. Most importantly however, as predicted, we identified a cluster of "shared" genes which we propose contains conserved core alveologenesis regulatory genes. The accumulated evidence reveals a constellation of genes that makeup the genetic architecture of alveologenesis in mice with relevance to pathogenesis of BPD in human preterm neonates.

AB  - The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is higher among premature male neonates even after adjusting for other confounders. Despite the well-established sex-specific differences in the incidence of BPD and impaired lung function in males, the molecular mechanism(s) behind this are poorly understood. Mammalian cells have intrinsic differences based on sex and respond differently to stressors irrespective of the past or current concentrations of sex hormones. Our research investigates the effect of sex on neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and the mechanisms underlying these differences. Alveolarization and angiogenesis is preserved in female neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia compared to males. Differences in the lung transcriptome and the epigenome may contribute to these sex-specific differences. We have shown that differential expression of miRNA (miR-30a) and their downstream targets have also been shown to modulate this process. Sex-specific differences at the cellular level in the pulmonary endothelial cells and fibroblasts will also be discussed. To distinguish sex differences caused by gonadal hormones versus sex chromosome complement (XX versus XY), we used the four Core Genotype mice (FCG). The FCG model can discriminate between sex differences determined by gonadal type (versus those determined by the effects of sex chromosomes). Sex-specific transcriptomic changes were observed in numerous genes for each genotype at in room air and after hyperoxia exposure. Sex-hormones and sex chromosomes may cause sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of BPD in premature neonates. The presentation will address knowledge gaps in the molecular mechanisms behind the sexually divergent incidence of BPD and will discuss novel molecular pathways for future therapeutic interventional strategies to combat BPD.

AB  - Background The Premature Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) was a collaborative, multidisciplinary clinical study that sought to analyze the factors that could predict future risk for respiratory morbidity and mortality for 835 premature infants with gestational ages 23 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks. PROP investigators conducted physiologic challenges called Room Air Challenges (RAC) and Hypoxic Challenges Tests (HCT) to determine whether the premature infants could maintain their SpO in the target range of >=90% and to assess pulmonary reserve in former premature infants without Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia(BPD) at 36 weeks' premenstrual age (PMA). This project was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for 5 years through a $18.5 million research initiative. Objective We are interested in understanding the relationship between brain imaging data and respiration outcomes, and infection or chorioamnionitis and respiration outcomes. In addition, the RAC and HCT provides the opportunity to analyze the outcomes of physiologic challenges in preterm infants compared to term infants undergoing the same challenges in studies that conducted preflight HCT. Statement of the methods We utilized machine learning tools such as random forest, support vector machines, gradient boosted machines, and logistic regression to generate predictive models of the aforementioned features. Summary of results Preliminary data analysis of key variables to be included in our future data analytics includes standard deviations for birth weight (gm) (235.98), the baby's head circumference (cm) (83.05), APGAR for one minute (scored 1-10) (2.47), and APGAR 5 minutes (2.10). Statement of conclusions This PROP clinical study encapsulates an immense amount of multidisciplinary data from 835 premature infants, which is an extremely special population to include in research as approximately 1 out of every 9 births in the United States occurs prematurely.

AB  - Endothelial cell apoptosis is an early event in acute lung injury (ALI) leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). An early pathogenic feature of ALI is inflammation-induced endothelial cell death. We have previously shown that cytomix (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin (IL)-1beta, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), but not LPS alone, results in robust cell death in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC). We hypothesized that the inflammatory cascade associated with cytomix treatment in hPMVEC would result in the release of HMGB1, a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that interacts with TLR4, and thereby enhances TLR4 mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of hPMVEC with cytomix for 24 hours resulted in a robust induction (~80-fold, p<0.005) of HMGB1 protein levels in the media compared to controls. While, there was only a small and statistically non-significant increase in the HMGB1 protein levels in the cells following cytomix treatment compared with controls. To assess the role of TLR4 in the inflammatory response of hPMVEC following cytomix treatment, we utilized TAK-242, a TLR4 antagonist. Cytomix treatment of hPMVEC resulted in nearly 5-fold greater cleaved caspase-1 protein levels than in control hPMVEC. This cytomix-induced increase in cleaved caspase-1 was prevented by the addition of TAK-242 to the media. Cytomix treatment of hPMVEC also resulted in a robust induction of both pro-IL-1beta and cleaved IL-1beta protein levels compared to controls. However, the cytomix-induced pro-IL-1beta and cleaved IL-1beta protein levels were significantly attenuated when the hPMVEC were also treated with TAK-242. Our results demonstrate that treatment with cytomix results in substantial release of HMGB1. Furthermore, cytomix treatment results in robust production of the TLR4-mediated proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. We speculate that the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, may be crucial in the innate immune response of hPMVECs. These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis of ALI in inflammatory lung diseases.

AB  - Supplemental O is a primary mode of respiratory therapy for preterm infants. Numerous studies however have shown that supplemental O may contribute to the pathophysiology of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) associated with wheezing disorders such as asthma later in childhood. The calcium-sensitive receptor (CaSR) is a potent modulator of smooth muscle contractility and may be an underlying feature of childhood asthma. In the present study we investigated whether CaSR is involved in neonatal hyperoxia induced AHR in a mouse model of BPD. We hypothesize that inhibition (CaSR antagonism) downregulation of expression (siRNA) or deletion (CaSR KO mice) of CaSR will attenuate the AHR induced by hyperoxia in neonatal mice. Newborn C57BL/6 wild-type (background) or CaSR-/-(knockout) mice were randomized on the second day of life and assigned to room air (21% O ) or hyperoxic (40% O23) groups and exposed for seven days then recovered in room air for two additional weeks. At day P21 AHR was assessed in vitro using precision-cut living lung slice preparations in response to increasing doses of methacholine (MCh 0.25-8 muM). Wild-type lung slices were pre-incubated for 48 h in a CaSR siRNA sequence (40 nM) or scrambled RNA as a negative control. In another set of experiments slices were pre-incubated in a CaSR antagonist - NPS 2143 (10 nM) for 1 h. Airways were imaged and airway reactivity was expressed as percent change from baseline airway lumen area (+/- SEM). Neonatal hyperoxia significantly increased airway contractile responses to MCh in wild-type mice with a mean maximal effect (Emax) of 68.4+/-8.7% decrease in airway lumen area compared to room air controls (47.3+/-5.8% p<0.001) indicating AHR. Pre-incubation (48hrs) with siRNA targeting CaSR or pharmacologic inhibition (NPS 2143 1hr incubation) of CaSR reversed the hyperoxia-induced AHR and the contractile responses were normalized to control level with hyperoxic groups Emax of 44.0+/-5.2% and 41.3+/-3.1% respectively. AHR was not observed in CaSR knockout mice suggesting resistance to hyperoxia exposure. These data suggest that CaSR plays an important role in the long-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia on AHR. We speculate that CaSR may be a novel therapeutic target to reverse airway hyperreactivity in former preterm infants who had received prior supplemental O2 therapy.

AB  - BackgroundBeing aware of the impact of low birth weight on late-onset hypertension, our aim was to describe systolic blood pressure (sBP) and renal function in 3-5-year-old preterm-born children and to determine which perinatal factors or childhood factors were associated with an altered renal function at 5 years in these children. Methods This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study of children born at 27-31 weeks of gestation and included at birth and examined at 3, 4, and 5 years of age. The primary outcome was renal function at 5 years: BP, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria. Results One hundred and sixty five children were examined, of whom 93 (56.4%) were male. Gestational age was 29.2+/-1.4 weeks and birth weight was 1,217+/-331 g. Overall, 25% children had sBP >=90th percentile at age 3 and 4 years and 11% at 5 years. In multivariate analysis, sBP >=90th percentile at 5 years was associated with the use of antenatal steroids (OR=0.19(0.05;0.65)). There was a significant association between protein intake on day 28 and sBP at 5 years (beta=2.1+/-1.0, P=0.03). Glomerular filtration rate at 5 years was significantly decreased in case of hyaline membrane disease or necrotizing enterocolitis. High urine albumin was not predictable from one year to another. Conclusion In preterm-born children, sBP was often high and neonatal protein intake was associated with increased blood pressure during childhood.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops in 25-40% of BPD and is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in BPD patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator and apoptotic mediator made by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NOS is inhibited by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) hydrolyzes ADMA. Translational studies from our group identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DDAH1 gene, rs480414, that was associated with a decreased risk for PH in BPD patients. Therefore, we aim to determine if the DDAH1 SNP rs480414 affects DDAH1 function in cell culture. Neonatal cord blood specimens were treated with Epstein-Barr virus to select for Blymphocytes and transform into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that were genotyped (SNP or wild-type) at the rs480414 locus. We tested the hypothesis that in LCLs the SNP rs480414 results in a gain of function mutation in DDAH1, which would lead to greater NO-mediated apoptosis as compared to DDAH1 wild-type (WT). LCLs (WT, n=3 and SNP, n=3) were stimulated with phorbol myristate (PMA), IL-4, and IL-13 for 48 hours, protein was analyzed by western blot analysis for DDAH1, cleaved and total caspase-3 and -8, and beta-actin. RT-PCR was performed and expression of DDAH1 and iNOS mRNA was evaluated. Cell media was assayed for concentrations of nitrite using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. Spectrophotometry was used to measure the conversion of ADMA to L-citrulline. A standard L-citrulline curve was used to calculate DDAH activity after normalization to protein concentration. LCLs with the DDAH1 SNP had similar levels of DDAH1 protein expression (n=3, p=0.58), similar mRNA expression (n=3, p=0.1), and similar DDAH activity (p=0.35) compared to DDAH1 WT. We found that LCLs with the DDAH1 SNP had similar iNOS mRNA expression (p=0.6), lower nitrite levels (p=0.04), lower cleaved caspase-3 levels (p=0.04), and similar cleaved caspase-8 levels (p=0.2) than DDAH1 WT LCLs. Contrary to our hypothesis, these finding suggests that the DDAH1 SNP rs480414 may result in a loss of function mutation, resulting in lower NO production and lower apoptosis in LCLs. This is the first evidence that the DDAH1 SNP rs480414 has an effect on cell function, however we speculate that pulmonary vascular endothelial cells will likely have a different physiology.

AB  - Rationale Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of preterm birth. It is induced by oxidative stress caused by hyperoxia exposure during the vulnerable saccular or early alveolar stage of lung development resulting in alveolar growth arrest and initiation of cellular senescence. Senescence is characterized by inhibition of the cell cycle through 2 major tumor suppressor pathways: the proteins p53/p21 and the p16 /retinoblastoma protein leading to stringent growth arrest. Previous results suggest that p16 is highly expressed in hyperoxia male rats and p21 is highly expressed in the hyperoxia female rats at one year. We hypothesized that hyperoxia-induced senescence would lead to differences in inflammation in male or female rats as they age. Ink4a Methods Newborn Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to hyperoxic (HYP, 85%, n=13) or normoxic (NORM, 21%, n=9) conditions for 14 days and then remained in normoxic conditions until they were 1-year-old. At 1 year, the left lung was inflated and fixed (4% formaldehyde) and the right lobes were flash frozen. Pulmonary tissue was preserved at -80degreeC until analyzed for mRNA expression of proteins p16, p21, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) via TaqMan qPCR. Differences in expression were calculated by the ddCt method using the reference gene GAPDH. Two-way ANOVA was utilized for comparison of ddCt values between sexes in HYP and NORM rats for each target gene. Western blots were performed for quantification of p16 and p21 in the 1-year-old rats of both sexes and treatments. IL-6 expression in the 1-year-old rats was assessed via an ELISA. Results Expression of p16 in the lung tissue mRNA was significantly higher in the 1-year-old HYP male rats compared to NORM male rats; whereas, the 1-year-old female rats of both treatments did not present a difference in p16 mRNA expression. At 1 year, p21 expression in the mRNA of HYP females and HYP males was higher compared to NORM females and NORM males with no difference between the sexes. The same results were observed in the level of protein at 1 year. At day 21, HYP males and HYP females had a significant upregulation of p16 in their mRNA compared to NORM rats (p<0.01), while p21 was slightly upregulated in the mRNA of HYP males and HYP females. IL-17 was expressed in both NORM and HYP 1-year-old female mRNA. Contrarily, 1-year-old HYP male mRNA presented IL-17 expression while there was no detectable expression in the mRNA of the 1-year-old NORM males. At day 21, there was no detectable IL-17 expression in the mRNA of either sex of both treatment groups. The IL-6 expression at 1 year was detected in the plasma of the HYP male rats, but was not detectable in the NORM male rats. Alternatively, the 1-year-old female rats of both treatments expressed IL-6. Conclusion The significantly higher p16 expression in the 1-year HYP male rats suggests that senescence is more evident in the HYP males compared to HYP female rats. Detectable IL-6 as well as IL-17 expression in the 1-year-old HYP male rats also may support this development of a severely high expression of p16 in this particular treatment and sex. The measurement of mRNA expression at intermediate time points would allow for further analysis of the development of senescence in this BPD model.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops in 25-40% of BPD patients as a result of pathologic vascular remodeling, and PH is an independent predictor of death in BPD patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator and apoptotic mediator made in the pulmonary endothelium by nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous competitive NOS inhibitor. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) metabolizes the majority of ADMA in vivo and there are two isoforms, DDAH1 and DDAH2. Translational studies from our group analyzed a cohort of BPD patients and identified a potential biomarker, DDAH1 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs480414), that decreased the risk of PH in BPD by 61%. In the present study, we hypothesized that overexpression of DDAH1 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) would lead to greater apoptosis and lower proliferation of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMC) via effects in hPMVEC. We utilized a co-culture system where hPMVEC were transfected with AdDDAH1 or AdGFP control for 24h and then incubated in co-culture with hPASMC for 24h. Analysis included 1) western blot analysis for cleaved and total caspase-3, -8, -9, p21, PCNA, and beta-actin and 2) trypan blue exclusion for viable cell numbers. Transfection of hPMVEC with AdDDAH1 resulted in greater DDAH1 protein expression (n=6, p=0.003) as compared to control. After AdDDAH1 transfection of hPMVEC and co-culture with hPASMC, we found greater cleaved caspase-3 (n=6, p=0.01), greater cleaved caspase-8 (n=6, p=0.03), similar cleaved caspase-9 (n=6, p=0.94), similar p21 (n=6, p=0.7), and similar PCNA (n=3, p=0.82) protein expression as compared to control. After AdDDAH1 transfection of hPMVEC and co-culture with hPASMC, we found lower hPASMC viable cell numbers (n=3, p=0.008) as compared to control. After AdDDAH1 transfection of hPMVEC and co-culture with hPASMC treated with DETA NONOate 250muM or DETA NONOate 250muM + Hemoglobin 100muM, the hPASMC viable cell numbers were lower compared to control (n=3, p=0.001; n=3, p=0.003, respectively). There was no difference detected between DETA NONOate 250muM and DETA NONOate 250muM + Hemoglobin 100muM groups (n=3, p=0.429). In conclusion, DDAH1 overexpression in hPMVEC resulted in greater apoptosis and lower proliferation in hPASMC, consistent with our hypothesis. We propose that DDAH1 is a potential new therapy for BPD-PH via relieving pulmonary vascular endothelial ADMA-inhibition of eNOS, resulting in greater endogenous NO production, greater pulmonary vascular wall apoptosis, and potentially less pathologic vascular remodeling. Future studies will determine if DDAH1 endothelial knockout mice have worse lung function as compared to wild-type, after exposure to BPD-PH model of LPS and hyperoxia.

AB  - Background: Influenza is one of the main viral aetiologies associated with exacerbations of chronic lung diseases (CLDs) in children. Under the Australian Government's Immunisation Program, influenza vaccine is recommended for people aged >=6 months with chronic medical conditions. However, there are limited data on uptake of influenza vaccine and its effectiveness in Australian children with CLDs. The aim of this study was to determine influenza vaccine uptake and its effectiveness in preventing influenza hospitalisation in children with CLDs using routinely collected administrative data. Methods and materials: We performed a retrospective cohort study using population-based linked administrative data for all children aged <=17 years with CLDs (including asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other chronic/congenital lung diseases) born in New South Wales and Western Australia between 2001 and 2012 with follow-up data until 2013. The 10th edition of the International Classification of Disease, Australian Modification codes from hospital datasets were used to identify the study cohort. The main exposure variable was influenza vaccination status obtained from the linked national immunisation registry. The primary outcome was any influenza-coded hospitalisation at least 14 days after vaccination retrieved from the hospital dataset. Cox regression models were used to assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in preventing influenza hospitalisation. Result(s): Of the 1,407,182 children born during 2001 and 2012, 18,954 children (1.4%) had one or more CLDs; 2479 children (13%) with CLDs received one or more doses of influenza vaccine. In total 1,499 children (8%) with CLDs were hospitalised for influenza at least once during the study period. The adjusted incidence/1000 child-years (95% CI) of influenza-associated hospitalisation in vaccinated children with CLD was 54.38 (42.04-69.75) and for unvaccinated children was 30.45 (29.04-31.93). The adjusted hazard ratio of being hospitalised with influenza in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children with CLDs was 1.48 (1.14-1.93). Conclusion(s): This large population-based study has demonstrated low uptake of influenza vaccine in children with CLDs which limits our ability to generate precise vaccine effectiveness estimates. Strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake and recording of influenza vaccination status may provide better estimates for vaccine effectiveness.Copyright © 2020

AB  - Aim The aim was to compare recurrence of clinically significant apnea (CSA) using 2 protocols to stop caffeine therapy in preterm infants. Methods This prospective, randomized controlled trial studied babies born at 26-32 weeks gestation;in 2 groups: Group 1 (SEVEN): Caffeine therapy was stopped immediately once the infants on caffeine were apnea free and off respiratory supports for 7 consecutive days; Group 2 (THIRTYFOUR): Caffeine therapy was continued mandatorily till minimum of 34 weeks postmentrual age(PMA) and thereafter stopped only after baby was apnea free and off respiratory supports for at least one week. Randomization was done using a computer generated random number sequence and allocation concealment using Sequentially Numbered Opaque Sealed Envelopes. The predefined primary outcome was proportion of infants with recurrence of clinically significant apnea after stopping caffeine. The secondary outcomes included day of recurrence of CSA, PMA of last caffeine dose,adverse effects, Extrauterine growth restriction, Necrotizing Enterocolitis, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Retinopathy Of Prematurity, and mortality. Results 120 infants were randomized: 60 to each group. There was no difference in the baseline characteristics between the.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or chronic lung injury of newborn is a life-threatening condition in preterm infants with few effective therapies. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a promising therapeutic strategy for BPD. The ideal MSC source for BPD prevention is however unknown. Umbilical cord tissue (UCT) MSC may potentially have more anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic properties.Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the UCT-MSC will have superior lung regenerative effect in BPD owing to superior antiinflammatory and pro-angiogenic properties as compared to BM-MSC. Method(s): Newborn rats (n=10-12/group) were randomly assigned to normoxia or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 1 to 21 were given intra-tracheal (IT) BM or UCT-MSC (1 x 106cells/50 mul), or placebo (PL) on P3. Result(s): Hyperoxia PL-treated pups had marked alveolar simplification, vascular rarefaction, remodeling and lung inflammation. Administration of both BM-MSC and UCT-MSC significantly improved alveolar structure, vascular density pulmonary hypertension, vascular remodeling and lung inflammation. However, the improvement in alveolar structure and lung inflammation was more marked in hyperoxic pups who received UCT-MSC. In vitro studies demonstrated greater TSG-6 and IL-10 expression in UCT-MSC as compared to BM-MSC. Moreover, lung epithelial cells incubated with UCT-MSC conditioned media had greater wound healing following scratch injury. Conclusion(s): These findings demonstrate that while both BM and UCT-MSC have lung regenerative effects, UCT-MSC have greater anti-inflammatory and alveolar protective effects in experimental BPD. These findings have significant implications for cellular therapy in BPD, as it suggests that UCT-MSC are a superior cellular source for preterm lung protection.

AB  - Background: Renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) is a fatal rare disorder characterized by diminished to absent differentiation of proximal convoluted tubules and anuria leading to oligohydramnios. RTD has both genetic and secondary causes. Primary causes are heterogeneous mutations of genes acting in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Secondary RTD can be caused by decreased renal perfusion in utero. We present a 2-day old female infant born to an 18-year old G1P0 mother by emergency cesarean section at 26 weeks gestation because of preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction and decreased fetal heart rate variability. The infant developed severe metabolic acidosis and hypotension, which was refractory to medical treatment, and eventually expired. Method(s): Autopsy and placental examination were performed. H&E and CD10 immunohistochemical stains were performed. Result(s): Autopsy revealed a small for gestational age infant with no major gross congenital anomalies or evidence of infection. The kidneys appeared grossly unremarkable; however, microscopic examination of the kidneys revealed crowding of glomeruli in the cortex, and paucity of proximal convoluted tubules. This was confirmed by a significantly reduced number of CD10-immunoreactive tubules compared to an age matched control. Other autopsy findings included hyaline membrane disease, germinal matrix hemorrhage, patchy atrophy of the skin, petechial and visceral acute hemorrhages, and stress involution of the thymus and adrenal glands. The placental examination showed a small placenta for 26 weeks gestational age and severe maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) including villous infarcts and acute atherosis/fibrinoid necrosis in parietal arterioles. Conclusion(s): This premature, growth restricted infant had multiple significant complications related to premature birth, and the autopsy uncovered an unexpected finding: renal tubular dysgenesis. The underlying etiology of RTD in this case is not certain, but the evidence of growth restriction and fetal stress at autopsy supports the hypothesis that placental insufficiency secondary to MVM initiated the pathology, leading to fetal hypoxia, hypoperfusion of the fetal kidneys and ultimately development of RTD. The normal function of RAS to maintain arterial blood pressure and vascular homeostasis may explain why hypotension was intractable in this patient. Our case demonstrates how placental pathology can contribute to the pathogenesis of RTD and the importance of placental perfusion for the health of the fetus.

AB  - Introduction: Currently, there are no highly specific criteria ascertaining any clinical outcomes of respiratory pathology in preterm infants. Objective(s): To compare the polymorphism of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) outcomes. Method(s): 60 children with BPD (a main group) and 60 children with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; a comparison group) aged 3 to 16 years were examined. Anamnesis data, the results of physical examination, spirometry, computed tomography (CT) and molecular genetic study (MnSOD 16Ala/Val polymorphism) were assessed. Result(s): The development of chronic lung diseases was significantly more often observed after BPD (Fisher's test, p=0.002). Recurrent bronchitis (27.0%) and bronchial asthma (17.0%) were the most frequent adverse outcomes. According to spirometry, mild obstructive ventilation disorders were recorded in both groups. According to the CT data, pathological changes were predominately registered in children of a main group as an inequality of pulmonary tissue pneumatization (Fisher's test, p=0.020). The analysis of the genetic study results showed that children in a main group with the MnSOD Ala16Val genotype had a higher risk ratio of adverse respiratory outcomes (recurrent bronchitis mainly) up to 2.4 times (Pearson Chi-square with Yates correction=6.4, p=0.012). Conclusion(s): Outcomes in children at older age were associated with having a disease in the neonatal period (BPD or RDS). An important diagnostic finding is a high risk of respiratory pathology in children with BPD and MnSOD Ala16Val genotype.

AB  - Rationale: Supplementary oxygen leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, a disease characterized by lung growth arrest and matrix remodeling. We demonstrated that hyperoxia reduces Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a key transcription factor in cell biology. Since myofibroblasts are crucial in lung injury and remodeling, we investigated the functional role of Klf4 in the pathogenesis of BPD and in the homeostasis of lung fibroblasts. Method(s): (1) Newborn C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 85% 02 (HYX) or 21% 02 (NOX) until postnatal day 28 (P28). (2) Primary neonatal murine lung fibroblasts (pnF) were transfected with a Klf4 overexpressing plasmid or siRNA technique for overexpression (OE) and knockdown of Klf4 (del), respectively, and exposed to HYX or NOX. (3) BiolD (Proximity-dependent Biotin Identification) and CHIP-Seq were performed. Result(s): (1) Reduced Klf4 expression in lungs after HYX was associated with an activation of TGFs signaling and an increase of myofibroblasts, promoting thereby matrix remodeling. (2) TGFs inhibited Klf4 expression in cultured pnF Klf4del decreased migration, induced proliferation and increased mRNA expression of matrix markers (Ctgf, Collai & Col4a1) and Pdgfra (myofibroblasts). In contrast, Klf40E increased adhesion, but reduced proliferation, apoptosis, migration and expression of fibrotic genes in pnF (3) Finally, BiolD and CHIP-Seq identified a novel Klf4 interactome that regulates FoxOI transcriptionally and its activation via acetylation. Conclusion(s): Our data unveil a novel Klf4-Fox01 axis in lung fibroblasts that could promote matrix remodeling and lung growth arrest in lungs with BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Vascular endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of several oxidant stress-associated disorders. Oxidant stress is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity that often leads to sequelae in adult survivors., OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to identify whether differences in mitochondrial bioenergetic function and oxidant generation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) obtained from extremely preterm infants were associated with risk for BPD or death before 36 weeks postmenstrual age., METHODS: HUVEC oxygen consumption and superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generation were measured in 69 infants., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with HUVECs from infants who survived without BPD, HUVECs obtained from infants who developed BPD or died had a lower maximal oxygen consumption rate (mean +/- SEM, 107 +/- 8 vs. 235 +/- 22 pmol/min/30,000 cells; P < 0.001), produced more superoxide after exposure to hyperoxia (mean +/- SEM, 89,807 +/- 16,616 vs. 162,706 +/- 25,321 MitoSOX Red fluorescence units; P < 0.05), and released more hydrogen peroxide into the supernatant after hyperoxia exposure (mean +/- SEM, 1,879 +/- 278 vs. 842 +/- 119 resorufin arbitrary fluorescence units; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicating that endothelial cells of premature infants who later develop BPD or die have impaired mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity and produce more oxidants at birth suggest that the vascular endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction seen at birth in these infants persists through their postnatal life and contributes to adverse pulmonary outcomes and increased early mortality.

AB  - Rationale: Mechanical ventilation (MV) of premature infants often leads to Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterized by an impaired alveolarization and regeneration. Since prior studies from our group showed that activation of inflammatory IL-6 signaling is a key mechanism of BPD, we hypothesized that IL-6 deficiency protects from MV-induced lung growth arrest. Method(s): IL-6-deficient mice (IL-6'/-) mice and wildtype controls (WT) were ventilated (21% 02) for 8 h at postnatal day 5 (P5). Result(s): 1) MV induced a 10-fold increase of IL-6 expression and a markedly activated lung Stat3 signaling of WT mice. Activation of pulmonary IL-6 signaling was related to previously shown lung growth arrest. The number of CD68+ cells was significantly higher in ventilated WT mice compared to controls. 2) To investigate the functional role of IL-6 we analyzed ventilated and non-ventilated IL-6-/' mice. The significant increase in the number of macrophages (CD68+ cells) was not attenuated in lungs of ventilated IL-6-/' pups compared to IL-6-/' controls. However, IL-6-/' pups were protected from arrested alveolar formation after MV. These findings were related to a greater content of elastic fibers and collagen in IL 6-/~ mice than in WT mice. Moreover, the number of alveolar epithelial cells type II (SPC+ cells) was increased in IL 6-/~ mice in comparison to WT mice. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate an activation of pulmonary IL-6 signaling in MV-induced lung growth arrest. Loss of IL-6, however, promotes lung growth and survival of alveolar progenitor cells in ventilated newborn mice, offering thereby a novel potential target to treat preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - The chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication in preterm infants. It is characterized by alveolar hypoplasia and dysmorphic vasculature. Changes in cellular composition and gene expression underlying the development of BPD are not fully understood. Here we created a detailed temporal map of normal and aberrant late lung development using single-cell RNA sequencing on lung cells from 36 mice at postnatal days (P) 3, 7 and 14. BPD was mimicked by exposure to hyperoxia (85% 02). The MULTI-seq labeling was used in order to minimize experimental bias and increase the reproducibility. A total of 66.200 cells were analyzed throughout three crucial time points of late lung development, across which we identified 1 mesothelial, 5 epithelial, 6 stromal, 5 endothelial, 8 myeloid and 9 lymphoid cell clusters. All cell compartments followed developmental trajectories and hyperoxic exposure impaired the composition and expression patterns in all compartments. Specifically, hyperoxia impaired epithelial surfactant homeostasis and halted fibroblasts maturation. The number of capillary endothelial cells was significantly reduced, suggesting that hyperoxia impairs endothelial maturation at a critical stage of capillary development. Hyperoxia altered lung macrophage populations by reducing the number of homeostatic alveolar macrophages and diminishing the proliferating macrophages. Additionally, we identified the effector cells of the innate immune response, thought to orchestrate pivotal processes resulting in lung impairment. Understanding the temporal changes on transcriptional level provides new means to study the pathogenesis and novel therapies for BPD.

AB  - Background: Serum chitotriosidase (CHIT1) is a novel and promising biomarker of inflammatory diseases including airway and lung diseases. Serum C - reactive protein (CRP) and albumin (ALB) ratio (CAR) is also a promising biomarker to assess the inflammation and oxidative stress in many diseases. Inflammation has a key role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and treatment of these diseases targets the suppression of inflammation. The aim of this study is to investigate serum CHIT1 activity and CAR in CF and BPD patients as inflammatory biomarkers. Material(s) and Method(s): Demographic data and serum CHIT1 activity and CAR in patients with CF (n=8) and BPD (n=21) and in healthy controls (n=19) were compared. According to therapy, BPD patients were divided into two groups: inhaled steroid free (n=13) and inhaled steroid (n=8), and all the data were compared between these two groups also. Result(s): The median body weight and height values of the patients followed with BPD were statistically lower than those of the other two groups (p<0,01 for both). Although there was no statistically significant difference between three groups in terms of serum CHIT1 activity and CAR measurements, serum CHIT1 activity were significantly higher in inhaled steroid free BPD patients (p=0,025) than the other group. Conclusion(s): The lack of increased CHIT1 and CAR in serum of CF and BPD patients limits the benefits of these potential biomarkers for detecting airway inflammation in aforementioned patients. Further studies with more patients are necessary.

AB  - Despite clinical significance of Pulmonary Hypertension resulting from failed development of the gas exchange area in preterms with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) early markers and diagnostic tools to detect aberrant vascular development are missing. To improve early diagnosis in clinical routine, 85 preterm infants < 32 weeks gestational age (GA) underwent advanced 3T lung MR-imaging to quantify changes in pulmonary arterial (PA)flow (ArgusFlow, SiemensHealthcare) at the time of BPD diagnosis (36 weeks GA). Multiple flow parameters were complemented with clinical data and the assessment of lung structure by MRI. Echocardiography and MRI right heart volumetry served as validation. Biomarker screening was performed in plasma (SomaLogic), urine and tracheal aspirate specimen (label-free LC-MS/MS-based comparative proteomics) obtained in the first week of life. PA-flow correlates in both lungs, is decreased in BPD infants and correlates with the days of oxygen supply and mechanical ventilation. Echocardiographic signs of right ventricle strain and proteins involved in angiogenesis, vascular injury, matrix remodeling and inflammatory processes (e.g. BMP7, PKCA, Siglec14) are negatively correlated to PA-flow. A wide range of PA-flow in infants with similar emphysematous changes and interstitial lung remodeling indicates an underlying vascular phenotype. PA-flow measurements in infants are feasible and correlate with the presence of BPD. Detailed analyses indicate subgroups of infants with more severe reduction in PA-flow adding to the detected severity of lung remodeling and associated with promising biomarkers as potential early indicators of vascular disease.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common neonatal chronic lung disease occurring in premature infants due to ventilation and supplemental oxygenation. Lungs of BPD patients are characterized by growth arrest, alveolar hypoplasia and dysmorphic pulmonary circulation. No treatment for BPD is currently available. Preclinical studies uncovered the healing potential of cell-based therapies, in particular mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Recent studies suggest an existence and potential repair capacity of resident lung (L)MSCs. In this study we have utilized two most commonly used rodent models of BPD characterized by alveolar hypoplasia and impaired lung vascularization: ventilation induced lung injury (VILI) and exposure to 85% normobaric hyperoxia. Using a single-cell RNA sequencing approach we identified the resident Sca1+ (Stem cell antigen-1+) cell population in the lungs of healthy and aberrantly developing mice on postnatal day (P) 3, P7 and P14. Population of Seal + cells increased with age in all lungs diseased lungs and was increased by hyperoxia at all time points investigated. Sca1+ LMSCs isolated from both, healthy and BPD mouse lungs, expressed characteristic stem cell markers (CD90, CD146, CD105), fibroblast-like phenotype in culture and showed an ability to form colonies in vitro. Moreover, LMSCs conditioned media increased migration of epithelial cells in vitro and both, LMSCs conditioned media, as well as LMSCs-derived exosomes induced network formation and spheroid sprouting in vitro. Our data suggest that LMSCs are able to modulate angiogenesis and may play a role in normal late lung development as well as in an aberrant development associated with BPD.

AB  - The chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most severe complication of prematurity. BPD results in impairment of both, lung vascular and alveolar development. Currently, there is no treatment for BPD. Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) improve lung structure and function in experimental BPD, and early phase clinical trials are underway. However, the optimal UC-MSC donor remains to be determined. To compare healing effects of UC-MSC donors in BPD, UC-MSCs derived from 5 donors (1st term delivery [TMSC], 2nd term delivery [T2MSC], preterm delivery [PMSC], preterm delivery with preeclampsia [PPMSC], preterm delivery with chorioamnionitis [PCMSC]) were administered intratracheally at postnatal day (P) 4 in rat pups exposed to 85% oxygen from P0 to P14. At P21, survival, lung function (flexivent), lung structure (mean linear intercept), right ventricular hypertrophy (Fulton index), as well as lung vasculature at P35 (microCT) were assessed. Treatment with UC-MSCs increased survival in hyperoxia-exposed developing pups. In addition, TMSC, PMSC, PPMSC and PCMSC, but not T2MSC, improved lung compliance, lung growth and attenuated pulmonary hypertension when compared to control hyperoxic pups. Thus, donor source impacts beneficial effects of UC-MSCs in a rat BPD model. In the future, understanding the differences at the transcriptomic level between UC-MSC donors might improve the identification of the optimal MSC source for treatment of BPD.

AB  - Background: BPD is a common complication of preterm birth. Animal models, such as the preterm piglet, remain imperative to study local tissue changes, but little is known about their lung development beyond the first 48 hours of life. However, this wider time frame is crucial when studying BPD pathophysiology. Aim(s): To determine whether lung changes comparable to human BPD occur in preterm piglets of different ages. Method(s): Preterm piglets were surgically delivered at 90% gestation and compared to term newborn SGA piglets (n=7). Preterm animals were euthanized at 4 (pD4; n=14) and 5 days (pD5; n=46) postnatally. After perfusion with saline, the left lung was fixed and stained for histological assessment and the right lung was sampled for qPCR. KW and appropriate posthoc tests were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): pD4 and pD5 piglets showed less advanced alveolarization and septation and a thicker and more cellular interstitium than term piglets. TNFa levels were higher in both preterm groups combined than in the term controls. IL6 was higher in control and pD4 piglets compared to pD5 piglets; while ll-1s was different between pD4 and pD5. IL10 was upregulated in the pD5 piglets compared to pD4 piglets and controls. Conclusion(s): Our results show evolution in inflammatory cytokine levels, as in human preterm infants. Despite variation, less advanced alveolarization and septation in preterm piglets was evidently present.

AB  - Objective: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare condition associated with diverse cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic diseases in childhood. We aimed to detect the frequency of PH due to pulmonary diseases and clinical features of them in a pediatric pulmonology department. Method(s): Between 2008-2019, all patients with PH who were followed in pediatric pulmonology department were evaluated in terms of age of diagnosis, cause of PH, treatments and outcome. Result(s): A total of 41 patients were followed up with PH, 53% of them were female. Mean age of diagnosis was 4.07+/-5.1 years. Mean age of diagnosis was 3.14+/-4.85years in patients with cardiac or pulmonary anomaly and 6.01 +/-5.28 years in patients with idiopathic PH (p>0.05). Of these, 19 patients (46%) had cardiac, 20% had pulmonary disease related with PH, 3% had genetic disorder and 31% had idiopathic PH. Seven of the patients with cardiac anomaly had accompanying Down syndrome. Four of 19 patients with cardiac anomaly had accompanying pulmonary disorders. In pulmonary disease group, 6 patients had bronchopulmonary dysplasia, one had bronchiolitis obliterans, one had cystic fibrosis, and one patient had surfactant protein C deficiency. Patients were treated with endothelin receptor antagonists and/or phosphodiesterase inhibitor and/or furosemide and/or digital and/or angiotensin converting enzyme blockers and 11 of all them needed oxygen supplementation. In the follow up four patients were died. Method(s): PH is a serious disease in childhood with high mortality. Cardiac, pulmonary, genetic and systemic diseases should be investigated in patients with PH. Patients may have more than one systemic cause of PH even they have a cardiac anomaly related with PH.

AB  - Background: Currently there are no clear guidelines regarding the criteria for endotracheal intubation in moderate to later preterm infants who are being managed on CPAP. Method(s): A survey of neonatologists in Australia New Zealand Neonatal Network (ANZNN) to asses intubation criteria for moderate to late preterm infants (Gestation: 32-36 + 6 weeks) with respiratory distress managed with CPAP as the initial mode of support. Result(s): Twenty nine of the 30 tertiary ANZNN NICUs [113/200 (57%) neonatologists] responded to the survey. The most common criteria for intubation included CPAP 8 cmH2O (61%), pH <7.2 (55%), PCO2 > 70 (48%), FiO2 > 40% (40%), chest retraction (48%), >2 episodes of apnoea requiring intervention (54%), and chest x-ray with moderate to severe hyaline membrane disease (HMD: 49%). Conclusion(s): There was no general agreement on criteria for intubation in moderate to late preterm infants with respiratory distress. However, nearly 50% of the neonatologists shared a common threshold with regards to CPAP level, oxygen need, blood gases, and clinical and radiological findings. The results of this survey will help in designing protocols for future respiratory RCTs in this population.

AB  - Case Report: A 15 week old preterm male born at 27 weeks gestational age presented with persistent respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation with high FiO2 (60%) requirement. His birth history was significant for respiratory failure in the delivery room requiring surfactant, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. At 7 weeks of life, an echocardiogram showed mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) requiring sildenafil. His respiratory failure (capillary PCO2 58 mm Hg) and hypoxemia persisted despite mechanical ventilation, diuretics, bronchodilators, and systemic corticosteroids. A chest radiograph showed increased pulmonary interstitial markings with scattered patchy opacities consistent with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Due to disproportionately severe hypoxemia despite relatively mild PH, a chest CT was performed. It demonstrated coarse interstitial markings and a diffuse ground glass appearance of the pulmonary parenchyma, suspicious for an interstitial lung disease or surfactant dysfunction disorder (Figure 1). Genetic testing for surfactant dysfunction only revealed a variant of uncertain significance in the ABCA3 gene. A right upper lobe lung biopsy was performed and showed patchy alveolar interstitial fibrosis, hyperinflation, and focal acute bronchioalveolar pneumonia in the absence of microorganisms (Figure 2). Electron microscopy of the sample revealed thickened alveolar septae with spindle-shaped cells containing an abundance of monoparticulate glycogen, consistent with pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis. At 4 months of age, he was extubated and gradually weaned to nasal cannula oxygen. By 18 months of age, his pulmonary hypertension was resolved, and he was weaned off of diuretics and supplemental oxygen. Discussion(s): Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG) is a rare childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) of uncertain etiology. It has a variable clinical presentation during infancy ranging from tachypnea and hypoxemia to respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension. PIG can occur in either term or preterm infants and may be associated with congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and lung growth abnormalities. Typical chest CT features include ground glass opacities and cysts, which are non-specific findings. Therefore, a lung biopsy is required to make the diagnosis. Histological features include patchy or diffuse expansion of the alveolar walls by spindle-shaped cells that are immunopositive for vimentin. Electron microscopy demonstrates the accumulation of monoparticulate glycogen in these interstitial cells. Although the natural history of PIG is unknown, mortality is rare. Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy, ranging from supplemental oxygen to ventilatory support and therapies for PH. The role of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of PIG remains controversial. Long-term outcomes are good with clinical improvement occurring over time. Conclusion(s): Infants presenting with tachypnea, hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and diffuse abnormalities on chest imaging should undergo systematic evaluation for chILD in conjunction with a pediatric pulmonologist. Timely diagnosis of chILD has important implications for patient management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal or postnatal lung inflammation and oxidative stress disrupt alveolo-vascular development leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with and without pulmonary hypertension. L-citrulline (L-CIT), a nonessential amino acid, alleviates inflammatory and hyperoxic lung injury in preclinical models of BPD. L-CIT modulates signaling pathways mediating inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial biogenesis-processes operative in the development of BPD. We hypothesize that L-CIT will attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in our rat model of neonatal lung injury., METHODS: Newborn rats during the saccular stage of lung development were used to investigate the effect of L-CIT on LPS-induced lung histopathology and pathways involved in inflammatory, antioxidative processes, and mitochondrial biogenesis in lungs in vivo, and in primary culture of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, in vitro., RESULTS: L-CIT protected the newborn rat lung from LPS-induced: lung histopathology, ROS production, NFkappaB nuclear translocation, and upregulation of gene and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-8, MCP-1alpha, and TNF-alpha). L-CIT maintained mitochondrial morphology, increased protein levels of PGC-1alpha, NRF1, and TFAM (transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis), and induced SIRT1, SIRT3, and superoxide dismutases protein expression., CONCLUSION: L-CIT may be efficacious in decreasing early lung inflammation and oxidative stress mitigating progression to BPD., IMPACT: The nonessential amino acid L-citrulline (L-CIT) mitigated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury in the early stage of lung development in the newborn rat. This is the first study describing the effect of L-CIT on the signaling pathways operative in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in a preclinical inflammatory model of newborn lung injury. If our findings translate to premature infants, L-CIT could decrease inflammation, oxidative stress and preserve mitochondrial health in the lung of premature infants at risk for BPD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a respiratory complication characterized by abnormal alveolar development in premature infants. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) can induce heat shock protein (HSP) 70, which has cytoprotective effects against various stressors. Here, we investigated whether GGA protected neonatal lungs from hyperoxic stress in a murine BPD model, and measured the serum HSP70 levels in preterm humans treated with oxygen., METHODS: Newborn mice were exposed to >90% oxygen and administered GGA or vehicle alone orally on days 1, 2, and 3 of life. At 2 days of age, HSP70 expression in the lung was determined by western blotting. At 8 days of age, the lungs were processed for histological analysis. Radial alveolar count (RAC) and mean linear intercept (MLI) were measured as parameters of alveolarization. Apoptosis was evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method and cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. Serum HSP70 levels in preterm humans treated with oxygen were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: GGA administration enhanced the HSP70 expression to two-fold compared with normoxia-exposed and vehicle-treated mice. Hyperoxia reduced HSP70 expression, whereas GGA abrogated the effects. Hyperoxia-exposed mice exhibited more apoptotic cells in lung parenchyma and a more simplified alveolar structure with less RAC and larger MLI than normoxia-exposed mice. GGA suppressed the increase in apoptotic cells and the structural changes of the lungs induced by hyperoxia. Serum HSP70 levels of preterm human infants gradually decreased with age., CONCLUSIONS: GGA may attenuate hyperoxic injury in neonatal lungs and thereby may prevent the development of BPD.

AB  - Background: Delayed Cord Clamping (DCC) has been recommended by multiple medical bodies, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, especially due to its benefits in preterm neonates, and is being adopted in many practices. Previous studies have shown benefits such as decreased blood transfusions, improved thermoregulation, decreased rates of intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis, however recent studies have found no improved morbidity or mortality. Goal: To evaluate whether there was an effect of delayed cord clamping on short term neonatal outcomes after the initial implementation. Methodology: IRB-exempt Quality Improvement prospective project was conducted to implement DCC for all infants born at Cooper University hospital via vaginal delivery or C-section with a gestational age of 24 to 35 weeks between July 15th, 2016 and July 14th, 2017. Infants were excluded if there was risk of fetal or maternal compromise. Infants meeting inclusion criteria underwent delayed cord clamping optimally for 45 seconds. Data including maternal and neonatal characteristics and resuscitation data, and neonatal outcomes was collected and compared with matching timeframe of July 15th, 2015 to July 14th, 2016. All infants who received DCC were compared to all infants who did not, regardless of inclusion or exclusion criteria. Result(s): Analysis of all infants that received DCC (N=90) versus immediate clamping (N=198) using chi square tests revealed a decreased need for initial respiratory support (p=0.062) when admitted to the NICU, including less patients requiring mechanical ventilation (25.6% vs 37.4%, p=0.049). Admission hemoglobin levels were higher in the DCC group (16.08 vs 15.29 mg/dL, p=0.033), while the need for packed red blood cells during entire stay decreased (29% vs 39%, p=0.085). However, there was a trend for an increase in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (20% vs 15%, p=0.36), necrotizing enterocolitis (7% vs 5%, p=0.36), sepsis (20% vs 17%, p=0.56) and intraventricular hemorrhage (18% vs 13%, p=0.20) in the DCC group that was not statistically significant. There was no difference in mortality (6.7% vs 7.1%, p=0.90). Discussion(s): Infants that received DCC required less initial respiratory support, less mechanical ventilation and had higher initial hemoglobin levels. However, no significant differences were seen in morbidities or mortality with or without DCC, which aligns with recent literature. Benefits of DCC followed some expected trends, but also results which warrant further investigation of subsets of infants benefiting from DCC or who may be adversely affected by DCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in medical care have led to improved survival rates of extremely premature infants but the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not changed in the last two decades. Animal data suggests that erythropoietin treatment could ameliorate pulmonary vascular and alveolar development in neonatal models of BPD OBJECTIVE: To determine whether premature infants treated with erythropoietin (EPO) in the neonatal period for anemia had a lower incidence of moderate to severe BPD than infants who were not exposed. METHOD(S): IRB approved retrospective study of a population of preterm infants born at 23 to 32 weeks gestation, with birthweight 1500 grams or less between January 2009 and December 2014, and survived to 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatment modalities, risk factors for BPD and discharge outcome were compared between patients who received EPO and those not exposed. To examine the association between the outcome of moderate to severe BPD, and erythropoietin treatment, we performed a propensity score (PS) analysis using inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) approach. For comparison, we conducted a logistic regression adjusting for the same covariates used to generate PS using the original population. RESULT(S): The study included 1,821 preterm infants: 928 received EPO and 893 did not. The patients in the EPO group had lower GA, BW and required higher initial respiratory support than the No-EPO group. Logistic regression for the weighted data adjusting for unbalanced factors showed a reduced incidence of moderate to severe BPD in the EPO treated group. AOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48-0.79). CONCLUSION(S): Erythropoietin treatment of preterm infants 23 to 32 weeks GA was associated with a reduced incidence of moderate to severe BPD at 36 weeks PMA. with the lowest BPD rate with treatment initiation in the first 2 weeks of life.

AB  - Therapies based on mesenchymal stem/stromal cell extracellular vesicles (MEx) have shown promise in experimental models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease of disrupted lung development that can result from neonatal exposure to hyperoxia. The effects of oxygen exposure on other developing organs in the neonatal period remain poorly understood and whether MEx treatment may modify these responses is not known. Our research aimed at understanding the effects of neonatal exposure to hyperoxia and the immunomodulatory properties of MEx on thymic architecture and T cell development. Using a mouse model of neonatal hyperoxia, we showed that, in addition to lung injury resulting in BPD, there was involution of the thymic medulla with altered T cell function. Administration of a single dose of MEx resulted in preservation of thymic architecture, and restoration of normal thymic function through modulation of the thymic medullary antigen presentation network and T cell phenotypes. Consequently, MEx reinstated the mechanisms of thymic-driven central tolerance that are perturbed upon hyperoxia exposure, as demonstrated by increased FoxP3 regulatory T cell generation and decreased T cell autoreactivity. Overall, our study demonstrates that MEx represent a promising cell-free therapeutic option to restore thymic architecture and ensure the development of central tolerance by preventing thymic injury associated with neonatal hyperoxia exposure.

AB  - Infants born prematurely often develop chronic lung diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is associated with greatly increased host susceptibility and severe disease development following respiratory viral infection. To this end, we have recently established a neonatal hyperoxia model respiratory viral infection in hosts with lung prematurity and BPD. Using this model, we observed that mice exposed with neonatal hyperoxia (80% oxygen, BPD hosts) developed enhanced diseases following influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection compared to those of influenza or RSV-infected control mice. We showed that neonatal hyperoxia leaded to modestly enhanced viral replication in the respiratory tract. Using nanostring immune gene profiling and multiplex cytokine analysis, we found that neonatal hyperoxia markedly enhanced immune-associated gene expression and the production of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the airway compared to those of control mice. Neonatal hyperoxia also increased the accumulation of multiple inflammatory innate cell types that were shown to be pathogenic during respiratory viral infections. Importantly, antiviral T, B cells and NK cells were similar in the lungs between infected neonatal hyperoxia-exposed and control mice, which are consistent with the similar viral clearance kinetics in those mice. Thus, we have successfully established a clinically-relevant mouse model of respiratory viral infection in BPD hosts. We expect to further uncover novel insights on the viral pathogenesis and host disease devlopment in this novel model of respiratory viral infection in hosts with chronic lung diseases.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects pre-term infants whose lungs are unable to support life outside of the womb. These babies receive therapeutic oxygen which compensates for poor lung function but also causes oxidative damage to lung epithelium, resulting in a simplified lung marked by larger and fewer alveoli. We identified thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) as a protein of interest in the pathogenesis of BPD since Trx1 is cytoprotective against hyperoxic cell death. Using a perinatal hyperoxic mouse model of BPD, pulmonary Trx1 activity inversely correlates with atmospheric oxygen tension following birth and hyperoxic treatment. Therefore, we tested if impairment of lung epithelial Trx1 promotes BPD pathogenesis. Trx1 floxed mice (Trx1fl) were bred to mice expressing cre recombinase driven by the surfactant protein C promoter (sftpc-cre) to generate a mouse with Trx1 deficient lung epithelial cells. Although expected genotypic ratios were detected at birth, lethality was noted in Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice as early as 14 days of age. The LD50 for Trx1 deficient mice was 20 days old, while Trx1 heterozygote littermates appeared normal (p<0.001, n=12-17). Upon necropsy, large air-filled pneumatoceles were noted across multiple lobes of Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice. Similar to BPD, Trx1 deficient mice had a simplified lung marked by an increase in mean linear intercept and airspace size with decreased airspace numbers. Similar to mice treated with perinatal hyperoxia, Trx1 deficient lungs had fewer alveolar type 2 cells detected by surfactant protein b and thyroid transcription factor 1 immunohistochemistry. This work demonstrates that impairment of Trx1 in lung epithelial cells causes respiratory pathologies consistent with BPD. Ongoing studies seek to define the temporal nature of lung pathogenesis and test the overarching hypothesis that Trx1 serves as a molecular sensor of atmospheric oxygen tension in lung epithelium during alveolar development and perinatal hyperoxic injury.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading complication of preterm birth and primarily affects infants born between 22-28 weeks estimated gestational age in the saccular stage of lung development. While dysregulated Wnt signaling has been reported in BPD and other chronic lung diseases, the precise molecular mechanisms that result in aberrant Wnt signaling after injury and that drive abnormal lung development after preterm birth remain unknown. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of hyperoxia on epithelialmesenchymal interactions and to define the mediators of activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling after injury. METHOD(S): A 3D organotypic co-culture (3D-OTC) using primary human lung cells, murine ex vivo precision cut lung slices (PCLS), and murine in vivo hyperoxia models were used. Comparisons of normoxia and hyperoxia exposed samples were made by RT-qPCR, RNA in situ hybridization, quantitative confocal microscopy, and lung morphometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Examination of an array of Wnt ligands in the 3D-OTC revealed increased mesenchymal expression of WNT5A. Inhibition of Wnt5A with a neutralizing antibody reduced the impact of hyperoxia on the BPD transcriptomic phenotype model and improved alveolarization in the ex vivo PCLS model. Chemical inhibition of NF-kappaB with BAY-11-7082 reduced Wnt5a expression in the PCLS hyperoxia model and in vivo mouse hyperoxia model, with improved alveolarization in the BAY-11-7082 treated PCLS. CONCLUSION(S): This study shows that NF-kappaB signaling promotes mesenchymal expression of Wnt5A in the setting of hyperoxia injury during the saccular stage of lung development, providing a mechanism for how injury leads to dysregulated Wnt signaling. Increased mesenchymal Wnt5A expression after saccular stage hyperoxia injury contributes to the impaired alveolarization and fibrosis observed in BPD. Precise targeting of Wnt5A and the NF-kappaB/Wnt signaling axis may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common chronic lung disease affecting prematurely-born infants is characterized by impaired alveolar growth with fewer and larger alveoli and interstitial fibrosis. Premature infant airway inflammatory mediator levels, including CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), are elevated both at birth and during the later stages of BPD progression. Also, we previously demonstrated that premature infant tracheal aspirate levels of the proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine IL-17A were higher in infants developing BPD (AJRCCM 199: A6033, 2019). Production of IL-17A by exudative macrophages and gammadelta T cells has been implicated in aberrant injury and fibrotic responses. Recruitment of exudative macrophages and gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells is mediated by CCR2. CCL2-CCR2 signaling is required for hyperoxia- and chronic LPS-induced hypoalveolarization in immature mice (AJRCCM 197: A7388, 2018). In this study, we hypothesize that hyperoxia and chronic LPS exposure of immature mice each induce IL-17A expression in CCR2-dependent manner and IL- 17A is required for hypoalveolarization in both models. Method(s): Two murine models of BPD were used in this study. Two day-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to normoxia or 75% oxygen for up to 14 days. Alternatively, immature C57BL/6J and CCR2 knockout mice were inoculated with 3ug/10ul of LPS from E. coli O26:B6 or 10ul PBS intranasally on DOL 3, 5, 7, and 10 Selected mice were treated with neutralizing antibody against IL-17A intraperitoneally. Lung alveolar growth was assessed by morphometry. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR and ELISA. Lung immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Result(s): In immature mice, exposure to hyperoxia and chronic LPS each induced whole lung mRNA and protein expression of IL-17A and its upstream regulator IL-23. Chronic LPS exposure increased the percent of IL-17A-producing gammadelta T and exudative macrophages. Similar effects were observed in immature mice exposed to hyperoxia. CCR2 knockout mice showed an attenuated increase in IL- 17A-producing gammadelta T cells in response to LPS. Finally, treatment of immature mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody attenuated hyperoxia- and chronic LPS-induced hypoalveolarization preventing increases in alveolar chord length. Furthermore, premature infant tracheal aspirate levels of IL-17A positively correlated with CCL2 levels. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that in immature mice, CCR2-dependent increase in IL-17A is required for hyperoxia and chronic LPS-induced hypoalveolarization, linking a common inflammatory pathway and alveolar development. Future studies will examine the mechanisms by which IL-17A affects alveolar growth. Blocking IL-17A holds promise as a potential new therapy to prevent BPD.

AB  - Introduction/Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a prevalent and serious pulmonary morbidity of prematurity Severe BPD lungs are characterized by areas of alveolar simplification, cysts, and emphysema. Current theories suggest long inspiratory times (Ti) and slow respiratory rates to improve ventilation of the heterogeneous BPD lung, however, most methods for evaluating lung function in this population are limited to whole lung measurements rather than evaluating individual regions of the BPD lung. Using respiratory-gated ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI, regional tidal volumes (TV) can be objectively measured. We hypothesized that heterogeneous areas of the BPD lung will exhibit a quantifiable TV that will be affected by ventilator parameters. To test our hypothesis, we used k-space gated MRI to measure the TV in total lung, total-cystic lung individual cysts, and non-cystic lung and compared these measurements to clinical outcomes variables. Method(s): UTE MRI of 17 infants diagnosed with severe BPD was obtained in non-sedated, quiet-breathing infants and reconstructed into retrospectively respiratory-gated end-inspiration and end-expiration images (50% inspiration/expiration windows). Cysts were identified using a density threshold combined with manual identification, and cyst volume was determined by manual segmentation (Figure 1). Regional TVs were determined by subtracting end-expiration from end-inspiration volumes in regions corresponding to total lung, non-cystic lung, total-cystic lung, and individual cysts. The measurements were compared to clinical parameters and ventilator settings. Result(s): Results indicate that cystic lung areas on average have larger tidal volumes than non-cystic lung when normalized to lung volume (0.8 vs 0.1, p<0.002). Although cyst TV generally correlates with the size of the cyst (p<0.002), there is marked variability between individual cysts TV with 22% of cysts demonstrating a negative TV. There was a positive correlation between Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and total lung TV (p =0.002), total-lung cysts TV (p=0.048), individual cyst TV (p=0.10) and non-cystic TV (p=0.042). There was a trend towards a positive correlation between Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) and total lung TV (p=0.060) and total-lung cyst TV (p=0.17). Ti did not significantly improve TV of any of the lung regions analyzed (Ti vs. total-lung cyst TV p=0.94, Ti vs non-cystic lung p=0.97) Conclusion(s): Results suggest that although variable, the areas of BPD cystic lung have greater normalized TV when compared to non-cystic lung. PIP and PEEP increase cystic and non-cystic lung TV, but in contrast to current theories, Ti does not correlate with tidal volumes of normal or cystic lung (Figure Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes are unknown. To distinguish sex differences caused by gonadal hormones versus sex chromosome complement (XX versus XY), we used the four Core Genotype mice (FCG). In the FCG model (Figure 1), Sry is a transgene and is not present on the Y chromosome, so that XX and XY mice can each have either testes (with Sry, XXM or XYM) or ovaries (without Sry, XXF or XYF). RNA-seq was used to elucidate the sex-specific transcriptomic differences in coding genes in the lung in vivo in a model of murine neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, mapping affected genes to biological pathways. We hypothesized that hormonal and sex chromosome mechanisms interact in the sexspecific modulation of biological pathways in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): Neonatal FCG mice were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-4: saccular stage) or room air and euthanized on PND5. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data were mapped onto the murine genome build UCSC mm10 using Hisat2 and quantified using feature counts and the GENCODE mouse reference. We compared transcriptomic changes for each genotype between room air and hyperoxia exposure (FDR<0.05, fold change exceeding 1.5). We evaluated enriched pathways using hypergeometric distribution (FDR<0.05) and the compendium of pathways Hallmark, Kegg, Reactome, and Gene Ontology, as compiled by MSigDB. Result(s): Significant differences in the pulmonary transcriptome were observed in numerous genes for each genotype at PND5 in room air and after hyperoxia exposure (e.g. Figure 1 shows significant differences between XX and XXM mice). The overlap of gene expression between XXF and XXM was only ~18%, while it was ~40% between XYM and XYF mice. While differentially expressed genes in XXF mice enriched for cell cycle and proliferation pathways (including genes such as Mki67, Stmn1, Incenp, Plk1), XXM mice showed enrichment for morphogenesis and development pathways (examples of genes were Lif, Col11a1, Zfpm2, Myl2). Differentially expressed genes in XYM mice mapped to muscle development pathways (genes included Myom1, Acta1, Tmod2, Des), whereas XYF mice were enriched for immune response pathways (representative genes were Ccl2, Aoc3, Serpina3n, Adora1). Conclusion(s): Sex hormones and sex chromosomes may cause sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of BPD in premature neonates. Elucidation of these molecular mechanisms will lay the foundation for future sex-specific treatment strategies (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants causes chronic lung disease including life-long airway obstruction. Histology of airways from premature infants demonstrates squamous metaplasia, damaged cilia, and airway and alveolar remodeling. We previously reported that tracheal epithelial cells from infants with evolving BPD have dysregulated expression of structural and immunomodulatory genes. In this study, we sought to further characterize growth and differentiation properties of epithelia using an air-liquid interface (ALI) model. Method(s): Airway epithelial cells (AECs) were isolated from tracheal aspirates from premature infants (<29 weeks gestation) hospitalized at the University of Washington NICU. All infants were later diagnosed with BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. AECs were also obtained from healthy school-age children intubated for elective surgery. Submerged AEC cultures were established using selective PneumaCult-EX media and, when confluent, were placed in differentiation conditions at an ALI using PneumaCult-ALI media for 3 weeks Immunocytochemistry was performed using anti-phalloidin for cytoskeletal structure, anti- TUBA4A for cilia, and DAPI for nuclei, then imaged by confocal microscopy. Live CD45-EPCAM+ AECs were isolated by FACS for RNA Sequencing. Data analysis was performed with R, using Limma and edgeR packages. Gene expression data were fit to previously generated epithelial cell modules from school-age children. Gene Enrichment analyses of these modules were performed with Enrichr to identify functional modules of interest before qPCR analyses of differential gene expression in submerged and ALI conditions between premature infants and school-age children. Result(s): Neonatal AECs from patients with evolving BPD cultured at an ALI displayed disorganized morphology with stretched cytoskeletal processes, scant cilia, and less pseudostratification, compared with school-age AECs (Figure 1) We identified differentially expressed genes between neonatal and school-age epithelial RNASeq datasets, and then assayed by qPCR for differential expression in four AEC culture conditions: neonatal submerged (N=6), neonatal ALI (N=3), school-age submerged (N=5), and school-age ALI (N=5). HLA-A, ARHGAP15, and IDO1 mRNA were upregulated 15-fold (p=0.009), 24-fold (p=0.015), and over 5000-fold (p=0.044), respectively, in school- age epithelial cells when differentiating from submerged to ALI conditions. Differentiating neonatal cells exhibited 2-fold upregulation (p=0.003), unchanged expression, and 10-fold upregulation (p=0.001) of HLA-A, ARHGAP15, and IDO1 mRNA, respectively. Conclusion(s): Tracheal AECs from premature infants with evolving BPD have stunted growth and differentiation, and less robust expression of IDO1 (cell differentiation), ARHGAP15 (cell proliferation), and HLA-A (cell adhesion). These differences may reveal novel biology in airway development with concomitant injury during BPD pathogenesis (Figure Presented).

AB  - Hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of human infants that is characterized by disrupted lung angiogenesis. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide with angiogenic and vasoprotective properties. AM signals via its cognate receptors, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Calcrl) and receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (RAMP2). Whether hyperoxia affects the pulmonary AM signaling pathway in neonatal mice and whether AM promotes lung angiogenesis in human infants are unknown. Therefore, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) hyperoxia exposure will disrupt AM signaling during the lung development period in neonatal mice; and (2) AM will promote angiogenesis in fetal human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) via extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 activation. We initially determined AM, Calcrl, and RAMP2 mRNA levels in mouse lungs on postnatal days (PND) 3, 7, 14, and 28. Next we determined the mRNA expression of these genes in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia (70% O2) for up to 14 d. Finally, using HPAECs, we evaluated if AM activates ERK1/2 and promotes tubule formation and cell migration. Lung AM, Calcrl, and RAMP2 mRNA expression increased from PND 3 and peaked at PND 14, a time period during which lung development occurs in mice. Interestingly, hyperoxia exposure blunted this peak expression in neonatal mice. In HPAECs, AM activated ERK1/2 and promoted tubule formation and cell migration. These findings support our hypotheses, emphasizing that AM signaling axis is a potential therapeutic target for human infants with BPD. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: The EPPVDN is a registered, non-profit organization that strives to define and develop effective, innovative diagnostic methods and treatment options in all forms of pediatric pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease, including pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, PH associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) persistent PH of the newborn, and related cardiac dysfunction. Method(s): Ten section task forces voted on the updated recommendations, based on the 2016 executive summary. Clinical trials meta-analyses, guidelines, and other articles that include pediatric data were searched using the term ?pulmonary hypertension? and other keywords (1990-2018). Class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) were assigned based on European Society of Cardiology/American Heart Association definitions and on pediatric data only, or on adult studies that included >10% children or studies that enrolled adults with CHD. New definitions presented by the World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension 2018 were included. Result(s): We generated 10 tables with graded recommendations (COR/LOE). The topics include diagnosis monitoring, genetics, biomarkers, cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance/chest computed tomography, associated forms of PH, intensive care unit, lung transplantation, and treatment of pediatric PH. A simplified adult PAH risk score based on the 2015 ESC/ERS PH guidelines emphasizes particularly the prognostic value of mean right atrial pressure, cardiac index, WHO functional class, and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide. We subsequently developed a pediatric PAH risk score that needs to be validated in future studies. The evolving strategy of upfront (or early rapid sequence) combination pharmacotherapy may further improve outcome of pediatric PAH. For the first time, a set of specific recommendations on the management of PH in middle- and low-income regions was developed. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these executive, up-to-date guidelines provide a specific, comprehensive, detailed but practical framework for the optimal clinical care of children and young adults with PH.

AB  - RATIONALE: Alveologenesis in mice occurs entirely postnatally and is driven by a mesenchymally-derived cell type we have named secondary crest myofibroblast or SCMF (Li et al., 2015). Developmental processes are defined by networks of gene-to-gene interactions. Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are key to understanding such process at a mechanistic level Disruption of GRNs, during alveologenesis may explain the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a developmental disease of preterm birth. We have focused on defining the GRN of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF1), a central regulator of mammalian organ development during alveologenesis. METHOD(S): Using Gli1-creERT2, which targets SCMF in combination with Igf1rflox/flox, we first inactivated the IGF1 receptor on postnatal day 2 (PN2). The lungs of mutant mice (Igf1rGli ) were analyzed through alveologenesis using histology immunohistochemistry and quantitative morphometry. Genes altered as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and RNAseq were designated Igf1 downstream genes. Their inter-connections were determined by perturbations carried out in vitro using cultured cells. The network of genes under IGF1 and their connections was constructed on BioTapestry. RESULT(S): Blocking IGF1 by inactivating Igf1R in SCMF blocked alveologenesis and produced a phenotype similar to human BPD. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified by RNAseq using FACs-isolated SCMF. These include transcription factors (TFs), extracellular matrix proteins and signaling molecules. Selective blockade of IGF1 targets in vitro revealed their inter regulatory connections Their inclusion in the network uncovers a core circuitry of 3 TFs, indicating their pivotal roles in alveolization. DE genes were also identified in non-SCMF cells that included lung epithelial cells. Of known AT1 and AT2 canonical genes examined, all but one was repressed in Igf1rGli mutant lungs. Secretome-receptome analysis revealed that IGF1signaling from SCMF regulates epithelial genes through Fgf10 and Wnt5a. These connections reveal functional link between SCMF and lung epithelium within the IGF1 GRN. CONCLUSION(S): Using multiple approaches we constructed a GRN which provides a systemic and hierarchal view of the regulatory connections between signaling molecules and transcription factors, to effector genes regulated by IGF1, both intracellularly and intercellularly during the process of mouse lung alveologenesis. This GRN defines the mechanisms by which growth and development of alveoli is regulated by IGF1 signaling.

AB  - RATIONALE: WNT signaling plays important roles in normal lung development, homeostasis and injury repair. Dysregulated WNT signaling is observed in a number of lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), usual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP/IPF), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), and asthma WNT5a is a WNT family member that mainly activates beta-catenin independent (non-canonical) WNT signaling through the ROR family of tyrosine kinase receptors. Using the Wnt5a knockout mouse model, we have shown that Wnt5a is required for embryonic lung development. Because Wnt5a knockout mice die at birth, the role of WNT5a in postnatal alveologenesis, remains unknown. METHOD(S): We conditionally inactivated Wnt5a globally at the onset of postnatal alveolar development in CAGcreERT2;Wnt5a;mTmG mice. We also conditionally inactivated WNT5a receptors, Ror1 and Ror2, in secondary crest myofibroblast (SCMF), during alveologenesis by generating Gli1creERT2;Ror1;Ror2;mTmG mice. Impact of blocking WNT5a signaling on alveologenesis was determined by histology, immunofluorescent staining, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. The role of WNT5a signaling was further studied in vitro with fibroblasts isolated from postnatal day 5 (PN5) lungs. RESULT(S): Postnatal inactivation of Wnt5a disrupted alveologenesis resulting in a phenotype characteristic of human bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mutant lungs showed dilated alveolar structures and abnormal differentiation of SCMF represented by significant reduction of myofibroblast markers Acta2 and transgelin (Tagln or SM22). Impact of Wnt5a inactivation was further examined in vitro using isolated neonatal lung fibroblasts. In addition to reduced expression of Acta2 and Tagln inactivation of Wnt5a disrupted fibroblast migration in vitro. These results indicate that SCMF is a major target of WNT5a signaling in neonatal lungs and suggest that defects in this cell lineage caused by Wnt5a inactivation may be the major cause of abnormal alveologenesis in CAGcreERT2;Wnt5a;mTmG lungs. To test this hypothesis, we characterized Gli1creERT2;Ror1;Ror2;mTmG lungs where Ror1 and Ror2 were inactivated in SCMF. In support of the hypothesis, inactivation of Ror1 and Ror2 by Gli1creERT2 caused a similar phenotype as that of Wnt5a inactivation. CONCLUSION(S): These observations demonstrate that WNT5a/ROR signaling regulates SCMF differentiation and migration, two cellular processes critical for alveolar formation.

AB  - Background: Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages play essential role in the maintenance of the lung homeostasis and orchestration of the immune response to inhaled pathogens. It is well established that in adult animals alveolar macrophages maintain their population via local proliferation without input from the circulating monocytes. Murine lungs are in the in the saccular phase of lung development at birth and begin alveolarization around postnatal day (P)4. Murine lungs undergo exponential growth during early alveologenesis with 3-fold increase in alveoli number between P5 and P7, and another 1.5-fold increase by P10. Mechanisms of maintenance of the alveolar macrophage pool during the rapid postnatal lung growth and alveologenesisparticularly in the context of iatrogenic hyperoxia in prematurity, are not known. Rationale: We hypothesize that the pool of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages during the exponential postnatal lung growth is formed through continuous recruitment of monocytes, rather than local proliferation and expansion of the first wave of alveolar macrophages recruited immediately after birth. Method(s): We used inducible fluorescent fate-mapping system (Cx3cr1-ERCre x zsGreen) combined with flow cytometry, immunofluorescent microscopy and bulk RNA-seq to characterize origin, distribution and phenotype of the alveolar macrophages during normal postnatal alveologenesis (P0-P14 at room air) and during hyperoxia exposure (85% O2, P0-14) as a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Result(s): Using tamoxifen-inducible fate-mapping system we demonstrate ongoing recruitment of the monocytes and their differentiation into monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages during the postnatal lung growth (P0 to P14). Moreover, alveolar macrophages recruited during hyperoxia exposure persisted after the return to normoxia (P21). At P14, hyperoxia-exposed alveolar macropahges demonstrated an activated phenotype with a shift toward CD11bhigh, MHCIIhighand SiglecFlow. Transcriptome analysis of FACSorted alveolar macrophages identified 2435 differentially expressed genes (1138 up and 1297 down). Gene Ontology Processes significantly up-regulated for SMAD protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial cell proliferation in wound healing pathways Conclusion(s): Our data support the hypothesis that population of the alveolar niche by alveolar macrophages is ongoing beyond the first 24 hours of age and continues during lung growth and alveologenesis. Moreover, our findings suggest that alveolar macrophages recruited during hyperoxia exposure persist into adulthood. These long-living hyperoxia-primed alveolar macrophages are characterized by different transcriptomic profiles. Persistence of these cells may contribute to the long-lasting respiratory abnormalities and increased susceptibility to pulmonary diseases in adult survivors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and serious pulmonary condition associated with premature birth but the underlying structural pathologies are poorly understood. There exist few prognostic indicators of respiratory outcomes and concern over ionizing radiation limits application of neonatal CT. Pulmonary MRI offers safe, tomographic imaging in this vulnerable population, with established reader scores of BPD lung disease predicting short-term outcomes. While manual scoring has some degree of subjectivity, proton-density-weighted ultrashort echo-time (UTE) MRI can quantify CT-like lung density, without ionizing radiation or anesthesia/sedation, and lung density abnormalities shows good agreement with BPD reader scoring of parenchymal disease. Here, we correlate short-term outcomes in neonatal BPD with quantitative lung density abnormalities on UTE MRI. Method(s): Pulmonary, quiet-breathing UTE MRI (3D-resolution=0.7mm, proton-density weighting) was acquired in 38 neonates (18 severe BPD, 7 moderate, 6 mild, 7 control; NICHD consensus definition; 40+/-4 wk postmenstrual- age at MRI) on a neonatal-sized 1.5T scanner, with no sedation ordered for MRI. Lung density distributions were generated from whole-lung segmentations (image intensities normalized by muscle and noise; air-to-muscle ~0-1 g/cm3) Density bins were defined using +/-1sigma and +/-2sigma from the mean of a distribution derived from control subjects (Figure); purple and orange indicate abnormally low-density and high-density tissue, respectively. Ochiai reader scoring of BPD lung disease was performed as previously described (range=0-14). Scores and percent of whole-lung volume with abnormally low (<-1sigma) and high density (>+1sigma) were quantified and compared to severity diagnosis and respiratory support level at hospital discharge (none, O2, ventilator, death; BPD patients only; univariate analysis). Result(s): Volume-percent of abnormal lung density was fairly correlated with clinical severity in all infants (R2=0.21), more strongly correlated with discharge support in all BPD infants (R2=0.45), and similarly correlated with discharge support in a subgroup of moderate and severe BPD infants (R2=0.39) (Figure). Those same correlations improved with reader scoring, compared to density quantification: R2=0.68, R2=0.73, and R2=0.66, respectively. Conclusion(s): Structural lung determinants of neonatal BPD can be quantified with minimal risk using quiet-breathing pulmonary MRI, with correlation to clinical severity and short-term clinical outcomes. While objective density quantification holds promise, reader scoring of BPD lung abnormalities correlated more strongly with outcomes, indicating the need for automated textural analysis, such as via artificial-intelligence algorithms. This technique has the potential for disease phenotyping and in the future may be used serially to assess individualized disease trajectory and treatment efficacy in this vulnerable and little understood preterm population (Figure Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe MRI enables non-invasive strategies to quantify lung function and structure. Diffusionweighted MRI-specifically the 129Xe apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-is a well-validated measure of alveolar-airspace size, with elevated ADC reflecting alveolar enlargement. HP 129Xe ADC has demonstrated alveolar enlargement in a diverse range of disorders, including emphysema, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). 129Xe ADC is also sensitive to mild airspace-enlargement (e.g., normal pediatric development) and can thus provide new insights into early lung disease, including cystic fibrosis (CF) (Fig. A). However, numerous factors impact the precision and accuracy of 129Xe ADC measurements, and these have not been rigorously investigated. Here, we introduce a general, analytical approach-based on error propagation and hyperpolarized signal dynamics-to optimize 129Xe diffusion imaging. This approach improves the accuracy of in vivo lung microstructure measurement, without increasing the cost or difficulty of MRI experiments. Method(s): An analytical solution for the 129Xe ADC uncertainty was derived using error propagation and HPmodified Bloch equations (Fig. B). Variables analyzed included common MRI parameters: i.e., b-value (5-50 s/cm2), the number of b-values (2-10), and flip angle (1-15o). Monte Carlo simulations (MATLAB, Mathworks, Natick, MA), phantom studies, and imaging in healthy volunteers and lung disease patients (CF, LAM, etc.) were used to validate the model and explore the impacts of image reconstruction (e.g., k-space filtering) and data fitting methods (e.g., linear, non-linear and Bayesian) on quantitative accuracy. Results129Xe signal decay influences ADC estimate but only for low initial signal-to-noise (SNR0 <10). Using up to 5 b-values decreases uncertainty in 129Xe ADC measures in the ADC range expected for healthy adults and patients with diseases such as emphysema (>0.03 cm2/sec, Fig. C). For 2 b values, ~12.5 s/cm2 is the optimal maximum of b value. For 5 b values, values between 20-30 s/cm2 are optimal. Filtering, in particular using a low-pass Fermi filter, yielded improved ADC estimates by enhancing SNR while maintaining spatial resolution. Bayesian fitting provides the best 129Xe ADC estimates, yielding <10% error even at SNR <=5 (Fig. D). Conclusion(s): Diffusion-weighted 129Xe MRI is a noninvasive and radiation-free method to assess changes in lung microstructure. HP 129Xe acquisitions can be optimized to maximize the accuracy of ADC measurements using rigorous error propagation, filtering and Bayesian fitting. Doing so yields improved in vivo measures lung microstructure that can be used to monitor regional disease progression and assessing therapy response in a range of lung diseases.

AB  - RATIONALE Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although most studies focus on BPDassociated PH diagnosed during infancy, growing data suggest BPD patients are at high risk for late pulmonary vascular disease and the subsequent diagnosis of PH beyond infancy. However risk factors and clinical features that characterize late onset BPD-associated PH are poorly understood. To identify distinct features unique to patients with BPD diagnosed with PH after infancy, we compared their clinical features to those diagnosed with PH earlier after preterm birth. METHODS The Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet) initiated a multicenter registry of pediatric PH cases and collected data from 2014-2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02249923). We analyzed the data of patients with the diagnosis of BPD born less than 32 weeks, excluding those with congenital or other genetic syndromes. Infant PH was defined as a diagnosis at <=12 months. Late PH was defined as diagnosis at >12 months of age. Summary statistics include the median, interquartile range (IQR), frequencies and percentages. Tests of association include Fisher exact, Student's t and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate RESULTS Of 1497 registry participants, 299 children formed the analytic cohort. Most cases (242; 81%) were diagnosed in infancy but 57 (19%, 95% CI 15%-24%) had a later diagnosis. The Infant PH and Late PH groups (median age at diagnosis 4.4, IQR 3.2-6.1 versus 22.6, IQR 15.5- 48.5 months) had similar gestational age (25.6 versus 26.0 weeks), sex (54% versus 46% female) and birth weight (median 630 versus 635 grams). Late PH cases had more maternal preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome (56% versus 32%; P=0.025), necrotizing enterocolitis (37% versus 18%; P=0.023) and need for procedural PDA closure (45% versus 29%; P=0.061), while the diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis was similar (16% versus 11%). Late PH cases were less likely to be discharged from the neonatal ICU (NICU) with respiratory support (60% versus 86%; P=0.019). Sixty-one Infant PH (25%) and 23 (40%) Late PH cases underwent cardiac catheterization at 7.0 (IQR 4.0-9.0) and 32.0 (IQR 18.0-50.5) months, respectively (P<0.001) CONCLUSIONS Late PH is prevalent among BPD patients born at <32 weeks. These patients have a unique clinical profile, including more maternal hypertensive disease and infant complications. Although long-term outcomes in adulthood need further study, these findings suggest that continued outpatient surveillance of PH in preterm infants, particularly among those with certain early life risk factors, is warranted.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease of prematurity. While inflammation contributes to BPD pathogenesis, mechanisms of neonatal lung injury are poorly understood. IL-33 promotes expression of type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to regulate immune cells. A single study found that the decoy/dominant negative receptor for IL-33 was increased in infants who develop BPD, suggesting that lack of functional IL-33 signaling is pathogenic. Consistent with this hypothesis, a downstream target of IL-33, amphiregulin (Areg) mediates epithelial repair. We investigated the roles of IL-33 and Areg during neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) to model evolving BPD. Human co-cultures were used to evaluate epithelial-monocyte cross-talk. Method(s): IL-33-/-, Areg-/-, and littermate mice were placed in >0.85 FiO2 at PN0. Epithelial cells (EpC) and interstitial monocytes/macrophages (IM) were isolated by FACS. Lung sections were stained with Movat's. Tracheal aspirates were collected from intubated premature infants at the UW NICU, who were eligible if born at <29 weeks GA and <28d old. All donors met criteria for BPD at 36 weeks CGA. Tracheal EpC were cultured in PneumaCult-EX medium and seeded into apical chambers of transwells CD14+CD16- (SP, similar to murine Ly6Chi) and CD14+CD16+ (DP, similar to Ly6Clo) monocytes were isolated by FACS from healthy donor pBMCs and placed in basolateral chambers. IL-33, Areg, and ST2 QPCR were performed on murine lungs/sorted cells and human co-cultures. Result(s): IL-33 is highly expressed in the mouse lung at PN0, with a 2-fold decrease by PN5 (p<0.05). EpC express 1000-fold more IL-33 mRNA than IM, but Ly6Clo and Ly6Chi IM also robustly express IL-33. CD11b-DTR+ depleter mice, lacking ~50% of IM, have increased mortality and alveolar hemorrhage in HILI. In these mice, IL-33 and Areg mRNA are decreased 3- fold (p<0.05) and 1.5-fold (p<0.05), respectively, compared with controls. IL-33-/- mice have impaired survival during HILI and decreased Areg expression (1.5-fold, p<0.05). Lungs from IL- 33-/- and Areg-/- mice demonstrate increased capillary leak and alveolar simplification after 3d of HILI (Figure 1). Tracheal EpC from infants with evolving BPD express 60-fold more Areg than monocytes. Compared with SP, DP express more ST2 and make 2-fold more Areg mRNA (p<0.05) after incubation with rIL-33 for 24h. Co-culture with epithelial cells increases monocyte expression of the IL-33 receptor ST2 20-fold. Conclusion(s): IL-33 and Areg are protective in acute HILI. Epithelial cell co-culture increases IL-33 signaling by monocytes through induction of ST2 IL-33-mediated immunomodulation may be important in BPD pathogenesis (Figure Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Dysmorphic pulmonary vascular growth and increased endothelial cell (EC) proliferation are paradoxically observed in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) despite vascular pruning. Cellular proliferation is enhanced by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis, which generates NADPH as a reducing equivalent and ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. However, no information is available on whether hyperoxic exposure, a known inducer of BPD in rodent models, alters glycolysis and the PPP in lung ECs, leading to uncontrolled proliferation and dysmorphic angiogenesis. We hypothesized that hyperoxia increases glycolysis and the PPP, resulting in EC proliferation and disarrayed angiogenesis in mouse lungs. Method(s): Primary lung microvascular ECs, isolated from neonatal mice (3-5 days old), were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) for 24 h followed by air recovery for 24 h. Neonatal C57BL/6J mice (<12 h old) were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 3 days, which were allowed to recover in air until postnatal day 14. Result(s): Hyperoxic exposure increased glycolytic flux as measured by the Seahorse Analyzer, [1,2-13C]glucose metabolic flux, and metabolomics assay in cultured lung ECs. In these cells, hyperoxia also augmented levels of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) protein and NADPH but reduced ribulose 5-phosphate, suggesting increased PPP. Blocking the PPP with 6-aminonicotinamide (50-400 muM) or dehydropiandrosterone (50-300 muM) reduced whereas a specific G6PD activator AG-1 (0.5-1 muM) further increased hyperoxia-induced proliferation in cultured lung ECs. Inhibiting glycolysis by a selective PFKFB3 inhibitor, 3-PO (5- 10 muM), had no effects on hyperoxia-induced lung EC proliferation in vitro. Neonatal hyperoxic exposure also increased endothelial 6PGD expression and proliferation in mouse lungs Blocking the PPP with 6-aminonicotinamide (5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) or dehydropiandrosterone (10-20 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung EC proliferation and alveolar simplification in neonatal mice. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxic exposure augments the PPP, leading to proliferation of lung ECs, while blocking the PPP ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung EC proliferation and alveolar simplification in neonates. This provides novel metabolic mechanisms underlying dysmorphic vascular development in premature infants with BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of premature birth affecting almost 50,000 infants born in the United States annually, including 10,000 with severe disease. A common misconception is that BPD resolves within the first few years of life, but the course of BPD can be highly variable with some patients having pulmonary consequences throughout childhood, and others with symptoms into adulthood. Within the NICU, respiratory disease can be tracked, but the follow-up after discharge is not standardized and the longitudinal natural history is not clearly defined. Our primary goal was to define the epidemiology of a current outpatient BPD cohort. Method(s): Leveraging an existing multicenter BPD collaborative, we created a registry of outpatient BPD clinics at tertiary care centers. Data collection instruments were generated through an iterative process involving eleven centers across the United States With review board approval, data were collected by caregiver questionnaires in the clinic and/or extracted from the electronic medical record. Result(s): A total of 112 infants and children were recruited from five tertiary care centers' BPD clinics. Outpatient care was provided primarily by pulmonologists (82.1%), but also by neonatologists (8.0%) and other providers (9.8%). A majority of participants were male (63.3%) and 49.1% reported some non-white racial ancestry. The mean gestational age at birth was 27.2+/-2.8 weeks [Range: 22.3, 36.0] with a mean birthweight of 999+/-429 grams [Range: 410, 2780]. The mean age at recruitment was 2.3+/-2.7 years (n=90) [Range: 0.3, 11.7]. Using the NHLBI definition of BPD severity the population enrolled to date includes: mild BPD: 11.6%; moderate BPD: 16.1%; severe BPD: 64.3%; had BPD, but severity not documented: 2.7%; did not meet NHLBI BPD criteria, were born preterm with ongoing respiratory symptoms: 5.3%. Almost one third of participants (30.9%) had pulmonary hypertension that persisted beyond 36 weeks corrected age. Conclusion(s): Our initial data extraction for this new registry highlights some of the epidemiology of outpatient BPD management, including a population that is more likely to be male and minority compared to the general population. The mean age is older than 2 years, suggesting that many infants with BPD continue to have respiratory issues beyond the first several years of life. While most infants presenting to BPD clinics do have severe BPD, a significant minority with milder disease also obtain follow-up care. Pulmonary hypertension is also common in this population. We plan to compare outcomes and practices at different tertiary care centers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excess of iron and oxidant injury shortly after birth may be associated with neonatal morbidities in preterm infants., AIMS: The aim was to determine whether administration of erythropoietin without iron supplementation decreases iron load and morbidity., STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: In a randomized trial, we administered erythropoietin (EPO 250IU/kg daily during the first 6days of life) or placebo to 39 preterm infants (BW 700-1500g, GA<=30.0weeks)., OUTCOME MEASURES: The iron status, postnatal morbidities and follow-up at the age of two years were investigated., RESULTS: In all, 21 EPO- and 18 placebo-treated infants were recruited. A requirement of red blood cell transfusions during first 28days was similar between the study groups. EPO treatment decreased total serum iron concentration (p=0.035). EPO supplementation had no significant effect on serum transferrin receptors or reactive non-protein-bound iron. There were no differences in neonatal morbidity or in survival without major neurological abnormality at two years of age., CONCLUSIONS: A 6-day course of EPO decreased the iron load in preterm infants. There was no change in reactive, non-protein bound iron plasma levels and no influence on the outcomes during early childhood. Whether the neurocognitive effects of early EPO treatment can be detectable later in childhood remained to be verified. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infants and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening sequelae of this disease. Disrupted lung angiogenesis is a hallmark of BPD-associated PH. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2 is shown to modulate angiogenesis. Further, we observed that: hyperoxia exposure increases the expression of ERK 1 and 2 in neonatal mice; and pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 in primary fetal human pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cells decreases in vitro angiogenesis. We also observed that endothelial ERK2 deficiency in mice disrupts angiogenesis and augments hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Whether ERK1 contributes to or mitigates experimental BPD is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that global ERK1- knockout neonatal mice will be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wild-type (WT) littermates. Method(s): One-day-old global ERK1-knockout (ERK1-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates (ERK2 -/-) mice were exposed to normoxia (FiO2 21%) or hyperoxia (FiO2 70%) for up to 14 d, following which the lungs were harvested to determine angiogenesis and the expression of ERK1, ERK2, and several markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. In addition, we performed echocardiography studies on PND14 to determine the independent and interactive effects of ERK1 gene and hyperoxia exposure on the following indices of PH: pulmonary acceleration time (PAT), RV ejection time (ET), PAT/ET, and RV systolic pressure (RVSP). Result(s): Lung ERK1 mRNA and protein levels were undetectable in ERK1-/- mice at basal conditions and upon exposure to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia exposure for 14 d decreased PAT and PAT/ET ratio and increased RVSP, indicating that hyperoxia induces PH Further, hyperoxia increased inflammation and oxidative stress and decreased angiogenesis in the lungs. However, the extent of these effects of hyperoxia was similar in both ERK1-/- and ERK1+/+ mice, indicating that ERK1 gene does not modulate neonatal hyperoxic lung injury Conclusion(s): Contrary to our hypothesis, ERK1 signaling is not necessary to mitigate hyperoxiainduced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice.

AB  - The study of pediatric bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is relevant and consequencethe introduction of modern perinatal technologies in recent years. It's the reason of a significant increase in thechildren survival, with the remaining problems of the respiratory system pathology Among chronic lung diseases bronchopulmonary dysplasia takes one of the leading places and is the main cause of mortality in this category of children (up to 11-36%) in the first year of life The aim of the work was to optimize the technology of diagnosis and BPD in children on the basis of the revealed medical and social risk factors of parents at the stages of early ontogenesis The initial examination of pregnant women was carried out simultaneously with the issuance of a specially designed card (?Medical and social passport of future parents?). Medical and social history was analyzed in 101 pairs (child - parents) living in Khabarovsk and adjacent settlements: group 1 - (main) children with BPD and their parents (n=47), group 2 - (comparison) children without BPD, other diseases of the respiratory system, acute pathologies and their parents (n=54)of 222 parameters. Multivariate analysis has revealed developing risk factors forbronchopulmonary dysplasia BPD: single-parent families (4.3 times more often), unsatisfactory living conditions (2.9 times), lower total living area (8.6 sq. M) and per 1 person ( 4.9 sq. m.) lower average income per person (2 times). From the mother's part, the risk factors were: living in the area in 3-4 generations(2 times); burdened obstetric and gynecological history (abortion 2.4 times, ectopic pregnancy - 4.6 times, the number of pregnancies 4 or more - 2.1 times, recurrent candidiasis, tumor formation); extragenital pathology (hypertension - 5.7 times, chronic cystitis - 2.7 times); harm from the profession (transport loads - 2.2 times, work at night - 2.4 times) and during pregnancy (physical activity - 6.6 times, stress during work - 1.9 times); drinking wine (2.9 times), long, more than 2 hours, walking (2 times). Risk factors on the part of the father are cardiovascular diseases (2.9 times), respiratory organs (2.1 times). Conclusion Representative medical and social risk factors have been identified from the parents' side for the formation of BPD in children at the planning stage and early pregnancy, on the basis of which a forecasting program was developed to optimize preventive measures to improve the quality of living conditions and activities to improve the health of mothers and unborn children.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen is administered to premature infants having pulmonary insufficiency However, hyperoxia contributes to the development of BPD in these infants. The molecular mechanisms of abnormal lung development are not completely understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure of newborn rats to hyperoxia for 7 days, followed by normoxia for another 15 days, will lead to differential time-dependent alterations in gene expression in pathways that are relevant to oxidative stress and abnormal lung development. We also assessed the effect of vitamin A treatment in addition to hyperoxic exposure. Newborn Fisher 344 rats were exposed to hyperoxia (95%) or room air from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 8 and animals were either sacrificed on PND 8, or were returned to normoxia and were sacrificed at PND 22. Within each rearing condition, half of the pups were assigned to receive daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections from P1-P5 of either 2mg/kg vitamin A dissolved in corn-oil or vehicle (corn-oil, 33mL/kg) alone. Total RNA was isolated from individual animals (n=3), and gene expression profiling was studied using RNA-seq on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform Gene expression data was quantile normalized and analyzed using the DESeq2 software significance was achieved for q<0.2 and linear fold change exceeding 1.25x. We identified genes significantly changed and in opposite direction on PND 22, comparing hyperoxia to normoxia group, and hyperoxia plus vitamin A compared to the hyperoxia group, and then determined enriched pathways (hypergeometric test, q<0.2). Nitric oxide (NO) pathways were enriched in the hyperoxia exposed rats at both PND7 and PND22. In particular, Gene Ontology (GO) NO-mediated transduction was enriched with fdr=0.025, including suppressed genes such as Nos1 (0.17 fold), Neurod1 (0.21 fold), Kcnc2(0.10 fold), and increased genes such as Ddah2(1.42 fold). Gucy1a3 (1.26 fold). Another pathway was GO nitric oxide synthase, with fdr=0.002, including induced genes such as Npr3 (1.37 fold), Gsk3b (1.33 fold), and suppressed genes such as Il1b (0.51 fold) and Fcer2 (0.39 fold). Finally, VEGFA pathway was modulated in hyperoxia at both PND 7 and PND22, including genes such as Ppp3r2 (0.13 fold), Rac2 (0.64 fold), and Rac1 (1.27 fold). Genes that promote nitric oxide signaling and VEGF were modulated differentially at PND7 and PND22 by hyperoxia. Npr3, a gene involved in NO synthase activity was induced by hyperoxia at PND22 but suppressed by vitamin A. Therefore, we hypothesize that these genes could be potential targets for intervention in BPD patients.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) significantly increases risk of infections, asthma and COPD in children and adults born preterm. Chorioamnionitis is the most common identifiable cause of preterm labor, and affected preterm infants often require postnatal treatment with oxygen (O2). Animal studies have implicated immune system dysregulation as an important contributing factor to short-term and long-term respiratory comorbidities associated with BPD. However important limitations of these studies are that postnatal hyperoxia exposure alone was used to incite lung injury during development, and assays were performed using whole lung homogenates. Since clinical BPD is often multifactorial, with prenatal insults likely priming the developing lung to postnatal insults, we sought to evaluate the pulmonary immune cell responses in a clinically relevant model of BPD by exposing the developing lungs to prenatal chorioamnionitis and postnatal hyperoxia followed by analysis of resident immune cells of the lung. Method(s): Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with intra-amniotic LPS (1ug) or normal saline (NS) at 20 days of gestation. Upon delivery, pups were placed in hyperoxia chamber with 85% O2 or room air (RA) for 14 days. Rat lungs were harvested on postnatal day 14. CD45+ immune cells were isolated from single cell suspensions of the lung using fluorescent activated cell sorting. Lungs were also inflation fixed with 10% formalin for histological analyses Total RNA was extracted from immune cells and genome-wide microarray screening was performed using Affymetrix WT-plus Rat Clariom S Gene chip. Result(s): Lungs from animals treated with prenatal LPS and postnatal O2 had significantly higher mean linear intercept indicative of alveolar simplification (Fig1A). Percentage of CD45+ immune cells as a fraction of all pulmonary cells was similar between the two groups. Analysis of differentially expressed genes with FDR < 0.01 and expression fold change > 2, revealed 85 upregulated genes and 137 downregulated genes (Fig1B). Gene ontology and ingenuity pathway analysis of upregulated genes was enriched for biological processes involved in connective tissue replacement chemotaxis and migration of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and granulocytes. In contrast analysis of downregulated genes showed significant enrichment of biological processes involved in T cell receptor V(D)J recombination, T cell co-stimulation, regulatory T cell differentiation and B cell differentiation. Furthermore, genes known to regulate angiogenesis and vascular development were also differentially expressed. Conclusion(s): Pulmonary immune cell responses to combined prenatal and postnatal insults may contribute to aberrant connective tissue replacement, adaptive immunity and angiogenesis seen in BPD.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an extremely common chronic lung disease during infancy. The prevalence has continued to rise with the increasing survival of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates. The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial, with a strong genetic foundation. Recent studies show that the Family with sequence similarity 13, member A (FAM13A) polymorphism is associated with multiple human lung pathological conditions, including chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), asthma, silicosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. The FAM13A gene is located on 4q22 and is comprised of 25 exons. The function of FAM13A is still unknown, but recent studies propose three possible mechanisms for FAM13. One is that FAM13A acts as a signal transduction gene because its significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie within an intronic region downstream of a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain, which is important for the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. The second possible mechanism is that FAM13A is associated with activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which has a role in both airway and alveolar epithelial development as well as repair after injury Finally, FAM13A may regulate the carnitine palmitoyl transferase-fatty acid oxidation that plays a role in regulating the production of reactive oxygen species, which lead to lung epithelial cell death. In this pilot study, we seek to determine the association of FAM13A SNPs with BPD in ELBW infants. Objective(s): We investigated the hypothesis that the FAM13A gene variants rs2609264, rs2869967, rs2013701 and rs2609255 are associated with susceptibility to BPD in ELBW infants Design/Methods: DNA from buccal swabs of ELBW infants were collected, isolated, and analyzed with RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probes for rs2609264, rs2869967, rs2013701 and rs2609255. BPD was defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Parents gave informed consent prior to infant enrollment. Statistical analysis using chi-square, t-test, and ztest were performed, with p < 0.05 denoting significance. Result(s): Patients with BPD were born earlier (p<0.001) and at a lower birth weight (p<0.001) (Table 1). For rs2609255, there is a significantly different genotype distribution between ELBW infants who progress to BPD and those who do not (p=0.04). (Table 2) Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we found a genetic variant of FAM13A to be associated with the development of BPD in ELBW infants. We speculate that this genetic variant may influence airway and alveolar development and remodeling (Table Presented).

AB  - Rationale: Dynamic tracheal collapse (tracheomalacia, TM) is a serious comorbidity in infants born preterm (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BPD) or with congenital respiratory defects. Bronchoscopy is the current standard for evaluating TM but poses increased risks to patients, limiting implementation in less stable neonates and broad infant populations Imaging-based virtual bronchoscopy (VB) has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool but with limited clinical relevance; most VB yields from computed tomography (CT), which is uncommon in neonates due to ionizing radiation concerns. We have previously published regional quantitative assessment of neonatal TM using MRI, with good correlation of MRI-based TM quantification with bronchoscopic severity diagnosis and later tracheostomy requirement. Here, we present novel visualization of neonatal TM on virtual bronchoscopy from high-resolution, respiratory-gated MRI, with good agreement with clinical bronchoscopy. Method(s): Three subjects with severe BPD (NICHD definition; 3M/0F) underwent tidal-breathing airway ultrashort echo-time MRI (3D-resolution=0.7mm) in a neonatal-sized 1.5T scanner (post-menstrual age at MRI=40+/-3 wk; no sedation ordered for imaging). As previously described, images were retrospectively gated to eight frames throughout the respiratory cycle using the respiratory-modulated MRI k-space center. Tracheal anatomy was segmented from endinspiration and end-expiration images, generating surfaces for VB visualization (Figure). Subjects A and B underwent clinical bronchoscopy 2 and 17 days post-MRI, respectively. TM findings from clinical and virtual bronchoscopies were compared (imaging-based collapse defined as >=30% change in luminal cross-sectional area). Result(s): TM findings from clinical and virtual bronchoscopy were in qualitative agreement: Subject A was clinically and virtually diagnosed with no TM (<30% collapse). Subject B was clinically diagnosed with severe TM in the mid-trachea and lower trachea, with dynamic tracheal collapse (>=30%) present in corresponding regions on VB. Subject C did not undergo clinical bronchoscopy as airway issues were not clinically suspected, yet dynamic tracheal collapse of >=30% was observed on VB. Conclusion(s): MRI-based virtual bronchoscopy allows for visual assessment of neonatal airway abnormalities with bronchoscopic views that are familiar to clinicians, without requiring invasive, ionizing, sedated, or breath-holding procedures. While rigorous validation is required this method overcomes the current barriers associated with existing diagnostic standards. Virtual bronchoscopy of airway abnormalities such as TM may not replace invasive bronchoscopy but could be important for assessing neonates who are too vulnerable for clinical bronchoscopy or in whom airway issues are not suspected. Since this technique poses no additional risks to patients, it may be used in serial assessment of disease progression and therapeutic response (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in infants disrupting the development of the lung secondary to preterm birth. Treating infants with BPD in the US is estimated to cost $2.4 billion. This amount is second only to the costs for treating asthma, and far exceeds the costs for treating cystic fibrosis. Despite many advances in neonatal ventilation techniques, widespread use of surfactant and antenatal corticosteroids, the incidence of BPD has remained the same or slightly increased. AyuVis is developing AVR-48, a small molecule immunomodulator for the prevention of BPD in at-risk preterm infants via intravenous (IV) dosing. AVR-48 is efficacious in preventing BPD in a hyperoxia-induced mouse model at 5mg/kg Intraperitoneal (IP) dose. The preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicokinetic studies will be discussed here. Methodology: To determine the genetic toxicity of AVR-48, Ames bacterial mutation (TA 98 and TA 100, 700 mug/well) and invitro micronucleus (IMN, 1.0 mM) assays were conducted. As part of safety pharmacology, hERG assay was conducted at 300 muM. AVR-48 was screened against a panel of 87 GPCR, ion channels and enzymes (Eurofins SafetyScreen87, 100 muM) and for its affinity for toll-like receptor (TLR) subtypes in human peripheral blood monocytes (hPBMC) at 0.1, 1.0 and 10 muM. We did four pharmacokinetic studies: IP, 10 mg/kg, intranasal (IN), 0.22 mg/kg in mouse pups (postnatal day or P14) and two studies at 100mg/kg, IV dosing in rat pups (P3 and P14). Toxicokinetics was studied in rat pups and adult rats. Result(s): Ames and IMN assays on AVR-48 indicated no genetic toxicity and IC50 for the hERG channel was >300muM. AVR-48 had no affinity for any offtargets in Eurofins SafetyScreen87 panel or for TLR6. AVR-48 inhibited the activation of TLR2 TLR4, TLR5, TLR7/8, and TLR9 in hPBMC at 0.1 muM. In the PK studies, significant Cmax levels of AVR-48 were seen in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at 10 mg/kg (IP) dose in juvenile mice. This dose had previously demonstrated efficacy in the BPD mouse model with good pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) correlation. Conclusion(s): AVR-48 is a promising therapeutic against BPD and exhibits an acceptable safety profile with good PK/PD correlation in rodent plasma and BALF. Further toxicokinetic and efficacy studies are in progress in dog and pre-term lamb models respectively.

AB  - Rationale: Angiogenesis plays an important role in pulmonary morphogenesis, and is disrupted in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Mast cells (MCs) derive from circulating progenitors (MCPs) and differentiate to mucosal subtype (MCT) after recruitment to the lung, under the instructions of the local microenvironment. Rarely, under pathological conditions such as in BPD recruited MCPs differentiate to connective tissue subtype (MCTC). Specific cues within the lung which regulate MC subtype are unknown. We hypothesize that MCTC accumulating in the parenchyma of preterm lungs may interfere with pulmonary angiogenesis. Method(s): Primary human cord blood-derived MC, primary human peripheral blood-derived MC and the LUVA human MC line was used as models of MCTC and MCT. The regulation of MC phenotype (MCT/MCTC) by primary human airway epithelial cells, the 16HBE human airway epithelial cell line, the A549 distal human lung epithelial cell line, and primary fetal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (feHPMECs) was studied. Molecular profiles distinguishing MCTLUVA and MCTCLUVA were comprehensively defined by RNAseq. The ability of MC to affect vascular organization during fetal lung development was tested in mouse lung explant cultures. The effect of MC on in vitro tube formation and barrier function was studied using feHPMECs. The mechanistic role of mast cell proteases was tested using specific inhibitors Results: Primary cultures of human MC, and LUVA, assume a predominantly MCTC phenotype in the absence of external stimulus. Airway epithelial cells, but not A549 or feHPMEC, promote the MCT phenotype, which is associated with increased TNFalpha signaling activity. TNFa alone is sufficient to stably reprogram MCTC to the MCT phenotype. MCTCLUVA cells cause vascular dysmorphia, with significant reduction of vascularity, in E16.5 embryonic mouse lung ex vivo. In vitro, MCTCLUVA potentiate feHPMEC interactions, but inhibite feHPMEC tube stability, and disrupted cell-cell junctions. Importantly, MCT LUVA cells do not disrupt angiogenesis ex vivo or in vitro. Serine protease inhibitors ameliorate the ability of MCTCLUVA to alter endothelial cell angiogenic activities both in vitro and ex vivo. Conclusion(s): We identify novel fundamental regulators of mast cell phenotypes, which are associated with different effector functions. Our data suggest MCTC effector functions may directly contribute to disrupted angiogenesis in BPD.

AB  - Background: The pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial including the use of oxygen that causes inflammation and disrupts alveolar development, including depletion of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells Adenosine is generated extra-cellularly by CD73 in response to injury and can act through adenosine receptors to alter pulmonary response to injury. Although elevated adenosine levels are protective in acute lung injury, sustained elevations activate pro-inflammatory pathways and can contribute to abnormal lung development. The role of adenosine signaling in the neonatal lung on the AT2 cell populations remains unknown. Objective(s): Evaluate the effect of preventing extracellular adenosine production on AT2 cell populations in lung recovery following hyperoxic lung injury after birth in a murine model of BPD. Design/Methods: Newborn C57Bl6 (WT) and CD73-/- mice were exposed to room air (RA) or 95% oxygen (hyperoxia) for 4 days followed by recovery in room air. Mice were sacrificed at time points up to 8 weeks of age. Samples were collected for analysis including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue for determination of inflammation, lung development and assessment of AT2 cell populations. AT2 cell populations were quantified with immunohistochemistry using Surfactant Protein C (SPC) antibody. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure induces an acute lung injury and leads to abnormal pulmonary development characterized by alveolar simplification. At 8 weeks of age, AT2 cell populations are decreased in wild-type hyperoxia exposed mice compared to room air. Loss of CD73 attenuated this hyperoxia effect with AT2 cell populations comparable to room air controls. Conclusion(s): Loss of CD73, resulting in lower extracellular adenosine levels, leads to a quicker resolution of inflammation following hyperoxic lung injury, including increased KGF protein during recovery in room air This study additionally demonstrates long term preservation of AT2 cell populations remote from the initial hyperoxic injury These findings suggest that adenosine signaling is detrimental in the repair processes following hyperoxic lung injury, and offer the potential for therapies that decrease adenosine signaling in premature neonates to hasten recovery following lung injury.

AB  - Background & Aim: The chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most severe complication of prematurity. BPD occurs following ventilator treatment with supplemental oxygen for acute respiratory failure, and early inflammation. The hallmarks of the lung pathology are arrested lung development including fewer and larger alveoli with less septation, thickening of alveolar septa and impaired development of the capillary network. These changes may lead to life-long respiratory morbidity including asthma, reduced exercise capacity, early onset emphysema and pulmonary hypertension. Currently, there is no treatment for BPD. Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) improve lung structure and function in experimental BPD, and early phase clinical trials are underway. However, the optimal UC-MSC donor remains to be determined. The aim of this project is to compare healing effects of UC-MSC donors in hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD. Methods, Results & Conclusion(s): UC-MSCs derived from 5 human donors (1st term delivery [TMSC], 2nd term delivery [T2MSC], preterm delivery [PMSC], preterm delivery with preeclampsia [PPMSC], preterm delivery with chorioamnionitis [PCMSC]) were administered intratracheally at postnatal day (P) 4 in rat pups exposed to 85% oxygen from P0 to P14. At P21, survival, lung function (flexivent), lung structure (mean linear intercept), right ventricular hypertrophy (Fulton index), as well as lung vasculature at P35 (microCT) were assessed. Treatment with UC-MSCs increased survival in hyperoxia-exposed developing pups. In addition, TMSC, PMSC, PPMSC and PCMSC, but not T2MSC, improved lung compliance, lung growth and attenuated pulmonary hypertension when compared to control hyperoxic pups. Thus, donor source impacts beneficial effects of UC-MSCs in a rat BPD model. In the future, understanding the differences at the transcriptomic level between UC-MSC donors might improve the identification of the optimal MSC source for treatment of complications of extreme prematurity, the number one killer of infants below the age of 5.Copyright © 2020

AB  - Purpose /Aim: Intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin) is an irreversible vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor used off-label to treat severe retinopathy of prematurity in extremely low gestational age neonates. VEGF and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) participate in lung maturation. We tested the hypothesis that intravitreal bevacizumab enters the systemic circulation and has long-lasting effects on lung MMPs., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neonatal rats were exposed to: (1) hyperoxia (50% O2); (2) intermittent hypoxia (IH) (50% O2 with brief episodes of 12% O2); or (3) room air (RA) from birth (P0) to P14. At P14, the time of eye opening in rats, a single dose of Avastin (0.125 mg) was injected into the vitreous cavity of the left eye. A control group received equivalent volume saline. At P23 and P45, lung MMP-2 and MMP-9, and TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were assessed in the lungs., RESULTS: At P23, Avastin increased MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 levels in the hyperoxia group but decreased TIMP-1 levels in the IH group. The ratios of MMP-2/TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 were significantly elevated at P23 in the IH group treated with Avastin. At P45, the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 remained elevated in the hyperoxia and IH groups treated with Avastin, while a rebound increase in TIMP-1 levels was noted in the IH group., CONCLUSIONS: Avastin treatment in IH has lasting alterations in the balance between MMPs and their tissue inhibitors. These changes may lead to impaired alveologenesis and tissue damage consistent with bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease.

AB  - Background & Aim: Extracellular vesicles derived from human amniotic epithelial cells (hAEC-EVs) have been previously shown to be beneficial in a preclinical model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) when obtained from full-term, healthy pregnancies. In this study, we compare their therapeutic potential against preterm, complicated pregnancies. Methods, Results & Conclusion(s): Methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was introduced to C57bl6 mouse fetuses intra-amniotically at E16 prior to exposure to 65% oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth. hAEC-EVs were injected intravenously on postnatal day (PND) 4. One cohort of mice was culled on either postnatal day PND7 or PND14, while another cohort were kept in hyperoxia until PND 28, following which they were recovered under normoxia conditions for a further 2 weeks for cardiovascular assessment. Result(s): The EVs isolated from either term or preterm hAEC had distinct cup shaped morphology with average size of 40-120nm. All hAEC-EV samples presented epithelial marker CD326, and EV markers CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD105. Term EVs had significant higher level of CD142 and CD133 compared to preterm EV. Mass spectrometry showed that all samples contained CD9, CD81, Alix and Grp94. Compared to preterm hAEC-EV, 47 proteins were significantly enriched in term hAEC-EVs and 38 proteins significantly reduced by more than 20-fold. In mouse model of BPD-like lung injury, we observed that term but not preterm hAEC-EV improved tissue-to-airspace ratio and septal crest density in a dose-dependent manner. Although both term and preterm hAEC-EV reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on PND7, the improvement of lung injury was associated with the increase of the percentage of type II alveolar cells only observed in term EV treatment group. Furthermore, only neonatal term hAEC-EV delivery reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, mitigated pulmonary hypertension and prevented right ventricle hypertrophy that associated with BPD-like lung injury until 6 weeks of age. Conclusion(s): Both term and preterm hAEC-EVs bore exosome characteristics based on size distribution, morphology under EM and exosomal markers, however, EV cargo and functional potency were significantly different. Term hAEC-EVs were more efficient at repairing the BPD-like lung injury compared to preterm EVs, and this impact of donor criteria should be considered when applying perinatal cells derived EV therapy for clinical use.Copyright © 2020

AB  - Objective: To explore the relationships of key perinatal variables known to affect long-term neurodevelopmental outcome with absent/abnormal fidgety movements among infants born extremely preterm (EP) (<28 weeks' gestational age) and/or extremely low birthweight (ELBW) (<1000g). Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): All consenting parents of surviving infants born EP/ ELBW in the state of Victoria, Australia, were recruited over a 12-month period from April 1, 2016. Details of the following perinatal variables, which are all associated with poorer long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, were recorded prospectively: gestational age, birthweight z-scores, male sex, multiple pregnancy, postnatal corticosteroids, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, brain injury (major intraventricular haemorrhage grade 3 or 4, or cystic periventricular leukomalacia), neonatal surgery, and postnatal infection (sepsis or necrotising enterocolitis).Infants were assessed using the Prechtl General Movements Assessment (GMA), using videos recorded by parents and sent remotely to assessors via the Baby Moves smartphone app. The Baby Moves app notified parents to film two videos: one at 12-13+6 weeks' corrected age and another at 14-16+6 weeks' corrected age. A simple set of instructions for filming was provided to parents via the app. The GMA videos were scored as 'Normal', 'Abnormal', or 'Absent' fidgety movements. Infants required at least one video to be scored as normal to have an overall normal GMA. Result(s): A total of 226 infants born EP/ELBW were recruited to the study and videos of 155 infants born EP/ELBW were returned and could be scored using the Prechtl GMA. Thirtyfive (23%) infants were classified as having absent/abnormal fidgety movements. On univariable analysis, higher gestational age was associated with reduced odds of having absent/abnormal fidgety movements (OR for each week's increase 0.74, 95% CI 0.59, 0.93, p=0.008). The presence of brain injury detected on cranial ultrasound was associated with higher odds of having absent/abnormal fidgety movements (OR 8.07, 95% CI 1.9, 34.2, p=0.005). On multivariable analysis, only brain injury was independently related to absent/abnormal fidgety movements (OR 6.17, 95% CI 1.13, 33.75, p=0.04), but the relationship of gestational age weakened. Conclusion(s): Brain injury was independently associated with absent/abnormal fidgety movements. Therefore, all infants born EP/ELBW should be screened using the GMA due to known associations with long-term outcomes of infants born EP/ELBW. The confounding effects of key perinatal variables should be considered within future studies of relationships between perinatal variables and absent/abnormal fidgety movements.

AB  - Ellis Van Creveld(EVC) disease is an autosomal recessive chondral and ectodermal dysplasia.It is a very rare disease due to EVC and EVC2 mutations.In particular,the EVC2 protein is thought to help regulate a signaling pathway known as Sonic Hedgehog,which plays a role in cell growth,Specialization and normal shaping of many parts of the body.EVC syndrome follows short ribs,polydactyly,growth retardation,Ectodermal and heart defects.Cognitive and motor development is normal. In this case, we aimed to evaluate this rare disease genetically. 39w3d,2475 gr born 6-year-old patient due to congenital heart defect in the neonatal period was admitted to the intensive care unit.Post-natal echocardiography showed atrioventricular septal defect,single AV valve,inlet wide VSD and wide primum ASD.During the physical examination of our patient,post-axial polydactyly in bilateral hands and syndactyly in bilateral feet (2- 3),disproportionate short stature,rhizomelic shortness in extremities,narrow rib cage,flattened nasal root,hypodontic and nail dysplasia were present.In addition the patient with bronchopulner dysplasia was accompanied by immunodeficiency and was receiving IVIG.In our case,homozygous c.709G> T mutation was detected by EVC2 gene sequence analysis.Mutationtaster and Varsome and in silico genetic prediction evaluation,this change was interpreted pathologically.This interesting disease,also called hast 'six-fingered dwarfism',has many aspects waiting to be solved.EVC-related gene mutations are thought to be associated with a group of diseases called ciliopathy.In our case,immunodeficiency,bronchopulmonary dysplasia and cholelithiasis are associated with different cases reported in the literature.In order to increase the life expectancy of EVC patients,it is important to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to various clinical problems that may be seen in this process.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of preterm infants and hyperoxia is a major risk factor for this disease. Histopathologically, BPD is characterized by alveolar simplification (fewer and larger alveoli). Our studies showed that hyperoxia exposure increases lung adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha) activation in neonatal mice. Whether this alteration is a compensatory or contributory phenomenon in hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that lung AMPKalpha activation protects against hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD in neonatal mice. Methods used C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) male and female mice pups were housed in air (21% FiO2, normoxia) or 70% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 d while they are injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the AMPKalpha agonist, aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), or the vehicle daily through postnatal days (PND) 1 to 14. Lung tissues were harvested on PND7 or PND14 to determine lung AMPKalpha activation and development, respectively. AMPKalpha activation was determined by immunoblotting, whereas alveolar development was evaluated by radial alveolar counts (RAC) and mean linear intercepts (MLI). Summary of results At PND7, AICAR administration increased phosphorylated AMPKalpha protein levels, indicating that the compound activated AMPKalpha in our experimental conditions. Hyperoxia-exposed mice had a decrease in RAC and increases in MLI indicating that their alveoli were fewer in number and larger in diameter, respectively, when compared with normoxia- exposed mice. Interestingly, AICAR treated mice had increased alveolar development at basal conditions (normoxia exposure). Further, AICAR treatment decreased hyperoxiainduced alveolar simplification. Conclusions These findings support our hypothesis that AMPKalpha signaling mitigates hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD in neonatal mice. We propose that AMPKalpha is a potential target for the development of new therapies for BPD.

AB  - Purpose of study Despite known negative effects of tobacco use during pregnancy, it remains a significant problem. Adult studies demonstrate that tobacco-exposure (TE) causes chronic inflammation, tissue remodeling, and neutrophil accumulation in lungs. In utero inflammation has been associated with development of BPD in preterm infants. We hypothesize that maternal tobacco exposure increases neutrophil infiltration in the placenta and increases risk for BPD in premature infants. Methods used Prospective, pilot study on a convenient sample of women and their infant born <32 weeks from Oct 2018 to Nov 2019 at OUHSC. Primary outcome was incidence of BPD with secondary outcomes of NEC, IVH, ROP, PDA, sepsis and death. We excluded mothers with chorioamnionitis, PPROM, fever, maternal disease affecting immunity, or fetus with known major anomaly. Mothers were classified as TE or no TE based on a Tobacco Exposure Questionnaire. Placenta sections were tested for neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), myeloperoxidase, and elastase using ELISA and IHC. Subset of patients had RNA analyzed using Immunology Nanostring Panel©. Maternal demographic and neonatal outcomes data were collected. Data was analyzed using Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and student t-test. Summary of results Of the 29 patients enrolled, 41% were TE mothers. Baseline demographic data was similar with BPD or death as compared to no BPD except for birth weight, gestational age and intubation. There was no statistical difference in the infant's composite outcome of BPD or death based on maternal TE. Neutrophil markers were higher in mothers exposed to tobacco than non-exposed. IHC showed neutrophils in intervillous space near infarction with positive NGAL stain. 26 inflammatory genes were differentially expressed in placentas of TE mothers with infants having BPD as compared to non-exposed mothers with infants not having BPD. Conclusions Tobacco exposure during pregnancy leads to increased neutrophil infiltration in the placenta, but there is no association with development of BPD. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

AB  - Purpose of study Carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) can be endoge-nously formed in the presence of oxidative stress and may be elevated in inflammatory lung disease. There is lack of evidence of its relationship with development of bronchopulmo-nary dysplasia (BPD). The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between blood CO-Hb levels in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and BPD. Methods used Retrospective study of ELBW infants born at LAC-USC Medical Center between June 2015 and June 2019, that survived to 36 weeks corrected gestational age (cGA). CO-Hb values were collected daily from day of life (DOL) 1 to DOL 14. BPD definition followed NICHD criteria. Wil-coxon Rank sum test was used to determine the association between blood CO-HB levels and BPD. Summary of results ELBW infants with BPD had a median GA in weeks of [24 (1) vs 27 (3.5); P=0.002] in non-BPD infants, and median BW of (644.5 (185) vs. 910 (250) grams, p=0.02) respectively. Blood CO-Hb level was not significantly different between infants with and without BPD (table 1). Conclusions Lower gestational age and birth weight are associated with BPD but not CO-Hb levels at any time within the first 14 days of life. This needs to be further studied in a larger sample size.

AB  - Purpose of study Poor post-natal growth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in extremely preterm infants. In a rodent model, we have shown that postnatal growth restriction (PNGR) causes intestinal dysbiosis and PH. Human beta-defensin 2 (HBD2) is a broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide produced by many epithelial cells including enterocytes in the distal small bowel and colon. We hypothesized that HBD2 would attenuate malnutrition-associated dysbiosis and PH. Methods used Newborn rats were assigned to a litter size of 17 (PNGR) or 10 (normal growth), and exposed to room air or 75% oxygen for 14 days. Some PNGR+hyperoxia pups were treated with recombinant HBD2 by gavage. Echocardio-grams were performed on day 14 to determine the ratio of pulmonary acceleration time (PAT) to pulmonary ejection time (ET); decreased PAT:ET indicates PH. Pups were then euthanized and plasma and tissues harvested. Fulton's index (RV weight divided by LV weight + septum weight), was quantified to identify RV hypertrophy. Lung expression of IL1b and glutathione (GSH) were analyzed as a marker of inflammation and oxidative stress respectively. Summary of results HBD2 attenuated malnutrition-induced PH and RVH and reversed associated changes in IL1b and GSH (figure 1). Conclusions Malnutrition causes intestinal dysbiosis leading to injury in the developing lung. Alterations in inflammatory cytokines and markers of oxidative stress are promising mechanisms. The decrease in lung IL1b with malnutrition was unexpected and was reversed by treatment with HBD2. Investigation of changes in the gut microbiota with administration of HBD2 is warranted.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease most commonly seen in preterm infants as a result of long-term mechanical ventilation and oxygen exposure. The pathogenesis resulting in BPD is not completely understood. Studies using postmortem BPD lung tissue have shown that there is altered expression of a number of devel-opmentally important genes. Methods used We generated three independent genetic models of BPD-like phenotype by disrupting the signaling pathways of TGFb, PDGFa, and IGF-1 in neonatal lung in mice. The mutations to disrupt the pathways were induced in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) whose role is critical for normal alveologenesis. RNAseq analysis was performed which identified a cluster of differentially expressed genes that were common amongst the three BPD-like phenotypes. To assess the physiologic relevance of a specific subset of the identified genes, we examined their expression in a well-established hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolization mouse model. We analyzed gene expression using a total of ten mice exposed to hyperoxia compared to eight combined controls at three different points during neonatal life. mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Summary of results Expression of Foxq1, Foxd1, Foxc2 were decreased in the mouse BPD lungs suggesting a role for the selected genes in the pathogenesis of BPD. We further demonstrate that Foxd1 is expressed in SCMF and ablation of SCMF during alveologenesis via Foxd1-cre arrests alveolar formation leading to a BPD-like phenotype. To validate our findings in the mouse model, we show that Foxd1 is also reduced in human BPD lung tissue. Conclusions Collectively, these observations support the notion that disruption of Foxd1 and FOX family transcription factors may play a major role in the pathogenesis of BPD in preterm infants. This study was supported by NHLBI and The Hastings Foundation.

AB  - Introduction/Hypothesis: Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in premature newborns is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Angiopoietins are vascular growth factors that regulate endothelial homeostasis and inflammation. During sepsis and ALI, angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) is upregulated and pathologically antagonizes normal angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1)-mediated Tie 2 receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Since limiting neonatal ALI may prevent BPD, we used our previously developed newborn mouse model of LPSinduced ALI and alveolar simplification (akin to BPD) to test whether exogenous ANGPT1 can antagonize ANGPT2 to prevent ALI. Method(s): 6-day-old C57BL/6 mice (4-6 per group) were given ip LPS (2 mg/kg) +/- 2 hr pretreatment with ip recombinant mouse ANGPT1 (rmAngpt1, 1 mug). Whole lungs were harvested after 24 hrs for mRNA and protein study. Apoptosis was seen by TUNEL stain. Separately, human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC) cultures were stimulated with LPS +/- recombinant human ANGPT1 (rhANGPT1) for 1 or 24 hrs to dissect effects on the angiopoietin-tie axis. Result(s): In mouse pups given ip LPS, rmAngpt1 pretreatment prevented lung NF-kappaB activation at 24 hours (P-p65:p65 fold change from control: 2.23+/-0.67 for LPS vs 1.04+/-0.11 rmAngpt1+LPS, p<0.05). rmAngpt attenuated lung gene expression of keratinocyte-derived cytokine, IL-1beta, and the endothelial neutrophil attractant ICAM-1 by 25-35% (p<0.01), blunted the 4.6-fold rise in ICAM-1 protein by 27% (p<0.05), and protected against lung apoptosis (% apoptotic cells: 5.51+/-1.88 vs 1.59+/-0.29 [71%]; p<0.01). MMP-9, a marker of pathologic lung remodeling, had 10-fold higher lung gene expression post-LPS (p<0.0001), which was 58% lower with rmAngpt1+LPS (p<0.001). In HPMEC in vitro, trends in NF-kappaB activation, ICAM-1, and IL-8 paralleled in vivo data. Further, LPS-induced ANGPT2 (2.1-fold mRNA and 2.8-fold protein, p<0.05) was entirely suppressed by rhANGPT1. Tie 2 was dephosphorylated in endothelial cells 1 hour post-LPS alone though not with rhANGPT1+LPS. Conclusion(s): Therapeutic ANGPT1 attenuates lung apoptosis as well as key mediators of ALI and alveolar remodeling in an in vivo neonatal sepsis model. Restoring balance in the Angiopoietin-Tie axis during sepsis may potentially counter neonatal ALI and prevent BPD.

AB  - Objective: Two models which produce BPD in mice have been previously reported. IL-6 has been implicated in the development of chronic inflammation, which can precipitate BPD. We sought to determine if perinatal IL-6 absence attenuates BPD in each of these models. Study Design: IL-6 knockout (-/-) mice were compared with wild-type C57BI6J mice (+/+) in order to determine if this exposure improved the BPD phenotype. Day 14 Antepartum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with and without postpartum hyperoxia were the two models of BPD. Litters were homogenized at birth and then randomly assigned by model type. On day 14 of life pups were sacrificed, and two thirds of them were randomly selected to have their lungs inflated and preserved with formalin before being made into slides. The primary outcomes were alveolar septation by mean linear intercept (MLI) and alveolar heterogeneity in ten representative photos of each lung sample. Unpaired t-tests were utilized to determine differences between mice type for each model of BPD; a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): 10 dams in each exposure group bore twelve correctly timed litters and a total of 79 pups. 42 pups' lungs were preserved with adequate formalin inflation. 9 +/+ and 12 -/- were exposed to LPS, and 11 +/+ and 10 -/- exposed to hyperoxia and LPS. In the LPS only model, 61 +/+ and 80 IL6 -/- representative images were analyzed. In the LPS and hyperoxia model, 118 +/+ and 90 IL6 -/- images were analyzed. In the LPS only model, alveolar heterogeneity was significantly better in the knockout group (D2 200 vs 147mm, p=0.002), but there were no significant differences in MLI (See Figure 1). In the LPS and hyperoxia model, there were no significant differences in the primary outcomes (See Figure 2). Conclusion(s): Genetic IL-6 absence attenuated the cascade of effects of antepartum LPS exposure in mice, and this therapy warrants additional investigation as a means of preventing BPD in at risk fetuses and neonates. The addition of hyperoxia removed this trend, likely secondary to the more intense exposure. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2019

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although caffeine and glucocorticoids are frequently used to treat chronic lung disease in preterm neonates, potential interactions are largely unknown. While anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are well defined, their impact on airway remodeling is less characterized. Caffeine has been ascribed to positive effects on airway inflammation as well as remodeling. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) plays a key role in airway remodeling and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. The current study addressed the impact of glucocorticoids on the regulation of CTGF in the presence of caffeine using human lung epithelial and fibroblast cells., METHODS: The human airway epithelial cell line H441 and the fetal lung fibroblast strain IMR-90 were exposed to different glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, budesonide, betamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone) and caffeine. mRNA and protein expression of CTGF, TGF-beta1-3, and TNF-alpha were determined by means of quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting. H441 cells were additionally treated with cAMP, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, and the selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitor cilomilast to mimic caffeine-mediated PDE inhibition., RESULTS: Treatment with different glucocorticoids (1 muM) significantly increased CTGF mRNA levels in H441 (p < 0.0001) and IMR-90 cells (p < 0.01). Upon simultaneous exposure to caffeine (10 mM), both glucocorticoid-induced mRNA and protein expression were significantly reduced in IMR-90 cells (p < 0.0001). Of note, 24 h exposure to caffeine alone significantly suppressed basal expression of CTGF mRNA and protein in IMR-90 cells. Caffeine-induced reduction of CTGF mRNA expression seemed to be independent of cAMP levels, adenylyl cyclase activation, or PDE-4 inhibition. While dexamethasone or caffeine treatment did not affect TGF-beta1 mRNA in H441 cells, increased expression of TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 mRNA was detected upon exposure to dexamethasone or dexamethasone and caffeine, respectively. Moreover, caffeine increased TNF-alpha mRNA in H441 cells (6.5 +/- 2.2-fold, p < 0.05) which has been described as potent inhibitor of CTGF expression., CONCLUSIONS: In addition to well-known anti-inflammatory features, glucocorticoids may have adverse effects on long-term remodeling by TGF-beta1-independent induction of CTGF in lung cells. Simultaneous treatment with caffeine may attenuate glucocorticoid-induced expression of CTGF, thereby promoting restoration of lung homeostasis.

AB  - Objective: BPD is the result of chronic pulmonary inflammation and abnormal alveolar remodeling. IL-6 is an inflammatory mediator which has been implicated in this process. Two models which produce BPD in mice have been previously reported. We sought to determine if perinatal IL-6 absence in these models of BPD attenuated pulmonary inflammation. Study Design: IL-6 knockout (-/-) mice were compared wild-type C57BI6J mice (+/+) in order to determine if this exposure improved pulmonary inflammation. Day 14 Antepartum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with and without postpartum hyperoxia were the two models of BPD. Litters were homogenized at birth and then randomly assigned by model type. On day 14 of life pups were sacrificed, and one third of them were randomly selected for assessment of inflammation. The primary outcome was pulmonary inflammation measured by inflammasome caspase-1 fluorometric activity at 14 days of life. Relative fluorescence units (RFU) were controlled by total protein concentration of each sample. Unpaired t-tests were utilized to determine differences between mice type for each model of BPD; a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): 23 pups were randomly selected for molecular inflammation analysis. In the LPS only model, 8 pups were analyzed. In the LPS and hyperoxia model, 15 pups were analyzed. There was no significant decrease in pulmonary inflammation between -/- and +/+ in the LPS only group (1213 vs 920 RFU/total protein, p=0.38). Additionally, there was no difference in pulmonary inflammation between the -/- and +/+ mice in the LPS and hyperoxia group (1650 vs 1559 RFU/total protein, p=0.76). Conclusion(s): Genetic IL-6 absence did not decrease pulmonary inflammation in two mouse models of BPD. Future studies should examine if a more physiologic imperfect IL-6 blockade will decrease pulmonary inflammation, due to IL-6's roles in both the resolution of innate immunity and the development of acquired immunity.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a disease of premature newborns that is characterised by arrested lung alveolarisation and disturbed lung vascular development. MicroRNA are increasingly recognised as causal mediators of lung development. It was hypothesised here that miR-200c-3p, which exhibits up-regulated expression in aberrantly developing lungs, plays a causal role in arrested lung alveolarisation in experimental BPD. This idea was tested using a locked nucleic acid (antimiR) directed against miR-200c-3p. Experimental Approach: C57BL/6J newborn mouse pups were exposed to 85% O2 for the first week of post-natal life, which provoked changes in lung structure analogous to those in preterm infants with BPD. Mouse pups exposed to 21% O2 served as controls. Mouse pups were injected (i.p.) either with 10 mg kg-1 of antimiR-200c-3p, or with a scrambled antimiR (scr), in RNase-free H2O vehicle on postnatal day (P) 1 and P3. AntimiR efficacy was assessed by real-time RT-PCR analysis of miR-200c-3p levels. Changes to lung structure were assessed by design-based stereology in mouse lungs isolated at P7. Key Results: Steady-state levels of miR-200c-3p were up-regulated in mouse whole lung homogenates after 85% O2 exposure. Fluorescence activated cell sorting revealed that Tie2+ cells in particular overexpress miR-200c-3p; from-7.6 +/- 0.58 DELTACt in normoxia versus-5.82 +/- 0.81 DELTACt in hyperoxia (n = 5; P < .006). AntimiR-200c-3p applied at P1 and P3 caused a decrease in the levels of mouse lung miR-200c-3p assessed at P7 and impacted the expression levels of the miR-200c-3p downstream targets Zeb1 and Lbh. Lung structure of mouse pups maintained under 21% O2 that received antimiR-200c-3p inhibitor treatment was significantly affected with decreased lung volume (0.18 +/- 0.02 cm3 in scr vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02 cm3 in antimiR; n = 6, P = .0002), gas exchange surface area (115.20 +/- 16.02 cm2 in scr vs. 75.31 +/- 12.12 cm2 in antimiR; n = 6, P < .0001) and total alveoli number (from 1.50 x 106 +/- 0.12 alveoli in scr to 0.89 x 106 +/- 0.13 alveoli in antimiR; n = 6, P < .0001). No significant changes in lung structure were noted in the lungs of 85% O2-exposed mouse pups comparing scrambled with antimiR-200c-3p treatment. Conclusions and Implications: miR-200c-3p is a key regulator of normal late lung development in mice as abrogation of miR-200c-3p expression results in decreased lung volume and stunted lung structure. Treatment with 10 mg kg-1 miR-200c-3p inhibitor concomitant with 85% O2 exposure did not attenuate the deleterious effects of elevated oxygen levels on the development of the lung architecture.

AB  - Background: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Management of severe pre-eclampsia is particularly challenging at peri-viable gestations given the tension between foetal and maternal interests. Case description: A 32-year-old presented approximately 25-29 weeks pregnant with known positive urine pregnancy test but no prior antenatal care. She reported four days of headache and visual changes. Notably she had pre-eclampsia in three previous pregnancies. Her initial blood pressure was 249/138. She appeared well with normal reflexes. Initial investigations revealed severe proteinuria (protein-creatinine ratio 1100) with normal haemoglobin, platelets, coagulation, kidney and liver function but elevated lactate dehydrogenase suggesting haemolysis. An urgent ultrasound showed a live intrauterine pregnancy with estimated foetal weight 529 g and gestational age 22 weeks and 4 days. Blood pressure control was challenging for several hours despite IV hydralazine boluses and hydralazine infusion, oral nifedipine, IV labetalol and IV magnesium sulphate with readings up to 300/150 confirmed on arterial line. Given her peri-viable gestation, a decision was made for stabilisation without delivery and transfer to a tertiary centre. After neonatal counselling the patient opted for full resuscitation. Three days later, she developed resistant hypertension despite four anti-hypertensives. A live baby boy weighing 520 g was delivered by caesarean at 23 weeks gestation. The baby survived 49 days then died of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and extreme prematurity. Conclusion(s): Management of severe pre-eclampsia and timing of delivery to optimise maternal and neonatal outcomes requires a multidisciplinary approach.

AB  - Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) occurring secondary to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) contributes to significant morbidity and mortality among extremely preterm infants and currently there are no effective and safe interventions. We have previously shown that prophylactic treatment with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) prevents murine BPD, so we sought to determine if its protection also extends to murine BPD-PH. Method(s): Pregnant C57BL/6J mice received an i.p. injection of LPS (150 ug/kg) at d14 of gestation. Immediately after birth, pups were randomised to hyperoxia (65% O2) or room air (21% O2). Pups were treated with daily s.c. injections of IL-1Ra (10 mg/kg) or saline. On d28, lung parenchyma was assessed by histology, pulmonary blood vessels by synchrotron micro-CT imaging and pulmonary blood pressures by echocardiography. To assess pulmonary vasculature later in life, mice were returned to room air after d28 and then at d60 in vivo synchrotron radiation microangiography was performed. Result(s): IL-1Ra prevented BPD-like lung disease (28% reduction in alveolar size, 34% increase in alveolar number compared to hyperoxia saline). Micro-CT revealed significant pulmonary vascular remodelling in hyperoxia saline-treated pups e.g. 41% decrease in small vessels (4-5mum diameter) and 35-fold increase in large vessels (50-60mum diameter), which was accompanied by PH (TPV/RVET 0.27 for hyperoxia saline vs 0.32 for controls); treatment with IL-1Ra was protective. In vivo microangiography revealed 18-25% fewer vessels across all branching generations in hyperoxia saline mice than air controls, which was rescued by IL-1Ra. Conclusion(s): IL-1Ra protected the pulmonary vasculature of pups from perinatal inflammation and hyperoxia.

AB  - Background: Group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH), is caused by hypoxemia resulting from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) and FGF Receptors 1 and 2 (FGFR1/2) levels are elevated in PH patients and in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia. Endothelial FGFR1/2 signaling is important for response to injury. We hypothesize that FGF2 and endothelial FGFR1/2 signaling promotes endothelial cell signals that protect against PH. Method(s): The Flk1- or Tie2- Cre transgenes were used to conditionally regulate Fgfr expression in endothelial cells. Mice that lack Fgfr1/2 in endothelial cells (FGFRKO), mice that lack Fgf2, or mice that can be induced to express a constitutively active FGFR1 in endothelial cells (caFGFR1) were challenged with 10% hypoxia for 2 weeks, followed by cardiac catheterization to measure right ventricular (RV) pressure. We also engineered a microfluidic device to simulate physiologically relevant blood vessels. Result(s): Compared to control littermates, FGFRKO mice in hypoxia developed worse RV pressure, increased RV hypertrophy, and decreased RV function, demonstrating worsening PH. Furthermore, mice with a global deletion of Fgf2 developed more severe PH than FGFRKO mice when challenged in hypoxia. Notably, mice with endothelial overexpression of caFGFR1 showed RV pressure similar to control mice in normoxia. In microfluidic devices, primary pulmonary endothelial cells from FGFRKO mice altered vascular smooth muscle cell morphology resulting in extracellular matrix deformation. Conclusion(s): We conclude that loss of endothelial FGFR1/2 worsens hypoxia induced PH and RV function in vivo and alters smooth muscle cell physiology in vitro. Furthermore, FGF2 is important for the pathogenesis of Group 3 PH and acts at least in part through the endothelial FGFR1/2 pathway. We show that overexpression of constitutively active FGFR1 in endothelial cells prevents hypoxia induced PH in vivo. Our data suggests that activation of endothelial FGF signaling protects against Group 3 PH, the opposite of what is reported in Group 1, and regulates endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cell interactions.Copyright  2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of preterm neonates with a few therapeutic options. Our previous studies suggested that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) therapy is effective in the treatment of BPD in mouse models. Furthermore, microRNA-206 (miR-206) suggested having a correlation with BPD by regulating the expression of fibronectin 1 (FN1). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to characterize the role of BMSCs with the up-regulation of miR-206 in the treatment of BPD in newborn mice. Method(s): The BPD mouse model was induced by 60% oxygen. BMSCs transfected with miR-206 or negative control (NC) plasmid were administered on postnatal day 7 (P7) and every following week through an intraperitoneal injection (105 cells/animal) until P35. The mice were weighed and their lungs were weighed and prepared for histology. The expression levels of miR-206, FN1, and pulmonary surfactant-associated protein-C (SP-C) were determined through the quantitative polymerase chain reaction and under the immunofluorescence. The protein expression levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by ELISA. Result(s): BMSCs with up-regulation of miR-206 reduced the degrees of pulmonary edema, improved pulmonary architecture, and attenuated inflammation in BPD mice compared to the NC plasmid group. Furthermore, the up-regulation of miR-206 in BMSCs down-regulated the expression levels of TGF-beta and IL-6 in plasma samples and of SP-C and FN1 in the lung tissue of BPD mice. Conclusion(s): BMSCs with up-regulation of miR-206 are effective in the treatment of BPD in newborn mice, and the study introduced a novel idea for the treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2019, Author(s).

AB  - Objectives To determine zinc concentrations and associated factors in a population of preterm newborns at term age. Design This analytical, descriptive, observational and prospective study was conducted in the neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital. Preterm newborn between gestational weeks 24 and 34 were included in the study. The patients were recruited close to the date of birth. Their clinical histories were collected, and the serum zinc concentrations (SZCs) at gestational weeks 37-41 were measured. This study aimed to measure SZC in a population of preterm newborns at term age, and analyse the anthropometric, clinical and nutritional parameters associated with a decrease in SZC. results Overall, 83 preterm subjects were evaluated, including 44 (53%) female infants and 39 (47%) male infants. The median period of gestation was 31 (IQ25-IQ75: 29-33) weeks, and the mean weight at birth was 1.523+/-0.535 kg. The median SZC at term was 4.4 (IQ25-IQ75: 2.6-6.9) micromol/L. There were some variables associated with zinc concentrations like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), weight at birth, z-score of length at discharge, being small for gestational age and treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin, although the unique variable that was independent of the other variables in the multivariate analysis (p 0.01) was BPD. Preterm newborn with BPD had lower SZC at term age than those without (2.7 vs 4.9 micromol/L, p 0.005). Conclusions Zinc concentrations in this preterm population were low. BPD was significantly and negatively correlated with zinc concentrations.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - Here, we describe a novel pathogenic entity, the activated PMN (polymorphonuclear leukocyte, i.e., neutrophil)-derived exosome. These CD63+/CD66b+ nanovesicles acquire surface-bound neutrophil elastase (NE) during PMN degranulation, NE being oriented in a configuration resistant to alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT). These exosomes bind and degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) via the integrin Mac-1 and NE, respectively, causing the hallmarks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Due to both ECM targeting and alpha1AT resistance, exosomal NE is far more potent than free NE. Importantly, such PMN-derived exosomes exist in clinical specimens from subjects with COPD but not healthy controls and are capable of transferring a COPD-like phenotype from humans to mice in an NE-driven manner. Similar findings were observed for another neutrophil-driven disease of ECM remodeling (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). These findings reveal an unappreciated role for exosomes in the pathogenesis of disorders of ECM homeostasis such as COPD and BPD, providing a critical mechanism for proteolytic damage., In chronic inflammatory lung disease, neutrophil-derived pathogenic exosomes bypass the pulmonary antiprotease barrier to promote extracellular matrix destruction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective. To analyze the results of long-term (2007-2017) follow up of children with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). Patients and methods. A total of 522 children with COPD underwent comprehensive clinical and instrumental examination. We assessed the main risk factors for COPD as well as disease etiology. Almost half of all patients (45.8%) had lung malformations complicated by secondary bacterial infections. Using clinical and morphological data, we evaluated the probability of developing tissue dysplasia, which is not included in the approved classification of clinical forms of bronchopulmonary diseases in children. We also observed impaired growth and development of the lungs in children with secondary COPD, in addition to anatomic malformations leading to interstitial lung disease. Results. Various clinical variants of COPD in children as the outcome of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were revealed in 22.8% of cases. We analyzed possible causes of primary COPD (23.7% of cases) as an outcome of complicated community-acquired pneumonia with the consideration of genetic predisposition to chronic disease, specific immune cell-cell interactions, impaired energy supply of immunocompetent blood cells, and development of tissue dysplasia in the lungs. Genetically determined lung diseases were observed in 7.7% of patients. The etiology of COPD is associated with specific regional characteristics and, possibly, with underdiagnosis of genetically determined lung diseases. We analyzed the causes of COPD, which allows the administration of adequate antibacterial therapy and specific immunotherapy. Conclusion. The following measures are required to improve the quality of care for children with COPD: analysis of the disease etiology, timely diagnosis of specific clinical and etiological variants of COPD, and individual approach to treatment and follow-up of these children.Copyright © 2019, Dynasty Publishing House.

AB  - Background: Cranial ultrasonography is the main neuroimaging technique for very low birth weight infants. Low brain volume is associated with poor neurologic outcome. This study aimed to calculate brain volumes of preterm infants with two-dimensional measurements of cranial ultrasonography. Method(s): Intracranial height, anteroposterior diameter, bi-parietal diamater, ventricular height, thalamo-occipital distance and ventricular index were measured with routine cranial ultrasonographic scanning. Brain considered a spheric, ellipsoid model and estimated brain volume (EBV) was calculated by subtracting two lateral ventricular volumes from the total brain volume. Result(s): One hundred and twenty-one preterm infants under a birth weight of 1500 g and 32 weeks of gestational age were included in this study. The mean gestational age of study population was 27.7 weeks, and mean birthweight was 1057 grams. Twenty-two of 121 infants had dilated ventricle, in this group, EBV was lower than normal group (202 +/- 58 cm3 vs 250 +/- 53 cm3, respectively, p<0.01). Advanced resuscitation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and late-onset sepsis were found to be independent risk factors for low brain volume in our data. Conclusion(s): Estimated brain volume can be calculated by two-dimensional measurements with cranial ultrasonography.Copyright © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE), a soluble isoform of the RAGE receptor, is elevated in lungs from patients with acute conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and bronchiolitis. This study investigated whether sRAGE is present in ventilated infants. Methods Tracheal aspirates from the first week or the fifth week of life were obtained from intubated very low birth weight subjects and analyzed by Western blot. Immunohistochemistry analysis for sRAGE was performed on paraffin-embedded lung autopsy slides from 19 other infants. Results The sRAGE band densities were similar among the seven infants who fully recovered, eight who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and 5 who died (analysis of variance p = 0.797) but was higher at 4 weeks, p = 0.0324. There was minimal sRAGE staining in the autopsied lungs from previable infants (20-21 weeks) or from those who were not ventilated or had mild lung disease. In contrast, substantial staining was present in two of three with BPD, and those who received high ventilatory support. Conclusion sRAGE is present in ventilated infants. Levels are generally higher in those who receive prolonged or vigorous mechanical ventilation. Since sRAGE may have roles in inflammation and cell adherence, its role in the development of BPD may warrant study. Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

AB  - Hyperoxia may cause pulmonary fibrosis in neonates and is characterized by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of alveolar epithelial cells. The placental growth factor (PLGF) gene is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor family and is highly expressed in lung tissues that have been exposed to hyperoxia. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of PLGF in the EMT of lung tissue. Lung tissue exhibiting low PLGF expression was obtained by injecting rats exposed to hyperoxia with a PLGF-silencing lentiviral plasmid. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that expression levels of the EMT-related protein epithelial-cadherin were increased, whereas its inhibitor protein zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 2 was decreased in these rats. These data demonstrated that PLGF silencing may significantly mitigate hyperoxia-induced EMT in rat lung tissue. Additionally, an increase in phosphorylated-p38 MAPK protein expression indicated that PLGF may be able to regulate hyperoxia-induced lung injury in rats via the p38 MAPK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

AB  - Children with Medical Complexity (CMC) have high medical frailty and suffer frequent hospital admissions. Airways disorders represent the most common need for special targeted interventions as a consequence of inability to clear secretions for ineffective cough, particularly in case of acute airways inflammation or aspiration pneumonia due to impaired swallowing. These conditions may progress to respiratory failure. Genetic and chromosome disorders, encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy represent the most frequent etiologies. Respiratory rehabilitation plays a pivotal role in the CMC's treatment not only in preventing acute events and hospitalizations, but also in reducing length of hospital stay. Such interventions must be carried out jointly by hospital - local health authority Pediatric and child Neuropsichiatric units. Taking care of patients means to carry out clinical and instrumental assessments to identify hypoventilation during awake and sleep time, swallowing and coughing impairment. Common therapeutic measures are bronchial clearance and less frequently, mechanical ventilation and home oxygen therapy. Caregiver education is very important, since it allows to move almost all treatments from hospital to the home setting, in several cases with the support of healthcare professionals and telemedicine.Copyright © 2019, AIPO Ricerche srl.

AB  - Objectives: Angiogenic factors may be involved in lung development. To evaluate the relations between maternal and cord blood angiogenic factors (sFlt-1, placental growth factor [PlGF], soluble endogline [sEng], transforming growth factor beta [TGF-beta]) and their association with moderate and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very preterm growth-restricted infants. Study design: Prospective monocentric cohort study. Twenty-four mother-child dyads featuring antepartum preeclampsia, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) and birth before 30 weeks' gestation were included. This ensured a 80% power to test whether sFlt-1 maternal levels would be twice as high in cases of BPD as in the absence of BPD. Main Outcome Measure(s): Four pro/anti-angiogenic factors from two pathways (sFlt-1, PlGF and sEng, TGF-beta) were measured in maternal serum before delivery (at the time of hospitalization or the day of birth) and in neonates' cord blood. Neonatal outcome was moderate to severe BPD, defined as oxygen requirement for at least 28 days and persistent need for oxygen or ventilatory support at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Result(s): sFlt-1 levels were positively correlated in maternal serum and cord blood (rs = 0.83, p <.001) but levels of PlGF and TGF-beta and its receptor sEng were not. Among all the factors studied in cord and maternal blood, none was associated with BPD. Conclusion(s): In IUGR preterm babies born before 30 weeks' gestation from preeclamptic mothers, serum sFlt-1, PlGF and sEng, TGF-beta levels were not correlated with BPD. The increased BPD risk in preterm neonates born from preeclamptic mothers cannot be related to high sFlt-1 levels.Copyright © 2019 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy

AB  - Antioxidant enzymes may play a significant role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the level of extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) in the serum at days 1 and 7 of life and the risk of developing BPD. The study comprised 103 neonates born before 32 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of <=1500 g. In the investigated group, the median serum SOD3 level at day 1 of life was 4.01 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR) 2.59-5.09 ng/mL] and at day 7 of life 3.13 ng/mL (IQR 2.49-4.34 ng/mL). A statistically significant decrease in the serum SOD3 level was found in the first week of life, P < 0.0001. No correlation was found between the serum SOD3 level at day 1 of life and gestational age R = 0.07, P = 0.4543 and birth weight R = 0.10, P = 0.3083. No statistically significant correlation was found between the dynamics of change in the SOD3 level in serum at days 1 and 7 of life and the risk of BPD development for the definition of BPD at day 28 of life, P = 0.8764 nor at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, P = 0.6598. The study revealed a statistically significant decrease in the serum SOD3 level in the first week of life in very and extremely low birth weight infants born before 32 weeks of gestation. In the clinical setting, no relationship was observed between the level of SOD3 in serum and the risk of developing BPD.Copyright © 2019 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Background: Ureaplasma spp. is a known risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, little is known about the effect of different degrees of maternal Ureaplasma colonization and their adverse outcomes. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of different degrees of maternal Ureaplasma colonization on BPD. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of preterm infants delivered at <32 weeks' gestational age (GA) was performed. The infants were divided according to maternal Ureaplasma status as follows: high-colonization (>=104 CCU/ml, UUH), low-colonization (<104 CCU/ml, UUL), and noncolonization (controls). Subgroup analysis according to neonatal respiratory Ureaplasma (n-UU) was also performed to evaluate vertical transmission. Result(s): In total, 245 infants were included in this study (UUH = 105, UUL = 47, controls = 93). The rates of preterm labor and histological chorioamnionitis were significantly different. The rate of BPD was significantly high in UUH (P = 0.044). The transmission rate of n-UU colonization was 36% in UUH and 32% in UUL (P = 0.609). The rate of BPD was 78% in n-UU (+) of UUH but 43% in n-UU (-) of UUL (P = 0.027). Conclusion(s): High-degree colonization of maternal Ureaplasma was associated with preterm labor, histological chorioamnionitis, and neonatal BPD. The incidence of BPD was significantly higher in Ureaplasma-colonized infants born to women with high-degree colonization.Copyright © 2018

AB  - Background: While additional oxygen supply is often required for the survival of very premature infants in intensive care, this also brings an increasing risk of progressive lung diseases and poor long-term lung outcomes. Caffeine is administered to neonates in neonatal intensive care for the prevention and treatment of apneas and has been shown to reduce BPD incidence and the need for mechanical ventilation, although it is still unclear whether this is due to a direct pulmonary action via antagonism of adenosine receptors and/or an indirect action. This experimental study aims to investigate the action of caffeine on the oxidative stress response in pulmonary tissue in a hyperoxia-based model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborn rats. Method(s): Newborn Wistar rats were exposed to 21% or 80% oxygen for 3 (P3) or 5 (P5) postnatal days with or without recovery on room air until postnatal day 15 (P15) and treated with vehicle or caffeine (10 mg/kg) every 48 h beginning on the day of birth. The lung tissue of the rat pups was examined for oxidative stress response at P3 and P5 immediately after oxygen exposure or after recovery in ambient air (P15) by immunohistological staining and analysis of lung homogenates by ELISA and qPCR. Result(s): Lungs of newborn rats, corresponding to the saccular stage of lung development and to the human lung developmental stage of preterms, showed increased rates of total glutathione and hydrogen peroxide, oxidative damage to DNA and lipids, and induction of second-phase mediators of antioxidative stress response (superoxide dismutase, heme oxygenase-1, and the Nrf2/Keap1 system) in response to hyperoxia. Caffeine reduced oxidative DNA damage and had a protective interference with the oxidative stress response. Conclusion(s): In addition to the pharmacological antagonism of adenosine receptors, caffeine appears to be a potent antioxidant and modulates the hyperoxia-induced pulmonary oxidative stress response and thus protective properties in the BPD-associated animal model. Free-radical-induced damage caused by oxidative stress seems to be a biological mechanism progress of newborn diseases. New aspects of antioxidative therapeutic strategies to passivate oxidative stress-related injury should be in focus of further investigations.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: The optimal antibiotic regimen for preterm premature rupture of membrane (pPROM) is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the effects of ampicillin-sulbactam (SBT/ABPC) and azithromycin (AZM) on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Method(s): This retrospective study included women with singleton gestations and a diagnosis of pPROM between 22 and 27 weeks of gestation. In patients presenting with a high risk of intra-amniotic infection between January 2011 and May 2013, piperacillin or cefmetazole + clindamycin (regimen 1 group; n = 11) was administered, whereas SBT/ABPC and AZM (regimen 2 group; n = 11) were administered in patients presenting a similar risk between June 2013 and May 2016. Result(s): The incidence of moderate or severe infant BPD in the regimen 2 group was significantly lower than that in the regimen 1 group, even when adjusted for gestational age at the time of rupture of membrane, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.02 (1.8 x 10-5-0.33). The incidence of BPD and total days on mechanical ventilation were significantly lower in the regimen 2 group than in the regimen 1 group. No significant differences were seen in other morbidities. Conclusion(s): In patients with pPROM between 22 and 27 weeks of gestation, the administration of SBT/ABPC and AZM may improve the perinatal outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology

AB  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between growth, nutritional and fluid intake in the first month of life and the likelihood of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Design & Settings: This is a retrospective case-control study conducted in a tertiary perinatal centre between January 2011 and December 2013. Patient(s): Thirty-three preterm infants without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were identified and matched with those with BPD, based on period of birth within a cohort of infants with a birth weight of <=1000 g and gestational age <=28 weeks that were admitted to the unit during the study period. Main Outcome Measure(s): We reported the weekly and 4-week mean daily caloric and fluid intake, and growth status as changes in Fenton z-scores and weight velocity. The predictors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The 4-week mean daily caloric and fluid intake were significantly lower in the BPD group. Mean z-scores of weights, weight velocity and proportions of infants with weights below the 10th percentile on day 28 of life were similar in both groups. The odds of developing BPD were increased when invasive ventilatory support was required at day 28 (OR = 16.5), and were decreased with a higher 4-week averaged daily caloric intake (OR = 0.89). Conclusion(s): Infants with BPD received a lower caloric and fluid intake in the first month of life. In multivariable regression analysis, two independent predictors for BPD development were the need for invasive ventilatory support and a lower 4-week averaged daily caloric intake.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background & aims: Preterm infants have lower levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Supplementing very premature infants with intravenous lipid emulsions that fish oil, which is rich in n-3 LC-PUFAs, may decrease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) by modulating inflammation and neonatal immune function. Method(s): Sixty very low birth weight (VLBW) premature infants requiring ventilator support were randomized in a double-blind manner to 2 groups and received total parenteral nutrition with fish oil containing LE (intervention group, n = 30) or soybean oil containing LE (control group, n = 30) for 7 days. Blood samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained for assay on day 1 and 7 days after LE. The primary outcome was to compare the levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 in serum and BALF. Secondary outcomes were to compare mortality and co-morbidities. Result(s): The levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 in serum and BALF were significantly lower in the intervention group at day 8 (p < 0.05). The incidence of BPD in the intervention group compared to the control group was 13.3% versus 36.7% (p = 0.04; odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.86). The duration of ventilator support and oxygen use was significantly less in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The level of alanine aminotransferase was significantly lower in the intervention group on day 8 (p = 0.031). Conclusion(s): In very premature infants, early administration of fish oil containing LE significantly decreased IL-1beta and IL-6 levels in serum and BALF and was associated with shorter duration of ventilator support and less bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. There is currently no proven effective treatment modality for BPD, and inflammation and oxidative injury play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. This study investigated the histopathological and biochemical effects of bosentan, which is a non-specific endothelin receptor antagonist with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, on hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) in neonatal rats. Method(s): The experiment was performed on newborn rats from the 3rd to the 13th postnatal day. The rats were randomly divided into six groups: Group 1 (air-exposed + saline, n = 6); Group 2 (HILI, n = 8); Group 3 (air-exposed + bosentan, n = 7); Group 4 (HILI + saline, n = 7); Group 5 (HILI + early bosentan-treated group, n = 6), and Group 6 (HILI + late bosentan-treated group, n = 7). Bosentan was administered (30 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally. The histopathological effects of bosentan on lung tissue were assessed by their alveolar surface area, fibrosis, and smooth muscle actin (SMA) scores, and the biochemical effects on lung tissue were assessed by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Result(s): The alveolar surface area and fibrosis scores were found to be significantly higher in HILI groups compared with Group 1 (P < 0.01). The SMA scores in HILI groups were also significantly higher than Group 1 (P < 0.01). Bosentan treatment, especially late therapy, reduced all of these histopathological scores and the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the hyperoxia groups (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): This experimental study showed that bosentan had a protective effect on hyperoxic lung injury through its anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2019 Japan Pediatric Society

AB  - Despite the well-established sex-specific differences in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the molecular mechanism(s) behind these are not completely understood. Pulmonary angiogenesis is critical for alveolarization and arrest in vascular development adversely affects lung development. Human neonatal umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) provide a robust in vitro model for the study of endothelial cell physiology and function. Male and Female HUVECs were exposed to room air (21% O2, 5% CO2) or hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2) for up to 72 h. Cell viability, proliferation, H2O2 production and angiogenesis were analyzed. Sex-specific differences in the expression of VEGFR2 and modulation of NF-kappa B pathway were measured. Male HUVECs have decreased survival, greater oxidative stress and impairment in angiogenesis compared to similarly exposed female cells. There is differential expression of VEGFR2 between male and female HUVECs and greater activation of the NF-kappa B pathway in female HUVECs under hyperoxic conditions. The results indicate that sex differences exist between male and female HUVECs in vitro after hyperoxia exposure. Since endothelial dysfunction has a major role in the pathogenesis of BPD, these differences could explain in part the mechanisms behind sex-specific differences in the incidence of this disease.

AB  - Along with such well-known risk factors for the formation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), such as low birth weight, prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome in the neonatal period, prolonged oxygen dependence, genetic factors play a significant role in the development of this disease in children. In particular, genetic determination of BPD formation is possible in the presence of polymorphisms of proteolytic enzyme genes, cytokine cascade, surfactants, antioxidants, etc. Objective of the research: To identify genetic factors predisposing to BPD formation in premature infants in the Russian Federation and to compare them with clinical and anamnestic risk factors for the formation of this disease. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 200 premature infants born before the 37th week of gestational age. The main group included children with BPD (n=100), the control group - without BPD (n=100). Genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood samples by phenol-chloroform extraction. Further genotyping was performed using real-time PCR on ABI StepOnePlus thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). The study identified possible associations between frequencies of alleles and genotypes of gene variants FGFR4 (rs376618, rs1966265), FGFR2 (rs2981579, rs1219648), SFTPA1 (rs4253527), SFTPA2 (rs121917737, rs121917738), SFTPB (rs137853202), SFTPS (rs121918559, rs121918560, rs121917834, rs34957318, rs121917835, rs121917836, rs121918560), MMP2 (rs7201, rs17301608, rs243865), MMP9 (rs20544, rs3918242, rs17576), MMP12 (rs2276109, rs652438, ), MMP16 (rs2664352), PTPN22 (rs2476601), HLA-DRA (rs9268645), TAGAP (rs1738074), TYK2 (rs34536443, rs2304256), LOC102823878 (rs 694739) and BPD formation. Result(s): Rs652438 and rs694739 variants were associated with BPD formation in premature infants. Significantly more often in the group of premature infants with BPD, compared with the control group, the C allele (p=0,02, OR 1,78 (95% CI 1,09-2,9)), CC genotypes (p=0,03, OR 3,2 (95% CI 0,84-12,18)) and TC (p=0,03, OR 1,39 (95% CI 0,76-2,55)) variant g.102736642T>C (rs652438) of the MMP12 gene and the C allele (p=0,004, OR 1,8 (95% CI 1,21-2,67)), TC genotypes (p=0,0004, OR 1,05 (95% CI 0,57-1,96)) and CC (p=0,0004, OR 3,02 (95% CI 1,32-6,91)) of the rs 694739 variant of the LOC102823878 gene. Conclusion(s): In the era of personified therapy, the detection of gene polymorphisms associated with BPD formation can help develop new strategies for the prevention and treatment of this disease. Further studies of gene variants are necessary to identify the genetic determination of BPD formation in premature infants.Copyright © 2019, Pediatria Ltd. All right reserved.

AB  - Background: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding disorder that commonly afflicts premature infants who are born prior to 31weeks of gestation or with a body weight less than 1250 grams (about 2.75 pounds). Another risk factor is excessive oxygen in incubators, which can lead to blindness. A compounding factor is that survival rates for premature infants are rising with concomitantly more cases of ROP. We have reported an unsuspected intrinsic property of melanin to dissociate water. This capability can be considered an alternative treatment option for adult and neonatal diseases. It is known that exogenous surfactant administration suppresses bronchopulmonary dysplasia and consequent death, randomized, controlled trials with various respiratory interventions did not show any significant reductions in morbidity and mortality rates. During a descriptive study about the three leading causes of blindness in the world, the ability of melanin to transform light energy into chemical energy through the dissociation of water molecule was unraveled. Initially, during 2 or 3 years; we tried to link together our findings with the widely accepted metabolic pathways already described in molecular pathway databases, which have been developed to collect and organize the current knowledge on metabolism scattered across a multitude of scientific evidence. Observations: The current report demonstrates the main problems that afflict premature babies with an emphasis on the growth of abnormal vessels in the retina, the explanation for which is unknown until date. We also reported a case of a baby who suffered digestive and respiratory problems with a brain haemorrhage that was successfully treated by laser photocoagulation. We hypothesise that most likely this effect was due to the melanin level and melanin itself produces oxygen via dissociating with water molecules. Conclusion(s): We postulate that the intrinsic effect of melanin may easily convert visible and invisible light into chemical energy via a water dissociation reaction similar to the one in plant's chlorophyll, and markedly elevated with diagnosis and treatment of the complications related to premature babies.Copyright © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease in childhood, related to prematurity, and the most common cause of pulmonary hypertension (PH) secondary to pulmonary disease in children. Moderate and severe BPD have a worse outcome and relate more frequently with PH. The prediction of moderate or severe BPD development in extremely premature newborns is vital to implement preventive strategies. Starting with the hypothesis that molecular biomarkers were better than clinical and echocardiographic factors, this study aims to explore the ability of clinical, echocardiographic and analytical variables to predict moderate or severe BPD in a cohort of extremely preterm infants. Patients and methods We designed a prospective longitudinal study, in which we followed a cohort of preterm newborns (gestational age <28 weeks and weight 1250 grams). In these newborns we recorded weekly clinical and echocardiographic variables as well as blood and tracheal aspirate samples, to analyze molecular biomarkers (IL-6, IL-1, IP10, uric acid, HGF, endothelin-1, VEGF, CCL5). Variables and samples were collected since birth up to week 36 (postmenstrual age), time-point at which the diagnosis of BPD is established. Results We included 50 patients with a median gestational age of 26 weeks (IQR 25-27) and weight of 871 g (SD 161,0) (range 590-1200g). Three patients were excluded due to an early death. Thirty-five patients (74.5%) developed BPD (mild n = 14, moderate n = 15, severe n = 6). We performed a logistic regression in order to identify risk factors for moderate or severe BPD. We compared two predictive models, one with two variables (mechanical ventilation and inter-ventricular septum flattening), and another-one with an additional molecular biomarker (ET-1). Conclusions The combination of clinical and echocardiographic variables is a valuable tool for determining the risk of BPD. We find the two variable model (mechanical ventilation and echocardiographic signs of PH) more practical for clinical and research purposes. Future research on BPD prediction should be oriented to explore the potential role of ET-1.Copyright © 2019 Alvarez-Fuente et al.

AB  - Preterm infants acquire reduced amounts of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) via trans-placental transfer as compared to term infants which might explain their high susceptibility for infections. The reduced amount of IgG antibodies also results in a lower amount of anti-inflammatory Fc N-galactosylated and -sialylated IgG antibodies. This reduction or, even more, a qualitative shift in the type of IgG Fc glycosylation might contribute to the increased risk for sustained inflammatory diseases in preterm infants. It was the aim of our explorative study to investigate the IgG Fc glycosylation patterns in preterm infants of different gestational ages compared to term infants and mothers of preterm infants. In plasma samples of preterm infants (n = 38), we investigated IgG concentrations by use of ELISA. Furthermore, we analyzed IgG Fc glycosylation patterns in plasma of preterm infants (n = 86, 23-34 weeks of gestation), term infants (n = 15) and mothers from preterm infants (n = 41) using high performance liquid chromatography. Extremely low gestational age infants (born < 28 weeks of gestation during second trimester) had reduced IgG concentrations and decreased proportions of galactosylated (84.5 vs. 88.4%), sialylated (14.5 vs. 17.9%) and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine-containing (8.4 vs. 10.8%) IgG Fc N-linked glycans as compared to preterm infants born ?28 weeks of gestation (during third trimester) and term infants. Increased non-galactosylated (agalactosylated, 16.9 vs. 10.6%) IgG Fc N-linked glycans were associated with the development of chronic inflammatory bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, mothers of preterm infants born during second or third trimester of pregnancy did not show significant differences in IgG Fc glycosylation patterns. Thus, the IgG Fc glycosylation patterns of preterm infants depend on their gestational age. Although lack of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine has been associated with less inflammatory effector functions, the decreased IgG Fc galactosylation and sialylation with lower gestational age suggest a rather pro-inflammatory pattern. The difference in IgG Fc glycosylation patterns between preterm infants and mothers of preterm infants suggests a selective enrichment of IgG glyco forms in preterm infants, which might contribute to or result of the development of sustained inflammatory diseases like BPD.Copyright © 2019 Twisselmann, Bartsch, Pagel, Wieg, Hartz, Ehlers and Hartel.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) prevent the onset of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in animal models, an effect that seems to be mediated by their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). The aim of this study was to compare the protective effects of intratracheally (IT) administered MSCs versus MSC-EVs in a hyperoxia-induced rat model of BPD. At birth, rats were distributed as follows: animals raised in ambient air for 2 wk (n = 10), and animals exposed to 60% oxygen for 2 wk and treated with IT-administered physiological solution (n = 10), MSCs (n = 10), or MSC-EVs (n = 10) on postnatal days 3, 7, and 10. The sham-treated hyperoxia-exposed animals showed reductions in total surface area of alveolar air spaces, and total number of alveoli (Nalv), and an increased mean alveolar volume (Valv). EVs prompted a significant increase in Nalv (P < 0.01) and a significant decrease in Valv (P < 0.05) compared with sham-treated animals, whereas MSCs only significantly improved Nalv (P < 0.05). Small pulmonary vessels of the sham-treated hyperoxia-exposed rats also showed an increase in medial thickness, which only EVs succeeded in preventing significantly (P < 0.05). In conclusion, both EVs and MSCs reduce hyperoxia-induced damage, with EVs obtaining better results in terms of alveolarization and lung vascularization parameters. This suggests that IT-administered EVs could be an effective approach to BPD treatment.Copyright © 2019 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (BCPAP) has been used in neonates with respiratory distress for decades; however, the optimal setting for BCPAP circuits remains unknown. This study compared the gas exchange efficiency and lung protection efficacy between conventional and high-amplitude BCPAP devices. Method(s): We compared gas exchange, lung volume, and pulmonary inflammation severity among rats with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) that were treated with conventional BCPAP (BCPAP with an expiratory limb at 0degree), high-amplitude BCPAP (BCPAP with an expiratory limb at 135degree), or spontaneous breathing (SB). After mechanical ventilation for 90 minutes, the rats were randomly divided into four groups: A control group (euthanized immediately; n = 3), an SB group (n = 8), and two BCPAP groups that received BCPAP with the expiratory limb at either 0degree (n = 8) or 135degree (n = 7) for 90 minutes. Result(s): The high-amplitude BCPAP group exhibited significantly lower alveolar protein, lung volume, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels than did the SB group. The high-amplitude BCPAP group exhibited significantly lower IL-6 levels than did the conventional BCPAP group. The two BCPAP groups demonstrated no difference in gas exchange efficiency. Conclusion(s): High-amplitude BCPAP reduced lung inflammation and alveolar overdistension in rats with VILI after mechanical ventilation was ceased. Thus high-amplitude BCPAP may offer a superior lung protective effect than conventional BCPAP.Copyright © 2019, the Chinese Medical Association.

AB  - This case report is about a boy born extremely preterm at gestational age of 24 weeks, with extremely low birth weight, developing severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in need of mechanical ventilation for 155 days. He also had five recurrent infections with group B streptococcus (GBS) within 4 months from birth, and his respiratory condition clearly deteriorated with every GBS infection. It was difficult to wean him from mechanical ventilation. Finally he was extubated when he was 7 months old and kept out of mechanical ventilation after receiving high-dose methylprednisolone, given according to international recommendations. After GBS was cultured for the fifth time, he received oral rifampicin along with intravenous penicillin and after this treatment, GBS did not occur again. At the age of 22 months, the boy no longer needed any respiratory support and he was about 6 months late in his neurological development.Copyright © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - Objective: There is an increasing incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP) in preterm infants in China, which is the key issue affecting their survival rate and life quality. This study was performed to better understand the mechanism of protective effect of celecoxib on hyperoxia induced injury. Method(s): Hyperoxia BPD model was established using newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats exposed to high O2 level (85%). Celecoxib treatment was also conducted. Histology of lung tissue samples were analyzed. Functional studies were systematically performed using the lung tissues and A549 cells. Result(s): Hyperoxia disrupted lung development in SD rats. Celecoxib alleviated the damaged lung development. NF-kappaB and Aquaporin (AQP) 1 were identified as the pathways in the hyperoxia-induced lung injury. We have shown that hyperoxia activated NF-kappaB pathway through increased nucleus translocation and repressed AQP1 expression. On the contrary, celecoxib inhibited NF-kappaB phosphorylation and nucleus translocation and increased AQP1 expression through inhibiting COX2 activity. Additionally, celecoxib also rescued apoptosis induced by hyperoxia. Conclusion(s): Our study identified NF-kappaB and AQP1 as the pathways in the hyperoxia-induced lung injury in the hyperoxia BPD model SD rats and it provided a better understanding of the protective effect of celecoxib. It suggests NF-kappaB and AQP1 may be as potential targets for treating newborns with BPD.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Wang, Li, Zhao, Li, Liu, Jiang, Li and Zhang.

AB  - Background: Premature infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD) are at risk of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is used to predict disease severity in adult PH. Its diagnostic utility in sBPD-associated PH is unknown. Objective(s): The aim of this paper was to determine the accuracy of BNP, against echocardiogram (echo), to diagnose PH in infants born <32 weeks' gestation with sBPD. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all infants with sBPD with an echo and BNP within a 24-h period, at >=36 weeks postmenstrual age. PH was defined as: right ventricular pressure >1/2 systemic blood pressure estimated from tricuspid regurgitant jet or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) velocity, bidirectional or right-to left-PDA, and/or flat/bowing ventricular septum at end-systole. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to test the diagnostic accuracy of BNP. Result(s):Of 128 infants, 68 (53%) had echo evidence of PH. BNP was higher among the infants with PH (median [interquartile range]: 127 pg/mL [39-290] vs. 35 [20-76], p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for diagnosing PH using BNP was 0.74 (95% CI 0.66-0.83). At an optimal cutpoint of 130 pg/mL, BNP correctly classified the presence or absence of PH in 70% of the infants (specificity: 92, sensitivity: 50%). Conclusion(s): BNP, relative to concurrent echo, demonstrated moderate accuracy for diagnosing PH in this cohort of preterm infants with sBPD. BNP may help rule in PH in this population but has low utility to rule out the disease.© 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether batyl alcohol (BTA) can improve the pathology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in newborn rats induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the mechanism. Method(s): Pregnant SD rats (16.5 d) were randomly assigned into Saline group, LPS group, and LPS+BTA group. Amniocentesis injection of LPS was performed to establish neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rat model. In LPS+BTA group, LPS and BTA were injected at the same time. After birth, LPS+BTA group was injected with BTA continuously everyday for 7 days. The other two groups were injected with normal saline of equal volume. Lung tissues of neonatal rats on the first, third and seventh day after birth were stained by hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and resorcin-fuchsin respectively, to observe alveolarization arrest. The mRNA and protein levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in newborn rats lungs were detected by real-time PCR and ELISA. In vitro, mouse macrophages RAW264.7 were cultured to detect IL-1beta mRNA levels and protein levels after treatment with LPS and BTA. SD rat bone marrow macrophages were isolated and treated with LPS and BTA. RNA-sequence was taken to screen for possible targets of BTA inhibition of inflammation. Result(s): The results of H-E staining showed that LPS+BTA group had a milder pathology of BPD, with more secondary septa counts, more alveolar counts, and smaller mean linear intercept (all P<0.05); after BTA intervention the expression levels of IL-1beta mRNA and protein in lung tissues of neonatal rats were significantly lower than those in LPS group (both P<0.05). In vitro, IL-1beta mRNA and protein increased after LPS stimulation (both P=0.000), but decreased in the LPS+BTA group (both P<0.05). RNA-sequence results showed that BTA inhibited the expressions of some inflammatory factors, such as thrombospondin1 (Thbs1), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (Trem1), and cluster of differentiation 274 (Cd274), and promoted the expressions of some anti-inflammatory factors, such as complement C1q C chain (C1qc), RT1 class II, locus Da (RT1-Da), and RT1 class II, locus Db1 (RT1-Db1). Conclusion(s): BTA can improve lung pathology of neonatal rats with BPD by downregulating the expression of IL-1beta and reducing inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

AB  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been increasingly recognized to play a crucial role in normal physiological homeostasis. Additionally, disrupted AhR signaling leads to several pathological states in the lung and liver. AhR activation transcriptionally induces detoxifying enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1). The toxicity profiles of the classical AhR ligands such as 3-methylcholanthrene and dioxins limit their use as a therapeutic agent in humans. Hence, there is a need to identify nontoxic AhR ligands to develop AhR as a clinically relevant druggable target. Recently, we demonstrated that leflunomide, a FDA approved drug, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in humans, induces CYP1A enzymes in adult mice via the AhR. However, the mechanisms by which this drug induces NQO1 in vivo are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that leflunomide will induce pulmonary and hepatic NQO1 enzyme in neonatal mice via AhR-dependent mechanism(s). Leflunomide elicited significant induction of pulmonary CYP1A1 and NQO1 expression in neonatal mice. Interestingly, the dose at which leflunomide increased NQO1 was significantly higher than that required to induce CYP1A1 enzyme. Likewise, it also enhanced hepatic CYP1A1, 1A2 and NQO1 expression in WT mice. In contrast, leflunomide failed to induce these enzymes in AhR-null mice. Our results indicate that leflunomide induces pulmonary and hepatic CYP1A and NQO1 enzymes via the AhR in neonatal mice. These findings have important implications to prevent and/or treat disorders such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia in human infants where AhR may play a crucial role in the disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Disease summary: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that remains one of the most prevalent long-term sequelae of premature birth. Northway and colleagues first described the condition in 1967, after 32 preterm infants (mean gestational age 34 weeks) with respiratory distress syndrome developed characteristic radiographic changes following the initiation of positive pressure mechanical ventilation [1]. Four stages of lung injury were described in "classic" BPD: exudative (age 1-3 days); necrosis and early repair (age 4-10 days); microcyst formation and pulmonary fibrosis (age 10-12 days); and severe cystic changes and cor pulmonale (after 30 days of age) [2]. The clinical definition of BPD has evolved with time and advancements in neonatal care including surfactant therapy, antenatal steroid administration, and improved ventilator strategies [3,4]. Most infants currently developing BPD are born between 24-28 weeks gestational age, during the time of canalicular and saccular development. "New" BPD is characterised by a uniform arrest of lung development, with simplified alveolar structures and dysmorphic capillaries. These infants are more likely to present with a mild respiratory distress syndrome and a continued need for supplemental oxygen [5]. Three levels of BPD severity (mild, moderate, or severe) are determined by the gestational age of the infant, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks post-conceptual age, total duration of oxygen supplementation, and positive pressure requirements [6]. Long-term BPD survivors may experience persistent airway obstruction and pulmonary hypertension, complicating anaesthetic management.Copyright © Anasth Intensivmed

AB  - We studied the role of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in our established model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) induced by intrauterine hypoxia in the rat. First, we found that intrauterine hypoxia can reduce the number of MSCs in lungs and bone marrow of rat neonates, whereas the administration of granulocyte colony-stim-ulating factor or busulfan to either motivate or inhibit bone marrow MSCs to lungs altered lung development. Next, in vivo experiments, we confirmed that intrauterine hypoxia also impaired bone marrow MSC proliferation and decreased cell cycling activity. In vitro, by using the cultured bone marrow MSCs, the proliferation and the cell cycling activity of MSCs were also reduced when N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) was used as an NMDA receptor (NMDAR) agonist. When MK-801 or memantine as NMDAR antagonists in vitro or in vivo was used, the reduction of cell cycling activity and proliferation were partially reversed. Furthermore, we found that intrauterine hypoxia could enhance the concentration of glutamate, an amino acid that can activate NMDAR, in the bone marrow of neonates. Finally, we confirmed that the increased concentration of TNF-a in the bone marrow of neonatal rats after intrauterine hypoxia induced the release of glutamate and reduced the cell cycling activity of MSCs, and the latter could be partially reversed by MK-801. In summary, intrauterine hypoxia could decrease the number of bone marrow MSCs that could affect lung development and lung function through excessive activation of NMDAR that is partially caused by TNF-a.Copyright © 2019 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - We measured the serial changes in N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in a 6-month-old male infant with chronic lung disease (CLD) complicated by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The patient was born at the 24th week of gestation weighing 695 g. At 1 month after birth, an echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of CLD with PAH. He was treated with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and oral sildenafil and discharged from the hospital. At 190 days of age, the patient was readmitted to our department because of a viral upper respiratory infection. At 195 days of age, his respiratory condition worsened with pulmonary edema and his NT-proBNP level was determined to be 10,117 pg/mL. The patient was immediately administered iNO, and his respiratory condition improved, and NT-proBNP levels decreased. However, he experienced repeated severe cyanosis attacks. Before the attacks, his NT-proBNP level was > 1,000 pg/mL. Therefore, we continuously administered iNO until his NT-proBNP level decreased to < 1,000 pg/mL. We safely discontinued iNO administration at 473 days of age. In conclusion, serial change in NT-proBNP is a surrogate marker with prognostic value in patients with PAH associated with CLD.Copyright © 2019 Thieme Medical Publishers Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) models are essential for better understanding and impacting on long-term pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological sequelae of this chronic disease. Only few experimental studies have systematically compared structural alterations with lung function measurements. Method(s): In three separate and consecutive series, Sprague-Dawley infant rats were exposed from day of life (DOL) 1 to 19 to either room air (0.21; controls) or to fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. Our primary outcome parameters were histopathologic analyses of heart, lungs, and respiratory system mechanics, assessed via image analysis tools and the forced oscillation technique, respectively. Result(s): Exposure to FiO2 of 0.8 and 1.0 resulted in significantly lower body weights and elevated coefficients of lung tissue damping (G) and elastance (H) when compared with controls. Hysteresivity (eta) was lower due to a more pronounced increase of H when compared with G. A positive structure-function relation was demonstrated between H and the lung parenchymal content of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) under hyperoxic conditions. Moreover, histology and morphometric analyses revealed alveolar simplification, fewer pulmonary arterioles, increased alpha-SMA content in pulmonary vessels, and right heart hypertrophy following hyperoxia. Also, in comparison to controls, hyperoxia resulted in significantly lower plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Lastly, rats in hyperoxia showed hyperactive and a more explorative behaviour. Conclusion(s): Our in vivo infant rat model mimics clinical key features of BPD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BPD rat model demonstrating an association between lung structure and function. Moreover, we provide additional evidence that infant rats subjected to hyperoxia develop rarefaction of pulmonary vessels, augmented vascular alpha-SMA, and adaptive cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, our model provides a clinically relevant tool to further investigate diseases related to O2 toxicity and to evaluate novel pharmacological treatment strategies.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease most commonly seen in premature infants who require mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. Despite advances in neonatal care resulting in improved survival and decreased morbidity, limited progress has been made in reducing rates of BPD. Therapeutic options to protect the vulnerable developing lung are limited as are strategies to treat lung injury, resulting in ongoing concerns for long-term pulmonary morbidity after preterm birth. Lung protective strategies and optimal nutrition are recognized to improve pulmonary outcomes. However, characterization of late outcomes is challenged by rapid advances in neonatal care. As a result, current adult survivors reflect outdated medical practices. Although neonatal pulmonary disease tends to improve with growth, compromised respiratory health has been documented in young adult survivors of BPD. With improved survival of premature infants but limited progress in reducing rates of disease, BPD represents a growing burden on health care systems.Copyright © SLACK Incorporated.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of bovine lung phospholipid and poractant alfa injections in the treatment of neonatal hyaline membrane disease with continuous positive airway pressure. Method(s): A total of 136 newborns with neonatal hyaline membrane disease were selected as research objects and were analyzed, retrospectively. The newborns were divided into group A (66 newborns treated with bovine lung phospholipid injections combined with continuous positive airway pressure) and group B (70 newborns treated with poractant alfa injections combined with continuous positive airway pressure), with different treatment methods for each group. The two groups were compared regarding arterial blood gases (PH value, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), artery partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)), vital signs (respiratory, heart rate, mean blood pressure, and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), before treatment, at 12 hours and 24 hours after treatment, complications (infection, pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy, and brain injury), hospitalization time, treatment cost, and survival. Result(s): Clinical data of the newborns and pregnant women between the two groups showed no statistical differences (all P>0.05). The two groups showed no differences in respiration, heart rate, mean blood pressure, and SpO2 before treatment and 24 hours after treatment (all P>0.05). At 12 hours after treatment, the two groups showed no differences in heart rate and mean blood pressure (both P>0.05), while group B showed significantly higher respiratory frequency and SpO2% than group A (P=0.002, P=0.001). Before treatment and at 24 hours after treatment, group A and group B showed no statistical differences in PH value, PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (all P>0.05), while group A showed a significantly lower PH value than the normal value. At 12 hours after treatment, compared with group B, group A showed a significant increase in PH value and PaO2/FiO2, while showing significant lower PaCO2 and PEEP (all P<0.05). Compared with group B, group A showed a significant increase in incidence of complications, which was statistically significant (P=0.001). Compared with group A, group B showed a significant decrease in hospitalization time and treatment costs (P=0.037, P=0.041). Finally, a K-M survival curve was drawn based on 6 months of follow-up. It showed that group A and group B had no statistical differences in survival (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Bovine lung phospholipid and poractant alfa injections showed few efficacy differences. However, poractant alfa injections have greater application value and are worthy of clinical promotion, due to advantages in safety, hospitalization time, and treatment costs.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most devastating conditions in premature babies; meanwhile, keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) plays a key role in lung development. The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic effects of recombinant human KGF-2 (rhKGF-2) in a hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model and explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Method(s): A total of 75 newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were assigned to 5 groups, including normoxia control, normoxia+rhKGF2, BPD (no treatment), BPD+saline (NS) and BPD+rhKGF2 groups (n=15/group). For treatment, rats were intratracheally administered rhKGF2 (5 mg/ kg) or equal volume of saline, and sacrificed 2 weeks later. Weights and wet-to-dry weight ratio ((W/D), an indicator of lung edema) values of lung specimens were measured. Then, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) levels were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) samples. Next, lung tissue specimens were assessed by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry (VEGFa and NF-kappaB p65), quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR; surfactant protein C or SPC) and immunoblotting (VEGFa, NF-kappaB p65 and p-p65). Result(s): In the hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model, rhKGF-2 promoted lung growth and development, and reduced pulmonary edema. Treatment with rhKGF-2 resulted in reduced BALF levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased SPC mRNA levels and VEGF protein expression in the lung, and slightly decreased lung NF-kappaB p65 nuclear expression and phosphorylation. Conclusion(s): rhKGF-2 alleviates hyperoxia-induced BPD, likely through reduced inflammation and induction of SPC.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is an important clinical problem for premature infants. Previously, some biomarkers associated with severity of BPD have been studied. In our study, we aimed to investigate the value of interleukin-33 (IL-33) levels as a new biomarker in the follow-up of BPD severity and response to treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Premature infants of <32 weeks of gestational age and birth weight <1,500 g were included in the study. Infants with BPD were divided into moderate and severe BPD groups. Infants without BPD were assigned as the control group. Cord blood samples were taken from both groups immediately after birth. In addition, blood samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis of BPD and after the end of hydrocortisone (HC) treatment to measure IL-33 values in the serum. Result(s): During the study period, a total of 192 infants were eligible: 96 infants in the BPD group and 96 in the control group. Cord IL-33 values were similar between control (1.29 +/- 0.68 pg/mL) and BPD (moderate/severe) (1.31 +/- 0.84 pg/mL) groups (P = 0.813). The levels of IL-33 were higher in BPD group (3.43 +/- 0.98 pg/mL) than in the control group (0.98 +/- 0.51 pg/mL) (P < 0.001). IL-33 values decreased significantly after HC treatment (pretreatment: 3.43 +/- 0.98 pg/mL versus post-treatment: 2.97 +/- 0.28 pg/mL) (P < 0.001). In addition, IL-33 levels were significantly higher in severe BPD (3.91 +/- 1.22 pg/mL) than in moderate BPD (2.82 +/- 0.74) group (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Although the IL-33 level was not predictive of the development of BPD immediately after birth, it may be used as a new biomarker to diagnose, monitor, and follow the response to treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory lung disease of premature infants, with serious short- and long-term consequences. Early identification of premature infants at risk of BPD is critical to preventing the pathogenesis of disease. Thus, in the present study, we recruited 126 premature infants, collected peripheral blood samples at different time points during early life, and measured the concentration of Th1 (MCP-1, IP-10, and MIG) and Th2 (eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, and MCP-4) chemokines in serum. We found serum eotaxin-2 levels were significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group on day 1 [1662 pg/ml vs. 1221 pg/ml, P < 0.05], day 7 [1533 pg/ml vs. 1089 pg/ml, P < 0.05], and day 14 [1246 pg/ml vs. 704 pg/ml, P < 0.05] after birth, and serum MCP-4 levels were also significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group on day 1 [186 pg/ml vs. 128 pg/ml, P < 0.05], day 7 [199 pg/ml vs. 101 pg/ml, P < 0.05], and day 14 [238 pg/ml vs. 106 pg/ml, P < 0.05] of life. Conclusion(s): Increased levels of Th2 chemokines, eotaxin-2, and MCP-4, are associated with BPD in premature infants.What is Known:* The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and it is difficult to predict and prevent.* Previous studies have demonstrated that inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of BPD.What is New:* Increased Th2 chemokines, eotaxin-2 and MCP-4, were associated with BPD in premature infants.* Abnormal Th1/Th2 response in early life maybe associated with the subsequent development of BPD, which provide a new insight to understand the pathogenesis of the disease.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a significant pulmonary complication for preterm infants, but the mechanisms associated with altered lung development remain poorly understood. Our mouse model of perinatal inflammation mimics the pathophysiology observed in infants with severe BPD. We have previously reported decreased pulmonary miR-29b and miR~17-92 cluster expression and increased global DNA methylation. These studies tested the hypothesis that histone methylation may also be responsible for the lung pathophysiology observed in this model. First, we investigated protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)-mediated changes in H4R3me2 (symmetrical and asymmetrical). Second, we explored lysine methylation, specifically H3K4me3, H3K9me2, and H3K27me3. Methods Pregnant C3H/HeN mice received an intraperitoneal LPS injection on E16 and newborn pups were exposed in 85% oxygen from birth to 14 days of life. On postnatal day 14 or 28, mouse lung tissues were harvested. Tissue homogenates were analyzed by western blot for PRMT-1, PRMT-5, and H4R3me2 symmetrical and asymmetrical and by ELISA for H3K4me3 , H3K9me2, and H3K27me3 (Epigentek). Results Perinatal inflammation resulted in decreased expression of PRMT-1 (1.0 v 0.45 arbitrary units, p<0.0001) and PRMT-5 (1.0 v 0.48 arbitrary units, p=0.02) which corresponded to decreases in H4R3me2 symmetrical methylation (1.3 v 0.39 arbitrary units, p=0.04). H3K9me2 (39.8 vs 25.0 ug/mL, p=0.03) and H3K4me3 (41.1 vs 30.3 ug/mL, p<0.05) were also decreased in the exposed group while H3K27me3 was not significant. Conclusion Our data suggest that maternal inflammation combined with neonatal hyperoxia influences expression of proteins involved in histone methylation and alters specific histone methylation marks. Further investigations will explore expression of histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases. Overall the changes observed suggest a disruption in chromatin structure which may be responsible for altered gene expression in this model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) results from alveolar simplification and abnormal development of alveolar and capillary structure. Survivors of BPD display persistent deficits in airflow and membrane and vascular components of alveolar gas diffusion. Despite being the defining feature of BPD, various neonatal hyperoxia models of BPD have not routinely assessed pulmonary gas diffusion., METHODS: To simulate the most commonly-utilized neonatal hyperoxia models, we exposed neonatal mice to room air or >=90% hyperoxia during key stages of distal lung development: through the first 4 (saccular), 7 (early alveolar), or 14 (bulk alveolar) postnatal days, followed by a period of recovery in room air until 8 weeks of age when alveolar septation is essentially complete. We systematically assessed and correlated the effects of neonatal hyperoxia on the degree of alveolar-capillary structural and functional impairment. We hypothesized that the degree of alveolar-capillary simplification would correlate strongly with worsening diffusion impairment., RESULTS: Neonatal hyperoxia exposure, of any duration, resulted in alveolar simplification and impaired pulmonary gas diffusion. Mean Linear Intercept increased in proportion to the length of hyperoxia exposure while alveolar and total lung volume increased markedly only with prolonged exposure. Surprisingly, despite having a similar effect on alveolar surface area, only prolonged hyperoxia for 14 days resulted in reduced pulmonary microvascular volume. Estimates of alveolar and capillary structure, in general, correlated poorly with assessment of gas diffusion., CONCLUSION: Our results help define the physiological and structural consequences of commonly-employed neonatal hyperoxia models of BPD and inform their clinical utility.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of premature infants. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops in 25-40% of BPD patients, contributing to morbidity and mortality. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator and apoptotic mediator made in the pulmonary endothelium by nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous competitive NOS inhibitor. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) hydrolyzes ADMA and DDAH1 is the most important for ADMA metabolism in vivo. Translational studies from our group have identified DDAH1 single nucleotide polymorphisms that are differentially expressed in BPD-PH patients compared to BPD patients. We hypothesized that inhibiting DDAH1 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVECs) will lead to decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) via effects in hPMVECs. We utilized a co-culture model where hPMVECs were transfected with DDAH1 siRNA or scramble for 24h and then incubated in co-culture with hPASMCs for 24h. Analysis included 1) trypan blue exclusion for viable cell numbers and 2) western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 and 8, total caspase-3 and 8, PCNA, and beta-actin. After DDAH1 siRNA transfection of hPMVECs and co-culture with hPASMCs, we found greater hPASMC viable cell numbers compared to scramble hPASMC controls (N=3, p<0.05). After DDAH1 siRNA transfection of hPMVECs and co-culture with hPASMCs, we found lower hPASMC levels of cleaved caspase-3 protein (N=3, p<0.05) and cleaved caspase-8 (N=3, p<0.05), with greater hPASMC protein levels of PCNA (N=3, p<0.05) compared to scramble. DDAH1 siRNA knockdown in hPMVEC results in greater hPASMC proliferation and less cleaved caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. We speculate that DDAH1 is a potential therapeutic target for BPD-PH. We speculate that these findings support the concept that DDAH1 regulates vascular remodeling by minimizing ADMA-inhibition of eNOS, resulting in maintained NO production which would support angiogenesis and prevent/attenuate vascular remodeling. Future studies would include in vivo experiments in transgenic neonatal mice exposed to a BPD-like lung injury.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is seen in diseases associated with hypoxia (WHO classification Group 3), and one of those diseases is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is the most common co-morbidity following preterm birth, and the incidence is as high as 100% in babies born at 22 weeks' gestation. There are currently no available preventative or curative therapies for PH associated with BPD. Vascular remodeling is a hallmark of PH diseases including that seen with BPD. The proliferation of pulmonary endothelial cells, as well as release of pro-proliferative substances from endothelial cells that can induce vascular smooth muscle cells to proliferate, are central to the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling in PH. We have previously shown that human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) respond to hypoxia by proliferating. We have also shown that hypoxia-induced proliferation depends on epidermal growth factor (EGF) release resulting in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor proteins, of which there are 4 described and EGFR is also known as ErbB1. We have recently shown that hPMVEC express ErbB2 and ErbB4, but that ErbB3 mRNA and protein are absent in hPMVEC. We hypothesized that hypoxia would also regulate ErbB2 and ErbB4 expression levels in hPMVEC We used standard western blotting techniques to identify ErbB2 and ErbB4 protein levels in fetal hPMVEC incubated in normoxia (21% O2, 5% CO2) or hypoxia (1% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2) at 37degree C for 24 hours. We found that ErbB4 protein levels were similar between normoxic and hypoxic hPMVECs, while ErbB2 protein levels were lower in hypoxic hPMVEC than in normoxic hPMVEC. The absence of change in ErbB4 protein expression levels in hypoxia does not exclude the possibility for alteration in ErbB4 signaling in hypoxia. To begin to explore the role of ErbB4 signaling in hypoxia we determined if the ErbB4 ligand neuregulin-4 would increase protein levels of ErbB4 in hPMVEC and we found that in normoxic hPMVEC addition of neuregulin-4 increased protein levels of ErbB4. To determine if ErbB4 siRNA would knockdown ErbB4 specifically, i.e. without affecting ErbB1 or ErbB2 protein levels, we used an siRNA approach. Results show notable decreased protein expression level of ErbB4 exposed to siRNA as compared to cells exposed to scramble controls, but no notable changes in the expression levels of ErbB2 protein. We speculate that ErbB4 is involved in the hypoxic response of hPMVEC to hypoxia and may represent a potential novel therapeutic target for pulmonary hypertensive disorders associated with hypoxia.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common co-morbidity following preterm birth and is due to neonatal exposure to mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen. Neonatal mice placed in hyperoxia (85% oxygen) on post-natal day 1 (P1) develop histological evidence of lung injury and abnormal lung development manifest by fewer and larger alveoli, otherwise termed alveolar simplification, that is reminiscent of BPD in humans. We have found in adult models of lung injury that arginase 2 induction is involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury. We tested the hypothesis that neonatal mice deficient in the Arginase 2 gene (Arg2) would have attenuated alveolar simplification. Time-dated pregnant Arg2 deficient mice (Arg2-/-) on a C57BL/6 background and C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice were used in these studies. Neonatal mice were placed in either room air (normoxia) or 85% oxygen (hyperoxia) by placing their cages in a Plexiglas chamber and flowing either room air or 85% oxygen through the chamber at 10 lpm. Dams were rotated daily between a normoxic litter and a hyperoxic litter to prevent oxygen toxicity in the dam. There were 4 experimental groups, wild-type normoxia, wild-type hyperoxia, Arg2-/-normoxia, and Arg2-/-hyperoxia. After 1, 7 or 14 days the neonatal animals were euthanized and the lungs were inflation-fixed for H&E staining and determination of alveolar area, perimeter and number using automated software. After 1 day in hyperoxia, there were no differences between any of the four groups in terms of alveolar area (size) or alveolar number. After 7 days in hyperoxia, wild-type mice had a substantially greater mean alveolar area than did normoxic wild-type mice (1135+/-41 mum vs 465+/-17 mum, p<0.001). While there was no difference in normoxic wild-type or normoxic Arg2-/-mice, hyperoxic Arg2-/-mice had significantly lower mean alveolar area (856+/-45 Mm) than did hyperoxic wild-type mice (p<0.001). Similar differences in alveolar perimeter were seen between the groups, i.e. hyperoxic wild-type mice had the greatest perimeter, hyperoxic Arg2-/- were significantly lower than hyperoxic wild-type but not as low as normoxic-exposed animals. Furthermore, hyperoxic wild-type mice had substantially lower mean alveolar numbers than did normoxic wild-type mice (35+/-2 vs 89+/-3, p<0.001). There was no difference between normoxic wild-type mice and normoxic Arg2-/-mice in mean alveolar number. Hyperoxic Arg2-/- mice had significantly more alveoli (50+/-2) than did hyperoxic wild-type mice (p<0.001). These differences in alveolar area, perimeter, and number seen at 7 days remained at 14 days. Taken together these data demonstrate that deficiency of Arg2 attenuates the alveolar simplification caused by exposing neonatal mice to hyperoxia.

AB  - Background Previous reports have identified decreases in miR-29b levels in preterm infants that go on to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The cause of depressed miR-29b levels is unknown but may reflect an adverse maternal and/or intrauterine environment that led to preterm birth. This study was designed to investigate relationships between antenatal circumstances related to preterm birth and cord blood levels of miR29b. Methods We analyzed 127 cord blood collected from consecutive deliveries (n=114) of liveborn infants born <=30 weeks gestation (median 27.4 weeks: IQR [25.6-29.0]). Data on maternal co-morbidities, antecendants to preterm birth (e.g., preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental inflammation) were collected prospectively. miR-29b levels were measured using RT-PCR and normalized to expression of SP2. Data were analyzed for correlations by Spearman's correlation coefficient or Generalizing Estimating Equations (GEE) for mixed models controlling for twins. Results Preliminary results indicate that miR-29b levels were correlated to umbilical funisitis (p=0.038). Regression analysis revealed miR-29b is associated with intrauterine growth retardation (p=0.011) and pre-term labor (p=0.007). Conclusions miR-29b levels are associated with fetal inflammation and poor fetal growth. Maternal health is also related to fetal inflammation and further analyses of the clinical data is likely to reveal new correlations.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by an arrest in lung development with severe impairment of alveolar septation and vascular development. Premature male neonates are at a greater risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. Neonatal female mice have improved alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development compared to male littermates in a murine model of BPD. Analysis of the pulmonary transcriptome suggests that miR-30a, may modulate these sex-specific differences in gene expression. HIF-1alpha plays an important role in post-natal lung development, especially in recovery from hyperoxic injury and acute lung injury. We hypothesized that differential sex-specific expression of miR-30a is mediated through HIF-1a. Methods Male and female neonatal WT (C57BL6) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (P1-P5; saccular stage of lung development) and euthanized on P7 or P21 after recovery in normoxia. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs; from 18-24 weeks gestation donors; 3 male and 3 female) were obtained from ScienCell (Carlsbad, California). They were cultured in endothelial cell media per protocol. Cells from passage from 3 to 6 were used for experiments. For hyperoxic exposure, cells were incubated in 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 degreeC for upto 72 hours. Cells in normoxia were maintained in air and 5% CO2. miR-30a and Dll4 (miR-30a target) expression was measured. Hif-1a binding to its targets genes (by ChIP-qPCR) and expression was measured in vivo. To further establish potential regulation of miR-30a by Hif-1a, miR-30a expression after Hif-1 a inhibition was measured in neonatal HPMECs. Results Expression of miR-30a was increased and Dll4 decreased on PND21 in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal female mice compared to males. On PND21, hyperoxia-exposed female mice showed a significant increase in Hif-1a binding to target genes compared to room air controls and hyperoxia-exposed male mice. In contrast to male mice, females did not show a decrease in Hif-1a expression at PND21 after early hyperoxia exposure and this was accompanied by a significant decrease in Phd2 expression in female mice, which metabolizes Hif-1a. Motif analysis revealed a hypoxia response element (HRE) [AG]CGTG site 428 base pairs upstream of miR-30a. siRNA mediated loss of Hif-1a expression in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells decreased miR-30a and increased Dll4 mRNA and protein expression. Conclusions Hif-1a mediated differential sex-specific miR-30a expression may contribute to protection from hyperoxic lung injury in female neonatal mice and contribute to the sex-specific differences seen in BPD.

AB  - Background: The homozygous EGFR mutation is associated with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease type 2. So far only a hand few of cases have been reported. Case Report: Preterm female infant, born at 28 weeks of gestation via emergency cesarean due to non-reassuring fetal status, weighing 650 grams. Her Apgar score was 4/7/7. She was intubated in the delivery room and transferred to the NICU. On physical examination she had several malformations (sparse scalp hair, craniofacial abnormalities, thin and long limbs, arachnodactyly, absence of subcutaneous fat, arthrogryposis) and a very fragile skin with extensive erythema. While in the NICU she required continuous mechanical ventilation due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. She presented with recurrent infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia requiring multiple courses of antibiotics and transfusions. Echocardiography revealed a severe congenital heart disease with ventricular disproportion with hypoplastic left ventricle, severe aortic arch hypoplasia, complete atrioventricular septal defect and a patent ductus arteriosus. She developed persistent hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and severe hypomagnesemia requiring frequent replacement therapy. Cranial ultrasounds showed tetraventricular hydrocephalus with severe periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions, cerebellum atrophy and a mega cisterna magna. Genetic testing identified the c.1283G-A, p.(Gly428Asp) mutation in homozygosity, in exon 11 of the EGFR gene. At 3 months of post-menstrual age the infant died of progressive cardiac failure, despite optimization of medical therapy. Conclusion(s): Homozygous EGFR mutation is associated with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease type 2 which presents with a complex and severe phenotype and overall bad prognosis, with no reports of successful therapy. The inheritance of this disease seems to be autosomal recessive, and thus consanguinity is a high risk factor. With this case we expect to help characterizing this extremely rare syndrome. Neonatologists and pediatricians should consider EGFR mutation in neonates presenting with inflammatory skin disease from birth.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity suffered by surviving preterm infants and is associated with adverse pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of BPD. An influx of inflammatory cells and neutrophil-derived chemokines has been implicated in the development of BPD. A competitive CXCR2 receptor antagonist reduces neutrophil activation and influx into tissues. Objective(s): To evaluate the effects of a CXCR2 antagonist on reducing postnatal systemic inflammation and consequently developing BPD in rat model. Method(s): Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) was administered to the amniotic fluid on E20, which corresponds to the late canalicular stage of rat lung development. LPS and a CXCR2 receptor antagonist were administered intraperitoneally on P1, P3, and P5, which correspond to the saccular and early alveolar stages. On P7 and P14, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from the rat pups. To assess alveolar development, four random, non-overlapping fields per animal in two distal lung sections were studied at 100X magnification. Result(s): Early postnatal LPS administration significantly increased neutrophil counts in BALF and PB and disrupted alveolar development, whereas prenatal LPS alone did not. The CXCR2 antagonist significantly attenuated neutrophil increases in BALF and PB and restored alveolar development in the rat pups exposed to early ponstnatal LPS. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that a CXCR2 receptor antagonist restores alveolar development by alleviating pulmonary and systemic inflammation induced by early postnatal LPS.

AB  - Background: As survival of preterminfants increases, greater attention is being paid to improving the quality of health in survivors. Unfortunately, despite advances in neonatal respiratory care, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a significant cause of morbidity in the ex-preterm population. Consequently, there remains interest in developing strategies to reduce BPD incidence. Objective(s): To identify clinical and demographic features associated with reduced incidence of BPD Methods: This was a retrospective audit conducted between 2010-18 at a tertiary surgical neonatal unit at St George's Hospital, London, UK. Data were extracted from a database of infants born at 32/40 gestation at St George's Hospital. Information was collected on demography, clinical characteristics at birth, and respiratory clinical data. Significant BPD is defined as a need for supplemental oxygen or respiratory support at 36/40 corrected gestational age, in a baby born at 32/40 gestational age (as per National Neonatal Audit Programme definition). Result(s): 396 infants were identified as having been born at 32/40 gestational age in the study period. 59% of the cohort met the definition for significant BPD. Incidence of significant BPD was seen to vary inversely with gestational age and birthweight. An association was seen between delayed extubation, and subsequent development of significant BPD. First extubation attempt beyond 24 hours was associated with an increased risk of developing BPD compared to when extubation was attempted within 24 hours (61% incidence vs. 18%, OR=7.1 [95%CI 4.5-11.4, p0.0001); first extubation attempt beyond one week was associated with a further increased risk of BPD development, compared to extubation attempted within the first week (96% vs. 49%, OR=27 [95%CI 6.4-114.8, p0.0001]. Conclusion(s): These data show an association between early extubation, and survival without development of significant BPD. Assessment of strategies to encourage early extubation may demonstrate a causative nature to this relationship, and reduce significant BPD incidence.

AB  - Background: Less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) has become an increasingly used intervention in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in neonates [1]. Previous reports and meta-reviews document positive outcomes in the avoidance of mechanical ventilation as well as reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia [2,3]. During the last few years video laryngoscopes have become available for neonatal practice. The use of video assisted visualisation of the vocal cords makes application of surfactant via LISA easy and safe. Objective(s): We report 15 babies who received surfactant using LISA in combinationwith video laryngoscopy in a District General Hospital in the UK between March and December 2018. Method(s): Babies had a mean gestational age of 34weeks, with a range of 31 to 39 weeks. Indication for the administration of surfactant was increasing oxygen requirement, clinical impression of respiratory distress and rising capillary CO2 levels. All babies tolerated the procedure well with improvement in oxygen requirement, clinical assessment of respiratory distress and capillary CO2. There were no significant adverse effects. 3 babies were given atropine following procedure induced mild bradycardia. None of the babies were sedated. Conclusion(s): Our experience with delivering surfactant using LISA assisted by video laryngoscopy has been very positive. The use of a video laryngoscope allows less experienced operators to visualise the vocal cords safely under supervision [4]. This has a positive impact on the team as well as a valuable learning benefit. 6 out of 7 doctors performing the procedure felt that the video laryngoscope had improved their confidence and allowed the procedure to be performed less invasive compared to routine laryngoscopy techniques.

AB  - Objectives: Inflammation has a key role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and treatment of these diseases targets the suppression of inflammation. Measurement of inflammation is important in evaluating treatment efficacy. There are studies suggesting that the increase in serum chitinase and chitinase-like proteins may be used as a marker of inflammation in diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In our study, we aimed to determine whether serum levels of chitotriosidase, a chitinase-like protein were effective in indicating the presence of chronic inflammation in CF and BPD patients. Method(s): Eight C F, 21 BPD and 20 healthy controls were included in the study. Demographic findings and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin (ALB), CRP/ALB and chitotriozidase levels of children in the groups were compared. Result(s): The median body weight and height values of the patients followed with BPD were lower than those of the other two groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of serum median CRP, ALB, CRP/ALB and chitotriosidase levels. Conclusion(s): The results of the study did not support that serum chitotriosidase level is effective in detecting inflammation in patients with CF and BPD. Absence of difference between groups in terms of serum CRP levels and CRP/ALB ratios may indicate the absence of inflammation in CF and BPD patients. Further studies with more patients are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caffeine is widely used to manage apnea of prematurity, and reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Deregulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling underlies arrested postnatal lung maturation in BPD. It is unclear whether caffeine impacts TGF-beta signaling or postnatal lung development in affected lungs., METHODS: The impact of caffeine on TGF-beta signaling in primary mouse lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II cells was assessed in vitro. The effects of caffeine administration (25 mg/kg/d for the first 14 d of postnatal life) on aberrant lung development and TGF-beta signaling in vivo was assessed in a hyperoxia (85% O2)-based model of BPD in C57BL/6 mice., RESULTS: Caffeine downregulated expression of type I and type III TGF-beta receptors, and Smad2; and potentiated TGF-beta signaling in vitro. In vivo, caffeine administration normalized body mass under hyperoxic conditions, and normalized Smad2 phosphorylation detected in lung homogenates; however, caffeine administration neither improved nor worsened lung structure in hyperoxia-exposed mice, in which postnatal lung maturation was blunted., CONCLUSION: Caffeine modulated TGF-beta signaling in vitro and in vivo. Caffeine administration was well-tolerated by newborn mice, but did not influence the course of blunted postnatal lung maturation in a hyperoxia-based experimental mouse model of BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease associated with preterm birth. Our objective was to investigate whether the TNF, IL1B, IL6 genes polymorphisms have influence on BPD susceptibility. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 351 neonates with gestation period less than 32 weeks. Genotyping of IL1B-511 G/A, IL6-174 G/C and TNF-308 G/A variants was performed by Real-time PCR. The statistical differences in genotypes distribution among the groups were compared using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. Result(s): BPD was present in 36 neonates (11.43%). There were no significant differences in the genotypes distribution and allele frequencies for the IL1B and IL6 genes variants between neonates with and without BPD. The frequencies of TNF genotypes were GG 55.6%, GA 38.9% and AA 5.6% in neonates with BPD and GG 79.7%, GA 19.7% and AA 0.6% in neonates without BPD. TNF genotypes frequencies between these groups were statistically significantly different (p=0.001). Also, statistically significant difference was observed in TNF genotypes distribution between neonates with BPD and without BPD by dominant model (GG vs. GA/AA) (p=0.001; RR=2.188, 95% CI 1.428-3.348; OR=3.138, 95% CI 1.539-6.397). After the adjustment for BMW, gestational age, and sepsis, logistic regression confirmed statistically significant association between TNF-308G/A genotypes and development of BPD in premature infants (B=-0.992, p=0.003). TNF-308 A allele is risk factor for BPD (p=0.0007). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that TNF-308 A allele is a risk factor for development of BPD in premature neonates under the 32 weeks.

AB  - Introduction. The urgency of the problem of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants in our country is associated with the transition of the Republic of Uzbekistan to world standards for live births. Despite a significant number of studies on the genesis of BPD in newborns, the role of the mechanism of damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier is not well studied. In violation of the integrity of the lung tissue and the formation of pathology, much attention is paid to pneumoproteins. Pneumoproteins are specific proteins of the epithelium of the lungs, of which the less studied are the surfactant protein D (SPD) and the secretory protein of Clara cells (PCC). Purpose(s): To study the prognostic value of pneumoproteins in preterm infants with respiratory disorders in the development of BPD. Materials and methods. Sixty-six preterm infants with a gestational age of 28.9 +/- 1.6 weeks, with a bodyweight of 1002.4 +/- 55.67 g and a body length of 39.6 +/- 2.2 cm. were examined. Used clinical and instrumental diagnostics, studied the content of surfactant protein D and protein of Clara cells by IFA, using a set of reagents from Biovendor (the Czech Republic). Result(s): As a result of the studies, it was found that the condition of newborns at birth was severe. The degree of respiratory failure at birth was evaluated according to the Silverman-Andersen scale, while the respiratory failure of the I and II degree was observed in 38.8%, and III degree in 67.5% of children. In order to stop the symptoms of respiratory failure, all newborns underwent respiratory therapy. The duration of respiratory therapy averaged 24.6 +/- 5.2 days. When studying the content of SPD, depending on the severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), it was noted that the SPD in newborns with RDS I and II degree on the 5-7th day of life were 377.49 +/- 68.4 ng/ml, which is significantly higher than the rate of newborns with RDS III degree which is 198.45 +/- 55.4 ng/ml (p < 0.01). An assessment of the level of PCC in the blood serum of these children showed that in newborns with RDS I and II, the content of this protein was 18.5 +/- 0.87 ng/ml, which is also significantly higher than in newborns with RDS III degree -7.3 +/- 0 74 ng/ml (p < 0.01). By the end of the neonatal period, 12 (18.1%) infants developed BPD. The indices of SPD and PCC for BPD significantly decreased and amounted to 79.8 +/- 2.47 ng/ml and 2.8 +/- 0.57 ng/ml, respectively. Finding(s): Thus, the low content of pneumoproteins indicates damage to the integrity of the alveoli. It should also be noted that this is due to the low functional activity of Clara cells, which are the main protectors of the respiratory tract. The data obtained indicate a decreased synthesis of pneumoproteins, which contributes to the development of BPD and reduces the anti-infection protection of the lungs in premature infants.

AB  - Case report: A 13-month-old female with a past medical history of severe prematurity secondary to maternal placental abruption, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, right hydronephrosis with nephrostomy tube, tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube dependence, grade II intraventricular hemorrhage, who initially presented with several days of fevers, lethargy, and copious watery diarrhea. Vital signs were notable for fevers to 103 and tachycardia to the 220's. Neurology was initially consulted for rhythmic shaking movements of the left upper and lower extremity. The following day, the infant developed an unresponsive state with tonic eye deviation as well as spontaneous direction changing horizontal nystagmus. Neurologic exam was notable for new absence of blink to threat bilaterally and sustained clonus in the feet. Initial laboratory workup was notable for lactic acidosis, hypernatremia 159, WBC 39.9 with 7 bands, BUN 60 and Cre 1.11, consistent with septic hypovolemia. Given persistent fevers an LP was performed showing WBC 1, RBC 0, protein 22, glucose 86, gram stain and culture negative. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for common pathogens including E Coli, Group B strep, Listeria, HSV 1/2, CMV, VZV and enterovirus was negative. Infectious workup for diarrhea was notable for positive stool norovirus PCR and E. Coli from nephrostomy tube. While initial EEG showed bifrontal sharp waves, it rapidly evolved to show high voltage spike and slow wave activity originating from the right occipital cortex corresponding to the left leg movements. Subsequent horizontal nystagmus was found to correlate with multiple runs of left occipito-temporal and bi-hemispheric sharp and slow wave activity, consistent with status epilepticus. MRI brain showed acute diffusion restriction in bilateral white matter tracts with ADC but not FLAIR correlate, with posteriorly predominant leptomeningeal enhancement consistent with encephalitis. The patient was treated with phenobarbital and levetiracetam with stabilization of seizure activity. Norovirus was treated supportively with hydration and UTI with antibiotics. The patient's clinical seizure activity abated, however she remained with decreased interactivity and with loss of blink to threat and toy grabbing behavior concerning for persistent visual deficits. Conclusion(s): We present a case of infantile encephalopathy and status epilepticus with diffuse MRI changes consistent with encephalitis and multifocal status epilepticus in the setting of norovirus gastroenteritis infection. Although a rare complication, neurologists should be in tune to the possibility of norovirus encephalopathy. Routine testing of CSF for norovirus should be commercially developed to further explore this clinical entity.

AB  - Background and aimIn preterm newborns innate and adaptive immunity may be compromised by factors associated with preterm birth, such as pPROM, which is responsible for approximately one third of all preterm deliveries and may present with chorioamnionitis in half cases. The present study was designed to evaluate lymphocyte subsets of all preterm deliveries and to detect possible changes in the neonatal and/or maternal immune system in different clinical conditions.MethodsThe study enrolled 16 women with diagnosed pPROM and 19 preterm babies born between 23rd and 36+6th weeks of gestational age at the Department of Women's and Children's Health of Padua University Hospital vs a control group (11 mothers and 13 newborns). We obtained maternal and neonatal blood samples on a routine assessment in the first 3 days following the delivery, testing lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry (TBNK panel plus some populations involved in T cell maturation and activation), WBC count, IL-6 and CReactive Protein levels. EDTA whole blood and serum samples were analyzed within 24h after sampling. Sample preparation was performed according to the CLSI H42- A2 guideline.ResultsStatistically significant differences in lymphocyte subset distribution between the two newborn groups were detected for: NK cells, na ve helper T cells and memory helper T cells.Preliminary data analysis showed that na ve CD4+ T lymphocytes were lower in preterm babies born from mother with pPROM (p<0.005), while memory CD4+ T lymphocytes were higher in preterm babies born from mother with pPROM (p<0.005). The other lymphocyte populations did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups.There weren t any statistically significant difference in the total WBC count, T and B lymphocytes count between mothers and babies as well as between mothers with diagnosed pPROM and mothers without pPROM. C-Reactive Protein levels were significantly different both between mothers with and without pProm, being lower in the first group compared to the second, and also between newborns and mothers.Na ve CD8+ T lymphocytes were lower in preterm babies born before 28th weeks of gestational respect to preterm babies born after 28th weeks of gestation. Also preterm babies who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia showed a significant decrease of naive CD8+ T lymphocytes.From the comparison between preterm newborns with and without chorioamnionitis and preterm newborns with and without early onset sepsis, we observed an increase both in T helper cells absolute count and in PCR levels.The comparison between vaginal delivery and cesarean section showed statistically significant differences in T helper cells absolute count, CD4/CD8 ratio and leukocytes.Finally, newborns were stratified according to the latency time (period between diagnosis and delivery), considering 4 weeks as cut-off. Between these two groups, we observed a significant difference in T and NK cells distribution.Conclusions In the comparison between mothers and newborns, independently from the maternal pathology, we detected an expected maturational trend with regard to non-MHC restricted cytotoxic T cells, na ve and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes, na ve and terminal effector memory CD8+ T cells, activated (CD3+ CD38+ and CD3+ HLA-DR+) T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells and C-Reactive Protein. In the analysis of newborns with various clinical conditions, the most interesting result is the decrease of na ve and the contemporary increase of memory CD4+ T lymphocytes in pPROM newborns, suggesting a more protracted antigenic stimulation compared to controls. In pPROM newborns, an immune modulation seams to need for a longer latency time to be established. Further investigations are needed to define the role of reduced na ve CD8+ T cells in BPD and increased helper T cells in early onset sepsis.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by attenuated alveolar and vascular development. Supraphysiologic oxygen exposure, though necessary for survival, contributes to the development of BPD in premature infants. The thioredoxin reductase-1 (Txnrd1) inhibitor aurothioglucose (ATG) improves lung development in a murine BPD model. The present studies evaluated the effects of hyperoxia and pharmacologic TXNRD1 inhibition on pulmonary gene expression. Newborn C57B1/6 pups were treated with saline or ATG (25 mg/kg, i.p.) and maintained in room air (21% O2) or hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 72h. Following euthanasia, lungs were either inflation-fixed for H&E staining, or collected for RNA-sequencing. Purified RNA from lung tissue was checked for quality, then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System. Differential expression was calculated with DeSeq, and functional enrichment was identified via ToppFun (ToppGene). Histologically, hyperoxia-exposed lungs exhibited qualitative decreases in branching morphogenesis and increases in macrophage numbers. ATG treatment preserved branching morphogenesis and attenuated macrophage infiltration following hyperoxic exposure. Consistent with visual findings, ATG treatment altered the expression of genes known to regulate angiogenesis and vascularization. Specifically, ATG-dependent alterations were detected for 53 genes, including increases in Apold1 (0.7747-fold), Nfe2 (0.7317-fold), Klf4 (0.5920-fold), SIPR1 (0.5882-fold), and BMP2 (0.5276-fold) expression. These alterations are currently being validated by qRT-PCR. Our data suggest that ATG attenuates hyperoxia-induced alterations in angiogenesis. To further assess these alterations, morphometry and quantitation of vessel density are currently ongoing. These findings support the potential utility of Txnrd1 inhibitors to improve lung development in prematurely born infants.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Introduction: Lung regeneration is essential for damage recovering after lung injury at different age of life. Whether lipofibroblasts (LIF) are able to enhance endogenous alveolar regeneration once alveoli are damaged remains to be determined. Aim(s): To determine in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia if a lipid switch of fibroblasts to LIF induce a curative lung regeneration. Method(s): Wt C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O2) or room air from days 3 to 14 of post-natal life. Rosiglitazone (RGZ), a PPARgamma agonist which activates fibroblasts differentiation into LIF, was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 5mug/g of mice daily, 5 days a week, starting after hyperoxia exposure, until adulthood (D60). Tissues were immunostained with anti-ADRP and anti-proSpC antibodies for LIF and AT2 detection respectively. Number of alveoli were estimated by the mean linear intercept and secondary septation by septal crest number (Weigert). Result(s): Compared to mice exposed to room air, mice exposed to hyperoxia presented a significant decreased number of LIF in lung associated with an arrested alveolar development revealed by a reduced number of alveoli and a concomitant disruption of secondary septation. Compared to hyperoxic, non-treated mice, RGZ administration increased the number of LIF and AT2 cells in the lung, associated with an increase in the number of alveoli and septal crests at adulthood. Conclusion(s): Switching fibroblasts towards LIF through PPARgamma agonist administration induces lung regeneration after hypoalveolization due to post-natal hyperoxia. Administration of PPARgamma agonists can be a new pharmacologic strategy to promote lung recovery after injury.

AB  - Introduction: Clusterin (CLU) is a highly conserved glycoprotein whose gene expression is ubiquitous and attribute to many cellular physiologic functions, including cell to cell interactions, complement inhibition, lipid transportation, cell survival, and apoptosis. We hypothesized that CLU might be important in hyperoxic acute lung injury. Method(s): CLU expression and signaling were determined in airway epithelial cells after in vitro hyperoxia challenge. Using a murine model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, the role of CLU was determined by CLU-deficient mice. CLU and cell death were detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, ELISA and western blotting. Result(s): Increased CLU expression was observed in tracheal aspirates from babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death. After hyperoxic exposure, CLU-/- mice exhibited more acute lung injury and activation of apoptotic cascades compared with wild-type mice. Further, hyperoxic conditions were a major stimulus for increased CLU expression and apoptosis in cultured human airway epithelial cells. We also observed that CLU overexpression attenuated hyperoxia-induced apoptosis in human airway epithelial cells. Conclusion(s): CLU has a significant protective role against pulmonary hyperoxic injury and their expression is related to the cell survival or protection of oxidant injury and cell death.

AB  - Introduction: Oxygen therapy is common in premature neonates and adult patients with chronic lung diseases. Although the effects of hyperoxia in the adult lung remain unclear, in neonates it can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The distinct and common effects of hyperoxia on the neonatal and adult lung are yet to be explored. We aimed to determine these effects in healthy neonatal (HN) and adult (HA) mouse lungs. Method(s): In vivo, P5-7 and 82-week adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia(FiO2=0.4) or room air(RA, FiO2=0.21) for 2 and 8h(n=4/group). RNA extracted from lungs was isolated and hybridized in Mouse Whole Genome Arrays. A post-hoc of 109 oxidative stress response (OSR) genes was done. Statistical significance for differentially expressed genes (DEG) between groups was set at False Discovery Rate 0.05 based on t-tests. Result(s): Compared to RA mice, 19 distinct DEG in HN and 82 in HA mice were found, with most changes occurring at 8h (HN 14DEG; HA 80DEG). Contrary to HN, O2 induced downregulation (62DEG at 2h, 66 at 8h) in HA at 2h and 8h. OSR gene analysis, showed greater regulation in HN than in HA(66 vs 48 genes) at 2 and 8h. In addition, we found that in HN, O2 evoked marked upregulation of glutathione peroxidases like GPX2, 3 and GSTP1, and other OR genes i.e. PRDX5, APOE, SQSTM1. In contrast, only HSPA1A and SOD2 were distinctly regulated in HA. Conclusion(s): In HA, O2 induces regulation of more genes than in HN. However, among OSR genes, HN exhibited more transcriptomic changes. A greater response in HN could be driven by an increased susceptibility of the immature lung to hyperoxia. Moreover, the distinct signatures in HN and HA point to differential age-dependent effects of hyperoxia.

AB  - Introduction: Childhood interstitial lung diseases (chILD) are heterogeneous group of lung diseases which are very rare in childhood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate patients who were referred to a tertiary pediatric pulmonology department with the suspicion of chILD. Method(s): The data of children with chILD in the pediatric pulmonology department between 2007-2018 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients' age, gender, complaints and diagnosis were noted. Patients' diagnosis were categorized into Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease categories and subcategories. Result(s): Between 2007-2018, 5965 patients were evaluated in the pediatric pulmonology department; 354 (5.9 %) of them were referred with the suspicion of chILD. The mean age of the patients was 7.3 +/- 6.1 years. The most common complaints were respiratory distress, shortness of breath and coughing. Two hundred and thirty-one (65.2 %) of the patients were diagnosed with ILD. The most common diagnosis of chILD were bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiolitis obliterans, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia. The chILD related with systemic diseases were most commonly detected with malignancy. The most rare chILD subcategories were included surfactant dysfunction disorders (ABCA3, SFTPC mutations) and Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI). Conclusion(s): Patients with chILD are evaluated in a wide spectrum according to age of diagnosis, symptoms, underlying diseases or radiological findings. It is important for clinicians to keep in mind chILD in terms of early diagnosis and possible treatments in children with dyspnea, pulmonary infiltration, hypoxia or restrictive disorder in pulmonary function tests.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by impaired alveolarization and regeneration. Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor regulating cell homeostasis and pluripotency, is highly expressed in human and mice during lung development and linked to lung growth arrest. Aim(s): To study (1) if hyperoxia-induced lung injury reduces Klf4 in ATII cells in mice; (2) if ATII-specific loss of Klf4 depletes number of ATII cells; (3) the function of Klf4 in ATII cells in vitro. Method(s): (1) Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 (HYX) or room air (NOX). (2) Cell-specific deletion of Klf4 was induced in mice during late lung development. (3) Overexpression (Klf4OE) and ablation of Klf4 (Klf4del; CRISPR/Cas9) in murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12). Result(s): (1) Dual immunofluorescent staining determined Klf4 in ATII cells during late murine lung development and in epithelial cells in the human fetal lung. Reduced ATII markers after HYX were linked to reduced Klf4 expression and lung growth. (2) ATII-specific Klf4 ablation during late lung development reduced ATII cells in mice. (3) In MLE-12, HYX decreased Klf4 expression and cell survival. Klf4OE and Klf4del in MLE-12 induced apoptosis and decreased epithelial cell markers. Klf4OE aggravated HYX-related decreased proliferation, activated Smad2 and blocked Stat3 signaling. Inhibition of Smad2, using an inhibitor, activated Stat3. Klf4del activated Stat3 and inhibited Smad2. Conclusion(s): We identified a novel Klf4-Smad2-Stat3 axis cell homeostasis that HYX disrupts in ATII cells and in lungs of newborn mice, suggesting Klf4 as potential target regulating lung regeneration.

AB  - PURPOSE/AIM: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is associated with poor survival in preterm infants. Intrauterine infection can aggravate the degree of obstruction of alveolar development in premature infants; however, the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we sought to determine whether pyroptosis could be inhibited by downregulating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and inducing autophagy in BPD-affected lung tissue., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a neonatal rat model of BPD induced by intrauterine infection via intraperitoneally injecting pregnant rats with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subsequently, mTOR levels and pyroptosis were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, TUNEL staining, and western blotting. The Shapiro-Wilk test was employed to assess the normality of the experimental data. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare the means between two groups, and comparisons between multiple groups were performed using analysis of variance., RESULTS: Pyroptosis of lung epithelial cells increased in BPD lung tissues. After administering an mTOR phosphorylation inhibitor (rapamycin) to neonatal rats with BPD, the level of autophagy increased, while the expression of autophagy cargo adaptors, LC3 and p62, did not differ. Following rapamycin treatment, NLRP3, Pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, pro-IL-1beta, IL-1beta, IL-18/Pro-IL-18, N-GSDMD/GSDMD, Pro-caspase-11, and caspase-11 were negatively regulated in BPD lung tissues. The opposite results were observed after treatment with the autophagy inhibitor MHY1485, showing an increase in pyroptosis and a significant decrease in the number of alveoli in BPD., CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin reduces pyroptosis in neonatal rats with LPS-induced BPD by inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation and inducing autophagy; hence, it may represent a potential therapeutic for treating BPD.

AB  - Objectives Antioxidant response plays a key role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) pathogenesis. The glutathione-S-tranferases pi 1 (GSTP1) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) detoxification enzymes protect cells from oxidative damage. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the A313G GSTP1 and G516T CYP2B6 inactivating polymorphisms could be associated with BPD susceptibility. Study Design To test this hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study enrolled 138 premature neonates <=32 weeks of gestational age; of the 138, 46 developed BPD and 92 did not develop BPD. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from neonates' peripheral blood and was used as template for GSTP1 and CYP2B6 genotyping using the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. Results Our report provides evidence for a possible pathogenetic role of the G516T CYP2B6 polymorphism in BPD susceptibility. Although no differences in the frequencies of the GSTP1 variant genotypes were noticed between premature neonates who developed BPD and neonates who did not develop BPD, a significantly higher frequency of the GSTP1 polymorphism was observed in extremely low birth weight infants. Despite the small sample size, it is very interesting the fact that all neonates <=1,000 g carrying the homozygous mutant GSTP1 genotype developed BPD. Conclusion Our results underscore the significance of both CYP2B6 and GSTP1 polymorphisms in modulating the risk of BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Commercial aircrafts at cruising altitude are pressurized to a cabin altitude of 2438 m (FiO2 0.15). To evaluate hypoxic inflight risk Hypoxic Challenge Testing (HCT) is recommend whereby oxygen requirements can be titrated. Portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) are approved for onboard use but there is lack of evidence about the use especially in children. Pulse flow POCs are designed for adults and therefore not recommended in paediatric age. We tested the effectiveness and safety of POCs during HCT. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospective interventional crossover study. N=26 infants (mean gestational age 30.4 weeks) who underwent HCT. Tested POCs: SeQal-Eclipse3 continuous flow and InogenOne pulse flow. In case of Sat.O2 <= 85 %, oxygen was administered through POC. Result(s): 22 ex-preterm patients were included (4 dropped out). Both POCs achieved immediate reversal of hypoxia in all cases without associating adverse events. No significant difference was observed between preterm patients +/- bronchopulmonary dysplasia concerning hypoxic recovery. Discussion(s): We present the results of a pilot study evaluating POCs effectiveness to revert hypoxia induced by HCT in children. Previous studies tested POCs in adults (mountain, hypobaric chamber) where all tested POCs achieved sufficient oxygen output. Our study also demonstrates that POCs are able to sense patient inspiration even in preterm babies. We conclude that POCs generate sufficient oxygen to revert HCT induced hypoxia and should be considered as a valid delivery method for inflight oxygen supply.

AB  - Human milk (HM) is nutritionally the best for both term and preterm infants. The significant advantages for preterm infants are empowered host defense, gastrointestinal development and maturation, neurological development, reduction of necrotizing enterocolitis(NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as well as mental and physical benefits for the mother. Human milk protection against infection persists longterm even when it is not further consumed: Immun regulatory effect. Maternal immune memory is transferred to child by HM. Human milk positively affects the immune system and neurocognitive development in dose dependent manner . The bioactive components of HM protect against infection and inflammation, contribute to immune maturation, organ development, healthy microbial colonization. Human milk hormones, growth factors , gastrointestinal mediators stimulate gastrointestinal growth and motility, and enhance the maturity of the gastrointestinal tract. Human milk is associated with neonatal intestinal colonization by the beneficial microbes of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus species. Many other factors such as anti-inflammatory agents (eg, interleukin 10) , polyunsaturated fatty acids, enzymes (eg, platelet-activating factor [PAF] acetylhydrolase), Immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, oligosaccharides( e.g. disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT)and oligosaccharide 2-fucosyllactose), are all protective against NEC. Osteopontin, milk fat globule membrane proteins, HAMLET are newly discovered immune protective agents of HM. Human milk also has miRNAs, live immun cells(leucocytes) and multipotent and pluripotent stem cells that can be transfered to gastrointestinal system and neonatal tissues. Lower renal solute load, Whey-dominant proteins, high Omega-3 fatty acid content (DHA ve EPA), better absorbsion of lipids, Zn, iron are important beneficial factors of HM. When compared with formula, HM increase the rate of gastric emptying ,increase the intestinal lactase activity, decrease the intestinal permeability, decrease the risk of NEC and sepsis early in life in premature infants. Preterm infants tolerate HM better than formula, reach full enteral feeds sooner, and are discharged earlier. The incidence and severity of ROP the incidence of BPD and periventricular leukomalasia (PVL) decrease. Improved long-term cognitive development, better Visual and Hearing function, better blood pressure and lipid profiles in adolescence are reported for HM fed ex-preterm infants. Own mother's milk (OMM) of preterm infant has more protein and minerals in the first few weeks compared to term mother's milk. Together with the other important features this makes fresh OMM is the first preference for the preterm infant. However when OMM is lacking or during the transition time to obtain OMM, pasteurised donor milk (DM) can be used as a second choice. The cost of DM is comparable to preterm formula. In preterm and LBW infants, moderate-certainty evidence indicates that feeding with formula compared with donor breast milk, either as a supplement to maternal expressed breast milk or as a sole diet, results in higher rates of in-hospital weight gain, linear growth, and head growth but a higher risk of developing NEC. Fortification of DM with HM based fortifiers may decrease the risk of NEC.

AB  - Introduction Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurological syndrome associated with different situations, including preeclampsia (PE). This condition may involve alteration of consciousness, visual disturbances and seizures. Symmetric white matter abnormalities, typically in the posterior parietooccipital regions, are often present at magnetic resonance (MRI). We introduce a case of PRES in preeclamptic preterm pregnant patient, that emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention. Case A 32-year-old nulliparous woman at 31+4 weeks of gestation was transferred from a regional hospital with severe hypertension, headache and mild visual disturbances. Pregnancy previously proceeded uneventfully. PE was suspected at this point, and magnesium sulphate infusion (4 g bolus and then 1 g/h by continuous infusion) and fetal pulmonary maturation (6 mg intramuscular betamethasone) were initiated after her admission to the Obstetric Emergency Unit. Fetal and maternal monitoring showed persistent 200/110 mmhg blood pressure, and intravenous labetalol was started. A progressive vision loss until complete blindness occurred in the meantime, and 10 mg oral nifedipine was dispensed. Laboratory exams showed no significant alterations. Cesarean section was performed, after 6 hours of fetal maturation, under regional anesthesia and without complications. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Twenty-four hours after delivery, MRI showed radiological signs indicative of PRES, with cortico-subcortical hyperintense patched injuries in the brain stem of both occipital lobes. Forty-eight hours after delivery, neurological examination was normal, remaining slight blurry vision, and she was transferred to the obstetric unit. She was discharged one week after delivery in good health with antihypertensive therapy (30 mg oral nifedipine). The newborn weighed 1640 grams and presented hyaline membrane disease with satisfactory response to surfactant. Conclusion This is an illustrative case of PRES associated with the acute onset of preeclampsia. It is important to remember that PE can be very unpredictable and manifests in many atypical ways. Differential diagnosis should be excluded as fast as possible, including imaging if neurological manifestations are present. Fast initiation of empirical treatment may be crucial for favorable fetal and maternal outcome.

AB  - Purpose: The study of the developing microbiome in the context of neonatal health and disease is a rapidly expanding area of interest. There is a complex relationship between the development of the gastrointestinal microbiota and the regulation of immune function. Preterm infants with developmentally immature lungs are more susceptible to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a debilitating lung disease leading to significant morbidity. The role of the intestinal microbiome in the pathogenesis of BPD has not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the differences in the intestinal microbiota between preterm infants who develop BPD and those who do not, as well as the effect of early antibiotic exposure on the neonatal microbiota in these cohorts. Method(s): Stool specimens were collected from very low birth weight (VLBW) infants born < 1500 g BW during the first six weeks of life. Bacterial DNA was isolated, and sequences targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were generated on the Illumina MiSeq platform with a median of 23,492 sequences generated per sample. Following quality filtering, sequence clustering into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and taxonomic assignment for each OTU, the overall bacterial diversity and relative abundance were determined in each sample. BPD was defined as need for supplemental oxygen >21% for >28 days. The primary outcome was diversity of gut microbiota at the genus level among infants with/without BPD, along with antibiotic exposure taken into consideration for each comparison. Result(s): Among preterm infants exposed to early antibiotics, microbial diversity was significantly decreased in those who developed BPD compared to those who did not (Figure 1). In infants who developed BPD and were exposed to antibiotics, there is a significant increase in the relative abundance of Escherichia/Shigella and Streptococcus in comparison to infants that developed BPD without antibiotic exposure. Among the antibiotic exposed cohort, the relative abundance of Veillonella is significantly decreased in infants with BPD compared to the infants who did not develop BPD (Figure 2). Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that VLBW infants who develop BPD have decreased microbial diversity and display significant changes in the composition of their intestinal microbiota compared to those without BPD. Early antibiotic exposure also leads to distinct microbiota changes in this cohort. These results highlight the potential for restoration of a healthy gut microbiome in the prevention/treatment of BPD. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease due to prematurity are significant sources of morbidity and mortality in former pre-term infants. Central to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the presence of chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress which lead to pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesized that a novel therapeutic directed at reducing inflammation and oxidative stress may also reduce fibrosis and the long-term sequela these infants face. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene activity. MicroRNA-146a is a key regulatory molecule in the NFkB mediated inflammatory response, with downstream effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6. MicroRNA-146a was conjugated to cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP146a), which are scavengers of reactive oxygen species and rapidly taken up by epithelial cells. The aim of this project was to evaluate intratracheal delivery of CNP146a at the time of bleomycin injury and examine its effects on decreasing pulmonary inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. Methods Using an established murine model, 29 juvenile (10 week) male and female C57BL/6 mice, underwent intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (3units/kg), PBS (as a control), or bleomycin and a single dose of CNP146a (10uM). Animals were euthanized either 7 days post-injury for bronchial alveolar lavage and tissue harvest or 14 days post-injury for lung inflation and tissue harvest. Results Histologic analysis 14 days post-injury (Figure 1) shows significant lung injury with bleomycin, including the presence of alveolar hemorrhage, increased collagen deposition, and an abundance of CD45+ cells when compared to PBS treated controls. The study group treated with CNP146a at the time of bleomycin injury showed less mucosal sloughing/hemorrhage, decreased CD45+inflammatory cells, and markedly decreased lung fibrosis. Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were processed for cell viability. There were no viable cells observed in the BAL obtained from the bleomycin treated group at 7 days (0.0% cell viability compared to 32.04% cell viability in the PBS controls). The CNP146a treated group had improved cell viability, equivalent to the control animals (35.92% cell viability). Conclusions CNP-146a is a new therapeutic that may possess applications for the prevention and treatment of chronic pulmonary disease in former pre-term infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease. Histology 14 days post-injury demonstrates decreased inflammation, hemorrhage, and fibrosis the CNP146a treated group. Further, the BAL samples show improved cell viability in the CNP-146a treated group. These results indicate that CNP146a decreases the inflammation and fibrosis associated with the bleomycin induced model of pulmonary fibrosis and may be an effective therapy in the mitigation of chronic pulmonary disease.

AB  - Background: Most preterm infants require intubation during their hospitalization, and early extubation has become standard practice to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury and risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, failed extubation can be associated with higher risk of BPD and adverse outcomes. It is unclear whether early extubation increases the risk of failed extubation and therefore BPD. Purpose(s): The purpose of this study was to determine whether early extubation in preterm infants requiring mechanical ventilation is associated with higher risk of failed extubation and BPD. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study of intubated, preterm infants with birth weight <= 1500 g or gestational age (GA) <30 weeks admitted to our NICU from January 2012 to March 2017. Inclusion criteria were as follows: infants requiring intubation, survival to 36 weeks PMA, and known oxygen status at 36 weeks PMA. Early extubation was defined as first extubation attempt within first 48 hours of life, and late extubation as first extubation attempt after 48 hours of life. Failed extubation was defined as reintubation within 7 days of extubation attempt. BPD was defined as oxygen need at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. Result(s): A total of 510 eligible preterm infants were identified, of which 297 (58%) were intubated. 95% of those with GA 27 weeks or less required intubation. Of intubated infants, 280 (93%) were intubated in the first day of life. 111 (37%) were reintubated after the first extubation attempt, with 74 (25%) falling under the classification of a failed first extubation requiring intubation within 7 days of extubation and thus qualifying as failed extubation. The total incidence of BPD was 56% in all intubated infants, and was 78% in infants with a failed first extubation and 48% in infants with a successful first extubation (p<0.0001). In general, incidence of extubation failure and BPD or death was lower with earlier day of life of first extubation (Figure 1). Infants who were extubated early had lower rates of BPD and similar rates of extubation failure as compared with infants who were extubated late (Figure 2). Conclusion(s): Early extubation was not associated with increased risk of failed extubation or BPD in our cohort of very low birth weight preterm infants. These findings need to be confirmed with multivariate adjusted analyses, but provide reassurance that early extubation remains a suitable strategy for respiratory support of preterm infants requiring intubation.

AB  - Purpose: Cross-talk between the intestinal microbiome and the lung (the gut-lung axis) and its role in lung health is of growing interest. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a debilitating lung disease with long-term consequences and is one of the most common causes for morbidity in premature neonates. Postnatal exposure to high concentrations of oxygen contributes to the development of BPD and replicates the disease phenotype in neonatal mice. Perturbation of the neonatal microbiome can have long-term impacts on lung health and may be caused by exposure to antibiotics. The role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of BPD, and the underlying mechanism(s), has not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of pre- and postnatal ampicillin treatment on the neonatal murine microbiome as well as to determine the additive effect of ampicillin and hyperoxic lung injury on the microbiome and lung disease severity. Method(s): Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type mice were treated with ampicillin (AMP) 100 mg/kg oral gavage from E17-19. Pups were given AMP (100 mg/kg i.p.) postnatal day (PND) 1-3. Control dams and pups received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pups were exposed to hyperoxia (95% oxygen) or room air PND 1-4 (saccular stage of lung development). Intestinal and lung tissue were collected on PND 6 and 21 and then subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Lung tissue collected on PND 21 after hyperoxia was analyzed for alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, and macrophage infiltration and was compared to room air controls. Result(s): Betadiversity in the intestine was statistically different between the PBS and ampicillin treated groups at PND 6 and PND 21. AMP treated mice had decreased Lactobacillus and Streptococcus at PND 6 in the intestine, whereas Bacteroides and Akkermansia were significantly decreased at PND 21. In both treatment groups, microbial diversity increased between PND 6 and 21. The lung microbiome was not different between groups. Mice treated with AMP and hyperoxia had no significant changes in microbiome composition compared to mice treated with AMP and room air. Hyperoxia exposure adversely impacted alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization and increased macrophage infiltration. Interestingly, female sex was protective with better alveolarization and angiogenesis after hyperoxia exposure. Conclusion(s): Our data suggests that perinatal antibiotic administration has both an immediate and a sustained effect on the gut microbiome in a murine model. Hyperoxia did not have an additive effect found on the gut microbiome with pups exposed to ampicillin and hyperoxia when compared to pups only exposed to ampicillin. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of the developing gut microbiome in influencing lung development can lead to novel treatment and management strategies for BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Congenital central hypothyroidism is a rare pathology, whose molecular origin has been identified more frequently since discovery of the role of IGSF1. The natural evolution of central hypothyroidism in patients with mutations is not well known however. Case report: A male infant born at term with a normal birth weight received thyroid function tests in the neonatal period because of symptoms of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (generalized hypotonia, hyaline membrane disease). The tests in fact revealed isolated central hypothyroidism (TSH, 3.8 mIU/L; T3, 1.56 pmol/L; T4, 6.2 pmol/L) with normal hypothalamic-pituitary MRI results. The patient had another episode of severe acute respiratory distress, and developed asthma. Endocrinological follow-up confirmed the isolated and persistent nature of TSH deficiency. NGS analysis revealed a c.2485dup variant of IGSF1 (X-linked inheritance). Family investigations were performed. Tests revealed central hypothyroidism for both brothers. The elder brother (6 years old) has normal growth and psychomotor development and is completely asymptomatic. The younger brother (9 months of age) is asymptomatic but overweight. Thyroid tests were performed at day 3 of life for the younger brother because of family history. They revealed a low T3 level (3.5 pmol/l) and subnormal T4 level (11.4 pmol/l). No treatment was initiated. At 9 months of age, the T3 level had normalised (5.6 pmol/l) but the T4 level had decreased (8.2 pmol/l). At this stage, L-thyroxine treatment was initiated for both brothers, despite the absence of symptoms. Discussion(s): This genetic variant has never been described in the literature but is considered pathological. The diagnosis, which would have eluded neonatal screening in France, was made because of the initial clinical presentation with respiratory distress, but these symptoms have not been reported for IGSF1 mutations. The absence of symptoms in spite of clear central hypothyroidism has been described in the families of other index cases, and points towards the probable presence of compensating mechanisms, such as a possible increase in deiodinase levels, which would maintain a sufficient concentration of T3. This case highlights the variability of T3 and T4 levels in the absence of treatment in children, with a possible worsening of central hypothyroidism over time, suggesting that genetic testing in the family is essential to confirm diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Prospective follow-up of this family should shed light on the natural history of central hypothyroidism and provide arguments for or against initiating treatment in the absence of symptoms.

AB  - Rationale: Pregnant women are exposed to polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through their diet, smoking and other environmental sources. Preterm neonates are exposed to supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia), which leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Cross-talk between the intestinal microbiome and the lung (gut-lung axis) and its role in lung health is of growing interest. The purpose of this study is to determine the additive effect of prenatal PAH exposure and hyperoxia exposure on BPD severity and the neonatal gut microbiome over time in a neonatal murine model. We hypothesized that prenatal PAH exposure adversely affects fetal lung development, prevents the establishment of a normal gut microbiome and exacerbates the effects of postnatal supplemental oxygen in newborn mice. Method(s): Pregnant wild type (WT) (C57BL/6J) mice were treated with orally with BP (20 mg/kg) or vehicle corn oil (CO) on gestational days 16-19, and newborn mice were maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (> 95% O2) for 4 days (P1-4; saccular stage of lung development). Intestinal tissue was collected on P4 and 15 and then subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Lung tissue collected on P15 was analyzed for alveolarization and pulmonary vascularization. Result(s): The lungs of newborn WT mice exposed prenatally to the vehicle control, followed by postnatal hyperoxia showed grater lung injury, inflammation, and alveolar simplification (as measured by mean linear intercept and radial alveolar count), compared to animals maintained in room air. WT mice that were prenatally treated with BP, followed by postnatal hyperoxia showed potentiation of lung injury and abnormal alveolarization compared to those that were prenatally exposed to CO. The overall composition of the gut microbiome was analyzed by principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) of beta-diversity at PND 4 and 15. Hyperoxia significantly altered the composition of the microbiome (beta-diversity) at PND15 in both corn oil and BP, with an observed mutual loss of Akkermansia. BP had a significant effect on the composition of the microbiome at PND15 in mice treated with hyperoxia, which was noticeably absent in mice maintained in room air. These shifts were accompanied by loss of Enterococcaceae and gains of Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroidaceae. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that prenatal PAH exposure mediated microbial dysbiosis may potentiate of hyperoxic lung injury in newborn mice via mechanisms entailing the gut-lung axis. This study has implications for the adverse impact of prenatal environmental exposures on the exacerbation of postnatal lung injury in preterm neonates..

AB  - Introduction Postnatal corticosteroids are commonly used in preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to help improve respiratory status and facilitate weaning of respiratory support. Corticosteroids are known to have anti-inflammatory effects and alter immune responses which may explain their beneficial effects in ventilator-dependent preterm infants. We previously demonstrated that T-cells are present in the tracheal aspirates (TA) of ventilated preterm infants. We hypothesized that postnatal steroids, specifically dexamethasone, would alter the expression of T-cell surface markers in ventilated preterm infants. Methods TA samples were collected from preterm infants born between 23 0/7 weeks and 28 6/7 weeks who were mechanically ventilated. Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent were obtained prior to collection of samples. Samples were obtained during clinically-indicated or routine care suctioning only by the bedside nurse or respiratory therapist. Initially, samples were obtained for a non-steroid related study; retrospectively, we identified infants who had received dexamethasone for respiratory management. Infants must have had a TA sample obtained within 72 hours of a 10 day dexamethasone course and a subsequent TA sample within 72 hours after dexamethasone was initiated. Infants were excluded if they had received any previous steroids. Immune cell phenotyping was conducted by intracellular immunostaining with flow cytometric analysis. Standard statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California USA). Results We collected samples from a total of 43 infants. Of those infants, 9 had received dexamethasone but only 5 infants were identified as having met the inclusion criteria timing of samples obtained. We found a significant decrease in the percentage of CD4+ cells expressing IL-6 (p =0.02, paired t-test, figure), percentage of CXCR3+ cells expressing IL-2 (p <0.05, paired t-test, data not shown) and a decrease in the percentage of CXCR3+ cells expressing IL-6 (P <0.001, paired t-test, data not shown). Conclusions Preterm infants with evolving BPD who received dexamethasone had altered T-cell phenotypes which could account for the clinically beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone. However, this data is limited by the number of patients enrolled. It would be important to increase the sample size and obtain more orderly timed TA samples with additional data on respiratory status to improve this data set.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the nutritional provisions received by infants with surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and the associated effects on short-term growth., METHODS: Through the Children's Hospitals Neonatal Database, we identified infants born <=32 weeks' gestation with surgical NEC from 5 regional neonatal intensive care units for 4 years. Excluded infants had isolated intestinal perforation and died <14 days postoperatively. Infants were stratified by their median parenteral protein dose (low [LP] or high [HP] protein) for the first postoperative week. The primary outcome was postoperative weight growth velocity. Growth (weight, length, and head circumference [HC]) was measured and the effects related to protein dose were estimated using multivariable analyses., RESULTS: There were 103 infants included; the median parenteral protein dose received was 3.27 g . kg . day (LP: 2.80 g . kg . day; HP: 3.87 g . kg . day). Postoperative weight (11.5 +/- 6.5 g . kg . day) and linear growth (0.9 +/- 0.2 cm/wk) were similar regardless of dose (P > 0.3 between groups for weight and length). Unadjusted and independent associations were identified with HC changes and HP dose (beta = 0.1 cm/wk, P = 0.03) after adjusting for gestational age, the presence of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, short bowel syndrome, blood stream infection, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, small for gestational age, and calorie intake. Eventual nonsurvivors received 18% less protein and 14% fewer calories over the first postoperative month., CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative protein doses in infants with surgical NEC appear related to increases in HC. The influence of postoperative nutritional support on risk of adverse outcomes deserves further attention.

AB  - Rationale: Lung inflammation is known to interrupt alveolarization and lead to the most common morbidity of preterm infants i.e. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition to mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia, neonatal sepsis contributes to BPD pathogenesis. We recently observed that the lung phenotype of mice exposed to early postnatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recapitulates the phenotype of sepsis associated BPD in infants. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide that exerts anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs of adult rodents. Whether AM mitigates lung inflammation and promotes lung development and repair in a model of neonatal sepsis is unknown. Therefore, using the LPS model of neonatal sepsis, we tested the hypothesis that AM-deficient neonatal mice will display increased lung inflammation and injury and decreased ability to repair their injured lungs compared with wild type (WT) littermates. Method(s): AM-deficient mice or their WT littermates were intraperitoneally administered 6 mg/kg of LPS or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) once daily on postnatal days (PNDs) 3-5. The lungs were collected for genomic analyses on PND5. The impact of AM on alveolarization was determined on PND7 and PND14. Lung inflammation was assessed by quantifying the following cytokines/chemokines: chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), interleukin (IL)-1beta (IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Alveolarization was evaluated by measuring radial alveolar counts and mean linear intercepts. Result(s): LPS exposure decreased the growth rate of neonatal mice; however, the extent of growth failure was similar in AM-deficient mice and WT littermates. AMdeficient mice exposed to LPS displayed three-to six-fold increased expression of CCL3, CXCL1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha than similarly exposed WT littermates. Additionally, the severity of LPS-induced interruption of alveolarization was greater in AM-deficient mice than WT littermates at PND7. Interestingly, at PND14, the extent of alveolarization was similar in WT littermates treated with PBS and LPS, indicating that WT mice have the ability to repair and recover from LPS-induced lung injury. In contrast, LPS-exposed AM-deficient mice continued to have decreased alveolarization compared with WT littermates at PND14. These observation indicate that AM plays a role in the initiation and resolution of LPS-induced lung injury. Conclusion(s): We conclude that AM signaling is necessary to decrease lung inflammation and injury and promote repair of injured lungs in neonatal mice exposed to LPS. Our results indicate that AM signaling axis is a potential therapeutic target for the management of sepsis associated BPD in infants.

AB  - Introduction: Perinatal inflammation (chorioamnionitis) and mechanical ventilation at birth have been described as independent risk factors for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, there is increasing evidence that the interactions between antenatal and postnatal exposures contribute to BPD risk. Previously, we have shown that antenatal endotoxin (ETX) causes abnormal lung structure and mechanics at 2 weeks. Whether early abnormal changes in lung mechanics are present at birth and 7 days after antenatal ETX is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesize that antenatal ETX exposed pups will have abnormal baseline lung mechanics and be sensitized to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) at birth and one week. Method(s): Fetal rats were exposed to ETX (10mug) or saline via intra-amniotic injection at gestational day 20 and delivered via cesarean section two days later. At birth (D0) or 7 days (D7), rats underwent tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation for 90 minutes with LowVt (positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)=2 cmH2O, tidal volume (Vt)=6 ml/kg, respiratory rate RR=250 BPM); P20 (plateau pressure (Pplat)=20 cmH2O, PEEP=0, RR=50 BPM); or P24 (Pplat=24 cmH2O, PEEP=0, RR=50 BPM). Lung function was measured at the start and end of ventilation using quasi-static pressure-volume loops (PV) to determine inspiratory capacity (IC) and quasi-static compliance (Cst). Pulmonary system elastance (H) at PEEP=2 cmH2O was determined from impedance measured at 5-minute intervals during ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at the end of ventilation for total protein concentration. Result(s): At D0 and D7, ETX exposed rats had decreased Cst and IC compared to controls (p<0.05; Figure A&B). At D0, both controls and ETX exposed rats had increased H in response to all ventilation modes and protein concentration in BALF was greater in P20 ventilation as compared to LowVt (Figure C). High mortality due to pneumothoraces occurred during P24 ventilation at D0. At D7, ETX exposed pups demonstrated increased H during P24 ventilation (Figure D) and elevated BALF protein content. (Figure Preseted).

AB  - Rationale:Supplemental oxygen is frequently administered to newborns with pulmonary insufficiency. However, prolonged hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm human infants. Hypothesis:Prenatal treatment of newborn mice with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), followed by exposure to hyperoxia, would alleviate lung injury by mechanisms involving cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A or 1B1 enzymes. Method(s):Timed pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) were treated orally with the vehicle corn oil (CO) or BNF (80 mgkg) on gestational days (18-20), and pups born to these mothers were maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (> 95% O2) for 48, 96 or 120 h. The mice were sacrificed on day 5 of life. Expression of the CYP1A1/2 and 1B1 was measured by RT-PCR and Western blots. Lung injury was assessed by determining lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios and histopathology. Result(s):Mice born to CO-treated mothers showed significant lung injury and alveolar simplification at all three time points of hyperoxia. However, newborn mice born to BNFtreated mothers showed attenuation of lung injury and increased alveolarization, as determined by measuring lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratios and histology respectively. The most striking observation was that both pulmonary and hepatic CYP1B1 (not CYP1A1/2) were markedly induced in newborns born to BNF exposed mothers after 48 h of hyperoxia, and that correlated with less lung injury. After 5 days of hyperoxia, the pattern of expression was reversed. Conclusion(s): Our observations support the hypothesis that maternal BNF protects newborn mice against hyperoxic lung injury by induction of the CYP1B1 and CYP1A1/2 in a temporal fashion. Future studies on the role of CYP1A/1B1 enzymes in oxygen-mediated lung injury could lead to the development of rational strategies in the prevention/treatment of BPD in premature infants.

AB  - [Introduction] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common long-term complication due to premature birth, is anticipated to predispose early-onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). BPD is caused by injurious stimuli including hyperoxia with immaturity during perinatal periods. Owning to perturbed postnatal alveolar formation in BPD, exposure to cigarette smoke is supposed to introduce earlier onset of COPD. Previous reports have shown that Newzealand White (NZW) mice are resistant to smoke exposure with anti-oxidant related genes highly expressed in baseline, suggesting that NZW would be little sensitive to oxidative stress. In the present study, we hypothesized that the susceptibility to oxidative stress would be a leading background of phenotypes in both murine BPD and COPD models. [Methods] To address this hypothesis, we established an experimental BPD model using NZW and C57BL/6J as a susceptible control. 70% oxygen for 14 days was adopted as neonatal hyperoxic load. Within postnatal 1 day(PN1), litters were shuffled and allocated almost evenly to hyperoxia or normoxia (room air as control) with nursing dams. At PN28 and PN56, the respiratory mechanics measurement using FlexiVent was performed to determine quasi-static lung compliance (Cst:ml/cmH2O), followed by lung fixation at 25cmH2O pressure. For lung tissue morphometry, mean linear intercept(MLI:mum) and the indexes of alveolar structural complexity defined mathematically and geometrically, such as fractal dimension of air space size(Dsn) and air space shape(Dsp), were evaluated using our custom-made program. Data are shown as mean(SD). [Results] Neonatal hyperoxia group in C57BL/6J showed significantly higher Cst compared to control group, with significant air space dilatation at both PN28 and PN56. Of note, mice with neonatal hyperoxia tended to have significantly lower body weight(BW:g) than the control at PN28 (BW:11.7(1.1)vs14.5(0.81)). In NZW study, mice with neonatal hyperoxia didn't show significant growth retardation and lung abnormalities compared to the control at PN28 (BW:13.3(1.1)vs13(1.1), Cst:0.038(0.006)vs0.034(0.003), MLI:42.0(2.0)vs40.0(3.8)). Fractal parameters in the neonatal hyperoxia group were statistically equivalent to in the control groups shown as 1.6(0.03)vs1.5(0.01) in Dsp and 1.1(0.17)vs1.2(0.13) in Dsn, indicating that neonatal hyperoxia didn't alter alveolar structural complexity in NZW. [Conclusion] NZW showed minute susceptibility to neonatal hyperoxia in line with minimum alteration due to smoke-induced oxidative stress at adult stage. Sensitivity to oxidative stress is considered to underlie the disease phenotypes in both murine BPD and COPD models, suggesting a common mechanism linking the two diseases in part.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a devastating sequela of preterm birth, is associated with inflammation, decreased vascularization and arrested alveolarization. Neonatal oxygen-induced lung injury is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular superoxide. This is counteracted by EC-SOD, an antioxidant enzyme found in the extracellular matrix of the lung that scavenges superoxide and protects the developing premature lung against the damaging effects of hyperoxia. We hypothesized that, compared to wild type (WT), EC-SOD KO mice in neonatal hyperoxia exposure would have worse outcomes, with exaggerated inflammation and decreased alveolarization. METHOD(S): WT and EC-SOD KO mice were exposed to either normoxia (21%O2) or hyperoxia (95%O2) during the saccular phase of lung development from postnatal day (PN) 1 to PN 5, and then maintained in normoxia until PN14. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cells from BAL and lung tissue were obtained on PN7 and PN14. Alveolarization was measured using radial alveolar count (RAC) in inflation-fixed lungs. ELISAs were used for BAL and qRT-PCR was used for lung tissue mRNA expression of key molecules such as IL-1s and TGFs1. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-Acetyl Glucosaminidase (NAG) activities were used to quantify neutrophils and macrophages respectively. RESULT(S): In normoxia, compared to WT, EC-SOD KO mice had decreased alveolarization (PN14), increased MPO (PN7, P<0.001) and NAG activities (PN14, P<0.0001), as well as increased IL-1s mRNA (PN7, P<0.05) and TGFs1 mRNA (PN7, P<0.05). Compared to normoxia controls, WT mice exposed to hyperoxia had increased MPO and NAG activities, increased IL-1s and TGFs1 mRNA on PN7, and decreased alveolarization on PN14. In hyperoxia, compared to WT mice, EC-SOD KO mice had worse alveolarization, increased macrophage influx (PN14, P<0.005), increased IL-1s1 mRNA (PN7, P<0.01, PN14, P<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The lack of EC-SOD in neonatal mice is associated with inflammation and decreased alveolarization in room air (21%O2). With hyperoxia exposure (95%O2), the inflammatory response and decreased alveolarization are further exaggerated in EC-SOD KO mice compared to WT mice. We conclude that EC-SOD is critical for targeting ROS during neonatal lung development and could be a potential therapeutic target for neonatal oxygen-induced lung injury.

AB  - Rationale: Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients often have airway narrowings and dynamic collapse (tracheomalacia, TM) that may increase the work of breathing and overall caloric consumption. We currently have no reliable method for assessing the large-airway resistance, changes during respiration, or how much total work is expended on breathing per day. To quantify upper-airway and tracheal breathing effort independently of parenchymal issues, we have combined dynamic MRI with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to calculate the total large-airway resistance in the first quantitative analysis of the large airway contribution to infant work of breathing. Method(s): Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI was acquired for 14 NICU patients (7 severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), 2 pulmonary hypoplasia, 2 tracheoesophageal fistula, and 3 controls with no cardiorespiratory abnormalities). MRI was gated into 8 images at different points in the respiratory cycle using an established technique of respiratory gating on the center of k-space. These 8 images were registered to determine how the upper airway (nasopharynx to glottis) and trachea move during the breathing cycle. MRI-derived tidal lung volumes were used to generate the airflow rates for the left and right bronchi separately; these parameters were used as boundary conditions for CFD, which produced timedependent airway resistance, energy expenditure, and pressure during the entire respiratory cycle. This allowed calculation of the contribution of the upper-airway and trachea to the daily work of breathing. Result(s): The patient-specific CFD simulations show a wide range of daily energy expenditure values in the trachea, 6J to 740J, and also for upper-airway energy expenditure per day, 1J to 128J. Upper-airway energy expenditure as a fraction of total airway energy expenditure was higher (35%+/-17%) in BPD patients than controls (22%+/-13%, p=0.049) and those with pulmonary hypoplasia and tracheoesophageal fistula patients (8%+/-7%, p=0.001), as detailed in the Figure. Conclusion(s): The combination of quasi-cine MRI with CFD allows quantitative analysis of the regional contribution of breathing effort in the large airway. In this study, the contribution of the upper-airway as a fraction of the large-airway energy expenditure was larger in BPD patients than controls, and larger than patients with airway abnormalities. Assessing which regions of the airway contribute most to breathing effort may allow different modes of ventilation to be considered (intubated vs non-intubated). Patients with high upperairway energy expenditure may also benefit the most from tracheostomy. Quantification of large airway breathing effort provides assessment of airway disease separately from parenchymal issues.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease resulting from injury during postnatal lung development in premature infants. Supplemental oxygen exposure, as used in the NICU, may lead to alveolar simplification but also to loss of bronchial epithelial cilia (Al-Shmgani, 2012). These hair-like projections line the respiratory epithelium and function in clearance of mucus, pathogens, and debris. Mucociliary clearance can be perturbed by ciliary loss and/or dysfunction, which can lead to chronic infection and inflammation. Little is known about the mechanism of hyperoxic ciliary dysfunction in the respiratory tract and its impact in the pathogenesis of BPD. Method(s): Human airway epithelial cells (HAE) were grown at an air liquid interface that closely approximates a normal multiciliated respiratory airway epithelium both structurally and functionally (Whitcuff et al, 1988). The HAE was exposed to 95 % O2/5%CO2 or 5 % CO2 (controls) for up to 48 hours. Cilia length was measured from scanning electron microscopy images using a Matlab  program that measures curved cilia length. Maintenance of the cilia length is a function of intraflagellar transport (IFT), a highly organized protein transport mechanism that is important in ciliary axonemal assembly and lengthening (Hao et al, 2009). IFT involves cilia regulatory proteins including Foxj1, and motor proteins such as kinesin II and dynein II, as well as structural proteins including tubulin (Pooranachandran et al, 2016; Stepanek et al, 2016 ;Takemura et al, 1996). We therefore evaluated the levels of the IFT proteins Kif3b, dynein, acetylated alpha tubulin, and Foxj1 via western blot. Result(s): There was a significant time-dependent reduction (P<0.01) in cilia length after 24 hours of hyperoxia exposure. In addition, there was a significant time-dependent decrease in kinesin II motor protein Kif3b and an increase in Foxj1 after 36 hours of hyperoxia exposure. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that hyperoxia exposure leads to dysfunction in IFT with resultant decreased cilia length. This could result in dysfunctional mucociliary clearance and furthermore chronic infection and inflammation. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of airway dysfunction in patients with BPD could help to develop targets for treatment and prevention focused on IFT.

AB  - Rationale: The pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is complex with multiple regulatory pathways contributing to the disrupted alveolar development in BPD. DNA methylation at the 5-carbon position of cytosine (5mC) constitutes a major epigenetic mark that often signals for transcriptional repression. The reversal of DNA methylation is catalyzed by the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET1, TET2 and TET3) family of dioxygenases, which are capable of oxidizing 5mC into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and lead to active DNA demethylation. Recent studies suggest aberrant DNA methylation plays an important role in the arrested alveolar development after hyperoxic exposure. However, the role of TET proteins and hydroxymethylation in the pathophysiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains unknown. Method(s): Newborn C57Bl6 (WT) mice were exposed to room air or 95% oxygen for 4 days after birth (P1 to P5), and then allowed to recover in room air to P15. Mice were sacrificed for collection of lung tissue for analysis of lung development and epigenetic modifications. Analysis included immunohistochemistry of lung sections using anti-Tet1, anti-Tet2 and anti-5hmc antibodies. Dot-blot assay was performed using anti-5hmc antibody and dilutions of denatured DNA samples isolated from whole lung lysates and spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. Transcript levels from whole lung lysates were quantitated using real-time quantitative PCR. Results were compared with data from the LungMap project. Result(s): Hyperoxic exposure for 4 days after birth disrupted normal pulmonary development with enlarged and simplified alveoli. TET1 transcript levels were higher on DOL 0 compared to DOL 15, but no change in room air and hyperoxia groups at P15. This is consistent with decreased expression of TET1 in LungMap mouse RNA sequence data from E16.5 to P28. IHC results were more inconsistent for hyperoxia exposed animals but suggested 4 days of hyperoxia exposure may cause decreased 5hmC in some animals (Figure). After room air recovery, whole lung 5hmC levels are not different at DOL 15. Conclusion(s): TET1 gene expression shows developmental changes based on postnatal age suggesting that hydroxymethylation may play an important role in the transition to the extrauterine environment. Altered DNA hydroxymethylation may be affected by hyperoxia exposure and along with evidence of aberrant DNA methylation in arrested alveolar development, could contribute to the pathophysiology of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal chronic lung disease, characterized by reduced alveolarization and loss of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-II). Since neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are associated with lung diseases, we hypothesized (1) that the BDNF system is dysregulated in lungs of newborn mice exposed to prolonged hyperoxia; and (2) that BDNF-receptor TrkB regulates homeostasis of AEC-II. Method(s): (1) Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 or 21% O2 for 28 days; lungs were harvested at postnatal day 3 (P3), P7, P21, P28 and P70. (2) Cultured murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were treated with BDNF-receptor inhibitor (K252a), followed by assessment of cell survival and gene expression. Result(s): (1) Gene and protein expression as well as phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB) were increased in lungs during the alveolar phase; TrkB was localized in the bronchial epithelium and in the alveolar septa using immunohistochemistry. Hyperoxia increased serum BDNF and lung BDNF expression, whereas active TrkB was inhibited in lungs of newborn mice. Blocked lung TrkB signaling was linked to reduced surfactant protein C expression and increased alphaSMA and cyclin D1 (cell cycle regulator). (2) TrkBblockade using K252a inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis and the expression of mesenchymal markers in MLE-12. Conclusion(s): Here we demonstrate a blockade of the BDNFTrkB pathway in neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury and identify TrkB as a novel regulator of AEC-II homeostasis. Thus, our findings indicate an important role of BDNF signaling in the pathogenesis of BPD, offering a new target to enable lung regeneration.

AB  - Rationale: A challenge to progressing towards clinical use of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) remains a lack of standardization for patient response. Better characterization of hMSCs is needed, and data is lacking on the best source of hMSCs in the treatment of specific respiratory pathologies. Inflammation and the nitric oxide (NO) pathway contribute to a wide range of pediatric pulmonary diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. hMSCs decrease the expression of airway inflammation and inducible nitric oxide synthase in a variety of murine models of airway inflammation. Our aim is to identify the ideal hMSC tissue source for the treatment of pediatric pulmonary pathologies. Specifically, identifying the hMSC phenotype which correlates with functional potency via transcriptome analysis. hMSCs can be derived from different tissue sources. The arrays focused on the inflammatory and NO pathways. We hypothesize that different hMSC types will have similar gene expression profiles, with reduced expression of genes that are implicated in bronchoconstriction, specifically decreased expression of NOS2 and NOS3, and decreased expression of inflammatory genes such as IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta. Method(s): hMSCs from bone marrow and umbilical cord tissue were cultured using DMEM containing fetal bovine serum. Functional anti-inflammatory, anti-airway reactivity and anti-microbial assays were used to evaluate hMSC potency. In selected bone marrow and cord tissue hMSC preparations, RNA was extracted followed by cDNA synthesis. RT-PCR was performed with a small number of Taqman probes in preparation for the larger NO and inflammatory arrays. Result(s): NOS2 and NOS3 were not expressed by either the bone marrow or umbilical cord hMSCs. However, the inflammatory array showed unique differences between the two different types of hMSC preparations. While bone marrow and cord tissue hMSCs both expressed IL1RN, the expression of IL1alpha and IL1beta was unique to only the cord tissue hMSC preparation. Table 1 shows delta CT values for a subset of genes on NO and inflammatory arrays. Conclusion(s): hMSC phenotype is influenced by the tissue source. In both bone marrow and umbilical cord tissue, hMSCs did not express NOS2 and NOS3. However, umbilical cord hMSCs had a more proinflammatory gene expression profile than bone marrow hMSCs. Correlation of phenotype and functionality of these hMSCs in the setting of pediatric pulmonary pathology is an area for further research in determining the best tissue source for MSC therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory injury, particularly the production of active interleukin (IL)-1beta plays a major role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. The release of active IL-1beta is controlled by posttranscriptional modifications of its proform (pro-IL-1beta) through the inflammasome. Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of GTPases that regulate the inflammatory process., OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that Rac1 signaling increases inflammasome activation that results in damaging inflammation, and that the inhibition of Rac1 signaling prevents lung injury, by inhibiting inflammasome activation in a newborn rat model of BPD induced by hyperoxia., METHODS: Newborn rat pups were exposed to room air or hyperoxia (85% O2) and received daily intraperitoneal injections of placebo (normal saline) or NSC23766, a specific Rac1 inhibitor, for 10 days. The effects on lung inflammation, alveolarization, vascular development, vascular remodeling, right ventricular systolic pressure, and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were then assessed., RESULTS: Hyperoxia exposure upregulated Rac1 and increased the production of active IL-1beta, which was accompanied by increasing expression of the inflammasome. In addition, hyperoxia induced the pathological hallmarks of BPD. However, treatment with NSC23766 significantly decreased inflammasome activation and macrophage infiltration, improved alveolar and vascular development, and reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling and RVH., CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Rac1 signaling regulates the expression of the inflammasome and plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. Therefore, targeting Rac1 signaling may provide a novel strategy to prevent and treat BPD in preterm infants. Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Defective vascular development is a hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. The mechanisms underlying molecular regulation of normal and abnormal vascularization in the saccular/alveolar lung remain incompletely understood. To investigate the role of the endothelial cell (EC) in lung vascular arborization and alveolarization (vascular hypothesis), we targeted delta like 4 (DLL4), an EC Notch ligand that regulates embryonic angiogenesis. We hypothesized that DLL4-dependent angiogenesis is critical for pulmonary vascular arborization and alveolarization. We combined DLL4 mapping in mice and human samples with functional studies in DLL4 haploinsufficient (Dll4+/LacZ) and EC-specific Dll4-deletion mice to test this hypothesis. METHOD(S): Immunofluorescence (IF) was performed on mouse and human lung (autopsy) sections obtained from the canalicular to alveolar phase. DLL4 (EC tip cell marker), JAG1 (EC stalk cell marker), and PECAM expression were captured by confocal microscopy. X-gal staining on frozen sections from Dll4+/LacZ mice investigated temporal and spatial DLL4 expression in relation to vascular and acinar development. PECAM distribution, radial alveolar counts and mean linear intercepts were assessed to quantify vascular development and alveolarization in Dll4+/LacZ mice. Tamoxifen inducible-, EC specific knockout mice Dll4Loxp/Loxp; Cdh5-CreERT2 were used to examine the contribution of DLL4 to alveolarization. RESULT(S): DLL4 was expressed in the mouse lung from E17 to P28, and the human lung between 23-43wk gestation, with peak expression in the alveolar phase. DLL4 was expressed in small arteries and lung capillaries in a PECAM-restricted manner. Markers of stalk cell EC specification (Jag1), and EC Notch activation (NICD) mirrored and proximated EC DLL4 expression during mouse and human lung development. Lung dll4 (X-gal) expression was confirmed from E17 to P28 using Dll4+/LacZ mice with prominent expression in the saccular/early alveolar phase and in secondary septae. Haploinsufficiency of Dll4 (Dll4+/LacZ) resulted in hypersprouting of lung blood vessels at E17.5, disorganized capillaries at P6, and narrowed-lumen capillaries and smaller intermediate blood vessels (10-150muM) at P14. Dll4+/LacZ mice had defective alveolarization as evident by decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts (Fig. 1). Inducible-deletion of EC Dll4 at the onset of alveolar phase (P4) disrupted alveolar development in mid-alveolar phase (Fig. 1). CONCLUSION(S): We propose that DLL4-dependent angiogenesis regulates lung vascular development and loss of Dll4 impairs angiogenesis, disrupting lung vascularization and alveolarization. Our data evince a direct role for EC-Dll4 signaling in regulating alveolarization. These data inform investigation of Dll4 as a prime candidate mediating defective vascularization and alveolarization reported in BPD.

AB  - Objective: Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) metabolite of Vitamin A facilitates recovery from hyperoxia induced cell damage, but the mechanism and the genes activated in human lung epithelial cells on ATRA supplementation are poorly understood. We thus hypothesize that ATRA reduces expression of hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress response genes in alveolar epithelial cells. Method(s): For our hypothesis, we exposed A549 human lung epithelial cells to hyperoxia (95% O2) over time compared to normoxia (21% O2) in the presence or absence of 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6 mM ATRA. Cells were cultures in DMEM media containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For cellular proliferation, live cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Transcriptome responses were determined by RNAseq analyses. RNAseq analysis was carried out at Penn State's Functional Genomics Core. Significant transcriptome changes with a FDR of q<0.05 were obtained using IPA (www.qiagen.com/Ingenuity) to identify gene network. Pathway inhibition or activation was assessed by z-score standard deviation analysis of log2ratio normalized data. Result(s): Hyperoxia significantly reduced proliferation of A549 cells when compared to controls. Treatment with ATRA restored cellular proliferation after 48 hours in a concentration-dependent manner. Comparative analysis revealed 834 unique genes affected in hyperoxia, 1253 common genes in both hyperoxia and hyperoxia+ATRA and 601 unique genes in hyperoxia+ATRA compared to controls. Upstream pathway analysis revealed that ATRA suppressed pathways regulating oxidative stress and innate immune response pathways. Conclusion(s): Our findings show that ATRA relieves the block in cellular proliferation by hyperoxia. Furthermore, ATRA suppresses oxidant and inflammatory response genes to hyperoxia. Our findings support that ATRA supplementation may decrease oxidative stress and inflammatory response from hyperoxia-induced injury on the neonatal respiratory epithelium and alleviate development of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) leads to significant morbidity in Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW) infants. Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MYLK) gene encodes a smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) isoform that mediates cell movement and signaling in smooth muscle cells and a non-muscle (nmMLCK) isoform that affects the endothelial barrier integrity and plays a role in inflammation. The MYLK Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) rs820336 has been shown to affect smMLCK promoter activity and variation in its haplotype has been associated with sepsis and acute lung injury in adult studies. Our objective was to find if the smMLCK protein levels were significantly different in the tracheal aspirates of ELBW infants with and without BPD; or, with different allelic distribution of the MYLK SNP rs820336. Method(s): DNA was collected and isolated from ELBW neonates after obtaining parental consent. SNP genotypes were identified by RT-PCR using specific probes for eight MYLK gene SNPs including rs820336. Also, tracheal aspirates were obtained from the neonates during the first 7 days of life and MYLK protein levels in the tracheal aspirates were determined with MYLK ELISA (MBS102363, MyBioSource, San Diego, CA). BPD was defined as the need for Oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Mann-Whitney U test and t-test were performed for statistical analysis, with p<0.05 considered significant. Result(s): Table 1. Demographic Characteristics and MYLK protein levels in tracheal aspirates of ELBW infants with and without BPD Infants who developed BPD were of lower gestational age. There was no significant difference in MYLK protein levels in the tracheal aspirates of patients with and without BPD as shown in Table 1. When the median MYLK protein level in the tracheal aspirates was compared between the patients with homozygous wild-type alleles [7.52 (IQR 0.36, 8.56)] to those with any minor allele [9.97 (IQR 5.71, 12.27)] for the MYLK SNP rs820336, it was not significantly different either (p = 0.089). Conclusion(s): Our study did not find significant differences in MYLK (smMLCK) levels from the tracheal aspirates based on the diagnoses of BPD, as well as based on allelic distribution of MYLK SNP rs820336. We speculate that this lack of an expected differential expression may be due to a compartmentalized expression of smMLCK in smooth muscle cells.

AB  - Rationale: Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) promotes fetal lung development in mice and baboons. Normally, GRP levels drop postnatally, but remain elevated in newborns that develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease with interstital fibrosis and arrested alveolarization. In premature baboons, anti-GRP mAb2A11 abrogates BPD. Rodent BPD models could facilitate understanding of the kinetics of GRP-mediated signaling pathways leading to BPD. Mice are born at the canalicular stage of lung development, similar to ~24-28 weeks human gestation when BPD susceptibility peaks. Method(s): Timed-pregnant Swiss Webster mice were treated with continuous 75% O2 and biweekly injections of mAb MOPC21 (negative control IgG1) or mAb2A11. On day 18, right lungs were inflation-fixed overnight, then paraffin embedded. Alpha-smooth-muscle actin (SMA) immunostaining for myofibroblasts used alkalinephosphatase-conjugated mAb1A4 (Sigma-Aldrich) incubated overnight, then developed with Vector Red. Digitized 20x images were captured with 8-10 random images per mouse. Using ImageJ, the area-percent of SMA-positive alveolar tissue was calculated as: (total area of SMA+ alveolae)/(total alveolar tissue)x100%. Mean linear intercept (MLI) was measured to determine alveolar size using a fixed grid with lines totaling 1-mm: 1/(# air-tissue interfaces) x 1000, yielding mean distances between two air-tissue interfaces in microns. For statistics, data are shown as mean +/-SEM, calculated using one-way t-test, significance defined as p<0.05. Result(s): Normoxic mice +/-MOPC or 2A11, had area-percent SMA+ alveoli unchanged (5.1-6.3 +/-0.5-1.4). Hyperoxia+MOPC led to 3-fold increased SMA (15.6+/-2%). Hyperoxia+2A11 reduced SMA to 10.3+/-1.2%; P<0.01 comparing hyperoxia+2A11 vs. hyperoxia+MOPC. 2A11 had no effect on MLI with either normoxia or hyperoxia. We performed Affymetrix cDNA analysis of 18d lung RNA from hyperoxic mice treated with 2A11 or MOPC. mAb2A11 altered expression of >1000 genes (FC>10, P<0.05), many being potentially protective against newborn lung injury/fibrosis. Increased genes included: nucleoredoxin, an antioxidant related to thioredoxin (78x); surfactant protein A (140x); Tom20, outer mitochondrial transport protein that reduces lung injury (74x), and multiple other mitochondrial genes (>20x). Decreased genes included: Adam10, profibrotic (reduced to 5/100); amphiregulin, elevated in BPD (3/100); amyloid beta A4, toxic fragment (6/100); laminin B1 (2/100), which usually declines by birth; Tgfb1i4, profibrotic (2/100); and Stat1, profibrotic (2/100). Conclusion(s): After 18d exposure to 75% O2, newborn mice have >3-fold more interstitial myofibroblasts that are significantly reduced by mAb2A11. Many pulmonary genes are up-or down-regulated by mAb2A11 consistent with a multigenic downstream effect on reducing interstitial fibrosis via numerous interacting signaling pathways. Mice provide a useful model for continuing these preclinical investigations.

AB  - Rationale: Moderate hyperoxia is frequently administered to preterm infants in to treat hypoxia, increasing the risk of new bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Lung fibroblasts play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of alveolar structures during lung development and beyond. Thus understanding the mechanisms by which hyperoxia influences fibroblasts is critical. Cellular senescence is defined as complete and irreversible loss of replicative capacity occurring in primary cells, and is increasingly recognized to be important in multiple diseases. We hypothesized that moderate hyperoxia induces senescence in fetal lung fibroblasts, which may then play a role in lung injury, repair, and alveolar changes. In this study we investigated the effects of moderate hyperoxia (40%) on senescence in human normal primary cultured fetal lung fibroblasts. Method(s): Primary human fetal lung fibroblasts were isolated from canalicular stage (18-22 week gestation) lung tissue of human fetuses following fetal demise (StemCell Express; exempt per Mayo IRB). Cells were exposed to 40% or 21% O2 (normoxia) for 7 days. As a positive control cells were treated with etoposide (10muM) to induce senescence. Cellular senescence was evaluated by morphological changes, beta-galactosidase activity, MTS assay, cellular immunofluorescence of senescence markers, cell cycle analysis, Western blot of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers, and customized ELISA and real-time PCR of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Result(s): Moderate hyperoxia for 7 days significantly increased SA-beta-gal activity in primary fetal lung fibroblasts. Hyperoxia also decreased fibroblast proliferation and altered cellular morphology from the usual elongated phenotype to an irregular morphology with larger total cellular area. Additionally, hyperoxia increased mRNA and/or protein expression of senescent markers (p53, p21, p16) and DNA damage marker p-gammaH2ax. mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors (TNFalpha, IL-1, IL-8, MMP3, Col4a1) were elevated in fetal lung fibroblasts exposed to hyperoxia or etoposide. Matrix deposition of collagen I, III, IV and fibronectin were increased with hyperoxia or etoposide. Furthermore, moderate hyperoxia increased several senescence-associated secretory factors (PAI-1, IL1-alpha, IL1-beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) . Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that moderate hyperoxia induces senescence in primary fetal lung fibroblasts likely via the P53- P21 pathway as suggested by multiple markers. Cellular senescence induced by hyperoxia may play a role in abnormal repair of lung injury and development, contributing to the pathogenesis of new BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a major complication of premature birth. Although the underlying mechanism for the evolution of BPD has not been well elucidated, intra-alveolar inflammation caused by various factors such as perinatal infection, mechanical ventilation, and hyperoxia is considered to play an important role. While inhaled corticosteroid has been reported to reduce the incidence of BPD, routine use is not recommended due to its potential adverse effects on mortality. However, there is a distinct lack of robust biomarkers for BPD to aid early diagnosis and assess disease progression or responses to therapies. Extracellular microvesicles (MVs) carry a variety of molecules (proteins, lipids, RNAs, etc) as their cargo and their expression of surface markers allow us to identify parental cells, making them an informative biomarker in various inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated MV numbers and their subtypes within the alveolar space during the development of BPD in mice. METHOD(S): Newborn C57BL6 mice were exposed immediately following the birth either to hyperoxia (FIO2 0.8) or room air for up to 3 weeks. The mouse pups were euthanized at day 7, 14, or 21, and the lung was lavaged for analyses for cells and MVs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Development of BPD was evaluated by histology using mean linear intercept (MLI). Neutrophil-derived MVs were determined by their size (under 1mum), surface markers (CD45+CD11b+), and the sensitivity to detergent using flow cytometry. RESULT(S): Exposure to hyperoxia for 3 weeks well replicated characteristic pathologies of BPD in newborn mice, with a substantive increase in MLI (109.2+/-20 vs. 40+/-36 mum, n=3 each, p<0.01). Neutrophils in BALF significantly increased from day 14 in the hyperoxia group compared to normoxia (Figure 1a), while the number of alveolar macrophages was similar between hyperoxia and normoxia. Neutrophil-derived MVs in BALF increased significantly from day 7, prior to the increase of BALF neutrophil numbers (Figure 1b). CONCLUSION(S): We demonstrated, for the first time, that neutrophil-derived MVs increased within BALF from the very early stage of BPD. Our findings suggest that intra-alveolar neutrophil-derived MVs may serve as a useful early biomarker of BPD, which warrants further investigation.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a devastating pulmonary complication of respiratory failure in preterm infants, is the most common chronic inflammatory lung disease of prematurity. Exposure to mechanical ventilation and oxygen results in inflammation, a key pathogenic contributor to the development of BPD. The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), a key component of the extracellular matrix and the Receptor for HA-Mediated Motility (RHAMM, CD168) contribute to the inflammatory and fibrotic responses to acute lung injury, but the role of RHAMM in BPD has not been studied to date. We hypothesized that, compared to wild type (WT) mice, RHAMM knockout (KO) mice would be protected in a neonatal hyperoxia model of BPD. METHOD(S): WT and RHAMM KO mice were exposed to either normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) during the saccular phase of lung development from postnatal day (PN) 1 to PN5, and then maintained in normoxia until PN14. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cells from BAL, and lung tissue were obtained on PN7 and PN14. Lung morphometric evaluation included Radial Alveolar Count (RAC) in inflation-fixed lungs. Expression of IL1s in BAL was analyzed by ELISA and in lung tissue by qPCR. Neutrophils and macrophages in BAL cell pellets were quantified by myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-Acetyl Glucosaminidase (NAG) activities, respectively. RESULT(S):WT and RHAMM KO mice were similar at baseline. Compared to WT mice maintained in normoxia, WT mice exposed to hyperoxia had increased IL1s mRNA and protein(PN7, P <0.05), MPO (PN7, P <0.05) and NAG activities (PN14, P <0.05). Compared to WT mice in hyperoxia, RHAMM KO mice exposed to hyperoxia had less affected alveolarization (PN14), decreased MPO (PN7, P <0.05) and NAG activities (PN14, P <0.05), as well as decreased IL1s protein (PN7 and PN14, P <0.05). CONCLUSION(S): RHAMM KO mice are protected from the decreased alveolarization and increased inflammatory responses to neonatal hyperoxia. These data suggest that RHAMM is a potential therapeutic target to decrease the incidence and/or severity of BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Dysregulation of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling pathway is known to play a pivotal role during both the prenatal and postnatal development of the lung. TGF- beta signaling is also known to be one of the hallmarks of the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia which is characterized by stunted alveologenesis and perturbed vascular development in response to oxygen supplementation. To date, no study has addressed which cell types are involved in the dysregulation of the TGF-beta signaling in response to hyperoxia. To this end, reporter mice were generated to identify the cell types in which the TGF-beta pathway is differently regulated during normal and aberrant lung development. METHOD(S): To detect which cells expressed TGF-beta, a reporter line was generated for each of the three TGF-beta isoforms. For the gene encoding each TGF-beta isoform, a cascade was introduced into the stop-codon, containing the coding sequence of an enzymatic molecule (beta-galactosidase) a fluorescent molecule (mCherry), each flanked by a T2A sequence. For the generation of a TGF-beta reporter, was generated a construct containing an enzymatic molecule (alkaline phosphatase) a fluorescent molecule (yellow fluorescent protein) and T2A sequence under the control of a (CAGA)9 Smadbinding element, inserted into an HPRT element. RESULT(S): Flow cytometric analysis of singlecell suspensions prepared from the lungs of C57BL/6J mouse pups exposed to 85% O2 for the first 14 days of postnatal life revealed a three-fold increase in the percentage of TGF-beta1 positive cells compared with the control group. Similarly, a four- and two-fold increase, respectively, in the number TGF-beta2- and TGF-beta3-expressing cells was noted, after 85% O2 exposure. Hyperoxiainduced changes in TGF-beta ligand expression were most prevalent in EpCam+ cells (lung epithelium), although an impact of hyperoxia was also noted in CD73+ cells (stem cells), and ACTA2+ cells (smooth muscle cells, and perhaps myofibroblasts). And increase in TGF-beta responsiveness was also noted using an in vivo (CAGA)9 reporter. CONCLUSION(S): These data describe the generation of four new transgenic mouse lines which report activity of the most proximal (ligand) and most distal (gene expression) elements of the TGF-beta signaling system, which will be useful to investigators employing mouse models of lung disease.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects pre-term infants whose lungs are unable to support life outside of the womb. These babies receive therapeutic oxygen which compensates for poor lung function but also causes oxidative damage to lung epithelium, resulting in a simplified lung marked by larger and fewer alveoli. We identified thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) as a protein of interest in the pathogenesis of BPD since Trx1 is cytoprotective against hyperoxic cell death. Using a perinatal hyperoxic mouse model of BPD, pulmonary Trx1 activity inversely correlates with atmospheric oxygen tension following birth and hyperoxic treatment. Therefore, we tested if impairment of lung epithelial Trx1 promotes BPD pathogenesis. Trx1 floxed mice (Trx1fl) were bred to mice expressing cre recombinase driven by the surfactant protein C promoter (sftpc-cre) to generate a mouse with Trx1 deficient lung epithelial cells. Although expected genotypic ratios were detected at birth, lethality was noted in Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice as early as 14 days of age. The LD50 for Trx1 deficient mice was 20 days old, while Trx1 heterozygote littermates appeared normal (p<0.001, n=12-17). Upon autopsy, large air-filled pneumatoceles were noted across multiple lobes of Trx1fl/fl;sftpc-cre mice. Similar to BPD, Trx1 deficient mice had a simplified lung marked by an increase in mean linear intercept and airspace size with decreased airspace numbers and radial alveolar count. Similar to mice treated with perinatal hyperoxia, Trx1 deficient lungs had fewer alveolar type 2 cells detected by surfactant protein B and thyroid transcription factor 1 immunohistochemistry. This work demonstrates that impairment of Trx1 in lung epithelial cells causes respiratory pathologies consistent with BPD. Ongoing studies seek to define the temporal nature of lung pathogenesis and test the overarching hypothesis that Trx1 serves as a molecular sensor of atmospheric oxygen tension in lung epithelium during alveolar development and perinatal hyperoxic injury.

AB  - RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a devastating pulmonary complication of respiratory failure in preterm infants. We have established that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of BPD. Endogenous danger signals activate TLRs to increase the expression of pro-ILs and the NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase 1 to cleave pro-IL1s to mature IL1s. We have also shown that oligomeric hyaluronan fragments (oHA) are endogenous danger signals that activate the inflammasome and promote the production of mature IL1s. We have developed HA binding peptides (HABP) that block inflammation and fibrosis after acute lung injury with bleomycin. We hypothesized that HABP treatment of neonatal mice given hyperoxia during the saccular stage of lung development would be prevent the activation of TLRs and NLRP3 and therefore block inflammation in the mouse BPD model. METHOD(S): Neonatal mice (n=6-12) were exposed to 95% oxygen (O2) from postnatal day (PN) 1 to PN5 and then kept in 21% O2 until PN14. Mice were given HABP subcutaneously on PN1, 3, and 5. Mice were examined on PN7 and PN14. Cells obtained by lavage were studied by MPO activity for neutrophils and N-Acetyl Glucosaminidase activity for macrophages. Lung pro- IL1s was determined using IL1s mRNA and BAL mature IL1s was determined by ELISA. RESULT(S): Exposure to 95% O2 was associated with a 3-fold increase in MPO activity at PN7 (P<0.001) and a 2-fold increase in NAG activity at PN14 (P<0.001). IL1s mRNA and IL1s protein were both increased 3-fold at PN7. Treatment with HABP resulted in complete abrogation of the increased MPO activity, IL1s mRNA and protein at PN7 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Neonatal hyperoxia exposure during the saccular phase of lung development is associated with an activation of the TLR-NLRP3 inflammasome with increased IL1s and inflammation. Treatment with a peptide that blocks HA completely prevents the activation of this pathway. We speculate that HABP is a potential novel preventative therapy for BPD.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial and the clinical phenotype of BPD is extremely variable. Predicting BPD is difficult, as it is a disease with a clinical operational definition but many clinical phenotypes and endotypes. Most biomarkers studied over the years have low predictive accuracy, and none are currently used in routine clinical care or shown to be useful for predicting longer-term respiratory outcome. Targeted cellular and humoral biomarkers and novel systems biology 'omic' based approaches including genomic and microbiomic analyses are described in this review. Copyright © 2016.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease of infants and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening sequelae of this disease. Disrupted lung angiogenesis is a hallmark of BPD-associated PH. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2 is shown to modulate angiogenesis. Further, we observed that: hyperoxia exposure increases the expression of ERK 1 and 2 in neonatal mice; and pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 in primary fetal human pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) decreases in vitro angiogenesis. Whether ERK1 and/or ERK2 contributes to or mitigates experimental BPD and PH is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that endothelial ERK2-deficient neonatal mice will be more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH than their wild-type (WT) littermates. Method(s): In vivo studies: To disrupt endothelial ERK2 signaling, we decreased the expression of ERK2 in the mouse lung endothelial cells by breeding ERK2flox/flox mice with Tie-Cre mice. One-day-old endothelial ERK2-sufficient (eERK2+/+) or -deficient (eERK2+/-) mice were exposed to air (FiO2 21%) or hyperoxia (FiO2 70%) for up to 14 d, following which the lungs were harvested to determine angiogenesis and the expression of ERK1, ERK2, and several cytokines/chemokines. In addition, we performed echocardiography studies on PND14 to determine the independent and interactive effects of ERK2 gene and hyperoxia exposure on the following indices of PH: pulmonary acceleration time (PAT), RV ejection time (ET), PAT/ET, and RV systolic pressure (RVSP). In vitro studies: For translational studies, we used fetal HPMECs and determined the effects of ERK2 knockdown on angiogenesis and expression of ERK-1/2. Result(s): Lung ERK2 protein levels were lower in eERK2+/- mice than eERK2+/+ mice at basal conditions and upon exposure to hyperoxia. Importantly, the ERK1 protein levels were similar in eERK2+/- and eERK2+/+ mice. Hyperoxia exposure for 14 d independently decreased PAT and PAT/ET ratio and increased RVSP, indicating that hyperoxia induces PH. Further, hyperoxia independently increased lung inflammation and decreased lung angiogenesis. However, these effects of hyperoxia were augmented in the presence of endothelial ERK2 deficiency, indicating that endothelial ERK2 gene interacts with hyperoxia to potentiate the lung injury. Additionally, knockdown of ERK2 in HPMECs decreased in vitro angiogenesis signifying the importance of ERK2 for human lungs. Conclusion(s): Endothelial ERK2 signaling is necessary to mitigate hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD and PH in neonatal mice. Our results indicate that endothelial ERK2 is a potential therapeutic target for the management of BPD and PH in infants.

AB  - Introduction: Inflammation is the common pathway leading to Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. We previously demonstrated that depletion of CD11b+monocytes/macrophages in PN0 CD11b-DTR depleter mice resulted in severe hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI) with capillary leak and mortality by 40h of hyperoxia exposure. We hypothesized that monocyte/macrophage responses to pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the severity of HILI. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to identify novel and targetable inflammatory pathways in neonatal pulmonary monocytes/macrophages in early HILI. Method(s): HILI was used to model BPD in neonatal mice. Ly6Chi(N=6) and Ly6Clo(N=5) interstitial monocytes/macrophages (IM) were isolated by FACS from lungs of PN1 C57BL/6 mice exposed to RA or O2 for 24h. RNASeq was performed, and data analysis used R with the DESeq2 package to generate normalized gene counts and differential expression analysis. Gene enrichment analyses were performed with Enrichr. DT-treated CD11b-DTR+and DTR- littermate controls were exposed to HILI for 24h before histological analyses and sorting of Ly6Chiand Ly6CloIM for qPCR. Rescue experiments were performed with intranasal administration of 50ng recombinant IFN-gamma at PN0. Cellular sources of IFN-gamma were identified in Great mice (Jax 017581) using flow cytometry and the endogenous YFP reporter. Result(s): Depletion of 50% Ly6ChiIM but not Ly6CloIM was seen in DT-treated CD11b-DTR+mice treated with hyperoxia for 24h. Comparison of hyperoxia-induced changes in expression with known patterns of ligand-induced gene expression (LINCS) revealed significant upregulation of the IFN- gamma pathway in Ly6Chicells (Ccl5 gene) and downregulation of the IFN-gamma pathway in Ly6Clocells (NfatC and Add3 genes). When compared to Ly6Chicells, GOBP analysis of O2-exposed Ly6Clocells showed downregulation the IFN-gamma-mediated signaling pathway. Administration of intranasal IFN-gamma rescued DT-treated CD11b-DTR+depleter mice (with fewer Ly6ChiIM) from severe pulmonary hemorrhage and morbidity at 24h. Ifn-gammaalso decreased MMP9 mRNA in Ly6CloIM isolated from CD11b-DTR+mice. We identified endogenous sources of Ifn-gamma in the neonatal lung to be alveolar macrophages (AM, 5% of CD45+ cells), NK cells (0.5%), CD4+T cells (0.1%) Eosinophils (0.5%), dendritic cells (0.1%), Ly6ChiIM (1.3%), and Ly6CloIM (1.3%) with 3-fold hyperoxia-induced increases in AM and CD4+ Ifn-gamma. Conclusion(s): Through gene enrichment studies of RNASeq data and rescue of lung injury in DT-treated CD11b-DTR+mice, we found an unexpected protective role for IFN-gamma 24h after hyperoxia exposure. AM and/or CD4+-derived IFN-gamma may limit HILI through downregulation of IM-derived matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Rationale: Bronhocpulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by an arrest in lung development with severe impairment of alveolar septation and vascular development, increased fibroblast proliferation and pathological fibrosis. Premature male neonates are at a greater risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes are not known. Our preliminary results show that neonatal female mice have decreased expression of pro-fibrotic markers and improved alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development compared to male littermates in a murine model of BPD. Analysis of the pulmonary transcriptome suggests that the anti-fibrotic miRNA, miR-30a, may confer some of these sexspecific differences. The anti-fibrotic role of miR-30a has been reported previously in many disease states and organs. miR30a inhibits both the transcriptional regulator Snai1, which promotes fibrosis. We hypothesized that miR-30a decreases Snai1 expression in females and thus may attenuate pathological fibrosis in the developing lung. Method(s): Male and female neonatal WT and mir30-/- mice were exposed to hyperoxia (P1-P5; saccular stage of lung development) and euthanized on P7 or P21 after recovery in normoxia. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs; from 18-24 weeks gestation donors; 3 male and 3 female) were cultured in endothelial cell media per protocol. Cells from passage from 3 to 6 were used for experiments. For hyperoxic exposure, cells were incubated in 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 degreeC for upto 72 hours. Cells in normoxia were maintained in air and 5% CO2. miR-30a and Snai1 expression was measured. Snai1 expression was measured in HPMECs after miR-30a overexpression and inhibition. Result(s): miR-30a expression was markedly increase in expression in female neonatal mice at PND21, the same time point when expression of profibrotic mediators was significantly decreased in female mice. Compellingly, the female advantage in alveolarization and vascular development is lost, and expression of pro-fibrotic markers is increased, in miR30a-/- mice. Female WT neonatal mice showed significantly lower expression of Snai1 (mRNA and protein) in the lung after hyperoxia exposure at P7 and P21 compared to hyperoxia-exposed male mice. Upon hyperoxia exposure Snai1 expression was greater in HPMECs compared to normoxic controls and the male cells showed higher expression than female cells. Treatment with mir-30a mimic decreased, while treatment with miR-30a inhibitor increased Snai1 expression in HPMECs. Conclusion(s): miR-30a mediated down regulation of Snai1 may contribute to protection from hyperoxic lung injury in female neonatal mice and contribute to the sex-specific differences seen in BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Premature infants exposed to supplemental oxygen are at risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with long-term consequences including airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). BPD models have used neonatal hyperoxia to induce AHR, alveolar simplification, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous smooth muscle relaxant degraded in neonatal hyperoxia by elevated GSNO reductase (GSNOR) catabolism in the mouse lung (Molecular Pharmacology 2016). We have reported that global GSNOR knock-out mice were protected from hyperoxia-induced AHR and PH changes. We thus hypothesized that smooth muscle GSNOR is of functional importance to the AHR and PH outcomes, and that GSNOR[Flox] / alpha-smooth muscle actin[Cre] knock-out mice (GSM-/-) will be protected from AHR and PH. Method(s): Newborn C57BL/6 wild-types (background) or GSM-/- (conditional smooth muscle knockouts) were randomized on the first day of life to be raised in 21% or 60% oxygen for 3 weeks, then recovered in room air to 6 weeks of age. Using a rodent ventilator (flexiVent, SCIREQ), respiratory system resistance (Rrs) was measured in response to aerosolized methacholine challenge (MCh 0-200 mg/mL). Alveolar simplification (radial alveolar counts of hematoxylin and eosin staining) and pulmonary vessel muscularization (alpha-smooth muscle actin staining) were compared in inflation-fixed 5 mum lung sections by a masked technician. In separate animals, ventricular walls were dissected and weighed to assess for right ventricular hypertrophy (Fulton's Index = right ventricle / (left ventricle + intraventricular septum)). Result(s): Neonatal hyperoxia resulted in AHR and PH changes in wild-type adult mice: Rrs responses to MCh, alveolar counts, pulmonary vessel hypertrophy, and right ventricular hypertrophy were significantly different compared to room air controls (p<0.05). Hyperoxia-exposed GSM-/- mice were protected from pulmonary vessel and right ventricular hypertrophy, but unlike global GSNOR knockout mice, they were not protected from alveolar simplification or AHR (p<0.05 vs room air controls). Conclusion(s): These studies show that hyperoxia-exposed GSM-/- mice are protected from end-organ PH changes but not BPD alveolar simplification or AHR. We speculate that despite BPD lung changes, augmented GSNO vaso-relaxation from absent enzymatic catabolism in arterial smooth muscle prevented the development of pulmonary vessel and right ventricular hypertrophy. Conversely, GSNOR deletion in airway smooth muscle did not protect against AHR, indicating airway tethering and/or continued GSNO catabolism in the airway epithelium contributes to hyperoxic AHR - where GSNO possibly represents an epithelial derived relaxing factor. GSNO-based therapies may serve as novel treatments for patients with BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in infants which can lead to pulmonary hypertension (PH) in adolescence and adulthood. This is corroborated by previous reports showing that neonatal hyperoxic exposure caused PH in mice. Endothelial-tomesenchymal transition (EndoMT), a biological process where endothelial cells (ECs) progressively lose their specific markers and gain mesenchymal phenotype, participates in the pathogenesis of PH. It has been shown that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) augments the EndoMT in ECs. This was attenuated by enhancing FAO via overexpression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), a rate-limiting step of the carnitine shuttle. However, no information is available on whether hyperoxic exposure reduces FAO, resulting in EndoMT in lung ECs. We hypothesized that hyperoxic exposure causes EndoMT by modulating FAO in lung ECs, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in mice. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL/6J mice (<12 h old) were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 72 h, which were allowed to recover in air for up to 60 days. MicroCT scan, trichrome, vWF and alpha-SMA staining were performed in lungs. Mouse fetal lung EC line (MFLM-91U) and primary lung microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) for 24 h. Some cultures were placed in air for 1or 3 days post exposure (air recovery). FAO was determined using the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer by measuring mitochondrial respiration of cells in the presence of etomoxir (4 muM), and the Scintillation Counter by measuring the release of 3H2O from the oxidation of [9,10-3H(N)]-palmitic acid. Result(s): Simplified vascularization, perivascular fibrosis, reduced vessel numbers, as well as increased Fulton index (i.e., the ratio of right ventricular weight to left ventricular plus septal weight) and alpha- SMA expression in pulmonary vessels were observed in mice exposed to hyperoxia at newborns. The levels of mesenchymal cell markers (i.e., vimentin, CD44, Snail, Slug, Twist1, and alpha-SMA) were increased, whereas the EC markers (i.e., PECAM-1/CD31 and CD34) were reduced in lung ECs exposed to hyperoxia followed by air recovery (O2/rec). FAO was reduced in lung ECs exposed to O2/rec. Gene deletion of Cpt1a further aggravated O2/rec-induced CD34 reduction and Slug increase, while enhancing FAO by L-carnitine (0.5 mM, 12h) attenuated O2/rec-induced increase in Slug mRNA levels in lung ECs. Conclusion(s): Neonatal hyperoxic exposure results in pulmonary vascular and right ventricular remodeling in mice. Hyperoxic exposure causes EndoMT, and enhancing FAO rescues this phenotype. These findings provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying PH in BPD patients.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease that affects infants when normal lung development and function is interrupted due to hyperoxiainduced endothelial dysfunction, vascular injury and impaired alveolarization in lungs. Adiponectin, an adipokine secreted by the adipose tissue, has been recognized as a key regulator of lung endothelial cell function and inflammation in several lung diseases, however, the role of adiponectin in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) and BPD is largely unknown. In this study, we explored the role of adiponectin in hyperoxia-induced endothelial dysfunction, lung injury and BPD. Method(s): We used bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues collected from room air (21% oxygen) and hyperoxia (60% oxygen) exposed to wildtype (WT) and adiponectin (APN)-/- newborn mice. In addition, we used human lung tissues collected at various stage of BPD development. Lung inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vascular injury and lung morphometric analyses (mean chord length, radial alveolar count, septal thickness and branches) were performed on these specimens. Result(s): We detected reduced adiponectin protein level in lungs of neonatal mice (**P<0.01) as well as in lung endothelial cells (***P<0.001) exposed to hyperoxia as compared to room air. We also confirmed decreased adiponectin level in lung tissues from human neonatal lungs at various stage of BPD. Hyperoxia exposure to adiponectin-deficient (APN-/-) mice showed severe BPD phenotype, as demonstrated by decreased angiogenesis (**P<0.01), impaired pulmonary vasculature, and alveolar simplification as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. We showed that WT hyperoxia mice treated with adiponectin attenuated endothelial dysfunction, improve alveolarization as manifested by decreased mean linear intercept (**P<0.01) and increased angiogenesis as demonstrated by the enhanced level of angiopoietin-1 (*P<0.05) in lungs. Conclusion(s): These results show that reduced adiponectin levels in lungs during hyperoxia exposure increases endothelial dysfunction, vascular injury and impairs normal alveolarization in developing lungs. Further, we show that hyperoxia exposed neonatal mice treated with exogenous adiponectin attenuates endothelial dysfunction, lung injury and improve alveolarization in the developing lung by promoting angiogenesis.

AB  - Introduction: Inflammation has been associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Levels of tracheal aspirate pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 are higher in premature infants who develop BPD. We previously demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces hypoalveolarization in newborn mice (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 197: A7388, 2018). We have also shown that platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression is decreased in BPD (Am J Physiol 2014). In this study, we hypothesize that intranasal LPS exposure of immature mice inhibits expression of PDGFRalpha and its downstream targets in a TLR4-dependent manner, thereby disrupting lung alveolarization. Method(s): Immature C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with 3ug/10ul of LPS from E. coli O26:B6 or 10ul of PBS intranasally on day of life 3, 5, 7, and 10. Selected mice were treated with the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 intraperitoneally. Lung alveolar growth was assessed by lung morphometry. Whole lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR, ELISA and immunostaining. Mouse fetal lung explants and human neonatal lung mesenchymal cells were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of mouse or human recombinant TNF-alpha respectively. Premature infant tracheal aspirate levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-23 were measured by multiplex. Result(s): Inoculation of immature mice with LPS intranasally induced lung mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-17A and reduced mRNA expression of Pdgfra, Fgf7 and Pdgfrb, each of which are involved in alveolarization and vasculogenesis. The effect on Pdgfra, Fgf7 and Pdgfrb mRNA expression was most significant 4 days after inoculation with either a single or multiple doses of LPS. Recombinant TNF-alpha reduced airspace chord lengths of mouse E16 fetal lung explants and decreased PDGFRalpha expression in human neonatal lung mesenchymal cells. Finally, treatment with the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 protected immature mice from chronic LPS exposure-induced hypoalveolarization, preventing increases in alveolar chord length and attenuating the LPS effect on IL-17A and PDGFRalpha expression. Furthermore, premature infant tracheal aspirate levels of IL-17A and IL-23 were higher in infants developing BPD and positively correlated with TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that in immature mice, LPS induces a proinflammatory response, which reduces the expression of PDGFRalpha and its downstream targets and impairs lung alveolar growth in a TLR4- dependent manner. TNF-alpha was sufficient for hypoalveolarization. Future studies will determine the mechanisms by which TLR4-dependent proinflammatory signals control the expression of PDGFRalpha and its downstream targets and affect lung growth during LPS exposure.

AB  - Introduction Airway microbial dysbiosis and neutrophilic inflammation are associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Our group has previously found that airway gamma proteobacteria abundance is increased and lactobacilli abundance decreased in infants developing severe BPD. The mechanism by which airway microbial dysbiosis contributes to BPD is poorly understood. We hypothesized that airway microbial dysbiosis leads to neutrophilic inflammation causing BPD-like phenotype in mice. Method(s): 1. Gnotobiotic (GN; germ-free) mice and non-GN (NGN)mice were exposed to normoxia (21% O2) versus hyperoxia (85% O2) for baseline comparison. 2. GN and NGN mice were monocolonized with gamma proteobacteria (E coli 1X 106 cfu/20ul of saline intranasally) versus saline at P3, P6 and P9 and P12 to determine the effect of proteobacteria monocolonization in both 21% and 85%. 3. GN and NGN mice exposed to 85% O2 + gamma proteobacteria (double hit model of BPD-JCI Insight, 2018; PMID: 29515035) were treated with a respiratory probiotic combination (total 1X 106 cfu/20ul of saline intranasally) versus saline at P3, P6, P9 and P12 to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the respiratory probiotic combination. Lungs were harvested for histology, protein, and RNA following pulmonary function test (PFT) in a subset of mice at P14. Echocardiograms were performed at P28. Markers and modulators of neutrophilic inflammation were estimated. Result(s): 1. GN mice in 85% O2 showed protected lung development (RAC) and function (PFT) compared to NGN mice in 85% O2. NGN mice lungs in 21% O2 vs 85% O2 showed no baseline differences in microbial diversity and abundance based on 16S sequencing and bioinformatics. 2. Gamma proteobacteria monocolonization in NGN and GN mice induced alveolar hypoplasia (decreased RAC), decreased function (PFT), increased markers of neutrophilic inflammation (Ac-PGP, MPO, neutrophil counts), and evidence of pulmonary hypertension (echocardiogram) in both 21% O2 vs 85%. 3. Respiratory probiotic combination treatment in the double hit BPD murine model, improved lung structure, decreased neutrophilic inflammation, improved lung function and decreased signs of pulmonary hypertension. Conclusion(s): Airway microbial dysbiosis (increased gamma proteobacteria and decreased respiratory probiotic bacteria) cause neutrophilic inflammation leading to BPD in mice. Use of respiratory probiotic combination provides therapeutic benefits in murine BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in preterm infants that disrupts the developmental program of the lung. The pathologic hallmarks of BPD are hyperoxia-induced pulmonary inflammation, increased cell death culminating in impaired alveolarization and dysregulated vascularization of the lung. To date, there is no specific and effective prevention or treatment of BPD. AyuVis Research has synthesized a series of proprietary novel immunomodulatory small molecules derived from food ingredients, which were tested in mice models of BPD. Methodology: To emulate the clinical BPD model in mice, newborn pups (postnatal or PN1-saccular stage of lung development) were exposed to either moderate (60%) or severe (100%) hyperoxia for 4 consecutive days (till PN4) followed by recovery in room air (alveolar stage of lung development) till PN14. On PN2 and PN4, the nanosuspension of the test compound (referred to as AVR-NP111) were administered intranasally at a dose of 20uM. We also tested AVR-48 administered intra-peritoneally. On PN14, the pups were euthanized to collect the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lungs, heart and serum for morphometry, flow cytometry, biochemical and physiological assays. Result(s): AVR-NP111 had a promising effect on BPD pups as was evident by normalization of lung morphology (mean +/- SEM, chord length: 50+/-2 vs 60+/-2.5 mum; septal thickness: 9+/-1.8 vs 13+/-2.2 mum; radial alveolar count: 9+/-2 vs 12+/-3 in treated BPD versus control BPD, respectively; all p<0.05) and vasculature (vwF staining). Several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1beta, TNF-alpha, MIP2, IL6, IP10) were downregulated (all p<0.05) whereas the anti-inflammatory IL10 was upregulated (p<0.01) in both moderate and severe BPD models treated with AVR-NP111. There was significantly decreased BAL protein (4.5+/-3.0 vs 6.25+/-5 mug/ml; p<0.01) and total cell counts (4.2 +/- 4.7 vs 6 +/- 3.5 x 105; p<0.05) in the BAL fluid in the AVR-NP111 treated BPD versus control BPD group. We had similar results using AVR-NP48. Flow cytometry confirmed that the drug did not alter the innate immunity markers (CD3, CD4, CD45, CD19, NK1.1) of newborn pups, and blood gas measurements had significantly higher pO2 values (p<0.05) in the AVR-NP111 treated BPD lungs as compared to controls. Conclusion(s): AVR compounds are a promising therapeutic target for this pediatric disease for which no treatment is available. Detail toxicokinetic studies are in progress to test the efficacy and safety of AVR-NP compounds to be selected and tested in larger animal models for translational extrapolation.

AB  - Rationale: We have shown that sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1)/sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) signaling contribute to hyperoxia induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) like morphology in neonatal mice. Sphk1-/- mice showed protection against hyperoxic lung injury accompanied by reduced collagen deposition in alveolar septae. Global deletion of Sphk1 in mice reduced expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a matrix modifying enzyme that promotes collagen deposition in lung tissue. Objective(s): To explore the mechanism by which SPHK1/S1P signaling pathway regulates LOX expression and its role in the pathogenesis of BPD. Method(s): Three day old wild type (WT) mouse pups were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia (75% oxygen) for 7 days, while being treated with the SPHK1 inhibitor PF543 or placebo. Lung injury and alveolar simplification was evaluated. LOX expression was determined by Western blotting. In vitro experiments were performed using human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) which were transfected with scrambled or SPNS2, S1P1 or STAT3 siRNA (50 nM, 48 h) to interrogate the S1P signaling pathway. Human tracheal aspirates were studied for LOX expression and S1P levels. Result(s): Tracheal aspirates from new born babies with BPD had significantly increased expression of LOX and elevated S1P levels in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Administration of PF543 (2.5mg/kg body weight) once a day to WT neonatal mice conferred protection against hyperoxia-induced BPD and reduced expression of LOX in lung tissue and LOX activity in BAL fluid. HLMVECs exposed to hyperoxia showed increased expression and activity of LOX in cell lysate and supernatant respectively which was inhibited by PF543. Hyperoxia-induced LOX expression was down regulated by S1P antibody, siRNA for S1P1 and STAT3. Further, PF543 attenuated hyperoxia-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus. Conclusion(s): Downregulation of SPHK1 or inhibition of SPHK1 activity reduced expression of LOX mediated via S1P1 and STAT3 signaling in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Very pre-term infants (VP) at <32 weeks post menstrual age PMA have a high incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia BPD. BPD places them at risk for pulmonary-related perioperative complications from general endotracheal anesthesia GE during elective inguinal hernia repair., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was done to compare pulmonary-related perioperative risks between VP patients undergoing non-emergent inguinal hernia repair prior to NICU discharge under GE (n=58) vs regional anesthesia RA (n=37)., RESULTS: Median PMA (RA 26 vs GE 27 weeks), operative weight (RA 2.2 vs GE 2.27 kg), % with BPD, medical and surgical comorbidities, number of concurrent procedures are similar between groups, except for sac laparoscopy (0% RA vs 36% GE). Procedural anesthesia time was 40 minutes for RA vs 69 minutes for GE, (p < 0.001). GE (17%) vs RA (0%) remained intubated post op (p<0.001). Oral feeding was fully tolerated in RA (97%) vs GE (72%, p=0.002) by 48h after surgery. The statistical differences hold after regression analysis controlling for sac laparoscopy and procedure time. No difference in intraoperative or postoperative hernia complications is found., CONCLUSION: RA is safe. RA is associated with early resumption of full feed, avoidance of prolonged mechanical intubation. We recommend a randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy of GE vs RA in VP infants undergoing elective NICU inguinal hernia repair., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II Retrospective study.

AB  - Rationale: Prematurely born infants, especially infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have a high risk of asthma later in life. Supplemental oxygen therapy is a risk factor for BPD and long-term respiratory symptoms. Hyperoxic exposure induces lung epithelial cell necrosis. Clec9a, a C-type lectin selectively expressed on lung CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), is a receptor that binds necrotic cell exposed cytoskeletal actin filaments (F-actin). Co-stimulation of Clec9a and TLR3 enhances DC maturation and Th1 cell differentiation. We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice (a model of BPD) increases lung IL-12-producing Clec9a+CD103+ DCs, pro-inflammatory responses and airway hyperreactivity following rhinovirus (RV) infection (J Immunol 2016). CD103+ DCs and Clec9a signaling are required for hyperoxia-induced enhanced inflammatory responses to RV (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 195: A6386, 2017). Hyperoxia increases the dead cell number and F-actin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We hypothesize that, in hyperoxic mice, necrotic cell cytoskeletal actin filaments induce Clec-9a-dependent CD103+ DC activation and that gelsolin, an F-actin severing protein, prevents DC-mediated pro-inflammatory responses to RV. Method(s): 2 day-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to normoxia or 75% oxygen for 10 days and treated with human gelsolin or control intranasally. Two days after the exposure completed, mice were inoculated with RV intranasally. Alternatively, normoxic 14 day-old C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with BALF from hyperoxia-exposed mice (hyperoxic-BALF), RV and gelsolin or control. Two days after RV infection, lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. For in vitro studies, bone marrow-differentiated DCs or lung CD11c+ cells were isolated from C57BL/6J or Clec9agfp-/- mice and incubated with necrotic cells or hyperoxic-BALF. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Result(s): Upon incubation with necrotic cells, bone marrow-differentiated CD103+ DCs from C57BL/6J mice showed induction of CD86 and IL-12 expression, indicating pro-inflammatory activation. Similarly, incubation of lung CD11c+ cells from WT mice with hyperoxic-BALF induced CD86 and IL-12 expression in CD103+ DCs, a subset of the CD11c+ cells. Bone marrow-differentiated CD103+ DCs and lung CD103+ DCs from Clec9agfp-/- mice were protected from this effect. Furthermore, in mice, gelsolin treatment during hyperoxic exposure attenuated RV-induced lung mRNA expression of Il12p40, Ccl2, Tnfa, Clec9a, Irf8 and Cd86. Similar effects were observed when gelsolin was co-administered with hyperoxic-BALF and RV. Conclusion(s): Hyperoxia-induced soluble factors lead to Clec9a dependent activation of CD103+ DCs. Human gelsolin prevents the hyperoxia-induced enhanced pro-inflammatory response to RV and holds promise as a potential new therapy for viral-induced exacerbations of BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Exposure to Br2 at industrial or transportation sites due to release via accidents or by malicious intent is a significant threat to public health. We have shown that exposure of neonatal mice (postnatal day 3; P3) to Br2 (400 ppm, 30 min, or 600 ppm, 30 min in environmental chambers) induces exposure level-dependent alveolar remodeling, persistent lung inflammation and decreased lung compliance, similar to what is observed in murine models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at P14 (Jilling et al, AJP Lung Cell Mol Physiol, 2017, PMID:28912380). ATG has been shown to improve alveolar development in a neonatal murine model of BPD (Li et al, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 2016, PMID:27089175) and HPX was shown to alleviate Br2 exposure induced lung injury in adult mice (Aggarwal et al, Antioxid Redox Signal 2016, PMID:26376667). Herein we aimed to determine whether co-administration of ATG+HPX 1h after exposure of neonatal mice to Br2 at P3 will improve lung function, arterial oxygenation and growth as tested at P14. METHOD(S): Exposure of neonatal mice at P3 performed as above and weights were measured daily. At P14, lung function by flexiVent, inflammation by real time PCR analysis of mRNA from lung samples and arterial oxygenation by Element POC (Heska) from arterial blood (aorta). RESULT(S): P14 weights decreased from 8.0+/-0.3g in air-exposed mice (AIR) to 4.1+/-0.4g in Br2 exposed treated with vehicle (BrVEH; P<0.0001) and partially recovered to 6.5+/-0.4g (mean +/-S.EM) in Br2 exposed HPX+ATG (Br+A+H; P<0.01 vs BrVEH) treated mice. Quasi-static compliance decreased from 0.050+/-0.003 mL/cmH2O in AIR to 0.035+/-0.003 mL/cmH2O in BrVEH (P<0.001) and improved in Br+A+H to 0.058+/-0.03 mL/cmH2O (P<0.05 vs BrVEH). Arterial partial pressure of O2 decreased form 88.4+/-7.3 mmHg to 44.5+/-8.7 mmHg in BrVEH (P<0.01) and improved to 76.5+/-5.2 mmHg in Br+A+H (P<0.05 vs BrVEH). The inflammatory cytokine mRNA-s for IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNFalphaand chemokine CXCL1 were significantly increased in BrVEH vs AIR and decreased to the level of AIR in BR+A+H. SUMMARY: These data suggest that combination treatment with ATG+HPX may be effective to ameliorate neonatal Br2 exposure-induced altered lung development and function.
