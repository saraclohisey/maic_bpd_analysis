AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the effect of the HMGB1 peptide on Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-related lung injury in a mouse model., RESULTS: HMGB1 peptide ameliorates lung injury by suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and decreasing soluble collagen levels in the lungs. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the peptide suppressed the hyperoxia-induced inflammatory signature in macrophages and the fibrotic signature in fibroblasts. These changes in the transcriptome were confirmed using protein assays., CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of HMGB1 peptide exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in a mouse model of BPD. This study provides a foundation for the development of new and effective therapies for BPD. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale: The timing of lung maturation is precisely regulated and likely controlled by complex genetic and cellular programs. Lung prematurity associated with preterm birth frequently results in respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which remain the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. The mechanisms synchronizing gestational length and lung maturation remain to be elucidated. Method(s): A genome-wide mRNA expression time-course study (E15 to Postnatal Day 0) was designed using lung RNAs from C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J mice that differ in gestational length by ~30hr. Comprehensive bioinformatics and functional genomics analyses were used to identify key regulators, bioprocesses and transcriptional networks controlling lung maturation. Result(s): Both temporal and strain dependent gene expression patterns were identified during lung maturation. For time dependent changes, cell adhesion, vasculature development, and lipid metabolism/transport were major bioprocesses induced at E16-E17. CEBPA, PPARG, VEGFA, CAV1 and CDH were found to be key regulators of these processes. Innate defense/immune responses were induced at later gestational ages (E19-20), STAT1, AP1, and EGFR being key regulators of these responses. Cell cycle and chromatin assembly were repressed during lung maturation and were regulated by FOXM1, PLK1, chromobox, and high mobility group families of transcription factors. Strain dependent mRNA expression differences peaked at E18.5. At this time, mRNAs regulating surfactant and innate immunity were more abundantly expressed in lungs of B6 than in A/J mice, while genes involved in chromatin assembly and histone modification were expressed at lower levels in B6 than in A/J mice. Prior to birth, innate immune responses and surfactant production were critical and connected processes that contributed to lung maturation necessary for air breathing after birth. Epigenetic regulators played a repressive role by altering chromatin structure and controlling the cell cycle. The precise balance of these positive and negative gene networks is likely a critical determinant of the timing of lung maturation that differs in the B6 and A/J mouse strains. Conclusion(s): The present study systemically mapped key regulators, bioprocesses, and transcriptional networks controlling lung maturation, revealing insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying lung maturation.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of preterm birth associated with significant morbidity. BPD is a debilitating condition characterized by inflammation, enlarged airspaces, vascular dysmorphia and aberrant extracellular matrix accumulation that is typically described as arrested lung development. Rodent models involving neonatal exposure to excessive oxygen concentrations (hyperoxia) have been used to study the mechanisms contributing to BPD pathology. Transcriptomic assessment of the effects of hyperoxia in neonatal mouse lungs using RNASeq will help to identify genes and pathways associated with BPD. Material(s) and Method(s): Whole lung tissue from newborn C57BL/6 mice exposed to 100% oxygen for 10 days (n=8) and room air-exposed age matched controls (n=6) were compared. Total RNA was isolated from individual whole lung tissues (n=14) and pooled in duplicates to perform transcriptome Sequencing (RNA-seq). Alignments were generated using multiple algorithms (CASAVA; TopHat; and SHRiMP). Raw counts obtained from each alignment algorithm (using HT-Seq) were further and filtered to remove undetected genes. Differentially expressed genes were detected using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and CuffDiff2, on each version of mapped and normalized data. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for pathway and network analyses. Expression patterns for selected genes were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Result(s): 248 genes were identified as differentially expressed between hyperoxia and control samples by both SAM (median FDR = 0) and CuffDiff2 (p<0.05) and had a fold-change <= 2. We successfully validated 17 of 24 genes by qPCR. Canonical pathways significantly dysregulated in hyperoxia lungs included Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress signaling, p53 signaling, hepatic fibrosis and sildenafil pathways. Interestingly most genes significantly affected following hyperoxia exposure (~70%) showed a pattern of expression consistent with an arrest in lung development. A subset of the genes dysregulated in hyperoxic neonatal mouse lungs, were also differentially expressed in human BPD lung tissue. Conclusion(s): We have identified genes dysregulated in mouse of BPD-like pathology. Further analysis of these data will enhance our current knowledge of BPD, and may be useful for developing novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the most common adverse outcomes of extreme preterm birth, can be caused by oxygen-related lung injury and is characterized by an arrest in alveolar development. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) prevent and rescue lung injury when administered exogenously in animal models of BPD. Given the regenerative potential of MSCs, it is unclear why resident lung MSCs (L-MSCs) do not support lung repair and growth in BPD. We hypothesized that in vivo hyperoxia exposure perturbs the repair potential and gene expression in CD146+ endogenous lung MSCs in an oxygen-induced rat model of BPD. Method(s): Rat pups were exposed to 21% or 95% oxygen from postnatal day 0 to 10 and sacrificed on day 12. L-MSCs were isolated by enzymatic digestion, Ficoll-purification and plastic adherence. CD146+ L-MSCs were isolated through magnetic bead selection and characterized according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy criteria. Epithelial repair potential was tested by scratch assay, angiogenesis potential by network formation assay. Microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.1 ST array, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software. Result(s): Hyperoxia exposure decreased CD73 expression in CD146+ L-MSCs 2-fold, but not colony forming capacity and other surface marker expression. CD146+ L-MSCs promoted epithelial wound healing over baseline by 25% over 24 hours, regardless of in vivo hyperoxia exposure. Network formation was decreased by ~25% in endothelial cells exposed to conditioned media from hyperoxia CD146+ L-MSCs. GSEA analysis revealed that gene expression of the axonal guidance cue and CDC42 pathways were most strongly increased after in vivo hyperoxia. Among the decreased gene sets, most notably fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway were decreased. Conclusion(s): Exposure to hyperoxia in vivo lowered CD73 and JAK/STAT expression, indicating decreased immune-regulatory function and repair capacity. Increased axonal guidance cue signaling and decreased FGF signaling would indicate a halt in alveolar growth and development signaling from the mesenchyme. This is further supported by a decrease in angiogenesis potential. These changes in endogenous L-MSCs likely reflect both their role in normal lung development, immune regulation and repair, and possibly their dysfunction in BPD. A better understanding of endogenous MSCs may lead to improved effectiveness of exogenous MSC therapy.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by attenuated alveolar and vascular development. Supraphysiologic oxygen exposure, though necessary for survival, contributes to the development of BPD in premature infants. The thioredoxin reductase-1 (Txnrd1) inhibitor aurothioglucose (ATG) improves lung development in a murine BPD model. The present studies evaluated the effects of hyperoxia and pharmacologic TXNRD1 inhibition on pulmonary gene expression. Newborn C57B1/6 pups were treated with saline or ATG (25 mg/kg, i.p.) and maintained in room air (21% O2) or hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 72h. Following euthanasia, lungs were either inflation-fixed for H&E staining, or collected for RNA-sequencing. Purified RNA from lung tissue was checked for quality, then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System. Differential expression was calculated with DeSeq, and functional enrichment was identified via ToppFun (ToppGene). Histologically, hyperoxia-exposed lungs exhibited qualitative decreases in branching morphogenesis and increases in macrophage numbers. ATG treatment preserved branching morphogenesis and attenuated macrophage infiltration following hyperoxic exposure. Consistent with visual findings, ATG treatment altered the expression of genes known to regulate angiogenesis and vascularization. Specifically, ATG-dependent alterations were detected for 53 genes, including increases in Apold1 (0.7747-fold), Nfe2 (0.7317-fold), Klf4 (0.5920-fold), SIPR1 (0.5882-fold), and BMP2 (0.5276-fold) expression. These alterations are currently being validated by qRT-PCR. Our data suggest that ATG attenuates hyperoxia-induced alterations in angiogenesis. To further assess these alterations, morphometry and quantitation of vessel density are currently ongoing. These findings support the potential utility of Txnrd1 inhibitors to improve lung development in prematurely born infants.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common neonatal chronic lung disease occurring in premature infants due to ventilation and supplemental oxygenation. Lungs of BPD patients are characterized by growth arrest, alveolar hypoplasia and dysmorphic pulmonary circulation. No treatment for BPD is currently available. Preclinical studies uncovered the healing potential of cell-based therapies, in particular mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Recent studies suggest an existence and potential repair capacity of resident lung (L)MSCs. In this study we have utilized two most commonly used rodent models of BPD characterized by alveolar hypoplasia and impaired lung vascularization: ventilation induced lung injury (VILI) and exposure to 85% normobaric hyperoxia. Using a single-cell RNA sequencing approach we identified the resident Sca1+ (Stem cell antigen-1+) cell population in the lungs of healthy and aberrantly developing mice on postnatal day (P) 3, P7 and P14. Population of Seal + cells increased with age in all lungs diseased lungs and was increased by hyperoxia at all time points investigated. Sca1+ LMSCs isolated from both, healthy and BPD mouse lungs, expressed characteristic stem cell markers (CD90, CD146, CD105), fibroblast-like phenotype in culture and showed an ability to form colonies in vitro. Moreover, LMSCs conditioned media increased migration of epithelial cells in vitro and both, LMSCs conditioned media, as well as LMSCs-derived exosomes induced network formation and spheroid sprouting in vitro. Our data suggest that LMSCs are able to modulate angiogenesis and may play a role in normal late lung development as well as in an aberrant development associated with BPD.

AB  - Background: Animal studies have shown that a leukocyte influx precedes the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature sheep. The CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD because of the predominance of CXCR2 ligands in tracheal aspirates of preterm infants who later developed BPD. Purpose(s): To test the effect of CXCR2 antagonist on postnatal systemic and pulmonary inflammation and alveolarization in a newborn Sprague-Dawley rat model of BPD. Method(s): Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into the newborn rats on postnatal day 1 (P1), P3, and P5 to induce systemic inflammation and inhibit alveolariza tion. In the same time with LPS administration, CXCR2 antagonist (SB-265610) or vehicle was injected i.p. to investigate whether CXCR2 antagonist can alleviate the detrimental effect of LPS on alveolarization by attenuating inflammation. On P7 and P14, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from the pups. To assess alveolarization, mean cord length and alveolar surface area were measured on 4 random nonoverlapping fields per animal in 2 distal lung sections at x100 magnification. Result(s): Early postnatal LPS administration significantly increased neutrophil counts in BALF and PB and inhibited al-veolarization, which was indicated by a greater mean cord length and lesser alveolar surface area. CXCR2 antagonist significantly attenuated the increase of neutrophil counts in BALF and PB and restored alveolarization as indicated by a decreased mean cord length and increased alveolar surface area in rat pups exposed to early postnatal systemic LPS. Conclusion(s): CXCR2 antagonist preserved alveolarization by alleviating pulmonary and systemic inflammation induced by early postnatal systemic LPS administration. These results suggest that CXCR2 antagonist can be considered a potential therapeutic agent for BPD that results from disrupted alveolarization induced by inflammation.Copyright © 2021, Korean Pediatric Society.

AB  - Alveologenesis is the most important and the least understood phase of lung development. Alveolar defects underlie both neonatal and adult lung diseases. Their arrested development is found in infants with BPD (BronchoPulmonary Dysplasia), while their destruction is characteristic of emphysematous lungs in adult COPD. We have developed 3 parallel, postnatal genetically-based models to analyze the molecular basis of alveologenesis. Conditional postnatal inactivation of genes encoding receptors for TGFb, or PDGFA or IGF1 in a unique cell type we have identified as Secondary Crest Myofibroblasts, or SCMF blocks alveologenesis & produces a phenotype similar to human BPD. We reasoned that due to nearly identical phenotypes, the three BPD phenocopy models must share genetic elements whose role in alveologenesis is indispensable. To test this hypothesis, we have isolated mutant and control SCMF and identified their transcriptomic profile by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data identified "pathway-specific" differentially expressed genes (DEG) for TGFb, PDGFA/PDGFRa and IGF1 mutant models. Most importantly however, as predicted, we identified a cluster of "shared" genes which we propose contains conserved core alveologenesis regulatory genes. The accumulated evidence reveals a constellation of genes that makeup the genetic architecture of alveologenesis in mice with relevance to pathogenesis of BPD in human preterm neonates.

AB  - Rationale Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of the premature infant following respiratory support, e.g., oxygen supplementation, and characterized by impaired alveolar and microvascular formation and a higher risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prior studies identified IL-6 signaling being central in clinical and experimental BPD. Since inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular and bronchial disease, we now investigate the functional role of IL-6 in vascular and bronchial remodeling in experimental BPD. Methods (1) Neonatal WT, IL-6 knockout mice (IL-6 ) as well as WT mice with pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis (IL-6 mAb) - and trans (sgp130-Fc) signaling were exposed to hyperoxia (85% O , HYX) or normoxia (21% O , NOX). Lungs were excised and used either for molecular biology studies or for histomorphometric analysis. (2) Primary murine bronchial smooth muscle cells (pmBSMCs) were exposed to hyperoxia and IL-6/sIL-6 receptor (IL-6+R), followed by assessment of viability and proliferation. Results (1) Histomorphometric analysis revealed a thickening of the vascular and bronchial wall of WT compared to WTNOX . WTHYX mice showed reduced microvascular formation and a higher number of partly and completely muscularized small vessels (20-100 micrometer) compared to WT . Moreover, the number of vascular KI-67+ /aSMA+ cells and the amount of aSMA cells per vessel, both indicators of proliferation, were higher in WTNOX than in WTHYX . In contrast, IL-6 deficiency (IL-6 ) and pharmacological inhibition of IL-6 cis- and trans-signaling protected from hyperoxia-induced vascular and bronchial remodeling, but not from reduced microvascularization. (2) Exposure of pmBSMCs to HYX decreased viability compared to NOX. While IL-6+R decreased viability of pmBSMCs under NOX, we detected an increase under HYX. Finally IL-6+R increased proliferation of pmBSMCs under both NOX and HYX. Conclusion Our data demonstrate a critical role of IL-6 signaling in vascular and bronchial remodeling via hyperproliferation of SMCs.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Although inflammation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the triggers, receptors and signaling pathways of the immune cells that respond to exogenous signals such as hyperoxia in the premature lung are incompletely understood.Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor expressed by macrophages and monocytes in the lung. Upon activation, TREM2 can induce p53, a transcription factor (TF) involved in DNA repair or apoptosis. In lung infections, TREM2 has been reported to regulate macrophage function. However, its role in BPD is not known. Our objective was to investigate the role of TREM2 and its downstream TF, p53 in lung macrophages and monocytes during hyperoxia exposure in the developing lung. Methods Used: C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen) between postnatal day 1 and 14. Gene expression changes were measured by single-cell RNAseq and bulk RNAseq of whole lung. To determine the functional importance of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes we used Trem2-deficient mice (TREM2 KO). To identify transcription factor binding sites we used ChIPseq. Protein expression was measured by immunoblot. Lung histology was assessed with H&E stained slides. RNAseq and ChIPseq data were analyzed with HOMER. Summary of Results: Unbiased genomic assessment using single-cell RNAseq showed that hyperoxia exposure upregulates Trem2 in three myeloid subsets; alveolar macrophages (AM), interstitial macrophages (IM) and monocytes. We next determined the functional importance of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes using TREM2 KO mice. Trem2-deficiency resulted in a marked improvement of the lung architecture. Gene expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the p53 pathway after hyperoxia in WT mice as compared to TREM2 KO mice. We validated these findings on the protein level by immunoblot. As predicted by the RNAseq results, hyperoxia exposed WT mice had higher p53 levels than the room air controls. In TREM2 KO mice, hyperoxia exposure did not induce significant changes in p53 protein levels. ChIP-seq analysis identified a significantly increased binding of p53 to active gene regions in the lungs of hyperoxia exposed mice. Conclusion(s): These data suggest that TREM2 is not merely a hyperoxia associated marker but an essential driver of the injury and abnormal lung development after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. Trem2 deficiency and the lack of p53 activation were associated with a protective phenotype. We propose that activation of the TREM2-p53 axis in myeloid cells is part of a dysregulated, injury-induced immune response that derails lung development, and that blocking TREM2 will results in lung regeneration and repair. The selective expression of TREM2 in lung macrophages and monocytes, makes this receptor a highly attractive target for immunotherapy. Furthermore, an inhibitory anti-TREM2 antibody is available and its therapeutic value is currently being tested in phase one clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) predisposes to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterized by abnormal alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development, in preterm neonates. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure is used to recapitulate the phenotype of human BPD in murine models. Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD, but the main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes at single-cell resolution are unknown. Objective(s): To investigate sex-specific and cell-type-specific transcriptional changes that drive injury in the neonatal lung exposed to hyperoxia at single-cell resolution. Method(s): We used single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) to generate transcriptional profiles of >40000 cells isolated from the lungs of C57BL/6 mice exposed to 95% oxygen between PND1-5 and their littermate controls. Viable single cells were isolated by FACS at PND7 (n=3/gp). Library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Sequencing data were mapped to mm10 and quantified using GENCODE. Data normalization, cell type clustering, and marker gene identification, and hyperoxia response gene signatures were performed using Seurat. Gene ontology analysis was done with Metascape. Result(s): scRNA-seq identified 27 clusters in both hyperoxia-exposed and control lungs consistent with distinct populations of endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. The proportion of AT1, monocytes, and neutrophils increased in hyperoxia-exposed mice. In contrast, AT2, ciliated epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells, and alveolar macrophages were decreased. Notably, proliferating endothelial and epithelial cells were most susceptible to hyperoxia and were dramatically decreased. Strikingly, males showed a greater decrease in AT2 cells, while females in pericytes, in response to hyperoxia exposure. Differential gene expression analysis identified the most pronounced hyperoxia-induced changes in Car4+ capillary endothelial cells and interstitial macrophages. Sexual dimorphism was noted in the enrichment of biological pathways in Car4+ capillary endothelial cells. Females showed activation of vessel morphogenesis, while males in oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Conclusion(s): These novel findings provide evidence that neonatal hyperoxia exposure results in significant changes in the cellular composition of the lung and induces cell-type-specific transcriptional changes in all major cellular compartments of the lung. The disproportional decrease of proliferating endothelial and epithelial cells provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the abnormal lung development observed after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. Furthermore, we highlight the sex-specific differences in cell distribution and cell-specific transcriptional profiles in the neonatal lung. The remarkable heterogeneity in cell-specific response to neonatal hyperoxia has important implications for the identification of novel targets for future disease modification or prevention.

AB  - The chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication in preterm infants. It is characterized by alveolar hypoplasia and dysmorphic vasculature. Changes in cellular composition and gene expression underlying the development of BPD are not fully understood. Here we created a detailed temporal map of normal and aberrant late lung development using single-cell RNA sequencing on lung cells from 36 mice at postnatal days (P) 3, 7 and 14. BPD was mimicked by exposure to hyperoxia (85% 02). The MULTI-seq labeling was used in order to minimize experimental bias and increase the reproducibility. A total of 66.200 cells were analyzed throughout three crucial time points of late lung development, across which we identified 1 mesothelial, 5 epithelial, 6 stromal, 5 endothelial, 8 myeloid and 9 lymphoid cell clusters. All cell compartments followed developmental trajectories and hyperoxic exposure impaired the composition and expression patterns in all compartments. Specifically, hyperoxia impaired epithelial surfactant homeostasis and halted fibroblasts maturation. The number of capillary endothelial cells was significantly reduced, suggesting that hyperoxia impairs endothelial maturation at a critical stage of capillary development. Hyperoxia altered lung macrophage populations by reducing the number of homeostatic alveolar macrophages and diminishing the proliferating macrophages. Additionally, we identified the effector cells of the innate immune response, thought to orchestrate pivotal processes resulting in lung impairment. Understanding the temporal changes on transcriptional level provides new means to study the pathogenesis and novel therapies for BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) significantly increases risk of infections, asthma and COPD in children and adults born preterm. Chorioamnionitis is the most common identifiable cause of preterm labor, and affected preterm infants often require postnatal treatment with oxygen (O2). Animal studies have implicated immune system dysregulation as an important contributing factor to short-term and long-term respiratory comorbidities associated with BPD. However important limitations of these studies are that postnatal hyperoxia exposure alone was used to incite lung injury during development, and assays were performed using whole lung homogenates. Since clinical BPD is often multifactorial, with prenatal insults likely priming the developing lung to postnatal insults, we sought to evaluate the pulmonary immune cell responses in a clinically relevant model of BPD by exposing the developing lungs to prenatal chorioamnionitis and postnatal hyperoxia followed by analysis of resident immune cells of the lung. Method(s): Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with intra-amniotic LPS (1ug) or normal saline (NS) at 20 days of gestation. Upon delivery, pups were placed in hyperoxia chamber with 85% O2 or room air (RA) for 14 days. Rat lungs were harvested on postnatal day 14. CD45+ immune cells were isolated from single cell suspensions of the lung using fluorescent activated cell sorting. Lungs were also inflation fixed with 10% formalin for histological analyses Total RNA was extracted from immune cells and genome-wide microarray screening was performed using Affymetrix WT-plus Rat Clariom S Gene chip. Result(s): Lungs from animals treated with prenatal LPS and postnatal O2 had significantly higher mean linear intercept indicative of alveolar simplification (Fig1A). Percentage of CD45+ immune cells as a fraction of all pulmonary cells was similar between the two groups. Analysis of differentially expressed genes with FDR < 0.01 and expression fold change > 2, revealed 85 upregulated genes and 137 downregulated genes (Fig1B). Gene ontology and ingenuity pathway analysis of upregulated genes was enriched for biological processes involved in connective tissue replacement chemotaxis and migration of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and granulocytes. In contrast analysis of downregulated genes showed significant enrichment of biological processes involved in T cell receptor V(D)J recombination, T cell co-stimulation, regulatory T cell differentiation and B cell differentiation. Furthermore, genes known to regulate angiogenesis and vascular development were also differentially expressed. Conclusion(s): Pulmonary immune cell responses to combined prenatal and postnatal insults may contribute to aberrant connective tissue replacement, adaptive immunity and angiogenesis seen in BPD.

AB  - Purpose of study Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease most commonly seen in preterm infants as a result of long-term mechanical ventilation and oxygen exposure. The pathogenesis resulting in BPD is not completely understood. Studies using postmortem BPD lung tissue have shown that there is altered expression of a number of devel-opmentally important genes. Methods used We generated three independent genetic models of BPD-like phenotype by disrupting the signaling pathways of TGFb, PDGFa, and IGF-1 in neonatal lung in mice. The mutations to disrupt the pathways were induced in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) whose role is critical for normal alveologenesis. RNAseq analysis was performed which identified a cluster of differentially expressed genes that were common amongst the three BPD-like phenotypes. To assess the physiologic relevance of a specific subset of the identified genes, we examined their expression in a well-established hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolization mouse model. We analyzed gene expression using a total of ten mice exposed to hyperoxia compared to eight combined controls at three different points during neonatal life. mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Summary of results Expression of Foxq1, Foxd1, Foxc2 were decreased in the mouse BPD lungs suggesting a role for the selected genes in the pathogenesis of BPD. We further demonstrate that Foxd1 is expressed in SCMF and ablation of SCMF during alveologenesis via Foxd1-cre arrests alveolar formation leading to a BPD-like phenotype. To validate our findings in the mouse model, we show that Foxd1 is also reduced in human BPD lung tissue. Conclusions Collectively, these observations support the notion that disruption of Foxd1 and FOX family transcription factors may play a major role in the pathogenesis of BPD in preterm infants. This study was supported by NHLBI and The Hastings Foundation.

AB  - Rationale: Supplementary oxygen leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, a disease characterized by lung growth arrest and matrix remodeling. We demonstrated that hyperoxia reduces Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a key transcription factor in cell biology. Since myofibroblasts are crucial in lung injury and remodeling, we investigated the functional role of Klf4 in the pathogenesis of BPD and in the homeostasis of lung fibroblasts. Method(s): (1) Newborn C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 85% 02 (HYX) or 21% 02 (NOX) until postnatal day 28 (P28). (2) Primary neonatal murine lung fibroblasts (pnF) were transfected with a Klf4 overexpressing plasmid or siRNA technique for overexpression (OE) and knockdown of Klf4 (del), respectively, and exposed to HYX or NOX. (3) BiolD (Proximity-dependent Biotin Identification) and CHIP-Seq were performed. Result(s): (1) Reduced Klf4 expression in lungs after HYX was associated with an activation of TGFs signaling and an increase of myofibroblasts, promoting thereby matrix remodeling. (2) TGFs inhibited Klf4 expression in cultured pnF Klf4del decreased migration, induced proliferation and increased mRNA expression of matrix markers (Ctgf, Collai & Col4a1) and Pdgfra (myofibroblasts). In contrast, Klf40E increased adhesion, but reduced proliferation, apoptosis, migration and expression of fibrotic genes in pnF (3) Finally, BiolD and CHIP-Seq identified a novel Klf4 interactome that regulates FoxOI transcriptionally and its activation via acetylation. Conclusion(s): Our data unveil a novel Klf4-Fox01 axis in lung fibroblasts that could promote matrix remodeling and lung growth arrest in lungs with BPD.

AB  - RATIONALE: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapies have shown promise in preclinical models of pathologies relevant to newborn medicine, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We have reported that the therapeutic capacity of MSCs is comprised in their secretome, and demonstrated that the therapeutic vectors are exosomes produced by MSCs (MSC-exos)., OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy of MSC-exo treatment in a preclinical model of BPD and to investigate mechanisms underlying MSC-exo therapeutic action., METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from media conditioned by human MSC cultures. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (HYRX; 75% O2), treated with exosomes on Postnatal Day (PN) 4 and returned to room air on PN7. Treated animals and appropriate controls were harvested on PN7, -14, or -42 for assessment of pulmonary parameters., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: HYRX-exposed mice presented with pronounced alveolar simplification, fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was effectively ameliorated by MSC-exo treatment. Pulmonary function tests and assessment of pulmonary hypertension showed functional improvements after MSC-exo treatment. Lung mRNA sequencing demonstrated that MSC-exo treatment induced pleiotropic effects on gene expression associated with HYRX-induced inflammation and immune responses. MSC-exos modulate the macrophage phenotype fulcrum, suppressing the proinflammatory "M1" state and augmenting an antiinflammatory "M2-like" state, both in vitro and in vivo., CONCLUSIONS: MSC-exo treatment blunts HYRX-associated inflammation and alters the hyperoxic lung transcriptome. This results in alleviation of HYRX-induced BPD, improvement of lung function, decrease in fibrosis and pulmonary vascular remodeling, and amelioration of pulmonary hypertension. The MSC-exo mechanism of action is associated with modulation of lung macrophage phenotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a neonatal chronic lung disease characterized by impaired pulmonary alveolar development in preterm infants. Until now, little is known about the molecular and cellular basis of BPD. There is increasing evidence that lncRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis during lung organogenesis. The potential role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of BPD is unclear. This study aims to clarify the role of MALAT1 during the process of BPD in preterm infants and illustrate the protective effect of MALAT1 involved in preterm infants., METHODS: We assessed the expression of MALAT1 in BPD mice lung tissues by reanalyzing dataset GSE25286 (Mouse GEO Genome 4302 Array) from gene expression database gene expression omnibus (GEO), and verified MALAT1 expression in BPD patients by realtime q-PCR. Then the role of MALAT1 in regulating cell biology was examined by profiling dataset GSE43830. The expression of CDC6, a known antiapoptopic gene was verified in BPD patients and the alveolar epithelial cell line A549 cells in which MALAT1 was knocked down. Cell apoptosis was determined by FACS using PI/Annexin-V staining., RESULTS: The expression of MALAT1 was significantly evaluated in lung tissues of BPD mice at day 14 and day 29 compared to WT (P < 0.05). In consistent with mRNA array profiling analysis, MALAT1 expression level in blood samples from preterm infants with BPD was significantly increased. Bioinformative data analysis of MALAT1 knockdown in WI-38 cells showed various differentially expressed genes were found enriched in apoptosis related pathway. Down-regulation of antiapoptopic gene, CDC6 expression was further verified by q-PCR result. PI/Annexin-V apoptisis assay results showed that MALAT1 knocked down in the alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) promotes cell apoptosis., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that up-regulation of lncRNA MALAT1 could protect preterm infants with BPD by inhibiting cell apoptosis. These data provide novel insights into MALAT1 regulation which may be relevant to cell fate and shed light on BPD prevention and treatment.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily members are key regulators for lung development and progress of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The mechanisms by which lipoxin A4 (LXA4) attenuates development of BPD have not been clarified. Neonatal murine BPD models were inducted by hyperoxia treatment. Neonatal mice were exposed to room air or 85% O2 hyperoxia with or without treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 or anti-TGF-beta antibodies. Mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12 cells) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3 cells) were cultured in room air or 85% O2 followed by treatment of LXA4, anti-TGF-beta antibodies, and let-7c mimic/anti-microRNA transfections. Treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies both attenuated the mice alveolar simplification induced by hyperoxia. Hyperoxia treatment significantly altered pulmonary basal mRNA and protein expressions of several important extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM remodeling proteins including fibronectin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), elastin, tenascin C, collagen I, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies suppressed the mRNA and protein expressions of TGF-beta1 and TGF-betaR1 but not TGF-betaR2 in the lungs exposed to hyperoxia. Treatment with LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies alleviated hyperoxia-induced injury of the NIH/3T3 cells identified by morphologic observation and flow cytometry, and expressions of ECM, ECM remodeling proteins, and TGF-beta1 signaling pathway, but reversed by transfection with let-7c anti-miRNA. LXA4 upregulated the let-7c expression in MLE-12 cells, transfection with let-7c anti-miRNA, inhibited the LXA4-induced let-7c expression in MLE-12 cells exposed to hyperoxia and reduced the relative luciferase activity of let-7c binding with let-7c binding sites of the TGF-betaR1 3' UTR. Treatment with 5S,6R-methyl-LXA4 and anti-TGF-beta antibodies significantly improved histology, ECM, and ECM remodeling proteins in the lungs isolated from the murine BPD model induced by hyperoxia. The LXA4-imparted protective effects on hyperoxia-induced lung injury are mediated by upregulation of let-7c and inhibition of TGF-beta1 and subsequent downregulation of TGF-beta1 signaling pathway.

AB  - miR-21 has been confirmed to be overexpressed in neonatal rat lungs with hyperoxia-mediated bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The specific function of miR-21 in BPD is still unclear. We established the hyperoxia-induced BPD rat model in vivo and the hyperoxia-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) model in vitro. Transwell assay was utilized to detect the migratory capability of PMVECs. Tube formation assay was utilized to measure angiogenesis ability. ELISA was utilized to test nitric oxide (NO) production and the intracellular and extracellular Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentration. Furthermore, the interaction between miR-21 and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) was evaluated using luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-21 expression in PMVECs was increased by hyperoxia stimulation. Inhibition of miR-21 improved the migratory and angiogenic activities of PMVECs and overexpression of miR-21 exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-21 increased NO production and decreased intracellular and extracellular ADMA concentration in hyperoxia-treated PMVECs. Next we proved that miR-21 could bind to DDAH1 and negatively regulate its expression. Rescues assays showed that DDAH1 knockdown reversed the effects of miR-21 depletion on hyperoxia-mediated PMVEC functions, NO production, and ADMA concentration. Importantly, miR-21 downregulation restored alveolarization and vascular density in BPD rats. This study demonstrates that inhibition of miR-21 improves pulmonary vascular responses in BPD by targeting the DDAH1/ADMA/NO pathway.Copyright © 2022 the author(s).

AB  - Rationale: Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but the main mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes are unknown. To distinguish sex differences caused by gonadal hormones versus sex chromosome complement (XX versus XY), at single-cell resolution, we used the four Core Genotype mice (FCG). In the FCG model Sry is a transgene and is not present on the Y chromosome, so that XX and XY mice can each have either testes (with Sry, XXM or XYM) or ovaries (without Sry, XXF or XYF). Sc-RNA-seq was used to elucidate the sex-specific transcriptomic differences in coding genes in the lung in vivo in a model of murine neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, mapping affected genes to biological pathways. We hypothesized that hormonal and sex chromosome mechanisms interact in the sexspecific modulation of biological pathways in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): Neonatal FCG mice were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-4: saccular stage) or room air and euthanized on PND5. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to generate transcriptional profiles of >40000 cells isolated from the lungs of C57BL/6 mice exposed to 95% oxygen between PND1-5 and their littermate controls. Viable single cells were isolated by FACS at PND5 (n=3/gp). Library preparation was completed on the Chromium 10X system. Sequencing data were mapped to mm10 and quantified using GENCODE. Data normalization, doublet removal, cell type clustering, and marker gene identification, and hyperoxia response gene signatures were performed using Seurat. Result(s): scRNAseq identified 31 cell clusters in both hyperoxia exposed and control lungs consistent with distinct populations of endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal and immune cells. Marked differences were seen in the immune and endothelial cell subpopulations due to the hyperoxia exposure and the responses further varied based on the gonadal/chromosomal sex. Specifically, in the distal alveolar endothelial cell (aCap and gCap) cells, distinct cellular transcriptomes were identified based on the gonadal or chromosomal sex. Genes related to endothelial to mesenchymal transition (Col4a2, Col4a1), Apoptosis (Bax) and p53 pathway (p21) were enriched in the hyperoxia exposed aCap and gCap cells. The distal alveolar epithelial cells are more vulnerable to hyperoxia exposed lung injury in chromosomal males (XXM and XYM) compared to chromosomal females (XXF and XYF). Conclusion(s): Sex hormones and sex chromosomes may cause sexspecific differences in the pathogenesis of BPD in premature neonates. Elucidation of these molecular mechanisms will lay the foundation for future sex-specific treatment strategies.

AB  - Introduction: Oxygen therapy is common in premature neonates and adult patients with chronic lung diseases. Although the effects of hyperoxia in the adult lung remain unclear, in neonates it can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The distinct and common effects of hyperoxia on the neonatal and adult lung are yet to be explored. We aimed to determine these effects in healthy neonatal (HN) and adult (HA) mouse lungs. Method(s): In vivo, P5-7 and 82-week adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia(FiO2=0.4) or room air(RA, FiO2=0.21) for 2 and 8h(n=4/group). RNA extracted from lungs was isolated and hybridized in Mouse Whole Genome Arrays. A post-hoc of 109 oxidative stress response (OSR) genes was done. Statistical significance for differentially expressed genes (DEG) between groups was set at False Discovery Rate 0.05 based on t-tests. Result(s): Compared to RA mice, 19 distinct DEG in HN and 82 in HA mice were found, with most changes occurring at 8h (HN 14DEG; HA 80DEG). Contrary to HN, O2 induced downregulation (62DEG at 2h, 66 at 8h) in HA at 2h and 8h. OSR gene analysis, showed greater regulation in HN than in HA(66 vs 48 genes) at 2 and 8h. In addition, we found that in HN, O2 evoked marked upregulation of glutathione peroxidases like GPX2, 3 and GSTP1, and other OR genes i.e. PRDX5, APOE, SQSTM1. In contrast, only HSPA1A and SOD2 were distinctly regulated in HA. Conclusion(s): In HA, O2 induces regulation of more genes than in HN. However, among OSR genes, HN exhibited more transcriptomic changes. A greater response in HN could be driven by an increased susceptibility of the immature lung to hyperoxia. Moreover, the distinct signatures in HN and HA point to differential age-dependent effects of hyperoxia.

AB  - [Objective] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that typically affects infants delivered at a gestational age of <30 weeks. Although surfactant replacement therapies and gentle ventilation are common strategies for preventing BPD-related lung injury, they have limited efficacy. Relatively new approaches using mesenchymal stem cells tMSCs) have shown promise as potential curative therapies. Previously, we showed that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1), released from injured tissue, induced regeneration through activating platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha-positive bone-marrow MSCs. Our another work also identified and synthesized a critical domain in HMGB1 that induces regeneration. In this study, we tested whether the HMGB1 peptide can ameliorate BPD-related lung injury. [Methods] We used a well-characterized mouse BPD model created with a hyperoxic chamber. Briefly, normoxic mouse pups were kept in room air, and hyperoxic mouse pups were raised in hyperoxic chambers v90% 02) from birth until postnatal day 14. Pups were administered with either HMGB1 peptide or saline on Postnatal 4,8 and 12. Mice were sacrificed at P14 for detailed evaluations. [Results] HMGB1 peptide significantly rescued BPD-related decreases in body weight and survival. The treatment also restored alveolar structure via suppressing inflammation and fibrosis in the lung. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the lung further showed that the peptide significantly suppressed a hyperoxia-induced inflammatory signature in macrophages and fibrotic signature in fibroblasts. These changes in the transcriptome were also confirmed at the protein level. [Conclusion] Our data show that treatment with the HMGB1 peptide suppressed inflammation and fibrosis, thus preventing BPD progression.

AB  - PURPOSE: Oxygen therapy is often required to treat newborn infants with respiratory disorders. Prolonged exposure of neonatal rats to hyperoxia reduced alveolar septation, increased terminal air space size, and increased lung fibrosis; these conditions are very similar to those of human bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia development., METHOD: We reared Sprague-Dawley rat pups in either room air (RA, n = 24) or an atmosphere containing 85% O2 (n = 26) from Postnatal Days 1 to 14. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was used to analyze genome-wide DNA methylation in lung tissues of neonatal rats. Hyperoxia-exposed rats exhibited larger air spaces and thinner septa than RA-exposed rats did on Postnatal Day 14. The rats exposed to hyperoxia exhibited significantly higher mean linear intercepts than did the rats exposed to RA. We applied MeDIP next-generation sequencing for profiling changes in DNA methylation in the rat lungs exposed to hyperoxia and RA. We performed bioinformatics and pathway analyses on the raw sequencing data to identify differentially methylated candidate genes., RESULTS: Our in vivo model revealed that neonatal hyperoxia exposure arrested alveolarization on Postnatal Day 14. We found that the ErbB, actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion signaling pathways are epigenetically modulated by exposure to hyperoxia. We demonstrated that hyperoxia exposure contribute in delaying lung development through an epigenetic mechanism by disrupting the expression of genes in lungs that might be involved in alveolarization., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that aberrant DNA methylation and deregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion pathways of lung tissues may be involved in the pathophysiology of hyperoxia-induced arrested alveolarization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sphingosine- 1-Phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid and an intracellular as well as an extracellular signaling molecule. S1P ligand specifically binds to five related cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-5). S1P levels are tightly regulated by its synthesis catalyzed by sphingosine kinases (SphKs) 1 & 2 and catabolism by S1P phosphatases, lipid phosphate phosphatases and S1P lyase. We previously reported that knock down of SphK1 (Sphk1 -/- ) in a neonatal mouse BPD model conferred significant protection against hyperoxia induced lung injury. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed on mouse lung tissue using Affymetrix MoGene 2.0 array., RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA analysis was performed and differentially expressed genes under hyperoxia were identified using Sphk1 -/- mice and their wild type (WT) equivalents. Pathway (PW) enrichment analyses identified several signaling pathways that are likely to play a key role in hyperoxia induced lung injury in the neonates. These included signaling pathways that were anticipated such as those involved in lipid signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage/apoptosis, inflammation/immune response, and cell adhesion/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We noted hyperoxia induced downregulation of the expression of genes related to mitotic spindle formation in the WT which was not observed in Sphk1 -/- neonates. Our data clearly suggests a role for SphK1 in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury through elevated inflammation and apoptosis in lung tissue. Further, validation by RT-PCR on 24 differentially expressed genes showed 83% concordance both in terms of fold change and vectorial changes. Our findings are in agreement with previously reported human BPD microarray data and completely support our published in vivo findings. In addition, the data also revealed a significant role for additional unanticipitated signaling pathways involving Wnt and GADD45., CONCLUSION: Using SphK1 knockout mice and differential gene expression analysis, we have shown here that S1P/SphK1 signaling plays a key role in promoting hyperoxia induced DNA damage, inflammation, apoptosis and ECM remodeling in neonatal lungs. It also appears to suppress pro-survival cellular responses involved in normal lung development. We therefore propose SphK1 as a therapeutic target for the development drugs to combat BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Diseases that distort the lung structure, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung fibrosis are characterized by disrupted alveolar morphology. Understanding the process of lung alveolarization might help to develop new therapeutic strategies for these diseases. Cells expressing adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP), known as lipofibroblasts, have been demonstrated to impact lung alveolarization: Rationale: The present study aims to characterize the cell-lineage of ADRP positive cells (ADRPlin) by elucidating the molecular signature and contribution to mouse lung cell populations during alveolarization. Method(s): Using a Plin2tm1.1(creERT-2)/mort/+; Gt(Rosa)mtmg/+ transgenic mouse model ADRP-positive (ADRP+) cells were labeled at postnatal day (P) 1 by a single tamoxifen intraperitoneal injection. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) was performed on 8791 and 9095 ADRP-lineaged (ADRPlin) cells respectively from P7 and P14 mouse lungs. High-quality imaging was carried out on 150 mum sections from P7 and P14 mouse lungs using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Result(s): Using sc-RNAseq seven major cell clusters were identified. These clusters of the ADRPlin mainly covered epithelial as well as mesenchymal and vascular cell populations during late lung development. High-quality imaging confirmed cell type features of identified cell clusters. Moreover, two subpopulations of lipofibroblasts were identified: ADRP-high expressing and Tcf21-high expressing mesenchymal lipofibroblasts. Conclusion(s): Exploring the molecular signature of the ADRPlin different cell populations were identified during alveolarization. Further in silico analyses will give insights into possible functions and characteristics of identified cell clones. Comparing the nature of the two different identified lipofibroblast subpopulations might contribute to a better understanding and better targeting of lipofibroblasts during alveolarization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine infection/inflammation plays an important role in the development of lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, While a multifactorial genesis is likely, mechanisms involved in BPD after intrauterine infection/inflammation are largely unknown. Recent studies have suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) are likely to play a role. Therefore, this study aimed to study the effects and mechanisms of intrauterine infection/inflammation on lung development, and to identify miRNAs related to lung injury and BPD., METHODS: An animal model of intrauterine infection/inflammation was established with pregnant SD rats endocervically inoculated with E.coli. The fetal and neonatal rats were observed at embryonic day (E) 17, 19, 21 and postnatal day (P) 1, 3, 7, 14, respectively. Body weight, lung weight, the expression levels of NLRP3, TNF-alpha, IL-lbeta, IL-6, VEGF, Collagen I, SP-A, SP-B and SP-C in the lung tissues of fetal and neonatal rats were measured. Expression profiles of 1218 kinds of miRNAs in the lungs of neonatal rats were detected by miRNA microarray technique. Target genes of the identified miRNAs were predicted through online software., RESULTS: Intrauterine infection/inflammation compromised not only weight development but also lung development of the fetal and neonatal rats. The results showed significantly increased expression of NLRP3, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, Collagen I, and significantly decreased expression of VEGF, SP-A, SP-B and SP-C in the fetal and neonatal rat lung tissues in intrauterine infection group compared to the control group at different observation time point (P < 0.05). Forty-three miRNAs with significant differential expression were identified. Possible target genes regulated by the identified miRNAs are very rich., CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine infection/inflammation results in lung histological changes which are very similar to those observed in BPD. Possible mechanisms may include NLRP3 inflammasome activation followed by inflammatory cytokines expression up-regulated, inhibiting the expression of pulmonary surfactant proteins, interfering with lung interstitial development. There are many identified miRNAs which target a wide range of genes and may play an important role in the processes of lung injury and BPD.

AB  - Supplemental oxygen is administered to premature infants having pulmonary insufficiency However, hyperoxia contributes to the development of BPD in these infants. The molecular mechanisms of abnormal lung development are not completely understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure of newborn rats to hyperoxia for 7 days, followed by normoxia for another 15 days, will lead to differential time-dependent alterations in gene expression in pathways that are relevant to oxidative stress and abnormal lung development. We also assessed the effect of vitamin A treatment in addition to hyperoxic exposure. Newborn Fisher 344 rats were exposed to hyperoxia (95%) or room air from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 8 and animals were either sacrificed on PND 8, or were returned to normoxia and were sacrificed at PND 22. Within each rearing condition, half of the pups were assigned to receive daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections from P1-P5 of either 2mg/kg vitamin A dissolved in corn-oil or vehicle (corn-oil, 33mL/kg) alone. Total RNA was isolated from individual animals (n=3), and gene expression profiling was studied using RNA-seq on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform Gene expression data was quantile normalized and analyzed using the DESeq2 software significance was achieved for q<0.2 and linear fold change exceeding 1.25x. We identified genes significantly changed and in opposite direction on PND 22, comparing hyperoxia to normoxia group, and hyperoxia plus vitamin A compared to the hyperoxia group, and then determined enriched pathways (hypergeometric test, q<0.2). Nitric oxide (NO) pathways were enriched in the hyperoxia exposed rats at both PND7 and PND22. In particular, Gene Ontology (GO) NO-mediated transduction was enriched with fdr=0.025, including suppressed genes such as Nos1 (0.17 fold), Neurod1 (0.21 fold), Kcnc2(0.10 fold), and increased genes such as Ddah2(1.42 fold). Gucy1a3 (1.26 fold). Another pathway was GO nitric oxide synthase, with fdr=0.002, including induced genes such as Npr3 (1.37 fold), Gsk3b (1.33 fold), and suppressed genes such as Il1b (0.51 fold) and Fcer2 (0.39 fold). Finally, VEGFA pathway was modulated in hyperoxia at both PND 7 and PND22, including genes such as Ppp3r2 (0.13 fold), Rac2 (0.64 fold), and Rac1 (1.27 fold). Genes that promote nitric oxide signaling and VEGF were modulated differentially at PND7 and PND22 by hyperoxia. Npr3, a gene involved in NO synthase activity was induced by hyperoxia at PND22 but suppressed by vitamin A. Therefore, we hypothesize that these genes could be potential targets for intervention in BPD patients.

AB  - We examined the biological roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neonatal rats were randomly assigned to hyperoxia (85% O2) and normoxia (21% O2) groups, and each group had eight neonatal. Twenty differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by deep sequencing, of which 10 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated in the hyperoxia group. A total of 5,794 molecular related to gene ontology functions were enriched, including cell location and biological processes. rno-miR-29b-3p were up-regulated, and rno-miR-322-5p and rno-miR-335 were down-regulated in the hyperoxia sample based on quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, BPD appears to be caused by activation of extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, RNA transport, cell cycle, and cell adhesion molecule pathways. These miRNAs may play a role in the occurrence and development of BPD. Our study provides new insight into the biological processes of BPD.Copyright © FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.br.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxygen supplementation is a life-saving treatment, but it can potentially induce long-term pulmonary injury by triggering inflammatory processes. Xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP enzymes play a critical role in hyperoxic lung injury. Murine studies have shown that CYP1B1 exacerbates, while CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 protect from hyperoxic lung injury. OBJECTIVE(S): In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to hyperoxia of Cyp1b1-null mice would revert the transcriptomic changes induced by hyperoxia in WT mice, both at the transcript and pathway level. DESIGN/METHODS: C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice, as well as Cyp1b1-/- knockout mice aged 8- 10 weeks were used in this study. WT and mutant mice were maintained in room air (21% O2), as a control group, or exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) into a sealed Plexiglas chamber for 48h. RNA profiling was conducted using Illumina Gene Expression MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip Kit. Significantly changed probes were determined using the limma R package, for fold change exceeding 1.5x and FDR<0.05. Enriched pathways were determined using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), with significance achieved at FDR<0.25. Human lung transcriptome data sets were scored using summed z-scores for each murine gene signature; association with phenotype was determined using Pearson correlation, with significance achieved at p<0.05. RESULT(S): Hyperoxia exposure leads to robust and correlated responses in WT mice, as well in the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 null mice. At the transcriptome level, all three CYP1 murine models mitigate the hyperoxia effects. Cdkn1a and Ccnd1 were induced by hyperoxia in both WT and Cyp1b1 null mice but reduced in Cyp1b1 null O2 mice compared to WT O2 mice. The GSEA results identified 69 pathways affected by hyperoxia and mitigated in Cyp1b1 null mice only, including lipid, glutamate, and amino acids metabolism. Hyperoxia gene signatures of all murine models associated positively with lung diseases including Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) and lung adenocarcinoma, but hyperoxia mitigation signature in Cyp1b1 null correlated negatively with BPD. CONCLUSION(S): Distinct phenotypes of Cyp1b1 null mice that were observed after hyperoxia exposure, compared to Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 null mice, are partially explained by mechanisms entailing protein and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Rationale Preterm infants with oxygen supplementation frequently develop a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Pathomechanistically, an inflammatory response with increased migration and activation of macrophages plays a major role. Elevated levels of CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), which has chemotactic and activating effects on proinflammatory inflammatory cells, were detected in lungs of infants evolving BPD. Therefore, we investigated whether CXCL10 deficiency protects newborn mice from hyperoxia-induced lung injury (as a model of BPD). Methods (1) Homozygous CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10-/- ) mice as well as wild-type mice (WT) were either exposed to hyperoxia (85% O , HYX) or normoxia (21% O2 , NOX) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14 and studied at P14. (2) For recovery, some mice were transferred from HYX to NOX for two additional weeks and were then sacrificed at P28. Excised lungs were snap-frozen for molecular biology studies or pressure-fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histomorphometric analyses. (3) J744A.1 macrophages were treated with CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist, and cell migration was studied. Results (1). Lungs of HYX-exposed WT showed significantly increased macrophage invasion at P14 compared with the control group. This inflammatory response after HYX resulted in impaired alveolarization, increased apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. CXCL10-/- protected the newborn mice from the inflammation and partially from the HYX-induced structural changes. (2) After recovery at P28, CXCL10 mice exhibited improved lung structure and attenuated matrix remodeling in comparison to WT. (3) Loss of CXCL10-/- prevented the macrophage influx to the lungs at both P14 and P28 after HYX. (3) Treatment with recombinant CXCL10 or CXCR3 antagonist significantly promoted and reduced the migration of macrophages, respectively. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that deficiency of CXCR3-CXCL10 axis blocks macrophage chemotaxis to the lung partially enables lung growth, and protects from ECM in experimental BPD.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants, but mechanisms causing abnormal alveolar development characterized by alveolar simplification are not well understood. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-17~92 expression is severely attenuated in human patients who died from BPD and confirmed this in a murine disease model. Global deletion of miR-17-92 results in fatal neonatal respiratory failure from alveolar epithelial hypoplasia; however, the cell specific effects of miR-17-92 deletion on alveolar development are not known. Rationale: We hypothesize that miR-17~92 deletion in Alveolar Type 2 (AT2) Epithelial Cells will cause alveolar simplification reminiscent of a BPD-like phenotype without oxygen exposure. Method(s): We used an inducible, fluorescent, lox-cre system (miR-17~92flox/flox x ERSPCCre x zsGreen) combined with flow cytometry, immunofluorescent microscopy and bulk RNA-seq to characterize the impact of miR-17-92 on AT2 epithelial cells during postnatal alveologenesis. By administering tamoxifen on the day of birth, we are able to target AT2 cells during the period of exponential alveolar growth when alveologenesis beings around day 4. Result(s): Using a tamoxifen-inducible AT2-specific, fate-mapping system, we achieved >98% of miR-17-92 in AT2 cells. Due to cell-specific deletion of miR-17-92, we demonstrated deficiencies in structural lung development evidenced by increased alveolar area in transgenic animals. Transcriptomic animals have decreased AT2 cell quantity within the population of lung cells determined by flow cytometry. Conclusion(s): Our data supported the hypothesis that miR-17~92 deletion specifically in AT2 cells would have a significant impact on alveolarization producing the alveolar simplification classically found in oxygen-induced BPD models. This could possibly be related to the decreased density of AT2 cells, which are the stem cells needed to transdifferentiate into the alveolar type 1 epithelial cells which comprise the walls of the alveoli. Pending transcriptomic data will provide insight regarding developmental pathways influenced by miR-17-92 that are vital for epithelial cell transdifferentiation. This inducible, cell-specific model provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the biologic impact of miR-17~92 on alveolar epithelial cell function without oxygen as a confounder.

AB  - Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the leading morbidity in survivors of preterm birth, with resulting impaired alveolarization and fibrosis. Infants with severe BPD have associated vascular changes and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The molecular mechanisms resulting in BPD and PH are poorly understood, and there are no curative therapies. Apelin is a peptide made by endothelial cells of the heart and lung that has been previously shown to be associated with endothelial repair, though its role in lung vascular development and injury is unclear. Methods To characterize expression of apelin and its receptor in lung development, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) across 7 time points from embryonic day 15 to postnatal (P) day 14. To study apelin expression during lung injury, we used a murine model combining hyperoxia (70% from P1-5) and inflammation (intratracheal lipopolysaccharide). For validation, we examined human lung tissue from preterm infants with and without lung injury. Apelin and apelin receptor expression were localized in lung tissue using RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), with quantification using Halo software. Results By scRNAseq, apelin and its receptor are expressed by distinct subpopulations of endothelial cells in the lung. Apelin expression increases before birth at embryonic day 18 and is relatively constant across the lifespan. In acute lung injury, we found decreased expression of apelin by RNA ISH in endothelial cells when compared with normoxia-exposed controls at P5 (p<0.001). This decrease in apelin expression persisted during recovery at P14 (p<0.01). There were no significant changes in apelin receptor expression with injury. Examination of human infant lungs in the saccular stage showed decreased apelin expression after 4 days of mechanical ventilation when compared with infants who were never mechanically ventilated (p<0.001). Conclusion Apelinergic signaling is a conserved pathway that emerges in the saccular stage of lung development. During acute neonatal injury and recovery, there is a significant decrease in apelin expression. Future work to target this pathway may identify novel therapies in infants with BPD and PH.Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation

AB  - Rationale. Lung immaturity is associated with numerous complications, including neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which are a key factor affecting mortality and morbidity in preterm babies worldwide. The cellular and molecular pathways that regulate lung development process are still poorly understood and critical to aid lung repair and regeneration in premature infants. The systematic investigations of the regulatory processes during the formation of the tracheobronchial tree and the alveoli will help to better understand the specification mechanisms that drive normal lung development and maturation. Methods. In this study, we applied unbiased mass spectrometry-based multi-omics approaches (i.e. proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) to characterize the molecular constituents of the mouse lung during normal development. We used whole lung tissue homogenates from mice at gestational day 16.5 & 18.5 (E16.5 & E18.5), postnatal day 7 (P7) and postnatal day 28 (P28) with n = 4 per timepoint. The aqueous polar metabolites, proteins, and lipids were extracted from the same sample using a modified Folch extraction method (metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction, MPLEx), then introduced into GC-MS (metabolomics) and LC-MS/MS (proteomics and lipidomics) analyses. Results. Our integrative multi-omics approaches have enabled comprehensive profiling of the processes underlying lung development in mouse. We have identified 8178 proteins, 159 metabolites, and 442 lipids which are involved in multiple stage specific changes in structure and function of Lung development over the time. The analysis showed several different expression patterns across developmental stages for each omics data. For example protein profiling indicated increased cell cycle activity and metabolism of proteins (i.e. increased proliferation) early in development while immune system components were increased as well as lipid metabolism and energy metabolism later. The proteomics observations were supported by global metabolite profiling which detected higher pools of free amino acids at early timepoints of lung development and increased abundance of glycolysis intermediates at later timepoints supporting the notion of increased proliferation/protein metabolism at early timepoints and increased energy metabolism at later timepoints. Conclusion. Understanding the molecular details of lung development will greatly help to ameliorate morbidity and mortality in premature infants. This work forms part of the LungMAP initiative to establish a molecular atlas of the mouse and the human lung.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by abnormal alveolar septation and microvascular development. Certain types of monocytes and macrophages have been implicated in epithelial growth and angiogenesis, while others play a role in immune defense and inflammation. Aim(s): To investigate whether monocyte/macrophage profiles and their products correlate with BPD development. Method(s): We investigated lungs of neonatal mice and tracheal aspirates (TAs) from preterm born infants. Result(s): We found that M2-MDSC like monocytes are abundantly present in the lungs of neonatal mice. These monocytes also showed high expression of proangiogenic genes (a.o. EMMPRIN, ENA78, GDF15, VEGFR2 and IGF-1) and strong immune suppressive capacity in vitro, supporting a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and lung growth. Upon repetitive exposure to LPS the monocytes lost their M2-profile and suppressive capacity and upregulated inflammatory markers (IL-8, IL-1b and IL-6 but not TNFa). We also found monocytes/macrophages in TAs from preterm born infants. Proteome profiling these TAs revealed high concentrations of both M2 and inflammatory monocyte/macrophage derived factors and angiogenic mediators. Addition of TAs to pericyte-endothelial cell co-cultures either enhanced or inhibited angiogenesis. Luminex analysis of TAs of preterm infants with (n=22) and without (n=23) BPD showed significant lower concentrations of the angiogenic factors EMMPRIN, ENA78, MCP1, GDF15, TNF-alpha, Angiopoietin-1, -2 and HGF in those infants who developed BPD. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that monocyte/macrophage profiles in TAs of premature children correlate with BPD development and may be used to identify new preventive or therapeutic targets.

AB  - Rationale: Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD. BPD is characterized by impaired alveolar secondary septation and vascular growth. Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) contributes to its development. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. In this study, we employed a non-biased approach to measure global changes in gene expression and DNA methylation following hyperoxia exposure in male and female mice. Method(s): Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-5: saccular stage) and sacrificed on PND 7 and 21. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data was mapped to the mouse genome using TopHat2, and quantified using Cufflinks2. Gene expression data was quantile normalized and analyzed using the R statistical software (Version 3.2.1). A combination of selection criteria comprising nominal p-values <0.05 and linear fold change greater or lesser than 1.25 was used to generate differential expressed genes (DEGs) profiles. Enriched pathways and processes were inferred using the hypergeometric distribution, and various gene set collections as compiled in the Molecular Signature Database compendium. To detect and quantify DNA methylation, we performed 5-methylcytosine ELISA on lung DNA samples (PND 21). Result(s): A total of 119 (up-regulated (UR): 40, down-regulated (DR): 70) and 198 (UR: 117, DR: 81) genes were differentially expressed following hyperoxia in neonatal female mice at PND7 and PND21 respectively. Pathway analysis revealed differential sex-specific modulation of key pathways on PND7 and PND21. In the early repair phase (PND7), myogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Notch signaling and angiogenesis were down regulated in males compared to females. In the late repair phase (PND21), females showed down regulation in the cellular defense response, allograft rejection and PD1 signaling compared to males. Hyperoxia decreased DNA methylation in both male and female mice but the decrease was more significant in male mice compared to similarly exposed females. Conclusion(s): Target genes in myogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Notch signaling and angiogenesis in the early phase after hyperoxia exposure and cellular defense response, allograft rejection and PD1 signaling pathways may explain the differences in susceptibility of male and female neonatal mice to HLI. Differences in the epigenome partly though DNA methylation may explain the changes in gene expression responsible for the differential pathway modulation described above. These findings provide novel insights in the differential sex-specific modulation of the pulmonary transcriptome in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury.

AB  - Background: BPD is characterized by impaired alveolarization and vascular growth. Male sex is considered an independent predictor for the development of BPD. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. Alternative splicing of coding genes is an underappreciated regulatory mechanism and has been shown to play a role in diverse processes such as embryonic development, tumorigenesis, and resistance to chemical pharmaceutical treatments. Our objective was to elucidate the sex-specific alternative splicing differences in coding genes in the lung in vivo in a model of murine neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia (95% FiO2, PND 1-5: saccular stage of lung development) or room air and sacrificed on PND 7. Pulmonary gene expression was studied using RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data were mapped onto the murine genome build UCSC mm10 using TopHat2, and quantified using cufflinks2 and the GENCODE mouse reference. Alternative splicing was performed for skipped exons splicing events using the MISO pipeline. We compared the alternative splicing by sex between room air and hyperoxia exposure. We evaluated enriched pathways using hypergeometric distribution (p<0.05) and the compendium of pathways Hallmark, Kegg, Reactome, and Gene Ontology, as compiled by MSigDB. Result(s): Alveolarization and angiogenesis was better preserved in female mice compared to similarly exposed male mice. Significant alternative splicing was observed in numerous genes between male and female mice at PND7 in room air and after hyperoxic treatment. 67 genes showed alternative splicing in room air, while 441 showed differences in the mice exposed to hyperoxia. Among 14 pathways enriched in alternatively spliced genes only in room air, we found differences in genes involved in collagen formation, such as Col24a1 and Col23a1, and PPARa signaling genes such as Med15 and Nrf1. Among 537 pathways enriched only in the hyperoxia group, genes involved in vascular endothelial signaling, including Fn1, Notch1, Mapk14, Itgb1bp1, Prkd1, Nrp2, and developmental genes, such as Rara, Ncoa2, Disc1, Chd7 were differentially regulated between male and female mice. Conclusion(s): Dysregulation via alternative splicing may contribute to the sex-specific differences in hyperoxia-induced inhibition of lung development and diseases, such as BPD. These differences could explain in part the mechanisms behind sex-specific differences in the incidence of BPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prematurity and fetal growth restriction are risk factors for pulmonary hypertension (PH) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Neonatal rats develop PH and vascular remodeling when exposed to hyperoxia. We hypothesize that postnatal growth restriction (PNGR) due to under-nutrition increases the severity of PH induced by hyperoxia in neonatal rats., METHODS: Pups were randomized at birth to litters maintained in room air or 75% oxygen (hyperoxia), together with litters of normal milk intake (10 pups) or PNGR (17 pups). After 14 d, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was assessed by Fulton's index (right ventricular weight/left ventricular plus septal weight) and PH by echocardiography. Lungs were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, morphometrics, western blotting, and metabolomics., RESULTS: Hyperoxia and PNGR each significantly increased pulmonary arterial pressure, RVH and pulmonary arterial medial wall thickness, and significantly decreased pulmonary vessel number. These changes were significantly augmented in pups exposed to both insults. Hyperoxia and PNGR both significantly decreased expression of proteins involved in lung development and vasodilation., CONCLUSION: PNGR induces right ventricular and pulmonary vascular remodeling and augments the effects of oxygen in neonatal rats. This may be a powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms that induce PH in low-birth-weight preterm infants with BPD.

AB  - The proper development of both human and murine lungs relies on a precise temporal-spatial expression of growth factors including WNT, FGF, and TGF-beta family of ligands. Among these, Tgf-beta family is well known for its functions in relation to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which play key roles not only during development but also during tumor growth. Sex is a risk factor in several human lung diseases. Male infants have higher risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as compared to females and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has higher incidence and worse outcome in male patients than in female patients. Sex hormones have been shown to modulated the severity of lung disease in animal models. For instance, the male hormone androgen exacerbates the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in female mice. Herein, we have induced the activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway specifically in embryonic lung epithelium by crossing Ca-Tgf-beta-r1-Stopfl/fl (Constitutively active Tgf-beta-receptor-1) female mice with Ttf1-Cre male mice which produced a complex and lethal phenotype only in male fetuses. The phenotype displayed by the mutant male resembles the bronchopulmonary dysplasia disease displayed by human preterm infants and was not compatible with life. In contrast, mutant females were viable and showed either a weak phenotype or no phenotype at all. The lung epithelium of the mutant males showed increased number of progenitor Sox9 positive cells and genetic deletion of one allele of the Sox9 gene significantly reduced the severity of the phenotype in mutant male mice. Transcriptome profiling delivered important insights on the mechanism responsible for the lung phenotype in mutant male animals. Among the genes deregulated in the mutant male lung we recognized genes already known to be critical for the lung physiopathology such as Spock2 and Amantsl2 which are implicated to the pathogenesis of BPD in human and bronchial dysplasia in mice, respectively , Adamts18 which is a critical regulator of murine lung development and Adamdec1 which is over-expressed in patients with sarcoidosis. Finally, we showed that injection of estrogen in pregnant female mice was able to reverse the phenotype in the male lungs which suggests a hormonal dependency of the phenotype in the lung of the transgenic male mice. In conclusion, we have established a novel male sex-specific model of the TGF-beta signaling pathway that will be useful in studying how male sex can adversely affects lung development as well as neonatal pulmonary diseases in humans and to identify the sex-specific signaling pathways that give to male patients bearing lung diseases a prognostic disadvantage compared to female patients.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disorder affecting infants born prematurely. Impaired lung function results from inhibited alveolar septation causing alveolar simplification. Although the etiology is multifactorial, BPD is strongly associated with exposure of the immature lung to inflammation and hyperoxia. While the mechanisms governing alveolarization are poorly understood, alveolar interstitial fibroblasts that express Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (PDGFRalpha) play an important role in matrix production and tissue remodeling during septation. In the present study we used a transcriptomic approach to assess changes in lung gene expression using a murine model of neonatal hyperoxia to elucidate acute and persistent effects of hyperoxia on PDGFRalpha+ pulmonary cells. Method(s): Newly-delivered C57BL6 mouse pups were exposed continuously to either hyperoxia (>90% O2) or room air (RA) from birth through the first 7 postnatal days (P0-P7). On P7, hyperoxia-exposed mice were returned to RA and allowed to recover until P10. Using magnetic bead separation from single lung cell suspensions, cells expressing PDGFRalpha were obtained at P4 and P7 (acute hyperoxia exposure) and P10 (recovery from hyperoxia), processed for bulk RNA-Seq, and compared to RA controls. Transcriptomic data analysis identified differentially expressed genes between time-matched samples, during normal development (RA), as well as under hyperoxic conditions. Pathway analysis revealed enriched pathways relevant to septation. Changes in gene expression were used to predict upstream transcriptional regulators. Result(s): Neonatal hyperoxia caused significant, global changes in PDGFRalpha+ fibroblast gene expression: RNAs associated with oxidative stress (super oxygen dismutase, glutathione metabolism) were significantly increased, RNAs encoding key lung developmental growth factors (TGF-beta, PDGF, BMP, VEGF, FGF, IGF) were significantly decreased, and RNAs governing extracellular matrix production and remodeling (collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and proteinases) were significantly inhibited. Additionally, mis-expression of genes known to be important regulators of cell cycle (P21, CDKs, cyclins) indicated that hyperoxia inhibited cell cycle progression. Upstream analysis of perturbed genes predicted that Foxm1 serves as a master regulator of the cell cycle during alveolarization by inhibiting the G2/M checkpoint. Conclusion(s): Taken together, this study demonstrates that neonatal hyperoxia causes global, persistent changes in the gene expression in murine PDGFRalpha+ interstitial fibroblasts. We have identified key regulators of alveolar septation as potential therapeutic targets to optimize lung development following preterm birth.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by decreased lung vascularization and alveolar simplification, and severe BPD is associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH). MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short, non-encoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Currently, the role of miRNA in the development of BPD and PH in BPD is not fully understood. In this study, we wished to identify miRNA that contribute to hyperoxia-induced decreased lung vascularization and PH. Method(s): Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% O2) for 2 weeks (T1) and then allowed to recover in room air for an additional 4 weeks until 6 weeks of age (T2). Lung alveolar and vascular development, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and vessel remodeling were measured at both T1 and T2 time points. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was measured at T2 only. miRNA expression profiling was performed with T1 and T2 lungs using a microarray platform and validated with qPCR. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (HPAEC and HPASMC) were transfected with candidate miRNA mimics and inhibitors and exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia (95% O2). Cell proliferation, tube formation, and angiogenic factor expression were measured in HPAEC, while proliferation and smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker protein expression were measured in HPASMC. Result(s): Mice exposed to 2 weeks of hyperoxia exhibited decreased alveolarization and vascularization at T1, which persisted at T2, consistent with a BPD phenotype. At T2, these mice had developed PH, displaying RVH, increased arterial wall thickness, and elevated RVSP compared to control mice. From the miRNA microarray data, we found that miR-133a and miR-133b expression was significantly decreased in both T1 and T2 lungs after hyperoxia. HPAEC exposed to hyperoxia showed decreased proliferation and fewer loops and branches in a tube formation assay. HPAEC that were transfected with miR-133a/b inhibitors in normoxia also had fewer loops and branches in a tube formation assay. Transfection with miR-133a/b mimics restored cell proliferation and loop and branch formation in hyperoxic HPAEC. In normoxia, miR-133a/b mimics induced angiogenic factor expression in HPAEC. In normoxic HPASMC, miR-133a/b mimics decreased proliferation and induced SMC marker expression. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that decreased expression of miR-133 induced by hyperoxia plays a role in the decreased vascularization of the BPD phenotype by suppressing PAEC proliferation and angiogenesis. Decreased expression of miR-133 may also contribute to the subsequent PH phenotype in our model by inducing proliferation and dedifferentiation in PASMC.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature neonates characterized by arrested lung alveolarization. MicroRNAs (miR) are poorly understood in the context of BPD. Here, a miR microarray on mouse lungs exposed to normoxia (21% O ) or hyperoxia (85% O ) revealed an up-regulation of the miR-34a expression (at least 1.5-fold at all time-points) in mouse lungs maintained under hyperoxic conditions. Mice treated with an antagomiR-34a almost doubled the total number of alveoli (2.1 +/- 0.4 x 10 ) and normalized the mean septal wall thickness (10.1 +/- 2.3 mum) under hyperoxic conditions compared to the number of alveoli (1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10 ) and septal wall thickness (17.8 +/- 3.9 mum) assessed by stereology in mice injected with scrambled antagomiR (SCR). Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)alpha, a target of miR-34a, has been reported to be crucial for myofibroblast transdifferentiation and normal lung alveolarization. Isolated PDGFRalpha cells by flow cytometry from mouse lungs exposed to 85% O for the first five days of life revealed an up-regulation of the miR-34a expression (3-fold). Mice injected with two target-site blockers, to block the miR-34a/Pdgfra mRNA interaction, increased the total number of alveoli (1.7 +/- 0.2 x 10 ) and normalized the septal wall thickness (11.6 +/- 1.2 mum) under hyperoxic conditions compared to the number of alveoli (1.3 +/- 0.1 x 10 ) and septal wall thickness (13.9 +/- 1.4 mum) observed in SCR-treated mice. In conclusion, the inhibition of miR-34a partially restored the total number of alveoli and normalised the septal wall thickness in mouse lungs maintained under hyperoxic conditions.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species contribute to the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic pulmonary disorders, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a respiratory condition affecting preterm infants. BPD treatment often involves respiratory support with high O2, and oxidative stress is an adverse effect associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Genetic polymorphisms in a few candidate genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood. Understanding the role of genetics is critical to improving treatment strategies and reducing oxidant injury in developing lungs. We developed a neonatal mouse model to mimic many features of BPD, and utilized genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of quantitative phenotypes to identify susceptibility genes for neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. One day after birth, neonatal mice from 29 inbred strains were exposed for 72 hr to normoxia (room air, 20% O2) or hyperoxia (>95% O2). Hyperoxia induced phenotypes (inflammatory cells/histopathology) that are similar to BPD when compared to normal postnatal lung development in normoxia. We also measured hyperoxia-induced lesions in nuclear (nuc) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA, and mitochondrial copy number from lung homogenates. Significant inter-strain variation was found for mtDNA and nucDNA lesions after normoxia and hyperoxia. GWA mapping identified significant quantitative trait loci for mtDNA lesions, nucDNA lesions, and mitochondrial copy number after normoxia and for hyperoxia. We ultra-deep sequenced neonatal lung mtDNA from mice exposed to normoxia and hyperoxia and found 385 sequence variations in wild-derived PWD/PhJ inbred mice compared to reference C57BL/6J mice. Higher variation frequency (1/32 bases) was found in the D-loop region compared to the rest of the mitochondrial genome (1/42 bases). There was also more heteroplasmy in PWD/PhJ mice compared to C57BL/6J. We found five haplotype groups among 27 strains that were sequenced, with classical inbred strains in haplotype 1, NZB and NZO mice in haplotype 2, and PWD/PhJ and PWK/PhJ mice in haplotype 3. Wild derived strains had more variation than classical inbred strains. We conclude that exposure to low (20%) and high (>95%) concentrations of oxygen early in life cause lesions in mouse lung mtDNA and nucDNA that are strain dependent. Ultra-deep sequencing identified mtDNA sequence variation and differences in heteroplasmy and indels across inbred mouse strains that associate with disease phenotypes. Through these combined approaches, we have identified novel candidate susceptibility genes that may improve our understanding of neonatal lung injury and development.

AB  - Introduction: Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have a high risk of asthma later in life. Supplemental oxygen, used to treat many premature infants, is a risk factor for BPD and long-term respiratory symptoms. We have shown that hyperoxic exposure of neonatal mice (a model of BPD) increases the number of IL-12 producing Clec9a+CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) and hyperoxia-exposed, but not air-exposed mice, develop enhanced airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in response to rhinovirus (RV). Hyperoxic exposure is associated with lung epithelial cell apoptosis and necrosis. CD103+ DCs phagocytose apoptotic cells which induces immunogenic responses. CD103+ DCs are required for CD8+ T cell IFN-gamma production in mice treated with apoptotic cells and poly(I:C). Clec9a, a C-type lectin selectively expressed on CD103+ DCs, is a receptor for dead cell cytoskeletal actin filaments that signals via the tyrosine kinase Syk and diverts internalized dead cell debris to endosomes, thus favoring cross-presentation on MHC I to CD8+ T cells. Co-administration of Clec9a-targeted antigen and poly(I:C) induces DC maturation and Th1 cell differentiation. We hypothesized that CD103+ DCs and Clec9a signaling are required for hyperoxia-induced enhanced lung inflammation and AHR in response to RV. Method(s): We exposed 2 day-old C57BL/6J, Batf3-/-, Clec9agfp-/- mice to normoxia or hyperoxia for 14 days. In selected experiments, C57BL/6J mice were treated with anti-mouse CD103 antibody or control IgG intraperitoneally on day 0, 7 and 14 of exposure for in vivo depletion of CD103+ DCs. Subsequently, the mice were inoculated with RV intranasally. Five days after RV infection, lung gene expression was analyzed by qPCR and ELISA. Lung immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Result(s): To confirm lung CD103+ DC depletion, we examined the lungs after 14 days hyperoxic exposure using flow cytometry. Anti-CD103 treatment significantly reduced the number of lung CD103+ DCs in both normoxia- and hyperoxia-exposed lungs, without significant differences between the two. After RV infection, hyperoxia-exposed IgG-treated mice showed greater increase in IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA compared to air-exposed mice. In contrast, anti-CD103-treated mice were protected from the hyperoxia-induced exaggerated increase in IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA in response to RV. Batf3-/- and Clec9agfp-/- mice were also protected from hyperoxia-induced exaggerated increase in IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA, and IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 protein expression in response to RV. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate that hyperoxia-activated lung Clec9a+CD103+ DCs serve as a priming mechanism for exaggerated pro-inflammatory immune responses.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common adverse outcome of extreme preterm birth, can be caused by oxygen-related lung injury and is characterized by arrested alveolar development. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have lung protective effects. Conversely, BPD is associated with increased MSCs in tracheal aspirates. This apparent discrepancy is unexplored. We hypothesized that endogenous lung (L-)MSCs are perturbed in an oxygen-induced rat model mimicking BPD. Method(s): Rat pups were exposed to 21% or 95% O2 from postnatal day 0 to 10. On day 12, CD146+ L-MSCs were isolated and characterized. Epithelial and vascular repair potential were tested by scratch assay and endothelial network formation respectively, immune function by mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. Microarray analysis was performed using GSEA software. Result(s): L-MSCs isolated from hyperoxia rat pups had decreased CD73 expression and inhibited lung endothelial network formation. L-MSCs indiscriminately promoted epithelial wound healing and limited T-cell proliferation. Expression of anti-angiogenic genes of the axonal guidance cue pathway was increased after in vivo hyperoxia, whereas genes of the anti-inflammatory JAK/STAT and lung/vascular growth promoting FGF pathways were decreased. Conclusion(s): In vivo hyperoxia exposure alters the pro-angiogenic effects and FGF expression of L-MSCs. Additionally, decreased CD73 and JAK/STAT expression suggest decreased immune function. L-MSC function may be perturbed and contribute to BPD pathogenesis. These findings may lead to improvements in manufacturing exogenous MSCs with superior repair capabilities.

AB  - RATIONALE: Post-natal lung development, notably, lung alveolarization, is often studied in the laboratory mouse, both for normal alveolarization, as well as blunted alveolarization associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To this end, a broad spectrum of interventions are often applied by intraperitoneal injections, including the injection of drugs, tamoxifen (for inducible genetic rearrangements), and "scrambled" antagomiRs (to control studies that target microRNA with antagomiRs). To date, the impact of the intervention protocols on lung alveolarization has not been assessed. To this end, we explored whether daily injection of saline, or the administration of tamoxifen or "scrambled" antagomiRs in well-established protocols, had any impact on the postnatal alveolarization of mouse lungs. METHOD(S): Saline was applied by intraperitoneal injection (20 mul) daily. Tamoxifen was applied at post-natal day (P)1 and P2, by intraperitoneal injection (0.4 mg; 20 mul) dissolved in Miglyol. "Scrambled" antagomiRs were applied P2 and P3, by intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg; 20 mul) dissolved in water. In all cases, at P14 mice were sacrificed, lungs were harvested and fixed by intra-tracheal instillation of glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde at 20 cmH2O hydrostatic pressure, embedded in agar, sectioned (3-mm), and total lung volume was assessed by the Cavalieri principle. Lung sections were then treated with arsenic, osmium, and uranium, and embedded in plastic, prior to systematic uniform random sampling for the stereological analysis of lung structure. In parallel, lung tissue was harvested for the unbiased assessment of gene expression by RNA-Seq. RESULT(S): The daily injection of saline (versus no intervention) marginally (but significantly) decreased total lung volume, and was without effect in gene expression, or any other parameters of lung structure, including alveoli number and mean alveolar septal wall thickness. The daily injection of Miglyol increased, while tamoxifen in Miglyol decreased mouse body mass (versus untreated mice), while tamoxifen in Miglyol decreased lung volume, total alveoli number, and septal wall thickness, and had a pronounced effect on gene expression in the lung. One of two "scrambled" antagomiRs slightly (but significantly) decreased total lung volume, decreased alveoli density, and decreased mean alveolar septal wall thickness, while a second "scrambled" antagomiR was without effect. Both antagomiRs had a pronounced impact on gene expression in the lung. CONCLUSION(S): These novel data make the important observation that control interventions are not silent in terms of gene expression, and impact on lung structure, when applied to mice during the first 14 days of post-natal life, in studies on lung development.

AB  - Introduction: Supplemental oxygen exposure is a risk factor for development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Reactive oxygen species may damage lung tissue, but hyperoxia has also a potential to alter the genome activity by means of altering DNA methylation. Understanding the epigenetic potential of hyperoxia can enable further improvement of therapeutic strategies in BPD. Objective(s): To identify hyperoxia-related alterations of DNA methylation, which could affect the activity of crucial genetic pathways involved in development of hyperoxia lung injury. Method(s): 24 newborn mice were randomized to hyperoxia (85% O2) or normoxia for 14 days continued with normoxia for the subsequent 14 days. The mice were killed on day 28 and lung tissue was analyzed with use of microarrays dedicated for assessment of genome methylation and expression profiles. Result(s): The mean DNA methylation level was higher in the hyperoxia in comparison with the normoxia group. The analysis of specific DNA fragments revealed hypermethylation of > 1,300 gene promoters in the hyperoxia group confirming the presence of the DNA hypermethylation effects of hyperoxia. Further analysis showed significant enrichment of TGF-beta signaling pathway (p = 0.0013). The hypermethylated genes included Tgfbr1, Crebbp and Creb1, which play central roles in TGF-beta signaling pathway and in cell cycle regulation. The genome expression analysis revealed complementary upregulation of genes that are crucial for cell cycle regulation in the normoxia group (Crebbp, Smad2, Smad3). Conclusion(s): These results suggest involvement of methylation of TGF-beta pathway genes in lung tissue reaction to hyperoxia. The data indicate hyperoxia may be a programming factor in newborn mice.

AB  - Rationale: Normal lung alveolar septation is a complex process that involves the spatial and temporal integration of several signals from multiple cross-talking pathways. Its disruption causes several diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which affects infants born prematurely. Despite significant progress in our understanding of the normal lung alveolar septation process, the molecular mechanisms that govern it are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide changes in DNA methylation during the alveolar phase of lung development. Method(s): Mouse genomic DNA from lung tissues was isolated from Laser-capture microdissected (LCM) samples at different time points during lung development: saccular stage (P0.5, and P2.5) and alveolar stage (P7, P10, P19 and P28). Three biological samples per time point were analyzed by Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation-Next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) to determine genome-wide CpG methylation. MEDIP-seq libraries were constructed using 125 ng of DNA. Libraries were uploaded onto an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform for ultra deep sequencing with single reads of 50 bases. Forty million reads per sample were sequenced. Result(s): Overall, MEDIP-seq data show that CpG methylation changes over time. GO enrichment analyses indicate that metabolic processes, binding, and catalytic activities are high in all time points. Transmembrane transport goes up at P0.5, then down, then up again at P7, P19 and P28. Phosphorous metabolism prominent at P0.5, P7, P10 and P28. Single-organism localization up at P7, P10 and P19. Furthermore, by performing genome-wide differential coverage analysis, we were able to identify a set of genes implicated in cell growth, development, or differentiation that were differentially methylated at several time points during lung development. Conclusion(s): Early changes in DNA methylation seems to initiate and shape lung alveolar development.

AB  - Background: Since the first description of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) three decades ago, alveolar formation remains poorly understood. In contrast, there is detailed understanding of early lung development (branching morphogenesis). The relevance of the latter to BPD is uncertain. Objective(s): To identify the principal genetic regulators of alveogenesis, information that is necessary for preventing or treating BPD. Method(s): We devised a unique, cell-specific, genetic targeting of select signaling pathways including TGF-beta, PDGFA and IGF1 during postnatal alveolar formation in mice. Next generation RNA sequencing revealed conserved genes that are in common amongst the 3 models. The relevance of the mouse genetic studies was examined in human postmortem BPD lung samples. We inactivated the receptors for TGF-beta, or platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA) or IGF1, in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMFs) which drive alveogenesis and generated 3 mouse models. Result(s): All mice developed respiratory distress shortly after birth. All mice also developed profound arrested alveolar formation (BPD phenocopy). The severity of the phenotype, added to SCMFs representing only 10-11.3% of total lung cells, is strong evidence for the robustness of these 3 central signaling pathways in alveolar formation. RNAseq and bio-informatics using sorted mutant and control SCMFs revealed a cluster of 117 genes in common amongst the 3 mutant lungs. Conclusion(s): Our innovative approach identified genes that participate in alveogenesis. These genes are dysregulated in human BPD lung samples. We show for the first time that one of the pathway's functions in alveolar formation parallels the function of antenatal steroid used as therapy to improve alveogenesis.

AB  - Lysyl oxidases are extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolizing enzymes with pathogenic roles in multiple diseases e.g. lung cancer fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Recently, ECM-independent roles for lysyl oxidases have been proposed, including chromatin remodelling and transcriptional regulation. We aimed to explore the gene regulatory roles for lysyl oxidases in primary mouse lung fibroblasts. The gene regulatory potential of three predominant lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2) was investigated using a microarray approach, small interfering (si)RNA knockdown and lentivirus-mediated over-expression. In order to determine whether the lysyl oxidase activity is required for transcriptional regulation, primary mouse lung fibroblasts were treated with lysyl oxidase inhibitor beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and the transcriptome was analysed by microarray. Potential correlations with gene expression in vitro were made with gene expression in vivo, in mouse model of BPD. We report, for the first time a transcriptomewide analysis of gene regulation by lysyl oxidases. In the context of primary mouse lung fibroblasts, siRNA knockdown of Lox, Loxl1, and Loxl2 deregulated the expression of 134, 3,761 and 3,554 genes, respectively. Identified lysyl oxidases target-genes relevant to lung development and BPD included Mmp3, Mmp9, Eln, Rarres1, Gdf10, Ifnb1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl9. The expression of target-genes in vivo correlated with the lysyl oxidases expression in a mouse model of BPD. Moreover, using BAPN, we demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation by lysyl oxidases was independent of catalytic activity both in vitro and in vivo, which is of importance in targeting the lysyl oxidases in a therapeutic context.

AB  - Background Inflammation-induced FGF10 protein deficiency is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurely born infants characterized by arrested alveolar development. So far, experimental evidence for a direct role of FGF10 in BPD is lacking. Methods and Results Using the hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury as a mouse model of BPD, the impact of Fgf10 deficiency in Fgf10(+/-) vs. Fgf10(+/+) pups was investigated. In normoxia, no lethality of Fgf10(+/+) and Fgf10(+/-) pups is observed. By contrast, 100% of Fgf10(+/-) pups died within 8 days of hyperoxic injury, with lethality starting at day 5, while Fgf10(+/+) pups were all alive. Lungs of pups from the two genotypes were collected on postnatal day 3 following normoxia or hyperoxia exposure for further analysis. In hyperoxia, Fgf10(+/-) lungs exhibited increased hypoalveolarization. Analysis by FACS of the Fgf10(+/-) vs. control lungs in normoxia, revealed decreased alveolar epithelial type II (AECII) cells over total EpCAM-positive cells ratio. In addition, gene array analysis indicated reduced AECII and increased AECI transcriptomic signatures in isolated AECII cells from Fgf10(+/-) lungs. Such imbalance in differentiation is also seen in hyperoxia and associated with reduced mature surfactant protein B and C expression. Attenuation of FGFR2b ligands activity postnatally in the context of hyperoxia also leads to increased lethality with decreased surfactant expression. Conclusions Fgf10 deficiency affects quantitatively and qualitatively the formation of AECII cells. In addition, FGFR2b ligands (including FGF10) are also important for repair after hyperoxia exposure in neonates. Deficient AECII cells could be an additional complication for patients with BPD.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on neonatal rat alveolar arrest induced by intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Method(s): A neonatal SD rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was constructed by intra-amniotic injection of LPS in pregnant rats. The pregnant rats (E19) were randomly assigned to Saline group, LPS group and LPS+anti-IL-1beta group. The lungs of the neonatal rats were randomly collected 1, 3 and 7 days after birth. Pathological changes in the lungs were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining, and expression of IL-1beta mRNA and protein was detected by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Rat bone marrow derived primary macrophage was cultured in vitro, and given LPS intervention, then genes related with IL-1beta were detected through whole transcriptome sequencing. Result(s): Compared with the Saline group, the alveolar counts and secondary septa counts significantly decreased, and mean liner intercept significantly increased in LPS group. Moreover, the expression of IL-1beta mRNA and protein in lungs significantly increased in LPS group. The LPS-induced pathological changes of lung tissues in neonatal rats were improved by anti-IL-1beta. LPS could up-regulate the expression of genes including Gbp5, Ccl3, Nod2, Ccr5, Mefv, Casp4 and Ifnar1, but down-regulate Lgals9 and Gstp1. Among these genes Gbp5, Ccl3, Nod2, Ccr5, Casp4, Ifnar1 and Lgals9 could positively regulate IL-1beta production. Conclusion(s): LPS can induce alveolar arrest through up-regulating the expression of IL-1beta in macrophages in neonatal rat BPD model. Whole transcriptome sequencing reveals that LPS can regulate the expression of IL-1beta in macrophages through several paths.Copyright © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

AB  - Rationale: Induction of cytoprotective genes by the transcription factor Nrf2 is essential in airway defense. Health benefits of dietary antioxidants, including a phytochemical Nrf2 agonist sulforaphane (SFN), have been demonstrated. However, effects of maternal antioxidant diet on postnatal airway disorders are not understood. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disorder of preterm infants. Lack of Nrf2 augmented the BPD-like phenotypes in murine models. Method(s): To determine the influence of prenatally supplemented SFN on the pathogenesis of a model BPD, time-pregnant wild-type (Nrf2+/+) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) mice were orally given with SFN or vehicle (PBS) on embryonic (E) days 11, 13, 15, and 17. At postnatal day 1 when lungs were in saccular stage of development, pups were exposed to 100% O2 (hyperoxia) or air with foster dams for 3 days until injury was analyzed by bronchoalveolar lavage and histopathology at the end of exposure. Result(s): Hyperoxia-caused lung edema and inflammation and arrested saccular-to-alveolar transition were marginal in Nrf2+/+ neonates compared to the susceptible Nrf2-/- neonates. Prenatal SFN significantly improved hyperoxia-caused lung injury parameters and alveolar maturation in Nrf2-/- pups while it did not alter these phenotypes in the resistant Nrf2+/+ pups. cDNA microarray analysis determined that gestational SFN altered baseline postnatal lung genes in an Nrf2-dependent way. Prenatal SFN caused upregulation of cell growth and tissue development genes (Egr2, Myof, Ibsp) in air-exposed Nrf2 +/+pups, while it altered cell cycle, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis genes (Tp53, Fgfr, Vegf, Ilk) in air-exposed Nrf2-/- pups. Transcriptome changes by gestational SFN also differed between two genotypes after hyperoxia. In Nrf2+/+pups, hyperoxia-increased immune genes (Lcn2, H2-D1, Cdh22) were downregulated by SFN, and vice versa for cell proliferation genes (Cdca2, Palmd). Prenatal SFN also upregulated Nrf2 effector antioxidants (Ephx1, Ggt7) against hyperoxia in these mice. In Nrf2-/- pups, many hyperoxia-induced inflammatory and cell-to-cell signaling genes (Clec7a, Selplg, Csf2rb) were suppressed by prenatal SFN. Althought gestational SFN supplementation affected lung transcriptomics differentially in Nrf2+/+and Nrf2-/- pups, inhibition of signaling molecules including MAPK, NF-kappaB and/or AP-1 was proposed to be involved in common. Conclusion(s): Gestational SFN protected developing lungs from BPD-like pathogenesis in the susceptible Nrf2-/- pups, supporting an Nrf2-independent defensive role of SFN. Transcriptome analyses suggested underlying molecular mechanisms of prenatal SFN. Together with transcriptome changes of embryonic lung and placenta at E18.5, results provide new insights into the influence of maternal antioxidant diet on fetal programming for postnatal respiratory health.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multi-factorial chronic lung disease of preterm infants that is characterized by interrupted alveolarization. Importantly, postnatal sepsis leads to BPD; yet, the underlying contributory mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous rodent studies have attempted to address this knowledge gap by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the alveolar phase of lung development. However, the lungs of infants who develop BPD are still in saccular phase of development. To address these knowledge gaps, we tested the hypothesis that LPS administered during the saccular phase of lung development disrupts alveolarization by mechanisms that promote lung inflammation and prevent optimal lung development and repair. Method(s): Neonatal C57BL6J wild-type mice were administered 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg of LPS or an equivalent volume of the vehicle, i.p. once daily on postnatal days (PND) 3, 4, and 5. To determine the molecular mechanisms and the extent of lung inflammation, the lung tissues were collected for proteomic analyses and flow cytometry on PND 6. Additionally, alveolarization was determined by performing lung morphometry on tissues harvested on PND7 and 14. Result(s): LPS increased mortality in a dose-dependent manner. LPS exposure differentially affected the expression of 98 proteins (p<0.05). Specifically, high-dose LPS decreased the expression of proteins regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (Ki67, integrin, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) and increased those mediating inflammation and cell death (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase). Additionally, the proteomic profile indicated LPS dysregulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the lungs. Flow cytometry analyses showed that LPS exposure decreased T-regulatory cells and increased macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Further, LPS-exposed mice had decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts, indicating that LPS disrupts alveolarization. Conclusion(s): Collectively, our results suggest that early LPS exposure disrupts alveolarization by mechanisms that promote lung inflammation and prevent optimal lung development and repair. Importantly, we have identified several potential therapeutic targets for sepsis-mediated BPD in preterm infants.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature infants, characterized by arrested alveolar septation, leading to impaired development of the immature lung. The pathomechanisms at play that underlie this arrested lung development are largely unknown. In the present study, a potential role for microRNA (miR) species - which are emerging as key regulators or organogenesis and tissue differentiation - in arrested alveolarization in an experimental animal model of BPD was assessed. A microarray screen identified miR-135b as being highly upregulated (2-fold, 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, at 2, 3, 5, and 14 days post-natal, respectively) by exposure of newborn mouse lungs to hyperoxic (85% O2) conditions, in a well-characterized mouse model of BPD. A comparison of primary mouse lung fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial (alveolar type II) and smooth muscle cells revealed miR-135b to be expressed primarily in lung epithelial cells, placing miR-135b in an ideal cell-type to influence epithelial cell plasticity and septal development. Application of antagomiR-135b consistently suppressed lung miR-135b expression, as well as that of miR-135a, which together constitute the miR-135 family of microRNA. This suppression was seen under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. The total septal volume in lungs from 14-day old mice was reduced from 0.11 cm3 (normoxia, scrambled antagomiRs) to 0.06 cm3 (hyperoxia, scrambled antagomiRs). Application of antagomiR-135b largely restored lung septal volume, to 0.10 cm3 (hyperoxia, antagomirs-135b), as assessed by state-of-the-art stereomorphological analysis. The miR-135 family was also demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of septal wall thickness, where the septal thickness in lungs from 14-day old mice was increased from 10.2 mum (normoxia, scrambled antagomiRs) to 15.7 mum (hyperoxia, scrambled antagomiRs). Application of antagomiR-135b tended to further increase septal wall thickness in hyperoxia-exposed mouse pups, to 18.4 mum (hyperoxia, antagomirs-135b). In silico analysis identified Smad5 as a candidate miR-135b target, which is a key signalling molecule in the developmentally important transforming growth factor-beta and bone morphogenetic protein signalling systems. Consistent with this idea, Smad5 levels in the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed newborn mouse pups were reduced compared with normoxia-exposed mouse pups. Furthermore, application of antagomir-135b to hyperoxia-exposed mouse largely restored normal Smad5 expression. These data suggest that the impact of miR-135b - levels of which are elevated during perturbed late lung development associated with hyperoxia exposure - on Smad5 expression may play a role in aberrant alveolarization of the developing mouse lung.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of preterm birth associated with significant morbidity. Due to the complexity of risk factors and limited availability of clinical samples, an understanding of this disease, potential biomarkers and causal mechanisms are limited. Prematurely born infants requiring supplemental oxygen often develop BPD, as oxidative stress disrupts critical pathways of lung development. Rodent models involving neonatal exposure to excessive oxygen concentrations (hyperoxia) have been used to study the mechanisms contributing to BPD pathology. Transcriptomic assessment of the effects of hyperoxia in neonatal mouse lungs using RNASeq will identify novel genes and pathways associated with BPD. Method(s): We examined gene expression changes in lung tissue from newborn C57Bl/6 mice exposed to 100% oxygen for 10 days and room air-exposed age matched controls. Total RNA was isolated from individual whole lung tissues (n=14) and pooled in duplicates to perform RNASeq using the Illumina platform. Alignments were generated by ELAND v1.8 algorithm using Illumina CASAVA software. Normalized gene expression data were filtered to remove undetected genes. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used to identify genes with differential expression. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for pathway and network analyses. Expression patterns for selected genes were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Result(s): A total of 798 genes were identified as differentially expressed between 3 hyperoxia and 4 control samples by SAM at FDR = 0, and 300 of those had fold change >= 2. We successfully validated 24 of 31 genes by qPCR. There was a clear association between the magnitude change identified by RNASeq and subsequent qPCR validation. Canonical pathways significantly dysregulated in hyperoxia lungs included Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress signaling, p53 signaling, hepatic fibrosis and sildenafil pathways. Interestingly most genes significantly affected in hyperoxic lungs (~70%) showed opposite expression change during organogenesis, consistent with arrested lung development, but some changed in same direction. 13% of the genes demonstrating a significant response to hyperoxia (103 of 798) were also dysregulated (t-test p<0.05) in human BPD lung tissue. Summary: We have generated genome-wide expression data from hyperoxia-exposed neonatal mouse lung tissue using RNA-Seq. We have identified 300 genes dysregulated in this model of BPD-like pathology. This model captures some aspects of BPD, but likely represents a more acute phase than available human tissue. Further analysis of these data would enhance our current knowledge of BPD, and may be used in developing novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) regulate lung development after birth, as well as the role of miRNAs in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). For this purpose, a total of 90 neonatal Wistar rats were randomly and equally assigned to either a model group or a control group. On postnatal days 3, 7 and 14, the lung tissues were collected for histological analysis to determine morphological changes. The expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, also known as CD31) were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. A miRCURY TM LNA array was employed to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs, and the possible target genes of those miRNAs were predicted. Our results revealed that, compared with the control group, the following changes induced by hyperoxia were observed in the model group over time: a decrease in the number, but an increase in the size of the alveoli, and a decrease in the number of secondary septa formed. In the model group, from postnatal days 3-14, the mRNA and protein expression levels of PCNA and CD31 were significantly lower than those in the control group. The differentially expressed miRNAs between the 2 groups were identified on days 3, 7 and 14 after birth. Possible target genes were identified for 32 differentially expressed miRNAs. Taken together, these findings suggest that during the development of BPD, an alveolarization disorder with microvascular dysplasia co-exists with the differential expression of certain miRNAs during the different stages of alveolar development in a neonatal rat model of hyperoxia-induced BPD. This indicates that miRNAs may participate in the occurrence and development of BPD.

AB  - Multiple signaling pathways are involved in morphogenesis and cell differentiation during lung development. Signaling associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is implicated in pathogenesis of the neonatal chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, little is known about the effects of ER stress on lung maturation, especially alveolar epithelial development/differentiation. In this study, we generated mice with lung epithelial cell-specific knockout of Grp78, a master regulator of ER stress responses/homeostasis by crossing floxed Grp78 mice to Sftpc-cre mice. Loss of Grp78 in lung epithelium caused early perinatal lethality. The proportion of knockouts was 17.2% at embryonic day 18 (E18), lower than the expected 25%. At postnatal day 1 (PN1) the proportion of knockouts decreased to 5.6% and all knockout pups died within a few hours from respiratory distress. Histological analysis of embryonic lungs revealed dilated airways at E14 and enlarged, irregular airspaces filled with cellular debris at E18. At PN1, lungs appeared severely dilated or simplified with thin alveolar septae compared to control animals. Western analysis and immunostaining of lung sections showed that expression of markers for both alveolar epithelial type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells was significantly decreased in E18 knockouts. Analysis of UPR signaling/ER stress protein markers showed increased levels of GRP94, p-eIF-2alpha, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) in E18 knockout lungs. Microarray analysis revealed that UPR signaling was the most affected pathway in E18 knockout lungs and qRT-PCR confirmed increased mRNA expression of GRP94, CHOP and PDI and several other major UPR components. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal ER expansion in AT2 cells, which were more loosely arranged and appeared to be detaching from the epithelial sheet. TUNEL assays and immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 demonstrated increased levels of apoptosis in knockouts at E18. While mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (e.g. Nrf2) was reduced, expression of genes involved in generation of reactive oxygen species was elevated. Additionally, increased levels of p21, a key downstream target of TGF-beta signaling involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and p-Smad3 were detected. Collectively, these results suggest that GRP78 plays a key role in protection of AT2 cells, a major stem/progenitor lung cell population, from apoptosis via regulation of UPR signaling during lung development, and implicate oxidative stress and TGF-beta/Smad signaling as mediators of AT2 cell apoptosis in Grp78 knockout mice.

AB  - Background: Preterm infants often require respiratory support, which can injure their lungs and lead to abnormal lung development called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The initial lung cell types affected by injury and the molecular mechanisms leading from lung injury to BPD are not fully understood. Therefore our aim is to mimic ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) in vitro to investigate the cell types and mechanisms leading to BPD. Method(s): Fetal rat lung fibroblasts were isolated at embryonic day (E)19 and exposed to 0 or 20% phasic over-distension. Cells were collected after 15 minutes, 1, 3, 6 or 24 hours to measure cell proliferation (ki67), apoptosis (caspase-3) and early lung injury markers (CTGF, CYR61 and EGR1). Result(s): Fibroblasts exposed to 20% over-distension had a 3-fold increase in EGR1 mRNA and protein levels within 1 hour of over-distension (p < 0.05). There was a 2-3 fold increase in caspase-3 positive cells after 6 hours of over-distension (p < 0.05). At 24 hours, very few over-distended cells were caspase-3 positive, yet there was a 6% increase in the proportion of cells proliferating (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): This in vitro model of over-distension injury successfully replicates many of the features associated with VILI including increased fibroblast apoptosis, proliferation and markers of lung injury, suggesting that fetal lung fibroblasts are involved in the initial response to VILI. This in vitro model of VILI will allow future studies to identify the early cellular mechanisms that mediate the response of the lung to VILI and that may initiate the cascade of events leading to BPD.

AB  - Introduction: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic pulmonary disorders, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a respiratory condition affecting preterm infants. In BPD, treatment often involves respiratory support with high oxygen levels and generation of ROS is an adverse consequence that has been associated with vascular damage and impaired lung development and function in a subset of infants. Polymorphisms in a few candidate genes have been associated with BPD susceptibility, however the genetic basis of differential susceptibility remains poorly understood. Understanding the role of genetics is critical to improving treatment strategies and reducing oxidant injury in developing lungs. Herein, we report a genetic model of hyperoxic lung injury including 30 neonate inbred strains of mice. The objective was to utilize haplotype association mapping of quantitative phenotypes to identify genes important to susceptibility of neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Method(s): Time-mated pregnant inbred mice were allowed to deliver spontaneously. During exposures, CFW dams we used for cross-fostering every 24hr. At postnatal day 1 (P1), neonates were pooled and reassigned to litters exposed to 100% O2 or air for 72hr. Dams were provided with food ad libitum. Following exposure, neonates were necropsied at P4 and bronchealveolar lavage fluid analysis (protein concentration, total cell counts, neutrophils, and epithelial cells) and histophathology were measured as disease phenotypes. All exposures were carried out at the NIEHS and approved by IACUC. Haplotype mapping of response phenotypes was done using SNPster. Result(s): The neonate inbred strains demonstrate lung injury following hyperoxia exposure. Significant inter-strain variation in hyperoxia response phenotypes was found, with broad-sense heritability estimates ranging from 47.2 to 58.6%. The most resistant strains to hyperoxic lung injury include 129S1/SvImJ and BALB/cByJ while C3H/HeJ and PWD/Ph mice are among the most susceptible. Haplotype association mapping studies identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs)with genes of interest for the disease phenotypes. Conclusion(s): Significant inter-strain variation in hyperoxia-induced disease phenotypes is consistent with a strong genetic contribution to disease. Interestingly, hyperoxia responses in neonate mice do not predict responses in adults of the same strain. Furthermore, through in silico haplotype mapping we have identified novel QTLs and candidate genes underlying susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury in this model of BPD that will provide important mechanistic insight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants having immature lungs often require respiratory support, potentially leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Conventional BPD rodent models based on mechanical ventilation (MV) present outcome measured at the end of the ventilation period. A reversible intubation and ventilation model in newborn rats recently allowed discovering that different sets of genes modified their expression related to time after MV. In a newborn rat model, the expression profile 48 h after MV was analyzed with gene arrays to detect potentially interesting candidates with an impact on BPD development., METHODS: Rat pups were injected P4-5 with 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). One day later, MV with 21 or 60% oxygen was applied during 6 h. Animals were sacrified 48 h after end of ventilation. Affymetrix gene arrays assessed the total gene expression profile in lung tissue., RESULTS: In fully treated animals (LPS + MV + 60% O(2)) vs. controls, 271 genes changed expression significantly. All modified genes could be classified in six pathways: tissue remodeling/wound repair, immune system and inflammatory response, hematopoiesis, vasodilatation, and oxidative stress. Major alterations were found in the MMP and complement system., CONCLUSION: MMPs and complement factors play a central role in several of the pathways identified and may represent interesting targets for BPD treatment/prevention.Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease occurring in ~30% of preterm infants born less than 30 wk of gestation (1). Its main risk factors include lung immaturity due to preterm delivery, mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen toxicity, chorioamnionitis, and sepsis. The main feature is an arrest of alveolar and capillary formation (2). Models trying to decipher genes involved in the pathophysiology of BPD are mainly based on MV and oxygen application to young mammals with immature lungs of different species (3). In newborn rodent models, analyses of lung structure and gene and protein expression are performed for practical reasons directly at the end of MV (4,5,6). However, later appearing changes of gene expression might also have an impact on lung development and the evolution towards BPD and cannot be discovered by such models. Recently, we developed a newborn rat model of MV using an atraumatic (orotracheal) intubation technique that allows the weaning of the newborn animal off anesthesia and MV, the extubation to spontaneous breathing, and therefore allows the evaluation of effects of MV after a ventilation-free period of recovery (7). Indeed, applying this concept of atraumatic intubation by direct laryngoscopy, we recently were able to show significant differences between gene expression changes appearing directly after MV compared to those measured after a ventilation-free interval of 48 h. Immediately after MV, inflammation-related genes showed a transitory modified expression, while another set of more structurally related genes changed their expression only after a delay of 2 d (7). Lung structure, analyzed by conventional 2D histology and also by 3D reconstruction using synchrotron x-ray tomographic microscopy revealed, 48 h after end of MV, a reduced complexity of lung architecture compared to the nonventilated rat lungs, similar to the typical findings in BPD. To extend these observations about late gene expression modifications, we performed with a similar model a full gene expression profile of lung tissue 48 h after the end of MV with either room air or 60% oxygen. Essentially, we measured changes in the expression of genes related to the MMPs and complement system which played a role in many of the six identified mostly affected pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal or postnatal systemic inflammation can contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We investigated whether prenatal intra-amniotic (i.a.) inflammation or early postnatal systemic inflammation can induce BPD in a rat model., METHODS: One microgram of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle was injected into the amniotic sacs 2 d before delivery (E20). After birth, 0.25 mg/kg of LPS or vehicle was injected into the peritoneum of pups on postnatal day (P)1, P3, and P5. On P7 and P14, peripheral blood (PB), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung tissue were obtained and analyzed., RESULTS: Postnatal i.p. injections of LPS significantly increased neutrophil counts in PB and BALF on P7 and P14. Similarly, proinflammatory cytokine and angiogenic factor transcript levels were increased in the lung by i.p. LPS on P7. Alveolar and pulmonary vascular development was markedly disrupted by i.p. LPS on P14. However, pretreatment with i.a. LPS significantly negated the detrimental effects of postnatal i.p. LPS on PB and BALF neutrophil counts and on lung proinflammatory cytokine expression and histopathological changes., CONCLUSION: Exposure to early postnatal systemic LPS induces BPD, an arrest in alveolarization, in neonatal rats. Preceding exposure to i.a. LPS protects the lungs against BPD triggered by postnatal systemic inflammation.

AB  - Introduction: Abnormal angiogenesis is a prominent feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and may underlie the arrest of alveolar development that characterizes this condition. Reduced expression of pro-angiogenic genes has been implicated in human cases and animal models of BPD, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether miRNA up-regulation might correlate with the reduced pro-angiogenic gene expression in a model of BPD. Method(s): Neonatal ICR mice were exposed to 80% oxygen (O2) or room air for 29 days. Lung microanatomy was assessed using standard histological techniques. Comprehensive mRNA and miRNA profiling was performed using lung tissue from both groups. The effect of hyperoxia on mRNA and miRNA levels was determined using ANOVA statistical analysis of CT values and fold-change. Potential direct mRNA targets of miRNAs within angiogenic pathways were predicted through miRNA-mRNA endogenous correlation and computational mapping in miRBase. Individual genes involved in angiogenesis were assessed by Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis for miRNA regulatory networks using the DAVID database and manual reviews of known pro-angiogenic genes. Protein expression was evaluated by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry techniques. Result(s): After 29 days, the lungs of O2-exposed mice displayed histological changes consistent with BPD. We found decreased expression of several pro-angiogenic genes, including Angiogenin-1, Angiogenin-3, b-catenin, PECAM-1, VE-cadherin and VEGF-A. Many of these genes are predicted targets of simultaneously up-regulated miRNAs, including mir-135b, mir-210, mir-699, mir-690, let-7i, mir-322, mir-497 and mir-27a. Most of the observed down-regulated genes are required for normal alveolar and pulmonary vascular development, and many are diminished in the lungs of human neonates with BPD. Immunodensitometry demonstrated decreased expression of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, beta-catenin and angiogenin proteins in the P29 O2-exposed mice. In our manual review, we discovered markedly decreased expression of Ntrk2 which encodes a neurotrophic receptor (TrkB) involved in a known signaling pathway that stimulates angiogenesis. In addition, Ntrk2 expression was a predicted target of up-regulated mir-29a and mir-29c. Immunohistochemistry clearly demonstrated decreased expression of the TrkB receptor. Conclusion(s): Using an established model of BPD, we found evidence that miRNAs may impair angiogenesis by targeting mRNA transcripts whose encoded proteins promote endothelial cell growth and functional maturity. Future directions include demonstrating the effect of hyperoxia on human endothelial cell proliferation, cell migration, and endothelial tube formation and attempting to recover impaired cellular processes by over-expression of mRNA and/or silencing miRNA via locked nucleic acids.

AB  - The proinflammatory stimulus of chorioamnionitis is commonly associated with preterm delivery. Women at risk of preterm delivery receive antenatal glucocorticoids to functionally mature the fetal lung. However, the effects of the combined exposures of chorioamnionitis and antenatal glucocorticoids on the fetus are poorly understood. Time-mated ewes with singleton fetuses received an intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) either preceding or following maternal intramuscular betamethasone 7 or 14 days before delivery, and the fetuses were delivered at 120 days gestational age (GA) (term = 150 days GA). Gestation matched controls received intra-amniotic and maternal intramuscular saline. Compared with saline controls, intra-amniotic LPS increased inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage and myeloperoxidase, Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 mRNA, PU.1, CD3, and Foxp3-positive cells in the fetal lung. LPS-induced lung maturation measured as increased airway surfactant and improved lung gas volumes. Intra-amniotic LPS-induced inflammation persisted until 14 days after exposure. Betamethasone treatment alone induced modest lung maturation but, when administered before intra-amniotic LPS, suppressed lung inflammation. Interestingly, betamethasone treatment after LPS did not counteract inflammation but enhanced lung maturation. We conclude that the order of exposures of intra-amniotic LPS or maternal betamethasone had large effects on fetal lung inflammation and maturation. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Pulmonary complications from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are attributed to alveolar simplification and impaired microvasculature growth resulting from oxidative injuries associated with hyperoxia, mechanical ventilation, and infection; which is often experienced by the premature infant. Developmental programs are further aggravated by concurrent immature antioxidant systems in these individuals. Thioredoxins, part of a major antioxidant system, regulate the reduction-oxidation (redox) state of protein thiols through oxidoreductase activities of a highly conserved catalytic site capable of undergoing reversible oxidation. Redox regulation of dithiol/disulfide status is critical for numerous signaling processes as an endogenous thiol oxidoreductase, thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is necessary for normal cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and antioxidant induction. Little is known about its signaling role in distal lung epithelium during hyperoxic exposure and how deficiencies in this redox node may lead to BPD. Mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells cultured in 95% oxygen for up to three days had significantly reduced oxidoreductase activity of Trx1 and its corresponding reductase, TrxR1. Reduction of these activities did not correlate with changes in protein expression and we speculate this is due to oxidation of cysteines in the catalytic sites of these two molecules. Inhibition of TrxR with auranofin, thereby impairing Trx1 activity, augmented hyperoxic cell death. MLE-12 cells transduced with retrovirus expressing the BioID transgene fused to the carboxy-terminus of redox-active (hTrx1-BirA-HA) and -inactive (hTrx1C32/35S-BirA-HA) human Trx1 were cultured in room air or hyperoxia for subsequent proteomic analysis. This proximity-based labeling method, BioID, was used to identify protein substrates targeted by Trx1 and pinpoint molecular events, regulated via dithiol/disulfide interactions, underlying hyperoxia-induced injury. Ongoing studies are focused on prioritizing novel Trx1 substrates identified via BioID based on pathway analysis, known functional relevance within alveolar type II cells, and secondary validation through in vitro and in vivo approaches. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that maintenance of Trx1 activity attenuates hyperoxia-mediated cell death of alveolar epithelial cells and novel redox-sensitive Trx1 substrates were identified that may serve as molecular targets in BPD.

AB  - Rationale: Supplemental oxygen is commonly used to treat hypoxia in premature neonates. Considerable evidence links oxygen exposure to development of neonatal diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma. There is a known sex preference for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but the role of sex steroids (maternal or fetal) is not clear. Understanding the role of local lung metabolism of sex steroids in hyperoxia effects on the immature lung may help to further elucidate mechanisms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that altered local generation of estradiol or estrogen receptor expression with hyperoxia contributes to pathophysiologic changes observed with oxygen treatment in the fetal or neonatal lung. Methods and Results: mRNA expression in postnatal mouse lung was obtained from four groups of mice: room air vs. 80% hyperoxia for 14 vs. 29 days (n=2-3/group) using an Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. Twelve genes related to estrogen receptors, estrogen synthesis and metabolism were expressed in mouse lung. Microarray analysis showed CYP1a1 - an enzyme responsible estradiol metabolism - with the most significant change in expression after 14 days hyperoxia. Therefore, in vitro studies were performed in human fetal airway smooth muscle cells (fASM) exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia and probed for expression of proteins involved in estrogen metabolism. Proliferation studies were performed in in the presence of estradiol. In fASM cells, CYP1a1 expression was altered with hyperoxia exposure while the enhanced cell proliferation observed in hyperoxia was blunted with estradiol. Pharmacologic inhibition studies indicate that this could be attributed to upregulation of CYP1a1 enzyme and subsequent increased metabolism of estradiol to a downstream intermediate 2-methoxyestradiol. Conclusion(s): The goal of this study was to characterize the expression pattern of pathways involved in estrogen signaling and metabolism in the presence of hyperoxia. These results are the first to specifically study estradiol metabolism in fetal and early postnatal lung tissue and its relationship to hyperoxia. The alterations in CYP1a1 expression and changes in cell proliferation with estradiol (and reversal with inhibition of CYP1a1) all suggest CYP1a1 as a potential mechanism for the protective effect of estradiol in the hyperoxia exposed immature lung.

AB  - Cross-species analysis of microarray data has shown improved discriminating power between healthy and diseased states. Computational approaches have proven effective in deciphering the complexity of human disease by identifying upstream regulatory elements and the transcription factors that interact with them. Here we used both methods to identify highly conserved transcriptional responses during mechanical ventilation, an important therapeutic treatment that has injurious side effects. We generated control and ventilated whole lung samples from the premature baboon model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), processed them for microarray, and combined them with existing whole lung oligonucleotide microarray data from 85 additional control samples from mouse, rat, and human and 19 additional ventilated samples from mouse and rat. Of the 2,531 orthologs shared by all 114 samples, 60 were modulated by mechanical ventilation [false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted q value (q(FDR)) = 0.005, ANOVA]. These included transcripts encoding the transcription factors ATF3 and FOS. Because of compelling known roles for these transcription factors, we used computational methods to predict their targets in the premature baboon model of BPD, which included elastin (ELN), gastrin-releasing polypeptide (GRP), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). This approach identified highly conserved transcriptional responses to mechanical ventilation and may facilitate identification of therapeutic targets to reduce the side effects of this valuable treatment.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature infants associated with barotrauma, oxygen therapy, and prematurity, and characterized by arrested alveolarization. Infants with BPD have increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells containing gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). We identified 2-fold higher GRP levels in preterm baboons and infants that later developed BPD. GRP blockade with antibody 2A11 abrogates lung injury and arrested alveolarization in 2 different baboon models of BPD. Conversely, newborn mice treated with exogenous GRP have diminished alveolar development. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that GRP blockade can modulate lung injury and development in mice. Newborn C57BL/6 pups were at room air or exposed to continuous 75% hyperoxia (HO) from postnatal day 1 (P1)-P18, given IP injections of 2A11 (5 or 0.2mug/kg), or MOPC21, negative control IgG (5 or 0.2mug/kg), or saline (PBS). At P18, lungs were harvested for histopathology and expression analysis using Affymetrix microarrays. Compared to pups at room air, HO-exposed pups given MOPC or PBS had higher mean linear intercepts (MLI) (P=0.001), indicating decreased septation. HO-exposed lungs given high-dose 2A11 had even larger alveoli than HO controls. However, with HO low-dose 2A11 (0.2mug/kg) improved alveolarization and reduced interstitial fibrosis. Room air pups given any dose 2A11 had more alveolar septation than control room air pups (P=0.03). Lung expression analysis (3-7 microarrays/group) compared room air vs. HO, high-dose vs. low-dose 2A11 or MOPC. High-dose 2A11+HO vs. HO+MOPC increased gene expression (FC>2, P<0.05) for host defense (IL-18, defensin-beta4), epithelial barrier function (repetin, loricrin, MUC5B), pro-inflammatory (CD68, granzyme-1, and P-selectin), but decreased tenascin-C and thrombospondin-2. Low-dose 2A11 increased expression (FC>2, P<0.05) of SP-A, PDGFR-alpha, Hedgehog-interacting protein and MMP3, and decreased expression (FC<0.5, P<0.05) of thrombospondin-1, chitinase 3-like-3, dectin-2beta, FcRgamma, TNFalpha-induced protein-2). In conclusion, low-dose 2A11+HO promotes alveolarization, with increased pro-developmental and decreased pro-inflammatory mRNAs. In contrast, high-dose 2A11+HO impairs alveolarization, with increased pro-inflammatory and few decreased developmental mRNAs. These observations suggest that some GRP is necessary for normal septation but blockade of excessive GRP in hyperoxic animals may promote alveolar formation.

As hyperoxia inhibits normal lung development, our hypothesis was that hyperoxia-induced dysregulation of this miRNA and its target gene COX-2 would contribute to abnormal lung development in hyperoxia. METHOD(S): (1) Lung homogenates from C57BL/6 (Wild-type; WT) mice were evaluated at birth, postnatal day 4 (P4), P7, P14, and P42 for miR-214, Cox-2 mRNA and protein. (2) Newborn WT mice along with their dam were exposed to normoxia (21%) or hyperoxia (95% O2) from 4 to 14 days of age in combination with daily i.p. injections of either Iloprost 200ng/kg/day (a commercially available analog of prostacyclin that is downstream of Cox-2) or vehicle. miR-214, and COX-2 mRNA and protein were estimated in lung homogenates; Alveolar development was estimated by Radial Alveolar Counts, Mean Linear Intercepts, and secondary crest density. (4) The effect of Iloprost on TNF-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 production by LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages was determined. RESULT(S): (1) miR-214 decreased over the course of lung development from P4 to P42, with corresponding increases in Cox-2 mRNA and protein (Figure 1). (2) Hyperoxia decreased miR-214, and increased COX-2 mRNA and protein. (3) Iloprost administration attenuated hyperoxia-induced inhibition of lung development in newborn mice as evident by a reduction in MLI and increase in RAC and SCD compared to hyperoxia-exposed mice (Figure 2). (4) Iloprost reduced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 production by mouse macrophages. CONCLUSION(S): miR-214 and its target gene Cox-2 are regulators of lung development, and mediate abnormal lung development during hyperoxia. Iloprost attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury and has anti-inflammatory effects. Augmentation of Cox-2 signaling using Iloprost is a potential therapeutic strategy that may be useful in hyperoxia-induced lung injury, such as in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (Figure Presented).

AB  - DNA methylation, a major epigenetic mechanism, may regulate coordinated expression of multiple genes at specific time points during alveolar septation in lung development. The objective of this study was to identify genes regulated by methylation during normal septation in mice and during disordered septation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In mice, newborn lungs (preseptation) and adult lungs (postseptation) were evaluated by microarray analysis of gene expression and immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). In humans, microarray gene expression data were integrated with genome-wide DNA methylation data from bronchopulmonary dysplasia versus preterm and term lung. Genes with reciprocal changes in expression and methylation, suggesting regulation by DNA methylation, were identified. In mice, 95 genes with inverse correlation between expression and methylation during normal septation were identified. In addition to genes known to be important in lung development (Wnt signaling, Angpt2, Sox9, etc.) and its extracellular matrix (Tnc, Eln, etc.), genes involved with immune and antioxidant defense (Stat4, Sod3, Prdx6, etc.) were also observed. In humans, 23 genes were differentially methylated with reciprocal changes in expression in bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with preterm or term lung. Genes of interest included those involved with detoxifying enzymes (Gstm3) and transforming growth factor-beta signaling (bone morphogenetic protein 7 [Bmp7]). In terms of overlap, 20 genes and three pathways methylated during mouse lung development also demonstrated changes in methylation between preterm and term human lung. Changes in methylation correspond to altered expression of a number of genes associated with lung development, suggesting that DNA methylation of these genes may regulate normal and abnormal alveolar septation.

AB  - Rationale: The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is rising despite medical advances. Claudins are a family of transmembrane proteins that are required for tight junction formation. The lung-specific tight junction protein claudin-18.1 is the most abundant claudin in type 1 (AT1) pneumocytes and is specifically regulated in human alveolar epithelial cells by lung maturation agonists and inflammatory mediators. This study was undertaken to investigate a potential role for claudin-18 in alveolar barrier function and postnatal alveolarization. Method(s): Lungs from a novel claudin-18 knockout (KO) mouse were compared with wildtype (WT) mouse lungs using whole genome microarray, in addition to histological and biochemical analyses of injury. Alveolar epithelial barrier structure and function were investigated in vivo, including ultrastructural evaluation. Claudin-18 levels were measured in preterm human lungs. Result(s): Histological analysis demonstrated similar histology between genotypes at postnatal day 3 but markedly decreased alveolarization in KO mice by 4 weeks of age (Figure 1). Mean linear intercept (inversely proportional to lung surface area) was significantly increased at 4 weeks in KO mice (WT 29.3 +/- 4.2 vs. KO 50.5 +/- 1.3 mum; P<0.05) but not at postnatal day 3 (WT 48.5 +/- 0.9 vs. KO 51.1 +/- 0.7 mum; P=NS). Microarray analysis followed by quantitative real time PCR revealed differential expression of critical genes involved in lung development and angiogenesis in KO mouse lungs by 4 weeks of age. KO mice had evidence of alveolar epithelial barrier disruption by 4 weeks, as measured by: 1) the accumulation of the AT1 specific marker T1-alpha in broncholalveolar lavage fluid (2.7-fold increase over WT, P<0.001); 2) increased accumulation of FITC-albumin in lavage fluid 4 hours after intraperitoneal instillation (WT 58 +/- 28 mug/ml vs. KO 148 +/- 28 mug/ml, P <0.001); and 3) ultrastructural distortion of AT1-AT1 cell junctions in transmission electron microscopy images of KO mouse lungs (Figure 2). Preterm human infants born 24-28 weeks of gestation are at the highest risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a disease characterized by impaired alveolar development. Preterm human lungs (gestational ages 24-32 weeks, n=4) demonstrated decreased mRNA expression of claudin-18 at 24 to 27 weeks gestational age relative to 32 weeks. Conclusion(s): Claudin-18 deficiency in mice results in alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction and delayed alveolarization. Data suggest that extremely preterm human lungs are relatively claudin-18 deficient. Therefore, claudin-18 deficiency or dysfunction may contribute to infant chronic lung disease. (Figure Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature birth, perinatal inflammation, and life-saving therapies such as postnatal oxygen and mechanical ventilation are strongly associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); these risk factors, alone or combined, cause lung inflammation and alter programmed molecular patterns of normal lung development. The current knowledge on the molecular regulation of lung development mainly derives from mechanistic studies conducted in newborn rodents exposed to postnatal hyperoxia, which have been proven useful but have some limitations., METHODS: Here, we used the rabbit model of BPD as a cost-effective alternative model that mirrors human lung development and, in addition, enables investigating the impact of premature birth per se on the pathophysiology of BPD without further perinatal insults (e.g., hyperoxia, LPS-induced inflammation). First, we characterized the rabbit's normal lung development along the distinct stages (i.e., pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar phases) using histological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Then, the impact of premature birth was investigated, comparing the sequential transcriptomic profiles of preterm rabbits obtained at different time intervals during their first week of postnatal life with those from age-matched term pups., RESULTS: Histological findings showed stage-specific morphological features of the developing rabbit's lung and validated the selected time intervals for the transcriptomic profiling. Cell cycle and embryo development, oxidative phosphorylation, and WNT signaling, among others, showed high gene expression in the pseudoglandular phase. Autophagy, epithelial morphogenesis, response to transforming growth factor beta, angiogenesis, epithelium/endothelial cells development, and epithelium/endothelial cells migration pathways appeared upregulated from the 28th day of gestation (early saccular phase), which represents the starting point of the premature rabbit model. Premature birth caused a significant dysregulation of the inflammatory response. TNF-responsive, NF-kappaB regulated genes were significantly upregulated at premature delivery and triggered downstream inflammatory pathways such as leukocyte activation and cytokine signaling, which persisted upregulated during the first week of life. Preterm birth also dysregulated relevant pathways for normal lung development, such as blood vessel morphogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition., CONCLUSION: These findings establish the 28-day gestation premature rabbit as a suitable model for mechanistic and pharmacological studies in the context of BPD.

AB  - Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in preterm infants, which is characterized by alveolar and vascular dysplasia and increased vascular permeability. Hyperoxia is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of BPD, hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) model has similar pathological manifestations as human BPD, therefore, may provide insight into the pathogenesis of human BPD. Studies have shown that Twist1 regulates pulmonary vascular permeability of LPS-induced lung injury through the Ang-Tie2 pathway. However, the effect of Twist1 pathway on vascular permeability in HALI has not been reported. Methods: We randomly exposed newborn rats to the room air or hyperoxia for 14 days. Lung histopathology, immunofluorescence, vascular permeability, mRNA and protein expression was assessed on day 1,7,14. Results: Our results verified that hyperoxia caused alveolar and vascular developmental disorders and increased pulmonary vascular permeability, which was consistent with previous findings. In hyperoxia-exposed rat lungs, the expressions of Twist1, Ang1, Tie1, Tie2, and pTie2 were significantly reduced, whereas the expression of Ang2 was significantly increased. Next, we observed a significant down-regulation of the Akt/Foxo1 pathway. Conclusion:  In HALI, the pulmonary microvascular permeability was increased, accompanied by changes in Twist1-Tie2 pathway which combined to Angs, and downregulation of Tie1 and Akt/Foxo1 pathway.

AB  - Late lung development is a period of alveolar and microvascular formation, which is pivotal in ensuring sufficient and effective gas exchange. Defects in late lung development manifest in premature infants as a chronic lung disease named bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Numerous studies demonstrated the therapeutic properties of exogenous bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in experimental BPD. However, very little is known regarding the regenerative capacity of resident lung MSCs (L-MSCs) during normal development and in BPD. In this study we aimed to characterize the L-MSC population in homeostasis and upon injury. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile in situ Ly6a+ L-MSCs in the lungs of normal and O2-exposed neonatal mice (a well-established model to mimic BPD) at 3 developmental timepoints (postnatal days 3, 7, and 14). Hyperoxia exposure increased the number and altered the expression profile of L-MSCs, particularly by increasing the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and anti-angiogenic genes. In order to identify potential changes induced in the L-MSCs transcriptome by storage and culture, we profiled 15 000 Ly6a+ L-MSCs after in vitro culture. We observed great differences in expression profiles of in situ and cultured L-MSCs, particularly those derived from healthy lungs. Additionally, we have identified the location of Ly6a+/Col14a1+ L-MSCs in the developing lung and propose Serpinf1 as a novel, culture-stable marker of L-MSCs. Finally, cell communication analysis suggests inflammatory signals from immune and endothelial cells as main drivers of hyperoxia-induced changes in L-MSCs transcriptome.

AB  - Objective: To examine the gene expression regarding pulmonary vascular disease in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia in young mice. Premature delivery puts babies at risk of severe complications. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of premature birth leading to lifelong affection of pulmonary function. BPD is recognized as a disease of arrested alveolar development. The disease process is not fully described and no complete cure or prevention is known. The focus of interest in the search for treatment and prevention of BPD has traditionally been at airspace level; however, the pulmonary vasculature is increasingly acknowledged in the pathology of BPD. The aim of the investigation was to study the gene expression in lungs with BPD with regards to pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). Methods: We employed a murine model of hyperoxia-induced BPD and gene expression microarray technique to determine the mRNA expression in lung tissue from young mice. We combined gene expression pathway analysis and analyzed the biological function of multiple single gene transcripts from lung homogenate to study the PVD relevant gene expression. Results: There were n = 117 significantly differentially regulated genes related to PVD through down-regulation of contractile elements, up- and down-regulation of factors involved in vascular tone and tissue-specific genes. Several genes also allowed for pinpointing gene expression differences to the pulmonary vasculature. The gene Nppa coding for a natriuretic peptide, a potent vasodilator, was significantly down-regulated and there was a significant up-regulation of Pde1a (phosphodiesterase 1A), Ptger3 (prostaglandin e receptor 3), and Ptgs1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase one). Conclusion:  The pulmonary vasculature is affected by the arrest of secondary alveolarization as seen by differentially regulated genes involved in vascular tone and pulmonary vasculature suggesting BPD is not purely an airspace disease. Clues to prevention and treatment may lie in the pulmonary vascular system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is not merely a chronic lung disease, but a systemic condition with multiple organs implications predominantly associated with hyperoxia exposure. Despite advances in current management strategies, limited progress has been made in reducing the BPD-related systemic damage. Meanwhile, although the protective effects of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) or their exosomes on hyperoxia-induced lung injury have been explored by many researchers, the underlying mechanism has not been addressed in detail, and few studies have focused on the therapeutic effect on systemic multiple organ injury., AIM: To investigate whether hUC-MSC intratracheal administration could attenuate hyperoxia-induced lung, heart, and kidney injuries and the underlying regulatory mechanisms., METHODS: Neonatal rats were exposed to hyperoxia (80% O2), treated with hUC-MSCs intratracheal (iT) or intraperitoneal (iP) on postnatal day 7, and harvested on postnatal day 21. The tissue sections of the lung, heart, and kidney were analyzed morphometrically. Protein contents of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were examined. Pulmonary inflammatory cytokines were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A comparative transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung tissue was conducted via RNA-sequencing. Subsequently, we performed reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis to explore the expression of target mRNA and proteins related to inflammatory and oxidative responses., RESULTS: iT hUC-MSCs administration improved pulmonary alveolarization and angiogenesis (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05 for mean linear intercept, septal counts, vascular medial thickness index, and microvessel density respectively). Meanwhile, treatment with hUC-MSCs iT ame liorated right ventricular hypertrophy (for Fulton's index, P < 0.01), and relieved reduced nephrogenic zone width (P < 0.01) and glomerular diameter (P < 0.001) in kidneys. Among the beneficial effects, a reduction of BALF protein, MPO, and MDA was observed in hUC-MSCs groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05 respectively). Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 expression observed in the hyperoxia group were significantly attenuated by hUC-MSCs administration (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05 respectively). In addition, we observed an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 expression in rats that received hUC-MSCs iT compared with rats reared in hyperoxia (P < 0.05). Tran scriptomic analysis showed that the DEGs in lung tissues induced by hyperoxia were enriched in pathways related to inflammatory responses, epithelial cell proliferation, and vasculature development. hUC-MSCs administration blunted these hyperoxia-induced dysregulated genes and resulted in a shift in the gene expression pattern toward the normoxia group. hUC-MSCs increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), JAK2, and STAT3 expression, and their phosphorylation in the lung, heart, and kidney (P < 0.05). Remarkably, no significant difference was observed between the iT and iP administration., CONCLUSION: iT hUC-MSCs administration ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung, heart, and kidney injuries by activating HO-1 expression and JAK/STAT signaling. The therapeutic benefits of local iT and iP administration are equivalent. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2022. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanisms of susceptibility to oxidant stress in neonatal lungs are not completely understood. We evaluated the role of genetic background in response to oxidant stress in the neonatal lung by exposing mice from 36 inbred strains to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 72 h after birth. Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was evaluated by using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis and pathology. Statistically significant interstrain variation was found for BALF inflammatory cells and protein (heritability estimates range: 33.6-55.7%). Genome-wide association mapping using injury phenotypes identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Comparative mapping of the chromosome 6 QTLs identified Chrm2 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 2, cardiac) as a candidate susceptibility gene, and mouse strains with a nonsynonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Chrm2 that causes an amino acid substitution (P265L) had significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced inflammation compared to strains without the SNP. Further, hyperoxia-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in neonatal mice with targeted deletion of Chrm2, relative to wild-type controls. This study has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of oxidative lung injury in neonates. Copyright © FASEB.

AB  - Exposure to hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. We observed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling protects newborn mice and primary fetal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) against hyperoxic injury. Additionally, a recent genome-wide transcriptome study in a newborn mouse model of BPD identified AhR as a key regulator of hyperoxia-induced gene dysregulation. Whether the AhR similarly deregulates genes in HPMEC is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize transcriptome level gene expression profile in AhR-sufficient and -deficient HPMEC exposed to normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Global gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina microarray platform and selected genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR. AhR gene expression and hyperoxia independently affected the expression of 540 and 593 genes, respectively. Two-way ANOVA further identified 85 genes that were affected by an interaction between AhR expression and exposure to hyperoxia. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology, and Reactome pathway analysis identified cell proliferation, immune function, cytokine signaling, and organ development as the major pathways affected in AhR-deficient cells. The biological processes that were significantly enriched by hyperoxia included metabolic process, stress response, signal transduction, cell cycle, and immune regulation. Cell cycle was the predominant pathway affected by the combined effect of AhR knockdown and hyperoxia. Functional analysis of cell cycle showed that AhR-deficient cells had decreased proliferation compared with AhR-sufficient cells. These findings suggest that AhR modulates hyperoxic lung injury by regulating the genes that are necessary for cell proliferation and inflammation. Copyright © The Author 2016.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are among the most common morbidities affecting extremely premature infants who receive oxygen therapy. Many clinical studies indicate that BPD is associated with advanced ROP. However, the mechanistic link between hyperoxia, BPD, and ROP remains to be explored. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a key executor of inflammasome-induced pyroptosis and inflammation. Inhibition of GSDMD has been shown to attenuate hyperoxia-induced BPD and brain injury in neonatal mice. The objective of this study was to further define the mechanistic roles of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced BPD and ROP in mouse models. Here we show that global GSDMD knockout (GSDMD-KO) protects against hyperoxia-induced BPD by reducing macrophage infiltration, improving alveolarization and vascular development, and decreasing cell death. In addition, GSDMD deficiency prevented hyperoxia-induced ROP by reducing vasoobliteration and neovascularization, improving thinning of multiple retinal tissue layers, and decreasing microglial activation. RNA sequencing analyses of lungs and retinas showed that similar genes, including those from inflammatory, cell death, tissue remodeling, and tissue and vascular developmental signaling pathways, were induced by hyperoxia and impacted by GSDMD-KO in both models. These data highlight the importance of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of BPD and ROP and suggest that targeting GSDMD may be beneficial in preventing and treating BPD and ROP in premature infants.

AB  - Inflammation-induced FGF10 protein deficiency is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurely born infants characterized by arrested alveolar development. So far, experimental evidence for a direct role of FGF10 in lung disease is lacking. Using the hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury as a mouse model of BPD, the impact of Fgf10 deficiency in Fgf10+/- versus Fgf10+/+ pups was investigated. In normoxia, no lethality of Fgf10+/+ or Fgf10+/- pups was observed. By contrast, all Fgf10+/- pups died within 8 days of hyperoxic injury, with lethality starting at day 5, whereas Fgf10+/+ pups were all alive. Lungs of pups from the two genotypes were collected on postnatal day 3 following normoxia or hyperoxia exposure for further analysis. In hyperoxia, Fgf10+/- lungs exhibited increased hypoalveolarization. Analysis by FACS of the Fgf10+/- versus control lungs in normoxia revealed a decreased ratio of alveolar epithelial type II (AECII) cells over total Epcam-positive cells. In addition, gene array analysis indicated reduced AECII and increased AECI transcriptome signatures in isolated AECII cells from Fgf10+/- lungs. Such an imbalance in differentiation is also seen in hyperoxia and is associated with reduced mature surfactant protein B and C expression. Attenuation of the activity of Fgfr2b ligands postnatally in the context of hyperoxia also led to increased lethality with decreased surfactant expression. In summary, decreased Fgf10 mRNA levels lead to congenital lung defects, which are compatible with postnatal survival, but which compromise the ability of the lungs to cope with sub-lethal hyperoxic injury. Fgf10 deficiency affects quantitatively and qualitatively the formation of AECII cells. In addition, Fgfr2b ligands are also important for repair after hyperoxia exposure in neonates. Deficient AECII cells could be an additional complication for patients with BPD. Copyright © 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - There is currently much interest in understanding the mechanisms of normal and aberrant lung alveolarization, particularly in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a common complication of preterm birth where alveolarization is impeded. To this end, the parenteral administration of pharmacological agents that modulate biochemical pathways, or facilitate modulation of gene expression in transgenic animals, has facilitated the discovery and validation of mechanisms that direct lung development. Such studies include control interventions, where the solvent vehicle, perhaps containing an inactive form of the agent applied, is administered; thereby providing a well-controlled point of reference for the analysis of the partner experiment. In the present study, the impact of several widely used control interventions in developing C57Bl/6J mouse pups was examined for effects on lung structure and the lung transcriptome. Parenteral administration of scrambled microRNA inhibitors (called antagomiRs) that are used to control in vivo microRNA neutralization studies, impacted lung volume, septal thickness, and the transcriptome of developing mouse lungs; with some effects dependent upon nucleotide sequence. Repeated intraperitoneal isotonic saline injections altered lung volume, with limited impact on the transcriptome. Parenteral administration of the tamoxifen solvent Miglyol accelerated mouse pup growth, and changed the abundance of 73 mRNA transcripts in the lung. Tamoxifen applied in Miglyol-in the absence of Cre recombinase-decreased pup growth, lung volume, and lung alveolarization and changed the abundance of 298 mRNA transcripts in the lung. These data demonstrate that widely used control interventions can directly impact lung alveolarization and the lung transcriptome in studies on lung development.

AB  - Neonatal respiratory system disease is closely associated with embryonic lung development. Our group found that integrin beta4 (ITGB4) is downregulated in the airway epithelium of asthma patients. Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory illness in childhood. Therefore, we suspect whether the deletion of ITGB4 would affect fetal lung development. In this study, we characterized the role of ITGB4 deficiency in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). ITGB4 was conditionally knocked out in CCSP-rtTA, Tet-O-Cre and ITGB4f/f triple transgenic mice. Lung tissues at different developmental stages were collected for experimental detection and transcriptome sequencing. The effects of ITGB4 deficiency on lung branching morphogenesis were observed by fetal mouse lung explant culture. Deleting ITGB4 from the airway epithelial cells results in enlargement of alveolar airspaces, inhibition of branching, the abnormal structure of epithelium cells and the impairment of cilia growth during lung development. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the airway epithelial cilia of the beta4ccsp.cre group appear to be sparse, shortened and lodging. Lung-development-relevant factors such as SftpC and SOX2 significantly decreased both mRNA and protein levels. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that multiple ontogenesis-regulating-relevant pathways converge to FAK. Accordingly, ITGB4 deletion decreased phospho-FAK, phospho-GSK3beta and SOX2 levels, and the correspondingly contrary consequence was detected after treatment with GSK3beta agonist (wortmannin). Airway branching defect of beta4ccsp.cre mice lung explants was also partly recovered after wortmannin treatment. Airway epithelial-specific deletion of ITGB4 contributes to lung developmental defect, which could be achieved through the FAK/GSK3beta/SOX2 signal pathway. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.
